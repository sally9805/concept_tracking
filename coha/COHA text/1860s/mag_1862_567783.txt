ARTICLE VII. - THE CLAIMS OF THE HIGHER SEMINARIES OF LEARNING ON THE LIBERALITY OF THE WEALTHY . IT is a question which thoughtful minds contemplate not without anxiety , whether that democratic society , which is historically American-so necessarily and irresistibly American , that neither the arguments nor the contemptuous sarcasms of European aristocracy , nor the gigantic struggles of anarchic despotism among ourselves , will avail essentially to change its character for ages to come , whether this democratic society contains within itself the power of providing for the higher departments of mental culture ; for giving to the national mind all that vast range of various development , of which it is capable , and which is so necessary to the beauty , the strength , the glory , and the perfection of a nation 's civilization . It can no longer be denied , that it is better adapted than any other social state which has ever existed , to the attainment of a certain average culture , to the education of a whole people up to a certain average standard . But some thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions with no unfriendly bias , have thought they perceived a tendency to a common standard , alike to enlarge the small and dwarf the great , to exalt the lowly and to depress the most exalted , till all should meet on the dull monotonous level of mediocrity . They have expressed their fears , that the universal education which is our glory , is to be attained by the utter sacrifice of all high and various and generous culture . The mere suggestion of such a danger by a candid and enlightened observer , should lead to earnest thought and persevering endeavor to remedy any such possible defect in our political and social systems . It must be admitted , that though the higher culture has not been entirely neglected , yet what has been achieved in that direction is not altogether satisfactory ; it does not correspond // either with our universal system of popular education , or with the vastness of our population , our wealth , and our material civilization . Though in this respect we rank among the foremost nations of the world , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most gifted and enterprising minds , are far inferior to those which are enjoyed under many of the second and even the third class monarchies of Europe . Many of our young men are obliged , every year , to crbss the ocean for the purpose of enjoying advantages , which our own country does not afford them . This fact is a rather mortif*ying proof , that this part of our system of instruction greatly needs to be enlarged and improved . INo nation has more need than we , not only of all the aids by which the most gifted minds may attain to the highest and most varied culture , but of all those encouragements by which they may be stimulated in the pursuit of it . It is not only important that such facilities should exist somewhere within our national domain , but that as far as possible they should be made ubiquitous , meeting the eye , arresting the attention , and stimulating the aspirations of our youth in all parts of our extended country . We can not look with much hope to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want . Government with us is so entirely democratic in its character , that it must always be expected to reflect the opinions and wishes of the masses . And while we do not undervalue the judgment and good sense of the people , it is hardly to be expected that the million will fairly appreciate the necessity of costly provisions for that higher instruction , of which the few only are directly to enjoy the benefits . For reasons , also , to which we alluded in our remarks on denominational colleges , in a former number of this Journal , * it may be doubtful whether , as our political bodies are constituted , they are well adapted to the control and management of funds devoted to education . They are too unstable , too liable to the agitations and revolutions of political party , to be the trustworthy guardians of the peaceful // halls and tranquil walks of learning . At least if it is true that political bodies can manage institutions devoted to learning , as wisely and efficiently as corporations instituted for that very purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We must , therefore , for the most part , lay aside onr reliance on government to make the necessary provisions for the higher culture , and look to private munificence . For the support and management of such a system of education , as we can reasonably expect to render universal , we can safely rely on State treasuries and the votes of the people . No political system was ever better adapted to the end . But for that higher instruction of which few can enjoy the direct benefits , while the nation and the world enjoy them indirectly , we must fall back upon our truly American voluntary system . And let us not regret this : there is nothing American which is more truly respectable than our voluntary system : by it we have raised an army of six hundred thousand men in less than six months , and there is no reason why at this time w* should distrust it . American democracy has far more reason to glory in what it has permitted the people to do for themselves , than in what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far the greater part of all which has been achieved thus far for the higher instruction , has been accomplished through this same voluntary system ; and there is no reason why we should not implicitly rely on it , for still greater and better results in the future . But if this interest is ever provided for in a manner at all corresponding to the wants of a great nation , it must be by the liberal contributions of the wealthy . This is the thought to which we wish to invite the special attention of our readers in these remarks . It seems to us that there are considerations relating to this subject , which are of great weight , which have been too little thought of by the wealthy , in determining what disposition to make of their estates . The following are some of them . There are no valid economical objections to bestowing any reasonable amount of capital on institutions of learning . Some have thought they saw danger , that in this way too // much capital would be withdrawn from active production . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want capital for three classes of objects-buildingsbooks and other instruments of instruction  --  and endowments yielding income in the form of interest to aid in defraying annual expenses . Tn so far as capital is to be employed in the erection of buildings , the leading educators of the nation are now too enlightened , to be in much danger of making any other than a wise use of it . The time has gone by when any intelligent Board of Trust would be likely to employ it in erecting long and unsightly barracks , where young men may live isolated from the world , and for the most part even from their teachers . It is understood at last , that the buildings needed are only such edifices for the purposes of instruction , as shall combine convenience , durability , and beauty ; edifices which will cultivate the taste of the young , and attach them through life to their Alma Mater by an intenser sentiment of veneration . We think there can be little danger , that a people so calculating , so intensely money-loving and money-getting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their capital from active business , for the erection of such edifices-especially to be devoted to education-consecrated to the sacred cause of learning . It seems to us that no nobler or wiser appropriation could be made by any wealthy man of a portion of his estate , than to employ it in erecting for some one of those institutions , which by the wisdom and liberality of their management have deseKed and acquired the confidence of the community , an edifice , which should be the admiration of the present generation , and descend to posterity , as a beautiful monument of the architectural taste , the generous liberality , and the love of learning of the founder , and of the generation in which he lived . Such monuments our country stands in more urgent need og than of any increase of her business capital and her commercial facilities . Such structures , consecrated to such a purpose , have great influence in giving strength and permanency to the love of learning and the love // of country , and to all which is truly conservative of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if possible , still less ground for hesitation in respect to withdrawing capital from active business , to be appropriated to collections of books , apparatus , scientific specimens , and other instruments of instruction . It is in respect to these very things more than to anything else , that we suffer by comparison with many other nations , which are immensely inferior to us in wealth and resources . In the number and extent of our lines of railway , telegraph , and steam navigation , in the beauty and magnificence of our structures devoted to inerchandisc , and in all commercial and business facilities , we can bear a very favorable comparison with any other nation on earth . But when our libraries are inquired after , our repositories of the garnered wisdom of ages , our collections of instruments , inventions and specimens , for advancing the sciences , enlarging the sphere of human knowledge , and extending the conquest of mind over the powers and forces of matter , we are obliged to hang our heads for the most part , and put off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days of our grandchildren . For the want of such facilities thousands of our countrymen , with minds as active and vigorous as any on earth , are blindly treading the intricate and perplexing paths of invention and discovery , with infinite labor and difficulty rediscovering what has been already discovered to their hands , and trying over and over again , at enormous cost , experiments which have been already tried and failed ; and thus employing with no useful result powers which , properly directed by the . lights of experience and scientific learning , might have extended the boundaries of human knowledge , and opened new sources of human happiness . No one who has not turned his thoughts to the subject has any adequate conception of the enormous waste of mental power and activity , which in this manner we are constantly suffering . The only remedy for the evil is to be found in a vast increase among us of the resources of learning , and the instruments of thorough and accurate instruction // in the principles of science , and the progress thus far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possible appropriation of capital to the requisite amount , which would in this country be more efficiently productive of additional facilities in every department of trade and business ; none which could in its results be more truly economical . Our American mind is truly and intensely inventive , and requires only to be guided by all the lights of learning , and aided by all the facilities which the last improvements in science and useful art afford , to produce results the most creditable to us as a nation , and the most beneficial to mankind . If men of wealth will go so far ; if they will furnish to our institutions devoted to the higher instruction , buildings corresponding in architectural beauty and substantial durability , with the dignity of that great interest which they are to represent , and with the costly magnificence of our commercial architecture , and supply them with libraries and collections of the various instruments of instruction , which will place within the reach of the gifted , the curious , and the studious among us , the treasured achievements of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly noble service to the cause of learning , to their country and to mankind . And yet , as society is constituted in this country , should their liberality embrace no other objects than those which we have thus far specified , they would leave their work so incomplete , that small results comparatively could be expected from it . In a country where , as in ours , all the lower walks of instruction are rendered by public endowment as free to all as the air and the water , it is indispensable that the institutions devoted to the higher departments of learning should be endowed also . If teachers in the higher walks of learning are compensated only by fees exacted from their pupils , those charges must become so burdensome , as to exclude all except the wealthy from enjoying their instructions ; and inasmuch as it does not appear that either genius or the love of learning are to be reckoned among the good things which money will purchase , such an arrangement is obviously unwise and . Unsuited // to the ideas or the wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ours is by democratic principles , the higher instruction must not stand by itself , as a solitary cx ception to the care and fostering liberality of the public ; if it does so it will utterly perish ; it must be so provided for by liberal endowments , as not to be beyond the reach of any gifted and enterprising mind , though born and reared in and toil . If then our hioliter seminaries of learning poverty are practically to bring their benefits within the reach of the people , they must be to a very considerable extent frirnished with endowed professorships in the various branches of science , art , and liberal learning ; and any man , who appropriates a few thousands of his wealth to the fonnding of such a professorship is eminently a public benefactor . It is at this point , more than anywher* else , that we have met the objection , that such an appropriation of capital is withdrawing it from active business ; that college corporations are not able to make capital as productive as it may be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is claimed in this objection is often true ; and it may be a very good reason why , as long as one needs , and can employ his capital in active business , he should retain it in his own hands , and , for the time being , only aid the cause of learning by bestowing upon it a portion of his annual income . But many wealthy men are unable to unite their whole capital with their own industry and skill ; and in the swift course of human life , every capitalist soon reaches a point where he can only derive benefit from his capital in the form of interest . Old age comes on , chills his blood , paralyzes his energies , and blunts the once keen edge of his perceptions ; or he must pass away from earth , and leave his estate to be managed by heirs , who may be as industrious and skillful as himself , or they may be utterly destitute of both these qualities , and quite deficient in the virtue of frugality besides . When a man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be satisfied that his estate should thenceforward yield to its holder bank interest . Few rich men we suspect succeed in so disposing of their wealth as for any great length of time to produce even that , when their // own care and skill and frugality are withdrawn from it . We believe there are few appropriations , which could be made of it , in which it would be so sure to produce a fair rate of interest , even down to the distant future , as the one which we recommend . We admit that our age has produced not a few schemes for founding new seminaries , which have proved utterly chimerical , indeed were known by experienced educators to be so from their very inception ; and that they have made grievous waste of the benefactions which have been bestowed upon them by incautious liberality , can not be denied . But for such untried enterprises we are not pleading . We have in nearly every portion of our country institutions , which are fonnded on principles well settled and tested , and managed by Boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can be trnsted implicitly to manage wisely any funds which may be committed to their hands . It is in the power of men of large wealth to make a noble and efficient provision for the higher culture , by enlarging the resources of these established institutions . There is not a State east of the Mississippi , certainly not a free State , which has not more than one such , with a foundation broad and solid enongh to sustain such a superstrncture as the age demands . It is only necessary that we know what instruction is requisite and provide these institutions with the means of imparting it . Nothing need be risked in any doubtful or nntried enterprise . What more , for example , is needful in New England , than to enlarge the circle of instruction in such institutions as Cambridge , and Yale , and Williams , and Amherst , till provision has been made for all that vast variety of culture which the age requires ? And the same is true of many of the colleges , even of the Western States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their foundations have been well laid , and sufficiently tested by time and experience ; it is only requisite that such additions be made to their resources as shall enable them to furnish the needed facilities in every department of human knowledge . We have heard munch , in our day , of Industrial Universities , // Farmers ' Colleges , and the like . The use of such phrases savors a little of the demagogue : it should surely be avoided as not suited to American society . What we need is not class education , nor schools of instruction which shall recognize and provide for classes ; but instruction for all who will avail themselves of it , in every department of literature , science , and art ; and that our institutions devoted to the higher instruction be enlarged and liberalized , till they . meet this want in its largest extent . Let us recognize and practically illustrate the unity of the republic of letters , consisting indeed of many departments , but having the one aim , to cultivate , adorn , and enrich the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , to lay new foundations ; we have no need to engage in doubtful and untried experiments . No investment can be safer . We do not believe that any man can dispose of at least a portion of his fortune in any other way , in which it will fairly promise to add so much to the real wealth , prosperity , and happiness of his country , as by devoting it to the cause of learning . In determining to what purpose he will devote his wealth , a man ought to consider what wants of society are most likely to be neglected , and remain unprovided for , and to do that which there is most danger that others will neglect to do . Every good man feels it to be his duty to provide for his own household ; and there will of course be great diversity of judgmuent , as to what amount of pecuniary provision will be most conducive to the happiness of his family and dependents . These are questions which every one must decide for himself and with which we presume not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fortune not absorbed by the paramount claims of those whom nature has made dependent on him , it seems to us , that the claims of the higher seminaries of learning are vastly stronger than any other , upon the simple principle , that in this country there really is no other way in which they can be adequately provided for , except by the liberal contributions of the wealthy . Some may be disposed to think that provision for the poor is a nobler charity . But experience shows that public provisions for the relief of the poor are mischievous in // their influence . It is necessary to leave the sufferings of the poor to be relieved oniy by such aid from time to time , as necessity may demand . Any other mode of providing for them diminishes the stimulus to industry , and permanently *ggrayates the very evil it was designed to relieve . One of the noblest and most blessed charities is , to aid in sustaining and disseminating the Christian religion in the world . This Journal is not to be suspected of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can not help regarding with some degree of amazement many men of large intelligence , and high pretensions to the spirit of active philanthropy , who yet manifest no sympathy with the endeavor to impart the knowledge of Christian truth to those portions of the human race who are destitute of it . We think such men egregiously mistaken . They fail to recognize and sympathize with one of the most beautiful and noble manifestations of the spirit of Christianity , which this age has witnessed . Every man , whether rich or poor , should cooperate in this good work , and aid it by regularly contributing to it some portion of his annual income . It is by such annual contributions , from the rich according to the abundance of their incomes , and from the poor in such sums as they can spare from their scanty resources , that our system of evangelization , home and foreign , is to be sustained . And while those noble associations , by the agency of which this work is carried forward , rely on such annual contributions , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and harvest . It may be doubted , moreover , whet her a large legacy to one of these institutions , or a large donation out of the ordinary and regular course of annual income , is not about as likely to injure as to benefit the cause . The people , on learning that one of our Missionary Societies , for example , has received a large donation or legacy , will regard it as just so much less dependent on its regular income , and will feel just so much less the necessity of contributing to it to the extent of their ability . In this way there is reason to fear that a large donation , out of the ordinary course , may on the whole injnre a society more than it benefits it , by diminishing those annual streams of munificence , // which are its surest reliance for support ; just as a church has often been enfeebled , by having one rich man , whose mistaken liberality has for a time in a great measure relieved the rest of the people from the annual burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safest and most trustworthy reliance tbr the maintenance and propagation of the Christian religion in the world , is on that regular , systematic beneficence which springs from the love of Christ . It is a force as permanent and universal as the influence of the gospel on the hearts of those who embrace it , and will always be found adequate to any undertaking , which the pious zeal of the church may prompt her to engage in . But while a mind that has thought the matter through , perceives that the relation of our higher seminaries of learning to our efforts to propagate Christianity in the world , is by no means less important than that of Societies for Home and Foreign Missions , it is still not possible to place those seminaries in any such relation to the annual pecuniary contributions of Christian people . To the masses they seem more remote , more secular , and therefore having less claim to those gifts , which are prompted by self-denying love to Christ . For this reason a seminary of learning can not be sustained as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways in which they can be endowed and rendered efficient ; they must either become the beneficiaries of the state , or they must derive their needed resources from the generous liberality and the dying bequests of the wealthy . In this country the former can not be hoped for . The latter is then for the most part the only hope of the cause of learning . This should be known and seriously considered by every man to whom God has given wealth , which he is willing to spare for the good of mankind ; and especially by the man of wealth who is thinking about surrendering his stewardship , preparatory to giving in his final account . Could we stand by one 's side at such a moment , we should surely whisper in his ear , with more than ordinary earnestness ,  --  Why not confer on some institution of learning the means of serving that noble cause with greater efficiency , long // after you are dead ? If you leave a legacy to that noble missionary institution , you give it indeed to a worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that treasury , and they are as regular and as permanent as Christian faith and charity . But there neither are , nor in the nature of the case can be , any such streams supplying the needed resources to the cause of learning . Why not then exercise your liberality in a field which others are leaving almost to you alone ; where at least you can accomplish a noble work , which , unless you do it , will be very likely to remain undone perhaps for genera-tions ? We commend to the wealthy this mode of disposing of a portion of their estates , as one of the best provisions they can make for their own posterity . Under our democratic institutions , no man can constitute any lasting bond between his estate and his family . He can not hand down his wealth to his distant descendants . His heirs will acquire the same entire control over his fortune , which he himself possesses , to enjoy and to use it as they please ; and what is to become of it , will depend on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their wisdom or their folly . Two or three generations renerallv suffice so to mingle the largest fortune with the mass of the nation 's wealth , that the descendants of him who amassed it shall have no special interest in it . It is therefore only to a very small extent , that a man can provide for his descendants by transmitting to them his property by inheritance . But one 's country is an inheritance , which he hands down to his posterity with little danger that their right in it will ever be alienated . They will share it , indeed , with all the millions of their fellow-citizens . But it is none the less precious to each individual , because shared in and enjoyed by so many . And it is a matter of unspeakable importance to our posterity , down to the latest generations , whetlmer we leave to them a country in the enjoyment of every facility for mental culture , and the most powerful auxiliaries to an ever advancing civilization , or one in which mind stagnates for the want of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for // his posterity , let him liberally appropriate of the wealth which God has giYen him , to enlighten and adorn that country , which is the only inheritance which he can with any certainty transmit to the snccessive generations of his descendants . Let him beware of leaving his children with all the doubtful and dangerous advantages of great wealth , in a country but meagerly supplied with the means of mental and moral culture . We can never think that parent wise in providing for his own household , who prefers overgrown wealth for his children , rather than to add to the permanent sources of his country 's civilization , enlightenment , and strength . That country which is en*joyed in common with all our fellow citizens , is infinitely more important to the happiness of our posterity , than the ainonnt of private fortnne which we may leave to our children . We do not feel it to be improper to remark in concluding this Article , that a generous and wise liberality to the case of learning is the noblest monnment which any man can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it is accordant with the nature which God has given us , to desire the good will and loving esteem of the men of our own day and generation . It is one of the rewards which God ordinarily bestows on a life nsefully and virtuously spent , and is justly reckoned among the choicest of earthly blessings . But if it is honorable to desire the good will of the men of our own times , it is no less honorable to desire that our names should be rescued from the oblivion of the grave , and remembered and spoken with respect and affection , in coming generations and ages , by the men and women who shall behold these aspects of nature , till these fields , dwell in these houses , and worship in these sanctuaries , lono* after we shall have passed away from earth , and been numbered with the dead . The unrivaled eloquence of the great leader of American radicalism , can not invest the name of Phillips with so bright a luster , as that which it derives from the schools of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the foremost colleges of New England are adorning , by their ever growing fame , and bearing down to posterity , the names of illustrious benefactors ; and what name will be spoken with more affection by the men who in after // times shall walk amid the classic shades of New Haven elms , than that of Sheffield ? We confess , that in this country , where no man can call his lands by his own name , or if he does so , it will only be writing his name on the sand to be washed ont by the incoming wave ,  --  where the wealthy man has scarcely a better prospect of being remembered than the laborer that toils for his daily pittance of bread , and where no man can with any certainty transmit his fortune to the third generation-in such a country we confess we marvel that more men are not ambitious to transmit their names to the grateful remembrance of posterity , as the generous benefactors of the cause of learning . What thoughtful man that now walks in the classic shades of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid those foundations , does not feel , mingled with the gratitude which his heart pays to their memories , a rising ambition to share in the honors which they have won fo r themselves , by their far-reaching foresight , and their liberal provision for the mental and moral culture of coming generations ! They did well , did nobly , and richly deserved the honor in which they are held . But their work is yet only begun . It is our privilege to enlarge and complete what they so nobly conceived and attempted ; to furnish institutions of a like spirit and aims , on a scale sufficienty large , with facilities sufficiently ample to meet the wants of a greatly advanced state of civilization , not alone for New England or the coast of the Atlantic , but over our whole country , so as effectually to provide for the education of a great continental people . If , then , men of wealth wish to call their estates by their own names , and to send those names down the stream of time , buoyed above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be spoken with an honest exultation by their posterity ; let them become the generous benefactors of learning ; let them faithfully care for that higher instruction , which divine Providence has so committed to their care , that unless they provide for it , endow it with their wealth , it must almost necessarily lie neglected and waste .
