CHAPTER I. SPREADING THE STRANDS . " Shout three times three , like Ocean 's surges , Join , brothers , join , the toast with me ; Here 's to the wind of life , which urges The ship with swelling waves o'er sea ! " " Masters , I can not spin a yarn Twice laid with words of silken stuff . A fact 's a fact ; and ye may larn The rights o ' this , though wild and rough My words may loom . ' T is your consarn , Not mine , to understand . Enough  --  " It was in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and five , and in the River Garonne , where a large , wholesome merchant brig lay placidly on the broad and shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great mass of yellow-tinted buildings , towers , and churches , rose from the river 's banks , and the din and bustle of the great mart came faintly to the ear . The sails of the brig were loosed , the crew were hauling home the sheets and hoisting the top-sails with the clear , hearty songs of English sailors , while the anchor was under foot and the cable rubbing with a taut strain against the vessel 's bluff bows . At the gangway stood a large , handsome seaman , bronzed by the sun and winds of about half a century , dressed in a square-cut blue jacket and loose trowsers , talking to the pilot  --  a brown little Frenchman , in coarse serge raiment and large , clumsy sabots . The conversation between them was carried on partly by signs , for , in answer to the pilot , the other threw his stalwart arm aloft toward the folds of the spreading canvas , and nodded his head . " Fort bien ! vite donc ! mon Capitaine , " said the pilot ; " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up anchor ! " " Ay , pilot ! " replied the captain , pulling out his watch ; " in ten minutes . The ladies , you know , must have time to say ' good-by . ' Is n't it so , my pilot ? " The gallant little Frenchman smiled in acquiescence , and , taking off his glazed hat with the air of a courtier , said , " Pardieu ! certainly ; why not ? Jean Marie would lose his pilotage rather than hurry a lady . " Going aft to the raised cabin on the quarter-deck , the captain softly opened the starboard door , and looking in , said , in a kindly tone , " It is time to part , my friends ; the pilot says we are losing the strength of the tide , so we must kiss and be off . " Two lovely women were sitting , hand clasped in hand , on the sofa of the transom . You saw they were sisters of nearly the same age , and a little boy and girl tumbling about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the soft , full , rounded forms of womanhood , with the flush of health and matronly pride tinged their cheeks , while masses of dark hair banded over their smooth brows and tearful eyes told the story at a glance . They rose together as the captain spoke . " Adieu , chere Rosalie ! we shall soon meet again , let us hope , never more to part . " " Adieu , Nathalie ! adieu , dearest sister ! adieu ! adieu ! " The loving arms were twined around each other in the last embrace ; the tears fell like gentle rain , but with smiles of hope and trustfulness they parted . " Ay , " said the sturdy skipper , as he stood with eyes brimful of moisture regarding the sisters , " ay , trust me for bringing you together again . Well do I remember when you were little wee things , when I brought you to France after the earthquake in Jamaica ; just like these little rogues here "  --  and he laid his brawny hands on the heads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folds of their mothers ' dresses ; " but never fear , my darlings , " he went on , " you will meet happily again . Ay , that you shall , if old Jacob Blunt be above land or water . " A boat which was lying alongside the brig shoved off ; the little boy , who had been left on board , was held high above the rail in the arms of a sturdy negro , while the mother stood beside him , waving her handkerchief to the boat as it pulled rapidly away toward the shore . " Man the windlass , lads ! " cried the captain . " Mister Binks , brace round the head-yards , and up with the jib as soon as the anchor 's a-weigh . " The windlass clinked as the iron palls caught the strain of the cable , the anchor was wrenched from its oozy bed , the vessel 's head fell off , and , gathering way , she moved quietly down the River Garonne . CHAPTER II . CALM . " It ceased : yet still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A noise like that of a hidden brook In the leafy month of June . Till noon we quietly sailed on , Yet never a breeze did breathe ; Slowly and smoothly went the ship , Moved onward from beneath . " The great lumbering brig , with yards square , main-sail hauled up , and the jib and trysail in the brails , lay listlessly rolling on the easy swell of the water , giving a gentle send forward every minute or so , when the sluggish sails would come with a thundering slap against the masts , and the loose cordage would rattle like a drum-major 's ratan on a spree . The sea was one glassy mirror of undulations , shimmering out into full blaze as the rising sun just threw its rays along the crest of the ocean swell ; and then , dipping down into the rolling mass , the hue would change to a dark green , and , coming up again under the brig 's black counter , would swish out into a little shower of bubbles , and sparkle again joyously . Away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early haze about the mountain tops rising like a white lace veil from the deep valleys below , with here and there a white dot of a cluster of buildings gleaming out from the sombre land like the flicker of a heliotrope , and at intervals the base of the coast bursting forth in a long , heavy fringe of foam , as the lazy breakers chafed idly about the rocks of some projecting headland . Nearer , too , were the dark succession of waving blue lines in parallel bars and patches of the young land wind , tipping the backs of the rollers in a fluttering ripple of cats ' - paws , and then wandering sportively away out to sea . On board the brig , forward , were three or four barefooted sailors , in loose frocks and trowsers , moving lazily about the decks , drawing buckets of water over the side and dashing it against the bulwarks , while others were scrubbing and clearing up the vessel for the day . The caboose , too , began to show signs of life , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning air until it came within the eddying influence of the sails and top-hamper , when a bit of roll would puff it away in blue curls beyond . Abaft stood a low , squat-built sailor at the wheel , his striped Guernsey cap hanging on one of the spokes , and his body leaning , half asleep , over the barrel , which gave him a sharp twitch every now and then when the sea caught the rudder on the wrong side . Near at hand , with an arm around an after top-mast backstay , and head resting over the rail , was the mate , Mr. Binks , with a spy-glass to his eye , through which he was peering at the distant hills of Jamaica . Presently , as he was about to withdraw the brass tube , and as the old brig yawed with her head inshore , something appeared to arrest his attention ; for , changing his position , and climbing up to the break of the deck cabin , he steadied himself by the shrouds , and rubbing his eye with the sleeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass , muttering to himself the while . At last , having apparently made up his mind , he sang out to the man at the wheel in this strain : " Ben , my lad , look alive ; catch a turn with them halliards over the lee wheel ; and just take this ' ere glass and trip up to the fore-yard , and see what ye make of that fellow , here away under the eastermost headland . " Ben , without more ado , secured the spokes of the wheel , clapped his cap on his head , hitched up his trowsers , and , taking the glass from the mate , rolled away up the fore-rigging . Meanwhile Mr. Binks walked forward , stopping a moment at the caboose to take a tin pot of coffee from the cook , and then , going on to the topsail-sheet bitts , he carefully seated himself , and leisurely began to stir up the sugar in his beverage with an iron spoon , making a little cymbal music with it on the outside while he gulped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way when Ben hailed the deck from the fore-yard . " On deck there ! " " Hallo ! " ejaculated Mr. Binks . " I see that craft , " cried Ben ; " she 's a fore and after , sails down , and sweeping along the land . She has n't got a breath of wind , sir . " " Very well , " said Mr. Binks , speaking into the tin pot with a sound like a sheet-iron organ ; " come down . " As Ben wriggled himself off the fore-yard and caught hold of the futtock shrouds to swing into the standing rigging , he suddenly paused , and putting the glass again to his eye , he sang out : " I say , sir ! here is a big chap away off on the other quarter , under top-sails . There ! Perhaps ye can see him from the deck , about a handspike clear of the sun "  --  pointing with the spy-glass as he spoke in the proper direction . " All right ! " said the mate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " becalmed , ai n't he ? " " Yes , sir ; not enough air to raise a hair on my old grandmother 's wig ! " muttered Ben , as he slowly trotted down the rigging . The sun came up glowing like a ball of fire . The land wind died away long before it fluttered far off from the island , and , saving the uneasy clatter at times of the loose sails and running gear , all remained as before . It was getting on toward eight o'clock , and while the cook was dishing the breakfast mess for the crew beneath an awning forward of the quarter-deck , the captain came up from his cabin below . The stalwart old seaman stepped to the bulwarks , and , shading his eyes with his hand from the glare , he took a broad glance over the water to seaward , nodded to the mate , and said , in a cheerful voice , " Dull times , matey ! No signs of a breeze yet , eh ? " " No , captain , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been enough air to lift a feather since you went below at four o'clock . But we have sagged inshore by the current a few leagues during the night , and here 's old Jamaica plain in sight broad off the bow . " " Well , it 's not so bad after all , a forty-four days ' passage  --  so I 'll tell my Lady Bird passenger . " Going to the latticed door of the deck cabin , the jolly skipper threw it wide open , clapped his hands together thrice , and then , placing them to his mouth like a speaking-trumpet , he bellowed out , in a deep , low roar , " Heave out there , all hands ! Heave out , Lady Bird and baby ! Land ho ! " There came a joyous note from a soft womanly voice within a screen drawn across the after cabin , mingled with a little cooing grunt from a child , and presently an inner door swung back , and the sweetest little tot of a boy came tumbling out into the open space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The little fellow buried his brown curly head into the old skipper 's whiskers , and then , kicking up his fat naked legs , he laughed and chattered like a magpie . " Aha ! you young scamp , this small nose smells the oranges and cinnamon , eh ? And dear lazy mamma shuts her pretty eyes , and wo n't look for papa , and so near home , too ! " Here Madame Rosalie 's low sweet voice trilled out merrily in a slightly foreign accent , while the contralto tones vibrated on the ear like the note of a harp . " Ah ! bon capitaine , how could you deceive me ? Still , I forgive you for telling me last night that we were so far from Kingston . When you know , too , " she went on in her Creole accent , " how I love and want to see my dear husband these last four years , since you carried him away in your good big ship . But never mind , my good friend , I shall pay you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please , for Banou to dress his little boy . " Scarcely had the worthy skipper reached a bell-rope near at hand , and given it one jerk , than the cabin door opened , and in stepped a brawny black , whose bare woolly head and white teeth and eyes glittered with delight . There was that about his face which indicated intelligence , courage , devotion , and humanity  --  those indescribable marks of expression which Nature sometimes stamps in unmistakable lines on the skin , whether it be white or black . He was below the middle height , but the large head was set with a great swelling throat on the shoulders of a Titan . His loose white and red striped shirt was thrown well back over his black and broad chest ; and putting out a pair of muscular arms that seemed as massive and heavy as lignum vitae , the boy jumped from the captain to meet them ; and then sticking his little soft legs down the slack of Banou 's shirt , he ran his rosy fingers in his wool , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , as he passed his huge arms around the little fellow , and smoothed down his scanty night-dress as if it were the plumage of a bird , " oho ! little Master Henri loves his Banou , eh ? Good , he take bath . " Bearing his charge out upon the quarter-deck beneath the awning , he pulled a large tub from under a boat turned upside down over the deck cabin ; and then , while the young monkey had scrambled round to his back , and was beating a tattoo with his tiny fists on his shoulders , Banou caught up a bucket and proceeded to draw water from over the side , which he dashed into the tub . When he had nearly filled the tub he felt around with his black paws as delicately as if he was about to seize a musquito , and , clutching the kicking legs with one hand , he spun the little fellow a somersault over his head , and skinning off at the same time his diminutive frock , plunged him into the sparkling brine , singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way strong Banou catch him , First he strip and den he ' plash him ; Henri he jump and ' cream for his moder , But Banou lub him more dan his broder ! " Here the brawny nurse would souse him head over heels in the sparkling water , lift him up at every dip , rub his black nose all over him , making mock bites at the little legs and stomach ; and , finally , holding him aloft , dripping , laughing , and struggling , go on with his refrain : " What will papa say when he sees him , Picaninny boy dat is sure to please him ? Big Banou he rub and dress him , But little Henri he kick and pinch him ! " All this time the men seated forward on the deck , pegging away deep into their mess-kids , would pause occasionally , shake their great tarry fingers at the imp , and chuckle pleasantly with their mouths full of lobscouse , as if the urchin belonged to them as individual property . " What a tidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Ben , " a-furlin ' the light sails in a squall ! My eye ! would n't I like to live and see him ! " " No , no , messmates , " replied that worthy , as he crunched a biscuit and took a sip of coffee out of the pot , " that ' ere child will , some of these times , when he 's growed a bit , be a-wearing gold swabs on his shoulders , and a-givin ' his orders like a hadmiral of a fleet ! " " Quite right , my hearty ! It 'll never do for sich a knowin ' little chub to spend his days along shore a-bilin ' sugar-cane on a plantation , and a-footin ' up accounts ; for , ye mind , he was like the chip as was " ' Born at sea , and his cradle a frigate , The boatswain he nursed him true blue ; He 'll soon learn to fight , drink , and jig it , And quiz every soul of the crew ! ' " While these old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the black gave him a final souse in the tub , and then holding him up to drain , as it were , for the last time , exclaimed , while his face lighted up with pleasure , " Oho , my little massa ! what will papa say to-morrow when he sees his brave Henri ? " " Ah ! how happy he will be , Banou ! " said the lovely mother , who had just come on deck , as she kissed the mouth of the young scamp , while the black wrapped and dried his little naked body in a large towel . " Ah ! yes , my mistress , we all will be happy once more to get home to master on the plantation . " " Tell me ! tell me , good capitaine , " said she , turning in a pretty coquettish way to the skipper , " when shall we get in port ? " It was a sight to see her , in the loose white morning-gown folded in plaits about the swelling bosom , her slender waist clasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bands of her hair confined by a large gold filigree pin , and half concealed by a jaunty little French cap , with the ribbons floating about her pear-shaped ears ; and while her soft , dark hazel eyes were bent eagerly toward the solid old skipper , her round , rosy , dimpled fingers clasped a miniature locket fastened by a massive linked gold chain around her neck . Ah ! she was a sight to see and love ! " Tell me , mon cher Capitaine Blunt , how many hours or minutes will it be before I shall behold my husband ? " The good-natured skipper laughed pleasantly at the eagerness of his beautiful passenger , and opening his hands wide , he gave vent to a long , low whistle , and replied , " When the wind comes from good San Antonio , my Lady Bird  --  when the sea-breeze makes  --  then the old brig will reel off the knots ! But see ! just now not a breath to keep a tropic bird 's wings out . There , look at that fellow ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men-of-war birds , with wide-spread pointed wings , and their swallow tails cut as sharp as knife-blades , were heading seaward , and every little while falling in a rapid sidelong plunge , as if in a vacuum , and then again giving an almost imperceptible dash with their pinions as they recovered the lost space and continued on in their silent flight . " That 's a sure sign , Madame Rosalie , " continued the skipper , " that the trade wind has blown itself out , and the chances are that this hot sun will drink up the flying clouds , and leave us in a dead calm till the moon quarters to-night . What say you , Mr. Binks ? am I right ? " " Never know 'd you to be wrong , sir , " said the mate , with an honest intonation of voice , as he tried to stare the sun out of countenance in following the captain 's glance . " Helas ! " said the young mother , with a little sigh of sadness , as she stood peering over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island , standing boldly out now with the lofty blue mountains cutting the sky ten thousand feet in mid-heaven ; " so near , too ; and he is thinking and waiting for us ! " " Come , " exclaimed the skipper , heartily , " the youngster wants his breakfast ! " Illustration : " WHEN THE WIND COMES FROM GOOD SAN ANTONIO , MY LADY BIRD  --  " CHAPTER III . HIGH NOON . " No life is in the air , but in the waters Are creatures huge , and terrible , and strong ; The swordfish and the shark pursue their slaughters ; War universal reigns these depths along . The lovely purple of the noon 's bestowing Has vanished from the waters , where it flung A royal color , such as gems are throwing Tyrian or regal garniture among . " High noon ! Still the stanch old brig bowed and dipped her bluff bows into the long , easy swell of the tropics ; the round , flat counter sent the briny bubbles sparkling away in the glare of the noontide sun ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the crew sheltered themselves beneath the awnings , and dozed on peacefully . Off to seaward a few dead trade-clouds showed their white bulging cheeks along the horizon , and occasionally a fluttering blue patch of a breeze would skim furtively over the backs of the rollers ; but long before they reached the brig they had expended their force , and expired in the boundless calm . Not so , however , with the large sail that had been seen from the brig in the early morning . For , with a lofty spread of kites and a studding-sail or two , she at times caught a flirting puff of air , and when the sun had passed the zenith she had approached within half a mile or less of the brig . There was no mistaking the stranger 's character . Her taunt , trim masts , square yards , and clear , delicate black tracery of rigging , shadowed by a wide spread of snow-white canvas over the low , dark hull  --  which at every roll in the gentle undulations exposed a row of ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brass stars of her battery reflected sparks of fire from the blazing rays of the sun , showed she was a man-of-war . " She 's one of our cruisers , I think , sir , " said the mate , as he handed the spy-glass to the captain ; " but Ben here believes contrariwise , and says she is a French corvette . " " Have to try again , Mr. Binks ; for , to my mind , she 's an out-and-out Yankee sloop-of-war . Ay ! there goes his colors up to the gaff ! so up with our ensign , or else he 'll be burning some powder for us . " Even while they were speaking a flag went rapidly up in a roll to the corvette 's peak , when , shaking itself clear , it lay white and red , with a galaxy of white stars in a blue union , on the lee side of the spanker ; while at the same instant a long , thin , coach-whip of a pennant unspun itself from the main truck , and hung motionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of men , standing in groups under the shade of the sails to leeward ; and on the poop were three or four officers in uniform and straw hats . One of these last stood for some time gazing at the brig  --  one hand resting on the ratlines of the mizzen shrouds , and the other slowly swinging a trumpet backward and forward . Presently an officer with a pair of gleaming epaulets on his shoulders mounted the poop ladder , touched his hat , and waved his hand toward the brig . A moment after  --  " Brig ahoy ! " came in a sharp , clear , manly tone through the trumpet . " Sir ? " " What brig is that ? " " The ' Martha Blunt ! ' named after my dear old wife , God bless her ! and myself , Jacob Blunt , God bless me ! " added the jolly skipper , in a sotto voce chuckle to the fair passenger who stood beside him . " Where are you from , and where bound ? " came again through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have a free passport from Sir Robert Calder and Admiral Villeneuve . " There was a wave of the trumpet as the speaker finished hailing , and then touching his hat to the officer with the gold swabs , and pausing only a moment , he moved to the other side of the corvette 's poop . " It would be no more nor polite in him to tell us what his name is , after all the questions he 's axed . " " Do n't ye know , Mr. Binks , " broke in the captain , " that the dignity of a man-of-war is sich that it would n't be discreet to tell no more than that she has a cargo of cannon balls , and going on a cruise any wheres ? which ye may believe is as much valuable information as we might get out of our own calabashes without asking a question . " " You are allers right , Captain Blunt , but I did not tax my mind to think when I spoke them remarks , " said Binks , deferentially . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate gave her credit for , and a moment after the officer with the trumpet sang out , " This is the United States ship ' Scourge , ' from Port Royal , bound on a cruise ! Please report us . " And again , after a few words apparently with the officer with the epaulets , the trumpet was raised to his lips , and he asked , " Have you seen any vessels lately ? " The skipper was on the point of answering the hail , when his mate said , " Beg pardon , Captain Blunt , but Ben and me made out a fore-and-aft schooner airly this morning , with sweeps out , pulling in under the outermost headland there , " pointing with his horny finger as he spoke . " Nothing , sir , but a small schooner at daylight sweeping to windward . " " What ? " came back in a clear , quick note from the corvette . " Small fore-and-after , sir , with sails down and sweeps out , close under the land . " In a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads together , several glasses were directed toward the now dim mirage-like shadow of the island , and the next instant the sharp ring of a boatswain 's whistle was heard , followed by a gruff call of , " Away there ! Ariels , away ! " Immediately a cluster of sailors , in white frocks and trowsers and straw hats , sprang over the ship 's quarter to the davits ; and then with a chirruping , surging pipe , a boat fell rapidly to the water . The falls were cast off , the cutter hauled up to the gangway , and soon an officer stepped over the side and tripped down to the boat . The white blades of the oars stood up on end in a double line , the boat pushed off , the oars fell with a single splash , and she steered for the brig . Descending down into the gentle valley of the long swell , she would disappear for an instant , till nothing but the white hats and feather blades of the oars were visible ; and again rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her bows as she came dancing on . In a few minutes the coxswain cried , " Way enough , " and throwing up his hand with the word " Toss , " the cutter shot swiftly alongside ; the boat-hooks of the bowmen brought her up with a sudden jar , and the next moment an officer with an epaulet on his right shoulder and a sword by his side stepped over the gangway . The skipper was there to receive him , to whom he touched his cap with his fore finger ; but as his eye glanced aft he saw a lady , and he gracefully removed his cap and bowed like a gentleman to her . He was a man of about eight-and-twenty , with a fine , manly , sailor-like figure and air , and with a pair of bright , determined gray eyes in his head that a rascal would not care to look into twice . " I am the first lieutenant of the ' Scourge , ' sir , " he said , turning to the skipper , " and if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words with you . " This was said in a careless tone of command , but withal with frankness and civility . The captain led him aft toward the taffrail , but in crossing the deck the little tot of a boy followed closely in his wake , and getting hold of the officer 's sword , which trailed along by its belt-straps on the deck , he got astride of it , and seized on to the coat-skirts of the wearer . The little tug he gave caused the officer to turn round , and with a cheerful smile and manner he snatched the urchin up in his arms , kissed him on both cheeks , and as he put him down again and detached his sword for him to play with , he exclaimed , " What a glorious little reefer you 'll make one of these days ! Wo n't you ? " " Oui ! oui ! mon papa ! " said the little scamp , as he looked knowingly up in the officer 's face . " Excuse my little boy , sir , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then turning to the child with a blush spreading over her lovely face , " It is not your papa , Henri ! papa is in Kingston . " " Ah ! madame , I love children . I had once a dear little fellow like this , but both he and his sweet mother are in heaven now . God bless them ! " A flush of sadness tinged his cheeks , and he passed his hand rapidly across his eyes , as if the dream was too sad to dwell upon ; but changing his tone , and while with one hand he patted the little fellow 's head , he went on : " Madame lives in Jamaica ? " " Oh yes ; I was born there , but my parents were destroyed by an earthquake when I was quite a little child , and this good captain here carried my sister and myself to France soon after , where Monsieur  --  " here she hesitated and blushed with pleasure  --  " where I married my husband , who is a planter on the island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piron ! " said the navy man , with warmth . " Ay , madame , for as fine a fellow as ever planted sugar ! Know him ? Why , madame , it is only a week ago that a lot of us dined with him at his estate of Escondido ; you know it , madame ? in the grand piazza which looks down the gorge . But he behaved very shabbily , " said the officer , as his face lighted up gayly , " for he kept a spy-glass to his eye oftener than the wine-glass to his lips , in looking out seaward , and in talking of his wife and the little boy he had never seen . " " Oh , monsieur ! you make me so happy , " said the lovely woman , as with sparkling eyes and heaving bosom she cried , " Banou ! Banou ! this gentleman has just seen your good master . " The black , who had been standing near and guarding every movement of his little charge , who was trailing the sword about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his knees , seized his hand and drew it toward his face . " Ah ! madame , I see that kindness meets with a return as well from a dark as a fair skin , " said the officer , in a low tone , as he gently withdrew his hand from Banou 's grasp . " But , " he continued , turning toward the skipper , as the clear sound of the cruiser 's bell struck his ear , " I must not forget what I came for . " " You say , captain , that you saw a schooner at daylight , eh ? This way , if you please "  --  as he raised his cap to Madame Piron and walked over to the other side of the deck . " What was she like ? " " She was reported to me by the mate , " replied Jacob Blunt . " Please send for him . " " Oh ! Mr.  --  a '  --  " " Binks , sir , " said that individual , touching his hat and making an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Binks , did you clearly make out the vessel you saw this morning under the land ? " " Ca n't say exactly , sir , as I did ; but Ben Brown there was on the fore-yard , and he got a good squint at her . " " Ah ! can I see the man ? " The mate straightway went forward , and , after a few pokes about the lee waist , Ben was roused out from under the jolly-boat and came rolling aft . " You saw the schooner , eh ? " said the lieutenant , as if he was in the habit of asking sharp questions and getting quick answers . " Yes , sir , " said the squat seaman , as he hitched up his knife-belt , and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand , and took off his cap . " Where ? " " Here away , sir , " with a wave of his paw , " just clear of that bluff foreland where the gap opens with the Blue Mountain . " " How was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much of a bowsprit , and no sail spread . I see her first by the flash of her sweeps in the rising sun , as she was heading about sou ' - sou ' - east into the land . " " Two masts , you say ? " " Ay , sir ; but I thought as ' ow there was a jigger-like yard a-sticking out over her starn , though I was n't sartin . " " So ! " said the lieutenant , in a musing tone , and with rather a grave face and compressed lip ; " that will do ; thank you , my man . " Then placing his hand on the skipper 's shoulder , he drew him to one side , out of ear-shot , and said , " Captain Blunt , are you much acquainted in these latitudes ? " " Oh yes , sir , me and my old brig are regular traders here , from Bordeaux to Jamaica , and so home to England . " " No treasure , I presume ? " went on the officer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak of , p'raps ; just a handful of dollars and a guinea or two in the bag for a few sacks of sugar or coffee , or a pipe of rum , or sich like , on my own account . " " Well , my friend , there is probably nothing to fear , but if the breeze springs up , keep as close to the corvette as you can , and I shall ask the captain to keep a look-out for you during the night . " " By the way "  --  the officer continued in a low tone as he moved toward the gangway  --  " in case any thing should happen , you had better hoist a lantern at your peak or in the main-rigging  --  we have sharp eyes for ugly customers , and one or two of them have been particularly troublesome of late hereabouts . " Turning for a moment to bid adieu to the fair lady passenger on the quarter-deck , and recovering his sword after a playful struggle with the youngster , he buckled it around his waist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat , the oars fell with a single splash , and the cutter shot rapidly away toward the corvette . CHAPTER IV . SUNSET . " Light is amid the gloomy canvas spreading , The moon is whitening the dusky sails , From the thick bank of clouds she masters , shedding The softest influence that o'er night prevails . Pale is she , like a young queen pale with splendor , Haunted with passionate thoughts too fond , too deep ; The very glory that she wears is tender , The very eyes that watch her beauty fain would weep . " Not a breath from the lungs of Aeolus . The sun went down like a globe of fire ; but just as it touched the horizon it flattened out into an oval disk , and , sinking behind a dead , slate-colored cloud , shot up half a dozen broad rose and purple bands , expanding as they mounted heavenward , and then fading away in pearly-tinted hues in the softening twilight until it mingled in the light of the half moon nearly at the zenith . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the blue tops of the mountains marked in pure distinct outline , and falling away from peak to peak on either hand , till the sea flashed up in sluggish creamy foam at the base . The man-of-war birds came floating in from seaward , high up , like black musquitoes , with their pointed wings wide spread and heading toward the land , but now with never a quiver to their silent pinions . A school of porpoises , too , broke water from the opposite direction , and , crossing and recrossing each other 's track , came leaping and puffing over the gentle swells until they struck the brig 's wake , when they wheeled around her bows , dashed off on a swift visit to the corvette , and then , closing up in watery phalanx , went gamboling , leaping , and breaking water again to windward . Presently , along the eastern horizon , the banks of clouds , which had been lying dead and motionless all the sultry day , seemed to be imbued with life , and , separating in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon spread out , like a lady 's fan , in all directions . " Ho ! ho ! " shouted Captain Blunt , clapping his hands , " what said I , Madame Rosalie , when we saw the sun setting up his lee backstays a while ago ? A breeze , eh ? Come , Mr. Binks , be wide awake ! We shall be bowling off the knots before the watch is out . " The mate caught the enthusiasm of the skipper , and , jumping up on the break of the deck cabin , he sang out , " D'ye hear there , lads ? give us a good pull of the top-sail halliards , and round in them starboard braces a bit ! That 's your sort ! Well , the head-yards ! That 'll do with the main ! Up with the flying jib , and trim aft them starboard jib and staysail sheets ! There ! Belay all . " Meanwhile the corvette , with her lofty dimity kissing the sky , caught the first light airs before the slightest ripple darkened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her after-yards braced sharp up , she silently swung round on her heel , while the spanker came flat aft , like a sheet of white paper , and with the head-sails trimmed , she slowly moved athwart the stern of the brig . The sharp whistles of the boatswain and his mates , piping like goldfinches , were the only sounds that were heard ; and as the cruiser moved on in her course , the declining moon cast a mellow light over the folds of her canvas , and , like a girl in bridal attire , she threw a graceful shadow over the smooth and swelling waters away off to windward . The sails of the brig , which had begun to swell out in easy drooping lines , fell back again flat to the masts as the ship crossed her wake . But as the corvette passed , the officer of the watch on the poop raised his cap to the lovely woman who was standing out in graceful relief on the upper cabin deck , with her little boy held up beside her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trumpet to his lips , said , in a distinct voice , as if addressing the skipper , " We shall go about at midnight . Remember the directions I gave you this morning . Bon voyage , madame ! " He shook his trumpet playfully at the boy , who put out his chubby arms with delight to the speaker , and then hammered away with great glee on the crown of his bearer 's head . " Thank you , sir , " said Captain Blunt , who was leaning over the rail ; and then turning to his mate , he added , " Them Yankees , Mr. Binks , always treats a merchantman like gentlemen on the high seas , and I never knew one on ' em to turn their backs on friends or foes . What a pity they ever cut adrift from the Old Country ! Howsoever , matey , it ca n't be helped , and you had better up with the port studding-sails , hang out all the rags , and make the old drogher walk . " Now came the rippling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a minute or two , so as to make the top-sails of the brig swell out and then fall back in a tremulous shiver ; but again bulging forward in a full-breasted curve , the vessel felt the tug , and began to dash the spray from her bluff bows till it fell away beyond the lee cathead in flying masses of foam . The studding-sail booms rolled out , the sailors busied themselves aloft in making the additional sail , and by-and-by the old brig floundered along , the bubbles gurgling out ahead in the ruffled water , tipping over astern as the crests broke on her quarter ; at times plunging her bows into the rolling swell , but coming up sturdily again , and so on as before . Meanwhile the corvette had edged away in a parallel course with the brig , running past her at first as if she were at anchor , when she let her topgallant-sails slide down to the caps , and , with the weather clew of her main-sail triced up , she held way with the brig a mile or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the west , and the clear , well-defined crescent was occasionally obscured by the light fleecy clouds moving under the influence of the trade wind , when , toward eight bells , the moon gave one pure white glimmer , threw a rippling flood of light over the waves , and sunk below the horizon . Still the stars twinkled and the planets flamed out like young moons  --  masked at intervals by the darkening clouds as they swept overhead in heavy masses  --  and tinging the sea with shade , which would again break out in phosphorescent flashes as the waves caught the reflection . " Now , Madame Rosalie , " said the kind old skipper , " it is nearly midnight ; take your last snooze in the old barky , and wake up bright and happy for Port Royal and  --  you know who , in the morning . " The charming woman had been watching , with soul-rapt gaze , the lofty hills of Jamaica from the last blaze of the setting sun , and until the moon too had vanished and left only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captain spoke , gave a deep sigh , kissed her hand to the good old skipper , said " Bon soir , mon ami , " and with a smile she entered her cabin . The black was seated within the partition of the apartment , near a small swinging cot , urging it gently to and fro , and watching over his little charge . " Good-night , Banou , " she said , in patois French ; " you may go to bed , and I will take care of my little boy . " The black grinned so as to show his double range of white teeth beneath the rays of the cabin lamp , and without a word he moved silently away . The lady stood for a few moments gazing lovingly at the sleeping child , and then drawing the miniature from her bosom , she detached it with the chain from her neck , and after pressing it to her lips , she leaned softly over the cot and fastened it around the little sleeper . As light and zephyr-like as was the effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching out his tiny arms , while a baby smile played around the dimples of his cheeks , he clasped his mother 's neck . Ah ! fond and devoted mother ! That was the last sweet infantile caress your child was ever destined to give you ! Treasure it up in joy and sorrow , in sunshine and gloom , for long , long years will pass before you press him to your heart again ! CHAPTER V. DARKNESS . " The busy deck is hushed , no sounds are waking But the watch pacing silently and slow ; The waves against the sides incessant breaking , And rope and canvas swaying to and fro . The topmost sail , it seems like some dim pinnacle Cresting a shadowy tower amid the air ; While red and fitful gleams come from the binnacle , The only light on board to guide us  --  where ? " On went the " Martha Blunt " with no fears of danger near . The bell struck eight , the watch had been called , and the captain , taking a satisfactory look all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a slight yawn , said , " Well , Mr. Binks , I believe I 'll turn in for a few hours ; keep the brig on her course , and at daylight call me . It will be time enough then to bend the cables , for I do n't think we shall want the anchors much afore noon to-morrow . Where 's the corvette ? " " There she is , sir , away off on the port beam . She made more sail a few minutes ago , and now she appears to be edging off the wind , and steering across our forefoot . I s'pose she 's enjoying of herself , sir , and exercisin ' the crowds of chaps they has on board them craft . " " Well , good-night , matey "  --  pausing a moment , however , as the honest old skipper stepped down the companion-way , and half communing with himself , and then , with his head just above the slide , he added , " I say , Mr. Binks , there 's no need , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alight and bent on to the ensign halliards there under the taffrail , in case you want to signalize the corvette . Ah , Banou ! that you , old nigger ? Good-night ! " So Captain Blunt went slowly down below , and at the same time the black went aft , coiled himself down on the deck , and made a pillow of the brig 's ensign . Mr. Binks wriggled himself upon the weather rail , where , with a short pipe in his mouth , he kicked his heels against the bulwarks , and while the old brig plunged doggedly on , he indulged himself with a song , the air , however , being more like the growl of a bull-dog than a specimen of music : " If lubberly landsmen , to gratitude strangers , Still curse their unfortunate stars ; Why , what would they say did they try but the dangers Encounter 'd by true-hearted tars ? If life 's vessel they put ' fore the wind , or they tack her , Or whether bound here or there , Give ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , damme if Jack cares where ! " " What d'ye think of that , Ben ? " said Mr. Binks , as he finished his ditty , and sucked away on his pipe . " Why , Mr. Mate , " replied Ben , as he gave the wheel a spoke or two to windward and glanced at the binnacle , " the words is first-rate , but it seems to me your singing gear is a bit out o ' condition , and I thought you wos a prayin ' ; but the fact is , " concluded Ben , apologetically , " that whenever I hears grog and tobaker jined together , I likes to see them in my fist . " " Oh ! you would , eh ? Well , shipmate , turn and turn about is fair play ; so here , just take a pull at the pipe , and I 'll step to the cuddy for the bottle , and we 'll have a little sniffler all around ! " Saying this , Mr. Binks swung off the rail , handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few moments , he returned with a square case-bottle and a pewter mug . " Now , Ben , " said he , " this ' ere is not a practice , as you know , I often is guilty of ; but you bein ' a keerful hand and a stiddy helmsman , and port here close aboard , I 've no objections to take a toss with ye . " Then pouring out a moderate quantity of the fluid , the mate handed it to Ben , who , taking the pipe out of his mouth , and with one hand on the king-spoke of the wheel and one eye at the compass-card , threw his head back and pitched the dram down his throat . " My sarvice to ye , sir ! " said Ben , as he smacked his lips and then shut them tight together , fearful lest a breath of the precious liquid might escape ; " a little of that stuff goes a great ways . " Mr. Binks hereupon measured himself off an allowance , and touching Ben on the shoulder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , draining the cup , he tuned his pipes once more , and croaked forth in this strain : " While up the shrouds the sailor goes , Or ventures on the yard , The landsman , who no better knows , Believes his lot is hard . But Jack with smiles each danger meets ; Casts anchor , heaves the log , Trims all the sails , belays the sheets , And drink his can of grog ! " " Here comes the corvette , sir ! " broke in Ben , as he stood on tiptoe , holding on to the spokes of the wheel , and taking his eyes off the binnacle a moment to get a clear view over the rail . " Here she comes , with her starboard tacks aboard , athwart our bow , and moving like an albatross ! " The man-of-war had for an hour or more crept well to windward , and then , wearing round , she came down close upon the wind under royals , and her three jibs and spanker as flat as boards . As she whirled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' length ahead , the sharp ring of the whistles was again heard , and the moment after the head-sails fluttered and shook in the wind , the sheets and blocks rattled , and with a clear order of " Main-sail haul ! " the after-yards swung round like magic , the sails filled , and without losing headway the head-yards were swung , and she gathered way on the other tack . On she came , with the spray flying up into the weather leech of her fore-sail , the dark mazes of her rigging marked out in clear lines against her white canvas , and the watch noiselessly coiling up the ropes on her decks . As she pushed her sharp snout through the water , and grazed along the brig 's lee quarter , an officer on the poop gave a rapid and searching glance around , peered sharply along the brig 's deck , waved his trumpet to the mate , and resumed his rapid tramp to windward . In ten minutes after she had passed the brig 's wake nothing was seen of her save a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water from her white streak , and an occasional luminous flash of foam as it bounded away from her lean bows . Half an hour went by . The mate was sitting on the weather rail droning out an old sea-song to himself , and the four or five men of the watch were dozing away along the bulwarks . Presently , however , Ben , the helmsman , happened to let his eyes wander away from the compass-card for a moment , as he steadied the wheel by his legs and bit a quid from his plug of niggerhead to last him to suck for the remainder of the watch , when , glancing beneath the bulging folds of the lee clew of the main-sail , he clapped both hands again on the steering spokes , and shouted , " Mr. Mate , here 's a sail close under our lee beam ! " " Where ? " said Binks . But , before he had fairly time to run over to the other side of the vessel and take a look for himself , a quick rattle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's side , and , before you could think , a swarm of fellows started up like so many shadows above the rail . In five seconds they had jumped on the deck , Ben fell like a bullock from a blow from the butt-end of a pistol , the helm was jammed hard down , the lee braces let fly , and , as the old brig gave a lurching yaw in bringing her nose to windward , the weather leeches shivered violently in the wind , and , taking flat aback , the studding-sail booms snapped short off at the irons , and , with the sails , fell slamming and thumping below . Illustration : THE PIRATES BOARDING THE BRIG . Meanwhile the mate had barely time to spring to the companion-way and sing out , " We 're boarded by pirates , Captain Blunt ! " when he , too , received an ugly overhand lick from a cutlass on his skull , and went senseless and bleeding down the hatchway like a scuttle of coals . At the first noise , however , the black Banou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glimpse of the fellows swarming over the side , he snatched hold of the ensign halliards where the signal lantern had been bent on , and in an instant it was dancing away up to the gaff , shrouded from view to leeward of the vessel by the spread of the spanker . In another moment the black leaped to the deck cabin and darted through the door . But in less time than it has taken to tell it , the " Martha Blunt " had changed hands . There , on the quarter-deck , stood in groups some sixteen barefooted villains , in coarse striped gingham shirts , loose trowsers , and skull-caps , and all with glittering , naked knives or cutlasses , and pistols in their belts and hands . In the midst of this cluster of swarthy wretches , near the companion-way , stood a burly , square-built ruffian , with a pistol in his right hand , and his dexter paw pushing up a brown straw hat as he ran his fingers across his dripping forehead and a tangled mass of carroty , unshorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kerchief tied in a single knot around his bare bull neck ; the shirt was thrown back , and exposed a tawny , hairy chest , as a ray of light flashed up from the binnacle . He looked  --  as indeed he was  --  the lowest type of a sailor scoundrel . His companions were of lighter build , and their dress , complexion , and manner  --  to say nothing of their black hair and rings in their ears  --  indicated a birth and breeding in other and hotter climes . " Well , my lads , " said the big fellow , who seemed to be in command , " the barkey is ours , and we 've cheated that infarnal cruiser handsomely . Go forward , Pedro , and gag them lubbers , and then tell the boys to trim aft them jib sheets ; and round in them after-braces , some of you , so we can keep way with the schooner and take things easy . " Here he laughed in a husky , spirituous , low chuckle , and then went on : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christo ! there may be some ounces on board . But who 's left in the boat , Gomez ? " This was addressed to a bow-legged , beetle-browed individual , with a hare-lip , which kept his face in a perpetual and skeleton-like grin , who hissed out from between his decayed front tusks , " El Doctor Senor , con tres de nosotros . " " Bueno ! all right ; three of the chaps will do to look out for her ; but tell the doctor to drop the boat astern , and veer him a rope from the gangway . There ! that 's well with the braces ! Keep her off a point ; so  --  that 'll do . " As the orders were promptly obeyed , and the crew of the brig gagged , and the vessel surged slowly on her course , the same speaker turned to his men and said , " Now , my hearties ! let 's have an overhaul of the skipper . Hand him up here , will ye ? or , never mind , " he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growl with him myself . " As the mate pitched head foremost down the companion ladder , two of the pirates jumped after him , and , dealing him another cruel stab with a knife deep into the back , they passed on into the lower cabin . There was a brief struggle , the sound of voices mingled with curses and threats , and then all quiet again . In pursuance of his expressed purpose , the stout ruffian slewed himself round , took a sweep about the horizon , then sticking his pistol in its belt , he slowly descended the ladder , gave the wounded and dying mate a kick , and with a hoarse laugh entered the cabin . There , on a small sofa abaft , between the two stern air-ports , sat Captain Blunt . Blood was trickling down in heavy drops from a lacerated bruise on his forehead ; but , notwithstanding the swelling and pain of the wound , his features were calm , stern , and honest . On either side of him sat as villainous a brace of mongrel Portuguese or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms were pinioned by a stout cord to the bolt above the transom . " My sarvice to you , sir ! " said the leader of the gang , with a devilish smile of derision , as he stuck his arms akimbo and squirted some tobacco-juice from his filthy mouth across the cabin table at the pinioned prisoner . " I s'pose you know by this time that you 're a lawful prise , captured by an hindependent constable of the West Indies , notwithstandin ' ye had sich safe escort and convoy all the arternoon ? " Here he chuckled , squirted more juice over the table , then dropped down on a sea-chest cleated to the deck , took off his hat , and scratched his yellowish red hair . The poor captain said not a word , but shook a great clot of blood from his brow . " Well , now , my old hearty , the first thing for you to do is to poke out your manifest , and any other little matters of vallew ye may have stowed away ; and be quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sail in this ' ere craft . Howsoever , I s'pose ye can swim ? " " You 'll find the manifest and the ship 's papers there , inside that instrument-box ; and all the money in the vessel is in that locker ; and I trust in Heaven it may burn your hands to cinders , you devils ! " " Ho ! smash my brains ! keep a stopper on your jaw , or I 'll squeeze your dead carcass through that ' ere starn port . " The fellow rose as he spoke , and , stepping up to the narrow state-cabin near by , he jerked open the upper drawer of a small bureau affair , and pulling out a canvas bag , sealed at the mouth , tossed it on to the cabin table . The coin fell with the heavy dead sound peculiar to gold , and the ruffian , after taking it up again and weighing it tenderly , growled out , " This chink will do for a yapper , at any rate ! So now let 's have a peep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second time to the berth , he gave a kick to the instrument-box , the lid flew off , and diving in his fist he drew out a bundle of papers . Once more seating himself at the table beneath the swinging lamp , he clumsily undid the papers and spread them before him . " What a blessed thing is edication , " muttered he to himself , " and what a power o ' knowledge reading ' riting does for a man ! " Putting his fat stumpy finger on each line of the manuscript as he slowly began to spell out the contents , he began , " Man-i-fest of Brig ' Martha Blunt '  --  Ja-cob Blunt , master : " here he paused , and , squirting more tobacco-juice over at the skipper , as if to attract his attention , he suddenly ejaculated , " Hark ye ! Master Blunt , what was the name of that man-o ' - war vessel as was lyin ' by you this morning ? " " The ' Scourge , ' " replied the skipper , faintly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brow . " The what ? The ' Scourge ! ' That Yankee snake ! Smash my brains ! D'ye know that that ship has been a hangin ' about the north side of Cuba for ever so long , interruptin ' our trade ? And you an Englishman , to go and ax him to purtect ye ! take that ! " Here he snatched a pistol from his sash , and , taking aim full at the skipper 's breast , he pulled the trigger . Fortunately , the weapon snapped and did not explode . The ruffian held it a moment in his hand , and then letting it rest upon the table , he said , with a horrible imprecation , " Ye see you wos not born to be shot ; but we 'll try what salt water will do for ye by-and-by . " Taking out his knife at the conclusion of this speech , he picked the flint of his pistol , opened the pan , shook the priming , and then shoved the weapon back in his belt . The mention of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some trepidation , for when he resumed the perusal of the manifest it was in a hurried , agitated sort of way , and not at all at his ease . Smoothing the papers again before him , he went on , making running commentaries as he read : " Eighty-six cases of silks  --  light , and easily stowed away ; twenty-nine tons bar iron ; sixty-four sugar-kettles ! it will help to sink the brig ; forty pipes of Bordeaux ; two hundred baskets Champagne ; three hundred and fifty boxes of claret  --  sour stuff , I warrant you ; two casks Cognac brandy  --  but I say , you Blunt , " said the fellow , looking up , " where 's your own private bottle ? It 's thirsty work spellin ' out all this ' ritin ' , and my mouth 's as dry as a land-crab 's claws . Howsoever , " he continued , as he caught the glance of satisfaction which came over the swarthy faces of his companions beside the captain , " wait a bit , and we 'll punch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run through the manifest , he opened another paper and exclaimed , " Hallo ! what have we here ? List of passengers  --  Madame Rosalie Piron and  --  ho ! that 's a French piece , I knows by the name . Where is she ? Has n't died on the v'yage , has she ? D'ye hear there , ye infarnal Blunt ? " The captain 's face was troubled , and his head dropped down on his breast without replying ; but one of the scoundrels at his side struck him a brutal blow with the back of his knife-hilt on the mouth , and jerking up , he said , with an effort , " Yes , we have a female passenger on board , with a helpless child ; but I pray you , in God 's name , to leave the innocent woman in peace . You 've robbed and ruined me and my poor old wife  --  turn me adrift if you like , drown or hang me , but do n't harm the poor lady . " The tears blinded him as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his cheeks . The ruffian 's ugly face and bloodshot eyes lighted up with a devilish and sinister satisfaction as the skipper began his appeal , but before he had well finished speaking he broke in , " Avast your jaw ! will ye ? You 'll have enough to look out for your own gullet , my lad , without mindin ' any body else 's ; so turn to and say your prayers afore eight bells is struck , because there 's sharks off Jamaiky . " Then addressing his own scoundrelly myrmidons , he exclaimed , " Look out sharp for that old chap , my lads , while I goes to sarch for the woman passenger ! " As he turned , however , to leave the cabin , one of his subordinates began to rummage about in a locker , when the burly brute said , " Tonio , do n't get to drinkin ' too airly , boy , for ye know it 's agin the law till the prize is snug in harbor , or sunk , as the case may be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a nod and a grin , and he resumed his seat again ; but no sooner had their leader left the cabin than a bottle and glasses were placed upon the table , and they fell to with a will , complimenting the bound and wounded prisoner by pitching the last drops from their tumblers into his face . CHAPTER VI . DANGER . " What tale do the roaring ocean And the night wind , bleak and wild , As they beat at the crazy casement , Tell to that little child ? And why do the roaring ocean And the night wind , wild and bleak , As they beat at the heart of the mother , Drive the color from her cheek ? " In all this time so little noise had been made that even the watch below , in the brig 's forecastle , were snoozing away without a dream of danger ; though , had one of them shown his nose above the fore-peak , he would have either been knocked down and murdered like the mate , or , with a gag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader of the pirates stepped again on deck , he said to his companions , who were still clustered around the companion-way , " Well , my boys , we have ' arned a good prize  --  a fine cargo of the real stuff  --  silks , wines , and what not , besides a few of the shiners ! " Here he jingled the bag of gold and dollars in his paws , and then threw it , with an easy , indifferent toss , on to the slide of the companion-way . " But what think ye , lads ? " he continued , in a hoarse whisper , " there 's a petticoat aboard ! and , as sure as my name 's Bill Gibbs , here goes for a look ; for there 's nothing like lamplight for the lovely creeturs ! " As he slewed round on his bare feet to approach the entrance to the deck cabin , a move was made in the same direction by two or three of the wretches of his band ; but , shoving them roughly back with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , in a threatening tone , " None o ' that , my souls ! I takes the first look myself ; and if I think her beauty 'll suit the chief , why  --  I shall be able to judge , ye know , whether she 'll go furder on the cruise or swim ashore with the rest of the lubbers at daylight to Jamaiky . Keep your eye on the schooner , Pedro , and do n't make no more sail ! D'ye hear ? " " Ay , ay , si senor ! " quoth that worthy , as he and his followers fell sulkily back . It took but three strides for Mr. Bill Gibbs to reach the cabin door , when , finding it hard to open , after several trials at the knob , he placed his burly shoulder against the edge of the panelwork , and , throwing his powerful weight upon it , the door yielded with a snap of the lock , and he pitched forward full length upon the cabin floor . The noise startled the lady within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Banou ! Banou ! what is the matter ? " " Mon dieu , madame ! we are prisoners in the hands of pirates ! " Before more words were uttered , Mr. Bill Gibbs , who by this time had regained his feet while giving vent to a volley of blasphemous curses , roared out as he beheld the black , " Ho ! nigger passengers , hay ? A mounseer of color , as I 'm a Christian ! I say , cucumber shins , is that ' ere woman as is talkin ' as black as you be ? " He was not left long in doubt concerning the color of the person he alluded to , for at the instant the stateroom door flew open , and the lovely woman , in her loose night-dress and hair streaming in brown , heavy silken tresses over her fair neck and shoulders , with a pale and terror-stricken face , stood before him . Speechless with agony , she gazed at the coarse ruffian , who had , at the moment , reached the swinging cot which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the act of looking at the sleeping child , the mother uttered a fearful cry and the boy awoke . " Sarvice , madam ! do n't be scared ! come and take the little chap ! I ai n't goin ' to hurt him  --  that is , if it be a him . " The frightened mother , spell-bound at first , needed no second bidding , and , forgetful of her disheveled dress , sprang forward , and with outstretched arms , bare to the shoulder , was about to snatch her child . The pirate , however , with his red eyes gleaming with unholy fire , threw his great arm around the lovely woman 's waist , and with a hoarse , fiendish chuckle of triumph , attempted to draw her toward him . But , quick as lightning , two black , sinewy paws clutched him with such a steel-like grip about the throat that his sacrilegious arm dropped by his side , and he was hurled violently back against the cabin bulkhead . Then standing before him , the negro glared like an angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his mistress . " Ho ! " sputtered the ruffian , as he pulled a pistol from his belt , " ho ! you mean fight , do ye ? " " Banou ! mon pauvre Banou ! " screamed the terrified woman . " Yield ! Oh , sir , spare him ! Do n't harm us , and we will give you all we possess ! " The burly scoundrel hesitated a moment , and balanced the cocked pistol in his hand , as if undecided whether to blow the black 's brains out on the spot where he stood ; and then shoving the weapon back in his sash , and keeping a wary eye on his assailant , he exclaimed in an angry tone , " Well , come here , then , my deary , and give us a kiss for this nigger 's bad manners . " Moving forward as he spoke , he caught up the little boy from the cot , tore the gold chain and locket from his neck , which he thrust into his pocket , and shook him roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enticing the tender mother within his merciless grasp . But again the black interposed his heavy frame before his mistress . " What ! at it again , are ye ? Well , then "  --  fumbling with his left hand for his pistol  --  " say your prayers , ye imp of darkness . " The black seemed , however , in no mood for praying ; and putting forth his slabs of arms like the paws of an alligator , he tried to grapple his foe by the throat . The cries of the mother now mingled with those of the child as he put out his little arms to shield his black protector . The ruffian , foiled in his purpose , with baffled rage evaded the negro by stepping to one side ; and as he did so , he hurled the helpless child with great force from him . The large cabin windows at the stern were open to let in the breeze ; and as the brig sank slowly down with her counter to the following waves , and gurgled up as the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaintive cry of the little boy arose above the seething waters  --  a light splash followed  --  and the mother had lost her child ! " Oh , monster ! " cried the heart-broken woman . " Oh , my boy ! my boy ! May Heaven curse you forever ! " as she sank down senseless on the deck . The awful howl of vengeance which burst from the deep lungs of Banou came simultaneously with the report of the pirate 's pistol , the bullet from which struck the black hard in the left shoulder ; but putting out for the third time his sinewy arms , and this time with an iron grip that only left the ruffian time to yell with a stifled curse for help , he was hurled headlong , smashing through the latticed cabin door , and fell stunned upon the outer deck . In an instant half a dozen pistol balls whistled around the negro 's head , and the knives of the pirates flashed from their sashes as they rushed forward to bury the blades in his body ; but leaping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into him , he seized an iron-shod pump brake from the bulwarks , and , with a mighty bound , whirled it once with the rapidity of thought high above his head , and brought it down on the leg of his prostrate foe . Such was the force of the blow that it smashed both bones , and drove the white splinters through the brute 's trowsers , where they gleamed out red and bloody by the light of the binnacle lamp . Even then , wounded , and the blood flowing from several places , and though almost encircled in the grasp of the scoundrels , Banou made good his retreat to the cabin , and planted his powerful body firmly against the door . With a volley of polyglot curses and yells in all languages , two or three of the pirates stopped to raise their fallen leader , while the others , leaving the wheel and vessel to herself , rushed in pursuit of the black . Scarcely , however , had they made a step , when their ears were saluted by a stunning crash from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a round shot as it flew just above their heads between the brig 's masts . There , within half a cable 's length to windward , loomed up the dark hull of a large ship . The crew were evidently at quarters , with the battle lanterns lit and gleaming in the ports , while the rays shot up the black rigging and top-hamper , and spread out over the sails in fitful flashes as she slowly forged abreast the brig , with her main top-sail to the mast . For a minute not a sound was heard , though the decks were full of men , some with their heads poked out of the open ports beside the guns , or swarming along over the lee hammock-nettings and about the quarter boats ; but the next instant there came in a voice of thunder through the trumpet , " What 's the matter on board that brig ? " There was no answer for a few seconds , until a choking voice , as if with a pump-bolt athwart the speaker 's mouth , mumbled out , " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow cut short these words ; and though the reply to the hail could hardly have been heard on board the ship , yet , as if divining the true state of the case , loud , clear orders were given  --  " Away , there , third and fourth cutters ! away ! Spring , men ! " Then came the surging noise of the whistles as the falls dropped the boats from the davits ; then the men , leaping down into cutters  --  silently and quick  --  no sound save the clash of a cutlass or the rattle of an oar-blade as they took their places and shoved off . Again an order through the trumpet  --  " Clear away the starboard battery ! Load with grape ! Sail trimmers ! stations for wearing ship ! Hard up the helm ! Fill away the main-yard ! " The " Scourge " had by this time forged ahead of the brig , her sails aback or shivering , as she came up and fell off from the wind , and the boats dancing with full crews toward her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwelcome stranger been made known on board the brig than the pirates seemed seized with a panic , and , without a second thought , they scudded to leeward , where their boat had been hauled alongside , and forgetful or indifferent for the fate of their companions below , though dragging the while their maimed comrade to the rail , they lowered him into the boat , jumped in themselves , and pulled away with all their strength toward the schooner near . They were not , however , a moment too soon ; for as the last of the band disappeared , their places were supplied by a crowd of nimble sailors to windward , headed by an officer with his sword between his teeth as he swung over the bulwarks . The first sound which greeted the new-comers was from below , and from the throat of the honest skipper . Down the open companion-way leaped the officer , with half a dozen stout , eager sailors at his heels , and dashed right into the lower cabin . There was the brave old skipper , with but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well-nigh exhausted  --  from the knives of the drunken brace of rascals who had been left to guard him . A pistol in the hands of one of this pair was pointed with an unsteady aim at the officer as he entered , but the ball struck the empty rum-bottle on the table and flew wide of its mark ; and before the smoke of the powder had cleared away , a sword and cutlass had passed through and through both their bodies , and they fell dead upon the cabin floor . While Captain Blunt found breath to give a rapid explanation of the trouble , and while the brig was once more got under control and the wounded cared for , we will take a look at the man-of-war and the part she bore in the business . At the first sound of the warning gun from the cruiser the schooner began to show life ; and drawing her head sheets , she wore short round on her heel , with every thing ready to run up her fore and aft sails , and a stay-tackle likewise rove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat and hoist it in the moment it came alongside . Meanwhile the " Scourge " had shot ahead of the brig , and wearing round her forefoot , with her starboard tacks on board , she emerged out beyond , like a hound just slipped from the leash . As she cleared the brig , the schooner lay with bare masts about three cables ' length to windward , and the rattle of oars told that her boat had just scraped alongside . At that moment a clear , determined voice shouted through the trumpet , " Level your guns ! Take good aim ! Fire ! " A brilliant series of sheets of flame burst forth from the corvette 's battery , lighting up the water and jet black wales , and away aloft to the great towering maze of rigging and sails to the trucks , with the topmen clustering to windward , and their very eyes and teeth lit up in the glare ; then , too , the crews of the guns , in their trim frocks and trowsers ; the marines on the top-gallant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abaft a knot of officers on the poop , with night-glasses to their eyes , all standing out as clear as day in the sudden flashes from the cannon . Then followed the concussive roar , and the next instant you could hear the hurtling rush of the iron hail as it flew singly or in bunches through the air , or skipped in its deadly flight from wave to wave , until it went crashing into the pirate 's boat , slapping with heavy thumps against the schooner 's side , or furrowing along her decks ; while a shower of white splinters flew high over her low rail , and told how well the iron had done its bidding . Then , with many a groan and imprecation , the shattered and sinking boat was cut adrift , and , a moment after , the sails of the vessel were spread , the sheets hauled flat aft , and , taking the breeze , she heeled over till her lee rail was all awash , and away she walked , right up to windward . But again came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the jumping of the crew and ramming home the charges in the guns : " Load ! round shot ! Run out ! One point abaft the beam ! Fire as you bring the schooner to bear ! " Out belched the red flames ; the heavy globes of iron , like so many black peas in daylight , sung their deadly note as they darted on their way , and the corvette gave a little heel to leeward as the shock of the explosion was felt . One shot dropped within fifty yards of the low hull of the schooner , bounded just clear of her after-deck , knocked off the head and shoulder of a man at the tiller , and then went skipping away over the water like a black foot-ball . Another messenger cut off the schooner 's delicate fore-top-mast as clean as a bit of glass , bringing down the gaff-top-sail , and , what was equally pleasant , the fellow who was setting it  --  pitching him over and over like a wheel , until he fell , a bruised and lifeless lump of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before , however , they were treated to another of these metallic doses , the pirates had got their craft in splendid trim ; and with every stitch of her canvas spread , and tugging and straining , she rushed on with the heels of a race-horse , within three points of the wind . The " Scourge , " too , was now close hauled , her yards braced as fine as needles , and crowded with every inch of sail that would draw ; while every ten minutes or so she would let slip two or more guns from a division at the chase . But the uncertain gloom of starlight , and the darkening effect of the passing trade-clouds , made the little vessel a very difficult object to see ; and though one of the last balls struck her on the narrow deck , passed through that and the waterways , and out to windward , spoiling two of her timbers , and no end of planking , yet this was the last damage she received . Her crew , also , had got as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound and wounded  --  and were lying quietly as possible deep down in the vessel 's run . When daylight broke the breeze began to slacken , but she was by this time hull down from the corvette , a long way beyond the reach of her long eighteens in the bow ports , and eating her way to windward , with no chance of being taken . Illustration : THE NIGHT CHASE . " It 's no use , " said the captain of the corvette to his first lieutenant , as they stood watching the receding chase . " We may as well give it up ; she has the heels of us in this light wind , and will soon be out of sight . I think , however , " continued the captain , with a smile , " that he 'll remember the ' Scourge ' when he meets her again . This is the second time we have chased that fellow ; and this heat , by the way the splinters flew , we must have peppered the skin off his back . " Shutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand , he took hold of the man-ropes of the poop ladder , and as he put his feet on the steps , he said , " You can go about , Mr. Cleveland , and run down to the brig . " CHAPTER VII . THE MEETING AND MOURNING . " Moan ! moan , ye dying gales ! The saddest of your tales Is not so sad as life ! Nor have you e'er began A theme so wild as man , Or with such sorrow rife . " Then , when the gale is sighing , And when the leaves are dying , And when the song is o'er , Oh ! let us think of those Whose lives are lost in woes  --  Whose cup of grief runs o'er ! " The afternoon following the night when the foregoing events transpired , the " Martha Blunt " sailed slowly along the sandy tongue of land which separates Port Royal from Kingston , and dropped anchor in the harbor . As the cable rumbled out with a grating sound through the hawse-hole , and the crew aloft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulled by a dozen blacks shaded by a striped awning , shot swiftly alongside . Jabbering were those darkies , and clapping their hands , and shouting joyously . A rope was immediately thrown from the gangway of the brig , and a tall , handsome man , with a broad Panama hat , loose white jacket and trowsers , sprang with a bound up the side , and leaped on deck . Captain Blunt stood there to receive him . A broad white bandage was passed around his head , and the tears trickled slowly down his bronzed and honest cheeks . Just beyond him , under the shade of the awning , lay Banou , stretched out at full length on a mattress ; while Ben , the helmsman , was kneeling beside him , fanning his hot and fevered face with his tarpaulin . A yard or two beyond , on a broad plank resting on trestles , lay the mate , Mr. Binks , cold and rigid in the grasp of death , with the union jack folded modestly over his corpse . The black breathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gentleman as he stepped on deck , a deathly blue pallor came over his countenance , and , closing his eyes , the hot salt tears started in great drops from the lids . " My God ! captain , " said the gentleman , with a bewildering stare , " what 's all this ? What has happened ? " The old skipper merely made a motion with his hand toward the cabin , and , leaning painfully against the rail , wept like a child . The gentleman 's blood forsook his cheeks , and , with his knees knocking together , he staggered like a drunken man toward the cabin door . A few minutes later he emerged , bearing in his arms the sobbing , drooping form of his wife . Starting from his close embrace for a moment as he bore her to the gangway , she gave one shuddering , terrified , searching gaze over the blue water to seaward , and then , with a wailing cry of agony , that would have shaken the hardest heart , she fell sobbing again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrieks of the negroes in the barge alongside subsided into low moaning groans ; four or five came up , and carefully lowered Banou down ; then all got into the boat , and she moved mournfully away toward the shore . CHAPTER VIII . CAPTAIN BRAND AT HOME . " From his brimstone bed at break of day , A-walking the Devil is gone , To visit his snug little farm the Earth , And see how his stock goes on . " Upon a broad , flat , rocky ledge , near a small , landlocked narrow inlet of one of the clustering Twelve League Keys on the south side of Cuba , stood a red-tiled stone building , with a spacious veranda in front , covered by plaited matting and canvas curtains triced up all around . The back and one side of the building rested against a craggy eminence which overlooked the sea on both sides of the island , and commanded a wide sweep of reef and blue water beyond . A few clumps of cocoa-nut-trees and dwarf palms , with bare gaunt stems and tufted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slopes , while lesser vegetation of cactus and mangrove bushes were scattered thickly over the island , cropping out with jagged edges of rock down to the sandy beaches of the sea-shore . A deep narrow inlet of blue water lay pure and still near the base of the rocky height , where , too , was a shelving curve of white sand , sprinkled about by a few mat sheds , while on the other side the rocks arose to an elevation of a hundred and fifty feet , forming a precipitous wall to the water . The inlet here took a sharp turn , scooped out in a secluded basin , and then narrowing to less than forty yards in width , it wound and twisted for a good mile in a thin blue channel to the open sea . Half that distance farther out was a roaring ledge of white breakers , where the long swell came hammering on it , bursting up in the air in brightish green masses , and then tumbling over the reef and bubbling smoothly on toward the shore . On a level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ledge ; but , looking down from the heights around the inlet , a narrow blue gateway was marked out , skirted on the surface by frothy crests of dead foam , and near where flocks of cormorants and gulls were riding placidly on the inner side of the ledge . The island itself was about two miles broad and seven long ; and about midway of its width the inlet formed a forked strait , one branch finding its way to the north , between a low succession of sandy hummocks , where the water was too shallow to float a duck , and the other finding an outlet , scarcely a biscuit-toss wide , between two bluff rocks . With the trade wind this passage was safe and accessible ; but on the change of the moon , with a breeze and swell from the south , the sea came bowling in , in boiling eddies and whirlpools , and it required a nerve of iron to attempt an entrance . Just within this narrow mouth , on a flat beveled ledge of rock but a few feet above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen-pounders , and two twenty-four pounder carronades mounted on slides and trucks , with platforms laid on a bed of sand . Near by , beneath a low shed of tiles and loose stones , were a pile of round shot , nicely blacked , and some stands of grape and canister in canvas bags and cases , together with a large copper magazine of cartridges . Seated a little way off on a low stool was a dingy Spaniard with a telescope laid across his knees , which every little while he would raise to his eye and take a steady glance around the horizon to seaward . At other times he would roll and light a paper cigar , murmuring some low ditty to himself as he sent the smoke in volumes through his nose . A small brass bell hung beside the shed near the battery , together with a telegraphic card , which was connected by a wire strung on low posts , or hooked from rock to rock to the stone building away up at the basin . To return , however , to the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet from the ground , which was loopholed for musketry , and with but one narrow slip of a doorway that fell like a portcullis , banded and strapped with bars and studs of wrought iron . Within this stone inclosure was a large and roomy vault , half filled with cases , barrels , and packages , and at the upper angle was a narrow subterranean vaulted passage , barred also by an iron-bound door , which led to a succession of whitewashed chambers  --  dark , damp , and gloomy  --  and then on , in a fissure-like pathway , to another equally strongly secured outlet on the other side of the crag . Leading to the veranda was a tautly-stretched rope ladder lashed to eye-bolts let into the natural rock below , and hooked on to the edge of the floor above . This was the only approach to the main floor of the building from the outside , though within were heavy trap-doors like the hatches of a ship , which communicated to the chambers beneath . The whole structure was of stone and tiles , roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resisting any assault , unaided by cannon , that could be brought against it . The floor was divided into four rooms , the smallest used for a kitchen , the next for a magazine of small arms , and the third a spacious bedchamber , which opened into a large square apartment facing the veranda , and which deserves more notice . Illustration : THE PIRATE DEN . The lofty ceiling came down with the slant , showing the bare red tiles and heavy square beams which supported the roof . In one of the stoutest of these beams was an eye-bolt and copper-strapped block , through which was rove a long green silk rope , with one end secured by a cleat on the wall , and the other dangling loose , and squirming , whenever a current of air struck it , like a long , slim snake . Around the sides of the room , which were paneled with cedar , stood four or five quaint ebony armoires , and as many cabinets , clocks , and bookcases , with here and there a woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver . The walls were hung with a great number of pictures of all kinds of vessels  --  generally , however , of the merchant description  --  under full sail , with vivid light-houses in the distance , and combing breakers under the lee ; and all portraying gallant crews and buoyant freights , which probably had never reached their destinations . Among this gallery of marine display was a broad framing of the " Flags of All Nations ; " and codes of signals , too , in bright colors , hung beside them . Farther on , in a pretty panel by itself , surrounded by an edging of mother-o ' - pearl , was a triple row of female miniatures , a number of them of great beauty , and many executed in excellent taste and art . In one corner was a large chart-stand , covered with rolls of maps and nautical instruments , while above were suspended , by white rope grummets , a pyramidal line of spy-glasses and telescopes of all sizes and make . Near the centre of the apartment stood a large round dining-table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a box of cigars , and a small silver pan of live coals . There were but two windows to this room , both hung with striped muslin curtains , the casements going to the floor , and looking out upon the veranda ; and but two doors , one leading to the kitchen , and the other to the sleeping-chamber on the opposite side . Presently this last door opened , and , pushing aside a blue gauze curtain which hung before it , an individual of about eight-and-twenty years of age stepped languidly into the room . He was a tallish man , over six feet in stature , rather spare in build , but with great breadth of shoulders , and though pale , apparently from long illness , yet he was evidently very active and muscular when his nerves were called into action . Had it not been for a downward choleric curve to his large nose , and a little parting at the corners of his wide mouth and compressed lips , the face might have been thought handsome . The eyes were light blue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ray of mercy or humanity in them . He wore no beard , and his light brown hair was thin and dry , and carefully parted at the side . He was dressed in a snow-white pair of loose drilling trowsers , cut sailor fashion , straw slippers , and silk stockings ; and above he wore a brown linen jacket with large pearl buttons , and pockets . As he entered the room he held a delicate cambric handkerchief , with a fine lace border , in his hands , which he seemed to regard with curious interest as he lounged toward the windows of the veranda . " I wish I could remember , " he muttered musingly to himself , " which of those sisters this bit of cambric belonged to , marked with an E.  --  Ellen or Eliza  --  hum ! They would die  --  silly things !  --  tried to stab me ! Ho ! what fun ! Never left me even a miniature , either , for my collection . ' Bueno ! ' There 's more fish in the sea  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpleasant elevation of his eyebrows . By this time he had approached the open window , and , shoving the delicate fabric daintily in his pocket , he gave a slight yawn and looked out . Before him lay the deep blue basin of the inlet , with a couple of boats hauled up on the shore ; a few idle sailors moving about , or squatted beneath the sheds playing cards or sewing . Without letting his eye rest more than a moment on this scene , he turned and gave a long , earnest gaze between an opening of the rocks to seaward . Then , with an angry frown , he approached the table , poured out a cup of black coffee , threw rather than dropped in a lump of sugar , and sat himself down for his morning 's meal . He had scarcely , however , gulped down his cup of coffee and choked after it a slice of toast , than he pushed away the breakfast things , snapped his teeth together like a steel clasp , biting a tooth-pick in twain by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dashed his hand into the cigar-box , extracted one , touched it to the pan of coals , and began to smoke savagely . At first the grateful smoke appeared to soothe his chafed spirit , for he threw himself lazily into a large cane-bottomed settee , and , stretching out his legs , seemed to enjoy the tranquil scene around him with uninterrupted pleasure . But soon a scowl darkened his face ; he dropped his cigar on the floor , and springing to his feet as if touched by a galvanic battery , he snatched down a telescope from the wall , steadied it at the window-sash , and peered again long and anxiously to windward . He saw nothing , however , save the long , glassy , unbroken undulations of a calm tropical sea , rolling away off beyond the ledge under a burning sun ; no sign of a breeze  --  not even a cat's-paw ; and only now and then the leap of a deep-sea fish sparkling for a moment in the air , and some sluggish gulls and pelicans sailing and diving about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a crash that made the joints ring , he strode to the settee , where hung several knotted bell-ropes , and , seizing one , gave it a sharp jerk . Then putting his ear to an aperture in the wall , where was a hollow cane tube like the mouth of a speaking-trumpet , he listened attentively till a hoarse whisper uttered the word , " Senor . " Putting his mouth to the tube , he said , " Can you make out the ' Centipede ' from the crag station ? " " Not sure , sir , this morning ; but last evening , at sunset , I saw a sail which I took to be her . The sea-breeze is just beginning to make , and if she 's to windward of Punta Arenas she 'll soon heave in sight . " This colloquy was held in Spanish ; and when the signal-man had ceased speaking , the interlocutor lit another cigar mechanically , kicked a foot-stool out of his way like a foot-ball , and thus communed with himself as he rapidly paced between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday since the schooner was off Matanzas ; not a word of news to cheer me through all that cursed fever ; the spring trade done , and the track deserted by this time ! " Then pausing in his walk , he stopped at the chart-stand , and unrolling a map , he went on : " Where , in the devil 's name , could she possibly have gone to ? She might have been to Cape Horn and back before this . Miserable fool that I was to trust the craft with that thirsty , thick-headed Gibbs ! Diavolo ! he may have been captured , and if he has , I hope his neck has been stretched like a shred of jerked beef . " Even while he was talking a bell struck near the settee , and , putting his ear again to the tube , the hoarse voice said , " I can make her out now , senor . She 's just caught the strong young breeze , and is , hull up , coming along with the bonnet off her fore-sail and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windward of her , which I take to be the ' Panchita ! ' " " Ah ha ! " laughed the individual in the room . " The ' Centipede ' is safe , then ; and I am to have the pleasure , too , of a visit from the Tuerto , the mercenary old owl , with his account of sales and his greed . But let me once catch him foul , and , my one-eyed friend , I 'll treat you to such a dance that you wo n't need shoes ! " Here he glanced with a meaning look at the silk rope swaying from the beam above his head , and the laugh of satisfaction which followed was not one a timid man would care to hear in a dark night ; nor did it come from his heart , as any one might have discovered from the ferocious gleam of inward passion which shot out in the cold sparkle of his eyes and flitted away over his grating teeth . Controlling his feelings , however , and stepping out on the veranda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in the huts , " One of you fellows , tell the boatswain I want him . " The men started up , and a moment after a man in a blue jacket stood out from one of the sheds and threw up his hand to his straw hat . Illustration : THE " PANCHITA " " Get together the people ! Let run the cable at the Alligator 's mouth , and have three or four warps ready for the schooner when she passes the point ! The ' Panchita ' is coming too , so look out , and have enough lines to tow both vessels in case the breeze fails . Tell Mr. Gibbs to moor close under the other shore in the old berth , and to come to me when he 's anchored ! D'ye hear ? " All this was said in a sharp tone of command , and by the alacrity with which the orders were executed the men seemed to be accustomed to a master who knew how to rule them . CHAPTER IX . CAPTAIN AND MATE . " So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinded him in his bags ; ' T was a weary job to heave him up , For a doomed man always lags ; But by ten of the clock he was off his legs In the wind , and airing his rags ! " A couple of hours had passed since the occupant of the stone building had last spoken to his subordinates down at the inlet , but the interval he devoted to a minute inspection of weapons in the armory adjoining his bedroom . They were all in excellent order , of the best make , and very neatly arranged in stands and cases around the room . When he emerged again , after locking the door , he held an exquisite pair of small pistols inlaid with gold in his hand , which he gently polished with his cambric handkerchief , and then slipped them into his trowsers pockets . Then he held short dialogues with the voice at the signal-station , and , without looking out of the window , he informed himself of what was doing outside , and what progress the vessels made toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her slim , low black bows , with her sails down , around the point , he gave one stealthy peep , or glare rather , at her . He took all in at that glance , from the patches of sheet-lead nailed over the shot-holes in her side , to the sawed-off stump of the fore-top-mast ; and then he remarked the absence of the boat which was carried amidships , and the few men moving about her deck . Ay ! he took it all in with that one comprehensive glance , and when he had done , he raised his fore finger quivering with anger , and slowly and unconsciously passed it with an ominous gesture across his throat . Soon was heard a sullen plunge as an anchor was let go , and the splashing of the warps upon the water as the stern of the " Centipede " was being moored to the rocks , to make room for her companion the felucca , now shortly expected . " Mr. Gibbs is coming on shore , senor , and he seems to have a wooden leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coming with him , and there is a little boy in the boat . " " Ho ! " muttered the man in the saloon , " where was that brat picked up ? " Nothing more was said . The tall man lit a cigar , threw himself into an easy attitude on the settee , opened a richly-bound volume , and waited . Ten minutes may have gone by when the trampling of feet was heard on the smooth rocks outside the building , and the voice of Mr. Gibbs exclaimed , " Easy , will ye ? Doctor ! Do n't ye see it tears the narves out of me to hobble with this broomstick-handle of a leg ! There ! Stop a bit ! How in thunder am I to climb this ladder ? Oh ! " Here a low howl of pain . " Another shove . Easy , old Sawbones ! So  --  give us another push , will ye ? All right ! There , that 'll do . " The next minute Mr. Bill Gibbs stood on the broad piazza , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the entrance of the apartment , and only pausing to recover his wind and compose his features , he pulled off his straw hat and entered . " So ho ! Mr. Gibbs , " said the man on the settee , as the burly , lame ruffian darkened the entrance , laying the book down as he spoke , and waving his delicate handkerchief before him . " So ho ! Mr. Gibbs , you 've come back at last ! Delighted to see you . I am , ' pon my soul . Ah ! one of those stout pins gone ? Why , how 's this ? Some little accident ? Santa Cruz rum and a tumble down the hatchway , perhaps , eh ? D'ye smoke ? Take a cheroot . Put that bag on the table . " All this was said in a gay , gibing tone , with an indifference and sang froid that a tight-rope dancer might have been proud of ; and as he ended , he threw a handful of cigars across the table , and pushed the pan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had time to utter a word in reply , his companion , while lolling over the settee , caught up an opera-glass from the table , and , placing it to his eyes , went on : " Ha ! ho ! the fore-top-mast of my pretty long-legged schooner is gone . Pretty stick it was ! I suppose , Master Gibbs , that you "  --  he nodded fiercely without removing the glass  --  " cut it up for that lovely new leg you 've mounted . Ay , my beauty ! " again apostrophizing the vessel , which lay like a wounded bird in the calm inlet before him ; " but where 's my handsome barge , that used to cover the long gun ? Ho ! stormy weather you 've seen of late . " During all this one-sided conversation Gibbs had managed to wriggle his mutilated body on to a wicker chair , where he steadied himself with his crutch , evincing manifest signs of choler the while by running his fat fingers through the reddish door-mat of hair , hitching up his trowsers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , until at last , unable , apparently , longer to control himself , he burst out , with his bad face suffused with passion , " I say , Captain Brand , it 's time to end them ' ere gibes . What 's took place is unfortinate ; but , howsoever , I has a bag of shiners and a wooden leg to show for it , and d  --   --  n the odds . " " Stop , stop , my bull-dog ! Do n't be profane in my presence , if you please . We are both Christians , you know , and friends too , I hope . " This was said in a very precise , emphatic , and clear enunciation , and without apparent heat ; and Captain Brand smiled too  --  but such a smile , as his wide mouth came down with a twitch at the corners , and left a sort of hole , where the cigar was habitually stuck , to see his teeth through . " And now , my friend , suppose you give me some little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can , any chinks that I have n't seen through already , " he concluded , throwing his legs again over the back of the settee , and elevating his eyebrows as the cigar smoke curled in spiral wreaths around his face . Mr. Gibbs hereupon settled himself more at ease in his chair , laid his crutch across his knees , and began : " I s'pose , sir , you got the news I sent in a letter from Matanzas , after we 'd been chased out of the Nicholas Channel by that Yankee corvette ? " Captain Brand nodded at the eye-bolt which held the green silk rope from the ceiling , as if calculating mentally the strain it would bear , merely as a matter of philosophical speculation , perhaps . " Well , after that  --  and a very tight race it was  --  we ran down to the Behamey Banks . There we picked up a Yankee schooner loaded with shingles and lumber ; and as the skipper was sarsy , I just made him and his crew walk one of his own planks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel , after taking out some water which we stood in need of . You has n't a drop of summut to drink , has you , Captain Brand ? becase it makes my jaw-tackle dry to talk much . " The captain merely motioned with a wave of his cambric handkerchief to an open liquor-case which stood on a cabinet near , and to which Mr. Gibbs hobbled ; when , seizing a square flask of crystal incased in a network of frosted silver , he returned with it to the table . Had Mr. Gibbs chosen he might have brought with the flask a small , thimble-shaped liqueur glass ; but he did not , and contented himself with a china coffee-cup which stood on the tray before him . He seemed a little near-sighted too ; and as he inverted the flask , gave no heed to the quantity of fluid he poured into the cup . But he took care , however , that it did not run over ; and then , raising it with a trembling hand to his lips , he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed it down his capacious throat . The captain gave no response to this compliment , but as Mr. Gibbs put down the coffee-cup he said blandly , " Thank you ; but suppose you put that flask back in the case . I am rather choice with that brandy ; it was a  --  given to me by a  --  person who was a  --  unfortunately hanged , and a  --  I rarely offer it a  --  the second time . " Puffing his cigar as he spoke in an easy manner , he then turned round to listen to Mr. Gibbs 's narrative . Becoming more genial as the brandy loosened his tongue , Mr. Gibbs continued : " Well , sir , from the Behameys we ran to leeward , nearly to the Spanish Main , in hopes , perhaps , of finding some stray fellow as was bound to Europe ; but we see nothing for days and days , and weeks and weeks , till finally the water fell short again , and we beats up and runs into Santa Cruz . There , as luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a bit of a scrimmage up on a gentleman 's plantation after sunset , and was werry roughly handled by a patrol of sogers as happened to be near . I believe as how Eboe Pete died that night ; and I heerd , too , that French Tom had his skull cracked ; and what does he go for to do but make a confession to the authorities that the ' Centipede ' was a pirate ! " Well , captain , the moment that information reached me , and seein ' a sogers ' boat gettin ' ready , and the sogers running about the water-battery of the fort , than I just slips the cable , and runs out to sea like a bird ; and , Lord love ye , sir ! the way they pitched round shot after us was  --  was  --  " Here Master Gibbs paused for a simile , and the captain observed with a hacking , cough-like laugh , " You saved the water-casks , though ? " " Why no , sir ; and we was forced to go upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Ho ! " rejoined the listener . " Capital ! Did n't suffer , I hope ? Go on . " " Howsomever , I says to myself , the captain wants a good valy'ble cargo , and so we beats up again and stretches away back along the coast of Jamaiky , on the look-out for any think that might be comin ' that ' ere way . Well , sir , d'ye see , airly one morning , as we was a lying as close as wax under the land , we spies a big brig becalmed off to seaward ; but we diskivered at the same time that same Yankee cruiser as was in chase of us off Matanzas . I know 'd as how you would be displeased at any risks being run , so we keeps clean and snug inshore , under a pint o ' land , till set of sun , and until after the moon went down . Then the breeze sprung up fresh from the old trade quarter , and says I , now we 'll make a dash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry as bone-dust ; more pertikerly , ye see , captain , since the corvette , after dodgin ' about him all day , had yawed off , and , with his port-tacks aboard , was beatin ' to wind'ard . " Here Mr. Gibbs 's auditor took the cigar from his mouth and rolled his light blue eyes at him , puffed a thick volume of smoke through the corner of his mouth , but said never a syllable . The narrator gave a wistful look at the brandy-flask , drained the last few drops from the coffee-cup , pushed out his timber leg , and resumed : " So you see , sir , as I was a sayin ' , I says to myself , I 'll get the boat in the water with the lads , and , to make sure of all being conducted shipshape , I 'll go myself . " " Oh ! " said the captain , as his eyebrows went up and the corners of his mouth came down , with the faintest breath of a sardonic smile , while he lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ay , sir ! So we let the old drogher go bouncing on past us , at about the rate of five mile in four hours , when we crossed his wake under the jib , and then we ups with the fore and main-sail , got a pull of the sheets , and  --  " Captain Brand shook the point of his curved nose at the speaker , who checked himself , and , giving an emphatic rap with his crutch on the floor , went on with  --  " Beg parding , sir ; but , Lord love ye ! we just walked up under his lee , and afore he know 'd where he wos , we boarded him , knocked over two or three chaps , and had the skipper lashed down in his cabin as quick as winkin ' and as quiet as could be . Ay , sir , we had it all our own way ; but during the scrimmage wot should I see ( here he inclined his head out like a loggerhead turtle ) but the lovelyest young ' oman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber stump grated nervously on the floor . " Says I , that 's just the craft , with such a clean run and full bows , as would please Captain Brand "  --  at which that individual rolled round on his elbow and brought his eye to the opera-glass in the direction of the schooner . " She is n't there , captain ! " parenthesized the narrator , following the motion with his head . " So I just fisted hold of her to hand her tenderly into the boat , with a bag of shiners as wos found on board , when , so help me  --   --   --  beg parding , sir  --  if a dwarfed giant of a nigger did n't take an overhand lick at me with an iron pump-break , and nearly cut this ' ere larboard pin in two pieces ; and , smash my brains ! " he continued , shaking his broad paw aloft with rage , " but what does I do , with all the pain from the clip that da  --  ( beg parding , sir ) give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nigger 's head  --  " " Did n't I see a little boy on board the ' Centipede ? ' Perhaps I was mistaken , the sun blazes so fiercely , eh ? " broke in Captain Brand , though the sun did n't blaze with a fiercer light than shot out of his deadly cold blue eyes . " Ho , ay , sir ! that young imp was a bitin ' at my t' other leg like a bull terrier pup , while the nigger was attackin ' me , and then he goes and crawls out of the cabin winders , and was fished out of the water by the chaps as wos towin ' astarn in the boat . " " Oh , really ! how very fortunate ! " muttered the captain ; " go on ; do n't stop , I pray you , Master Gibbs . " " Well , sir , I knows very little what happened after this , for the young ' oman was a screamin ' and our chaps a cursin ' about the decks , when all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the same time a heavy gun came slamming into our very ears ; and there was that infarnal corvette agen bowlin ' down within five cables ' length of the brig , her battery all alight and the whistles a callin ' away the boats , in as violent a haste as any think I can remember , " said Gibbs , as he paused to catch his breath . " You must have kept a sharp look-out , though ? " But , without heeding this remark , the burly scoundrel went on  --  " Well , Captain Brand , the boys tumbled me over the side  --  " " Not forgetting the little bag of shiners ! " sneered his auditor . " Tumbled me into the boat , sir , and then pulled like mad for the schooner . I know 'd , d'ye mind , captain , or leastways I felt sartain we could show any think afloat our heels , and so away we scrambles aboard , and off we splits . But ye must see by this time , sir , the corvette had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drogher , acting like a screen for the schooner close under his lee . It wos only a minnit , though , while he was holding some jaw with those lubbers aboard the brig , before he filled away again , and wearing sharp round her bows , he diskivered us sartain . I do n't think , as matters stood by this time , that our boat was a boat-hook 's length from the schooner when I jist see a burst of red flashes from the man-o ' - war 's starboard ports , and heerd an officer roar out , ' Give him the whole three divisions of grape ! ' when I 'm da  --  your parding agin , sir ; I 'm blest if ever I heerd sich a rain of cold iron in all my sea-goin ' experience . Ay , sir , by G  --  gracious , sir , if about two bushels of them grape did n't riddle the barge like the nozzle to a watering-pot , and same time tore seven of our noble fellows all to rags  --  " " You saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a kind voice , but with a frightful sneer . " Why , captain , we unfortinately lost her ; for ye see , after tumbling me aboard the schooner , and after bailing nigh as much blood as water  --  " " Capital ! excellent ! best joke I ever heard , " broke in Captain Brand , with a hollow laugh of much enjoyment . " Arter bailin ' as much blood as water , and finding the man-o ' - war was heaving in stays to slam another broadside into us , we cut the boat adrift , and then got the sheets flat aft , the gaff-top-sails up , and away we drove with a crackin ' breeze right up to wind'ard , like a swordfish . Lord love ye , sir ! we walked away from the cruiser , a eatin ' the wind out of him like a knife , and notwithstandin ' he hove more nor forty round shot at us , he only knocked away the fore-top-mast and some other triflin ' little damage about the hull , and "  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That counts off about half your crew , eh ? " said Captain Brand , smiling in his peculiar manner . " Well , what next ? " " Why , sir , the next mornin ' Belize Paul  --  as is part doctor , you know  --  said as how my leg was to come off below the knee , and after givin ' me a sip or two o ' rum  --  " " Bottle , " interjected the captain , twisting the beak of his nose in a puff of smoke . "  --  Rum , why , smash my brains , sir , if he did n't hack it off with a wood-saw ! " " Well , what next ? " " Then , sir , ye see , we run the schooner down Cape Cruz , where we kept werry snug and quiet till sich times as the old one-eyed Diego judged the coast clear to return to head-quarters . " " Well , what then ? " " That 's all , Captain Brand ! " concluded the narrator his garbled yarn , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , and cast a thirsty look at the brandy-flask . " That 's all , is it ? " hissed the man with the iron jaws , in a tone of concentrated passion , as he sprang with a single bound from the settee , and clutched Master Gibbs with both hands around his hairy throat until his face turned livid purple and his eyes started from the sockets . " That 's all , is it , you drunken beast ? That 's all you have to tell after idling away the summer , losing anchors and boats , and more than half my crew , and bringing a hornet 's nest down about our ears ! That 's all , is it ? And what would you say , now , if I should order the doctor to cut off your other leg close behind your ears , you beast ? " In the last stages of suffocation , the man was hurled on his back to the floor , and there lay , bleeding a torrent from his mouth and nose . His superior stood over him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket for a pistol , and then he glanced rapidly at the green rope squirming from the beams above ; but , changing his purpose apparently , he strode back to the settee and shouted " Babette ! " Presently the door opened from the passage leading to the kitchen , and there appeared a large , powerfully-made negro-woman , with her arms akimbo , and a pair of bloodshot eyes gleaming from beneath a striped Madras turban wound round her head . " Babette ! " repeated the captain , resuming his seat and his habitual polite air and voice , " serve out a barrel of Bordeaux and a beaker of old Antigua rum to the ' Centipede 's ' crew to drink my health ; and I say , my beauty ! have a pig or two killed ; tell the boatswain to haul the seine , and have a good supper for all hands to-night . And , Baba "  --  he went on as if he had just thought of something  --  " there 's my friend Gibbs lying there  --  I believe he has fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a bed in the vault  --  a little biscuit and water  --  he may be feverish when he wakes up , you know . And , Babette , old girl , if you are in want of kindling wood , you may as well use that timber leg of our friend Gibbs ! I do n't think he 'll want it again . There ! doucement , Baba ! " The negress gave a deep grunt of assent , and , seizing the senseless body lying on the floor , she dragged it out of the room . Returning a few moments after , she wiped up the blood with a cloth dipped in hot water , and finally disappeared . CHAPTER X. AN OLD SPANIARD WITH ONE EYE . " I fear thee , Ancient Mariner ! I fear thy skinny hand ! For thou art long , and lank , and brown , As is the ribbed sea-sand . " " The ' Panchita ' has passed Mangrove Point , " came in the hoarse whisper from the signal-man . " You can see her now from below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panama hat , and stepped out on the veranda , where , with a cigar in his mouth , he leaned over the balustrade , and kept sharp watch on every thing that was going on below him . In a few minutes a long pointed brown bowsprit protruded itself beyond the wall of rocks , followed by a great triangular lateen sail , bent to a yard a mile long , and tapering away like a fly-fishing-rod , where , at the end , was a short bit of yellow and red pennant . As her bows came into view they showed above a curved prow falling inboard , with a huge bunch of sheepskin for a chafing-mat on the knob , and a thin red streak along the wales , on a lead-colored ground , above her bottom , which was painted green . As more of her proportions came into the picture , you saw a stout stump of a mast , raking forward , with short black ropes of purchases for hoisting the single yard , and heavy square blocks close down to the foot of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen of rocks , another light stick of a mast stood up over the taffrail , with another lateen sail and whip-stalk of a yard , to which was bent the Spanish Colonial Guarda Costa flag . In fact , she was a Spanish felucca all over , from stem to stern , and truck to water-line . A few dingy hammocks were stowed about halfway along her rail , and there were a good many men moving about her decks in getting the cable clear , and a lot more clinging like so many lizards along the bending yard , and all in some attempt at uniform dress , in readiness to roll up the sail when the anchor was down . There was a long brass gun , too , burnished like gold , on a pivot slide , with all its equipment , trained muzzle forward in front of the main-mast . No sooner had she sagged into the open basin , with her immense sail hanging flat and heavy in the light air , than a boat from the schooner boarded her , and presently she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliments and greetings exchanged between the crews of the two vessels , and some rough jokes made , as the last comer veered out the cable , rolled up his sails , and set taut his running gear in quite a tidy and man-of-war style . " Go on board the felucca , Jose , and give my compliments to Don Ignacio , and say I shall be happy to see him , " cried Captain Brand from the piazza to a man at the cove ; " and tell him , " continued he , " that I should have called in person , but I ca n't bear the hot sun since I caught the fever . Take my gig . " This was said in Spanish , and when he had finished speaking he shaded his face behind the curtain and scowled . " You 're a bird of ill omen , my one-eyed friend ; but one of these days I 'll wipe out old scores , and new ones too , perhaps , " Captain Brand muttered to himself ; and , from his murderous expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his threat . Meanwhile , a light whale-boat of a gig , manned by four men and a coxswain , pushed off from the shore , and in three strokes of the oars she was alongside the felucca . The coxswain stepped over the low rail , and , walking aft , turned down a cuddy of a cabin , took off his hat , and delivered his message . A minute later he again got into the boat , and pulled to the cove , where he said to the captain , " Don Ignacio says he 'll come in his own boat when he 's ready . " " Bueno ! " was responded aloud ; and then to himself : " Do n't ask or receive favors , eh ? What an old file the brute is ! " He said no more , but watched . Presently a small man came up out of the cabin of the " Panchita , " but so very slow , and with such a quiet motion did he emerge , that one might suppose it was a wary animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in attire  --  a brown pair of linen trowsers , a Marseilles vest with silver filigree buttons , an embroidered shirt-bosom with gold studs , and a dark navy-blue broadcloth coat , with standing collar and anchor gilt buttons . His head-gear was simply a white chip hat , with a very narrow brim and a fluttering red ribbon ; but beneath it his coal-black hair behind was chopped as close as could be , leaving a single long and well-oiled ringlet on each side , which curled like snakes around a pair of large gold rings pendent from his ears . His complexion was dark , bilious , and swarthy , with a thin , sharp nose , and a million of minute wrinkles , all meeting above , at the corners , and under a small line of a mouth ; quite like rays , in fact , and only relaxed when the lips parted to show a few ragged , rotten pegs of sharp teeth . But perhaps the most noticeable feature in his face was his eye  --  for he had but one  --  and the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red , closed patch of tightly-drawn skin , with a few hairs sticking out like iron tacks . His single eye , however , was a jet black , round , piercing organ , which seemed to do duty for half a dozen ordinary glims , and danced with a sharp , malevolent scrutiny , as if the owner was always in search of something and never found it , and every body and every thing appeared to slink out of its light wherever it glanced around . His age might have been any where from forty to sixty . As he stepped on deck , clear of the cuddy cabin hatch , his sinister optic played about in its socket  --  now scanning the long brass gun , the half-furled sails , the crew , the ropes , or taking a steady , unwinking glance at the midday sun , and then shining off to the shore , and sweeping in the " Centipede , " the little pool of blue water , and the mouth of the inlet . Feeling apparently satisfied with the present aspect of affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket , plucked a cigarette from the case , and then proceeded deliberately to strike a light . Even while performing this simple operation , his uneasy orb , like unto a black bull's-eye , traversed about in its habitual way ; and when he raised the spark of fire with his brown , thin hand , and the claws of fingers loaded with rings , he seemed to be looking into his own mouth . Nodding to a fellow who stood near , with a crimson sash around his waist , he inclined his eye toward the shore , blew out a thin wreath of smoke from his lungs  --  all the while his vigilant organ shining like a burning spark of lambent jet through the smoke  --  and merely said , " The boat ! " In a moment a small cockle-shell of a punt was lowered from the stern of the felucca , when , stepping carefully in , he seized a scull , and with a few vigorous twists pushed her to the landing at the cove . During all these movements of the commander of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , indeed , he was so extremely critical that he stuck the tube of a powerful telescope through an aperture of the curtains around him , and not only looked at his cautious visitor , but he actually watched the expression of his uneasy eye , and almost counted every wrinkle  --  finely engraved as they were  --  on his swarthy visage ; but , if Captain Brand 's own visage reflected an index of his mind , he did not seem over and above pleased with what he saw . " Has a bundle of papers under his arm ! I can see the hilt of that delicate blade , too , sticking out from his wristband . Ah ! I 've seen him throw that short blade from his coat-sleeve and strike a dollar at twenty yards ! Wonderful skill with knives you have , Don Ignacio ; but you never yet tried your knack with me ! Oh no , my Tuerto  --  bird of ill omen that you are ! We ca n't do without one another just yet , so let us wait and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks , Captain Brand withdrew his telescope as the commander of the felucca approached , and , with a cheerful smile , waited to receive him . A few moments later the one-eyed individual mounted the rope-ladder stairway , carefully feeling the strands , however , and looking suspiciously around him as he stepped lightly on the piazza . " Ah ! compadre mio ! " exclaimed Captain Brand , in Spanish , as he seized his visitor by the flipper , and squeezed his fingers till the pressure on his valuable rings made him wince , as he was led into the large and spacious saloon , while at the same time the captain gave him a hearty slap between his narrow shoulders . " Ah ! compadre ! How goes the friend of my soul ? " The small man gave no symptoms of joy at this warm greeting ; but , screwing his wiry frame out of the captain 's caresses , his eye flashed like a spark of fire quickly up and down and all around the apartment , as if making a mental inventory of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crown of his head to the toes of his straw slippers , when he quietly remarked through his closed teeth , " Como estamos ? "  --  " How are we ? " " Ah , Don Ignacio , poco bueno , poco malo ! Half and half . Just getting well over that maldito attack of Yellow Jack . " " Hum ! more bad than good . No ? I 've brought you some letters from the agent at Havana . " " Thanks  --  thanks , my friend . Ho ! Babette ! Babette ! Some anisette for Don Ignacio . Presto ! my good Baba . There  --  that will do ! " he said , merrily , as the liqueur and glasses were placed on the table . " And do n't omit the turtle-soup for dinner , and tell Lascar Joe to make it . Ah ! I forget  --  the best cook I had  --  the devil 's making soup of him now . However , do the best you can , my Baba , and let us have dinner about sunset . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow and a laugh , he added , " And we 'll have the doctor to join us , and tell how he cut off our poor friend Gibbs 's leg with a hand-saw . Dios ! amigo ! Capital joke , ' pon my honor ! " Captain Brand 's honor ! Lord have mercy upon us ! And he had very few jokes , and never told one himself . " Hum ! " replied the Tuerto , in the pause of the conversation . " There 's better jokes than that to hear . Mira ! look ! " With this brief rejoinder he threw a bundle of newspapers on the table , and , pulling out a packet of letters from a breast pocket , pitched it toward his host . Then helping himself to a thimbleful of anisette , he took off his narrow-brimmed chip hat for the first time , polished up his eye a bit with the knuckle of his fore finger , and looked at his companion fixedly . " Letters , I see , from our old friend Moreno , at Havana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the settee , and with a pretty tortoise-shell knife cut round the seals . " Ah ! what says he ? ' Happy to inform you , ' is he ? ' Packages of French silks seized by custom-house on account of informal invoice and clearance . ' Why did n't the fool forge others , then ? Well , what next ? ' Schooner " Reel , " from Barbadoes , with cargo of rum and jerked beef , wrecked going into Principe , and crew thrown into prison on suspicion of being engaged in  --  ' Oh ! ah ! served them right , when I ordered them to St. Jago  --  delighted they must be ! ' Bills for advances and stores now due , please remit , per hands of Don Ignacio Sanchez  --  ' " Here Captain Brand caught a ray from the one eye of his companion , which he returned with interest ; and then laying the letters down on the table with the softest motion in life , he exclaimed , with a sigh , " Not the best news in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich goods , and those bags of coffee , and pipes of rum gone to the devil . But these are little accidents in our profession . " " Como ? " said Senor Ignacio , " our profession ? " shaking his fore finger before his paper cigar in a deprecating manner . " Speak for yourself , amigo . " " Ah ! true , " the other went on  --  " my profession . The freedom of the seas , the toll of the tropics , the right of search , and all that sort of buccaneering pastime , is liable , you know , to the usual risks . " Here he inclined his head to one side and gave a slight clack to his lips , as if to illustrate in a humorous way a man choking to death with a knotted rope under his ear . " However , we must be more cautious in future and retrieve the past disasters , for there are still on the sea as good barks as ever floated . " Captain Brand said this as if he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to enter into some shrewd commercial speculation . " Hum ! " murmured Senor Ignacio , while pouring out another little glass of anisette . " Amigo mio ! you had better read the papers from Havana before you talk of another cruise . " " Oh ! delighted to read the news  --  quite refreshing to get a peep at the world after being cooped up here for months ! Another French revolution ! Bonaparte alive yet ! A Patriot war ! Nelson and Villeneuve ! All interesting . " Thus glancing rapidly over the prints , pausing at times at a paragraph that arrested his attention , then tossing a paper away and taking up another , till suddenly Captain Brand 's hand shook with passion as he read aloud , Illustration : " HE TOUCHED THE BELL OVERHEAD AS HE SPOKE , AND , PUTTING HIS MOUTH TO THE TUBE , ASKED , ' ANY THING IN SIGHT ? ' " " His Britannic majesty 's squadron has been augmented on the West India station . The brig ' Firefly , ' corvettes ' Croaker ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Providence , on the 2d instant , bound to leeward . We also learn that the United States have fitted out a squadron of small vessels , called the Musquito Fleet , to search for the noted pirate Brand , who has so long committed atrocities among the islands . He was last chased by the American corvette ' Scourge , ' off Morant Bay , on the east coast of Jamaica , but escaped during the night . The following day a shattered boat was picked up , which had been cut adrift from the piratical schooner , containing several dead and dying bodies of the pirates . One of the latter gave such information to the captain of the ' Scourge ' as leads to the hope that Brand 's retreat may soon be discovered and his nest of pirates be destroyed . Recent advices from Principe state that a vessel loaded with valuable merchandise struck on the Cavallo Reef and went down . The crew , however , five in number , were rescued , but on landing were identified by the mate of the English bark ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that vessel and murdered the master and several of the passengers . Our readers may remember that among the latter were two sisters , who leaped overboard and were drowned , to save themselves the horror of a more cruel fate . The men alluded to , who were wrecked in the brig off Principe , were sent in chains to Havana , and were yesterday publicly garroted in the Plaza of Moro Castle . " CHAPTER XI . CONVERSATION IN POCKETS AND SLEEVES . " He holds him with his skinny hand : ' There was a ship , ' quoth he . ' Hold off ! unhand me , graybeard loon ! ' Eftsoons his hand dropp 'd he . " Captain Brand laid down the paper without a sign of outward emotion , and nodded his head several times at the one-eyed man facing him . He then extracted his perfumed handkerchief , examined the cipher in the corner , and waved it before his face . Don Ignacio pulled out a red silk bandana , and polished his eye as if it were the lens of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mio ! The nets are spreading , but the fish are not in them yet ! " " No , amigo ! " " Ah ! compadre , viento y ventura poca dura ! the fair breezes have chopped round in our teeth . Success , my friend , creates jealousy , envy , hatred , and malice . Now here were we swimming along as quietly as sharks under water , only coming up for a bite occasionally , when on come those villainous swordfishes , and wish to drive us away . " Captain Brand gave expression to this pious homily in a tone of virtuous reproach against the world at large , and as if he were a very much maligned and ill-used gentleman . He touched the bell overhead as he spoke , and , putting his mouth to the tube , asked , " Any thing in sight ? " " Nothing , senor . " " Telegraph the man at the Tiger-trap station to keep a bright look-out , and direct the gunner to keep the battery manned day and night ! Tell the boatswain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alligator 's mouth ! " Don Ignacio gave a rather suspicious glimmer at his vessel as this last order was given , and smiled ; that is , if a one-sided twitch to the wrinkles about the line of his mouth could be tortured into a smile . His companion seemed to divine what was passing in the Don 's mind , for he added politely , " The cable wo n't interfere with the ' Panchita ! ' " " No , amigo ; the felucca is anchored just outside of it . " The Tuerto was not a man to leave any thing to chance , and he had taken the precaution to be on the safe side of the pirates , either as friends or enemies . He had indeed been as near an approach to a pirate himself as could be , and had only abandoned the business for a profession quite as bad , where there was less risk and more profit . In other words , he was now a colonial officer in command of a Guarda Costa , winking  --  but without shutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it ; and he invariably was well paid for it , or else he made mischief . Withal , he was as crafty and determined an old villain as ever sailed the West Indies . He had amassed a large fortune , and owned several tobacco estates  --  pretty much all his wealth acquired by the easy trouble of holding his tongue . Yet his greed was insatiable , and he probably would have sold the fingers from his hands , and his legs and arms with them  --  all , save his single black ball of an optic , which was invaluable to him  --  for doubloons . In fact , this feverish thirst after gold which always raged in his hot veins had induced him to pay Captain Brand a visit , and we shall see with what result . The truth is , however , that Captain Brand was the only man of his numerous villainous acquaintance afloat for whom he felt the least dread . He knew him to be bold , skillful , and wary , and so the Don had a tolerably positive conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck might get a wrench in the garrote while he was throwing the noose for his coadjutor . To return , however , to the pair of worthies sitting in conclave in the pirate 's saloon : the captain , resuming the conversation , observed in a careless tone , quite as if the subject under discussion was a mere ordinary matter , " When will this swarm of hornets be down upon us ? " The Spaniard blew a thick puff of smoke from his cigarette , and still holding it between his teeth , while his eye glittered through the murky cloud , he replied , " Perhaps a fortnight , a little more or less . I left St. Jago five days ago , with orders from the Administrador to run down this side of the island , and procure information for the English consul . " " Any cruisers down that way ? " " Ay ! the corvette ' Scourge , ' and the ' Snapper ' schooner ; they arrived the night before I sailed . " " Did you happen to see their officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long talk with the captain of the corvette at the custom-house . " " Holloa ! and you told him  --  " " Yes ; I showed him a chart of the Isle of Pines , and pointed out how to get into the old hole . " Here the pair laughed short laughs , when Brand continued his questions with , " And how did he take the bait ? " " Hooked him ; for I heard him order his first lieutenant to be ready for weighing at daylight , and say that my description tallied with that of the dying man they picked up in the ' Centipede 's ' boat , " replied the Tuerto , with a chuckle . " Bueno ! " exclaimed the pirate , as his face assumed an unwonted sternness , while he rested his cheek on his left hand with the elbow on the table , and slipped his right into the pocket of his trowsers . " Bueno ! amigo mio ! But how do I know but you may have made a little mistake , and described another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction ? " There was the faintest click of a noise in the captain 's pocket as he spoke , but not so faint but that it vibrated on the ear of the Spaniard , and , pushing back his chair a foot or two from the table , he raised his right hand , the fore fingers and thumb slightly bent inward , but grasping a jewel-hilted knife , whose dim blue blade glimmered up the loose sleeve . There was nothing threatening apparently in the movement , though the two villains looked at each other with a cold , murderous , unflinching glare . The Don was the first to break the silence ; and he said , in a low , hissing tone , " Maldito ! Because I had a little account of plata to settle with you before the men-o ' - war should roast you out . But beware , Capitano mio ! I left a little paper at St. Jago with directions where to find me in case I did not return in a certain time . " " Ho , compadre , how very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such thoughts into your head ? Diavolo ! we have stood by one another too long to separate now . There , my hand upon it . " Saying this , Captain Brand 's whole manner changed , and , drawing his hand from his pocket , he reached over toward his companion . The Don , however , watched him narrowly , and his eye shot out a wary sparkle as he withdrew his hand , when , cautiously putting forth his own left , he touched his cold , thin brown fingers to those of the man before him . This operation ended , he quietly sipped a few drops of anisette , and rolled and lighted another paper cigar . " Well , amigo , let us now proceed to business , " said Brand , gayly , " for dinner will soon be ready , and we have no time to lose . How stands the account ? " " The papers are on board the felucca , and it will be more convenient , when the settlement is made , to come on board with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hurry . " " Just as you choose , friend of my soul ! The doubloons , or the silk , or broadcloth are ready for you at any moment . Pay you in any thing except the delicious wines of France . Bueno ! " he added , pulling out a splendid gold repeater , with a marquis 's coronet on the chased back . " And now , amigo , accept this little token into the bargain . " Don Ignacio 's fiery eye twinkled with greed , but it was only for a moment , when , giving a quick glance at the coronet and coat of arms , he waved his fore finger gently to and fro , and shook his head . " What ! No ? Why , you know it once belonged to the Captain General of Cuba , old Tol de rol de riddle rol  --  what was his name ? He gave it me , you know , together with some other trinkets , for saving his life  --  a  --  you remember ? Very generous old gentleman  --  nobleman indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or more , if he can ! " Ay , Don Ignacio did remember the circumstance attending that generous transaction , and he remembered to have heard , also , that the Captain General made a present of all his money and jewels with the point of a broad blade quivering at his throat . He said nothing , however , in allusion to this interesting episode , but he smiled meaningly , and went on with his cigar . " Not take it , eh ? Well , amigo , I must look you up something else ; but now for dinner . Babette , clear away for dinner . Here are the keys of the wine-cellar . The best , my beauty , and plenty of it . " Then turning to his companion : " Suppose we take a stroll to the Tiger 's Trap ; the sun is sinking , and a walk will give us an appetite for the turtle-soup  --  vamanos ! " CHAPTER XII . DOCTOR AND PRIEST . " But soon I heard the dash of oars , I heard the pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I saw a boat appear . " The pilot and the pilot 's boy , I heard them coming fast ; Dear Lord in heaven ! it was a joy The dead men could not blast . " While Captain Brand and Don Ignacio Sanchez walked pleasantly along the pebbly shore of the clear blue inlet to the Tiger 's Trap , let us , too , saunter amid the habitations which sheltered the pirate 's haunt . Apart from the mat sheds of the shelly cove of the basin , where the " Centipede " and " Panchita " were anchored , there was a nest of red-tiled buildings which served the crew of the former vessel for a dwelling when in port . It was pleasantly situated on a little sandy plateau , within a stone's-throw of the water , and shaded by a cluster of palm-trees ; while in the rear was a dense jungle of canes and bushes , through which led numerous paths to a small lagoon beyond . The buildings were of one story , constructed of loose stones , the holes plastered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly-built piazzas . They stood in a double row , leaving a stone pavement yard between , where one or two cocoa-nut-trees lifted their slim trunks like sentinels on guard . Two of the largest of these huts were mere shells inside , and used for mess-rooms , exposing the unhewn girders and roof above , but all whitewashed and tolerably clean . The floors were of rough mahogany boards , or heavy dark planks , and no doubt part of the cargo of some Honduras trader who had fallen into the pirates ' hands . Around the sides of these mess-rooms were arranged small tables and canvas camp-stools , with eating utensils of every variety of pattern and value , from stray sets of French porcelain to common delf crockery . A large open chimney stood a little way off , where was a kitchen , in which the cookery was carried on , under the superintendence of a couple of old negroes . Beyond the mess-rooms were the sheds used for sleeping apartments , with lots of hammocks of canvas and straw braid hanging by their clews from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . Bags and sea-chests stood out from the walls , with bits of mirrors here and there , some with the glasses cracked , and others in square or round gilt frames . All , however , was arranged with a certain degree of order , and the floor was clean and well scrubbed . Another detached building , much smaller than the rest , was divided by a board partition into two rooms . The first was used for a storeroom , and was filled with bread in barrels , bags of coffee and sugar , hams , dried fruits , beans , salt meats , and what not , but every thing in abundance , and apparently the very best the market of the high seas could produce . A strong door protected this repository , with a wrought iron bar and padlock . The other portion of the building was more habitable . There were chairs and tables ; a couple of upright bookcases with glass doors , one filled with books , odd numbers of magazines , and old newspapers , and the other containing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a small apothecary 's shop , in fact , together with two or three cases of surgical instruments . Two elegant bureaus , with rosewood doors and mouldings , like those furnished passenger ships to the East Indies , stood against the wall at either side ; and near to each , in opposite corners , were low iron bedsteads , without mattresses or bedding , and merely stretched with dressed and embossed leather . For pillows were Chinese heel stools , and as for covering , the climate dispensed with it altogether . Hanging against the wall were a couple of brace of pistols and two or three muskets , and on the table stood a square case-bottle of gin , some glasses , and a richly-bound breviary clasped with a heavy gold strap ; but in no other part of these huts were fire-arms ever allowed , and very rarely was liquor served out in more than the usual daily half-gill allowance . Seated at the table in the last room we have described were two men . One , the shorter of the two , was dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his waist by a white rope , which fell in knotted ends over his knees . Around his open neck was hung a string of black ebony beads , hooked on to a heavy gold cross , which rested on his capacious breast , and which the wearer was continually feeling , and occasionally pressing to his lips . His face was dark and sensual  --  thick , unctuous lips , a flat nose , and large black eyes  --  while a glossy fringe of raven hair went like a thick curtain all around his head , only leaving a bluish-white round patch on the shaved crown . This individual was the Padre Ricardo , who , for some good reasons best known to himself , had left his clerical duties in his native city of Vera Cruz and taken service with Captain Brand . One of the reasons for leaving  --  and rather abruptly , too  --  was for thrusting a cuchillo into the heart of his own father , who had reported him to his superior for his monstrous licentiousness . The padre , however , always declared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old parent , to save him the pain and disgrace which would have followed the exposure of his son ! He still clung , though excommunicated , to the priestly calling , and prided himself upon his fasts and vigils , never omitting the smallest forms or penances , and saying mass from Ave Maria in the early morning to Angelus at vesper time in the evening . For Captain Brand he was ready to shrive a dying pirate  --  and pretty busy he was , too , at times  --  or hear the confession of one with a troubled conscience in sound health ; which , if important to the safety or well-being of the fraternity , he took a quiet opportunity of imparting to his superior in command . In these pursuits he not only made himself useful to Captain Brand , but he became more or less his confidant and adviser , and seemed to maintain his influence by ghostly advice over the superstitious feelings of the men . The padre , however , utterly detested the sea , and never touched his soft feet in the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he had plenty to eat and drink on the island , and no end of prayers for his amusement when in charge of the haunt  --  as he was  --  to look out for the people who were left when the " Centipede " sailed on a cruise , he thus passed the time in a delightfully agreeable manner . The companion who sat opposite to the padre was a tall , gaunt , cadaverous person , evidently of French extraction , with something kind and humane about his face , but yet the physiognomy expressed the utmost determination of character  --  such a heart and eye as could perform a delicate surgical operation without a flutter of nerve or eyelid , and who would stand before a leveled pistol looking calmly down the barrel as the hammer fell . His face was intellectual , and he never smiled . His whole appearance portrayed a thorough seaman . Where he came from no one knew ; nor did he ever open his lips , even to the captain , with a reason for taking service among his band . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at St. Jago , and was engaged by Don Ignacio to serve professionally with Brand in assisting the patriots on the Spanish Main . When , however , he reached the rendezvous of the pirates , and discovered that they were altogether a different sort of patriots than he had bargained for , he nevertheless made no objections to remain , and took the oath of allegiance , only stipulating that he should not be called upon to take an active part in their proceedings . Here , then , he remained for nearly three years , attending to the sick or wounded , taking no interest in the accounts of the exploits of the freebooters around him  --  rarely , indeed , holding speech with any one save his room-mate , the padre , or occasionally a dinner or a walk with Captain Brand . On the last expedition , however , of the " Centipede , " he had been induced to go on board , so that he might become a check and guard over the brutal ruffian who had been placed temporarily in command ; but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of little avail . There was yet another occupant of the room inhabited by the doctor and Padre Ricardo ; and a low moaning cry caused the former to rise quietly from his chair and approach the low iron bedstead on his side of the lodging . There , beneath a light gauze musquito net , lay our poor little Henri  --  his once round , rosy , innocent face now pale and thin , with a red spot on each cheek , and a dark , soft line beneath the closed eyes . Uneasily he moved in his fitful slumber ; and putting his little hands together as if in prayer , he murmured , " Oh mamma , mamma ! " Beside the bed stood an unglazed jar of lemonade , together with a vial and a spoon . The doctor drew nigh , and , gently pushing aside the curtain , stood looking at the child for some minutes . Presently the little sick boy feebly stretched out his delicate , thin limbs , and unclosed his eyes . Oh ! how dim , and sad , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half-wild stare , and then , closing the lids tight together , the hot drops bubbled out and coursed slowly down his tender cheeks . The doctor , with the gentleness of a woman , bent over him , and taking up his poor , limp little hand , he remained feeling the fluttering pulse and catching the hot breath on his dark cheeks . As if communing with himself , while a glow of compassion lighted up his careworn visage , he muttered , " By the great and good God , who hears me , if I save this child I will restore him to his heart-broken mother ! " He sank down on his knees by the bedside as he made his vow , and letting the little hand rest on the bed , he buried his face in his large bony hands . What thoughts passed through that man 's mind none but the Almighty knows ; but when he arose his stern features had resumed their wonted expression , and , pouring a little lemonade in a glass , he held it to the sleeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , in a low tone , " Padre , the boy will live . His fever is leaving him , and he will get well . " " Ave Maria ! Santissima ! " ejaculated the padre , crossing himself and kissing his cross ; " I pray for him . You must give him to me , doctor . I will make him a little priest , and he shall swing the censer and chant the Misericordia when I get the new chapel built . " " Time enough to think of that , mi padre , when he gets strong again . But just now all the prayers you can say for him will do him no good , and so I hope you wo n't put yourself to the trouble . " " Cierto , amigo , doctor ; but do n't sneer at the prayers of the Church . They do good ; they ease the soul and soothe the pangs of Purgatory . " " Ah ! and how long do you expect to stop in Purgatory ? " " Ave purissima ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ricardo ! " " Question the devil when you want fire , " retorted the doctor , as he opened a book lying on the table before him , and put an end to the dialogue . His companion quietly helped himself to a measure of pure gin , and unclasped the covers of his richly-bound missal . Scarcely , however , had their conversation ceased , when a hoarse hum of many voices was heard in the direction of the sheds without , mingled with shouts in all tongues and uproarious laughter . " Peste ! " said the doctor , looking out of an open window ; " the people have knocked off work and are coming home to their supper . They seem to have brought some of the crew of the felucca with them too . We shall have a loud night of it , for the captain has sent them a pipe of wine and a barrel of rum to carouse with . " " Pobre citos ! they have had a hard time of it during the summer  --  short of rum , and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repose . So many of my poor flock killed , too , by that savage American corvette , and I not near to administer the last consolations and holy rite ! " sighed the padre , as he kissed the crucifix and bowed his head . " There is Lascar Joe , too , among the missing ! He refused the sacrament , infidel as he was , the day before he sailed ; but what turtle-soup he made ! " The padre hereupon sighed deeply again , but whether for the loss of the Lascar or the soup , no one knows . The noise without increased  --  the rattle of crockery , the clinking of glasses , the moving of feet , and all the sounds of hungry , boisterous sailors at table . Soon , too , a shout or cheer would be heard , then a verse of a song , roars of laughter , and now and then the tinkle of a guitar struck by vigorous fingers in waltz or fandango . " Merci ! " muttered the doctor , as he looked compassionately at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , I fear , disturb the little boy , and it 's as hot here too , padre , as the place we all are going to . " " It is warm , my son ! " he replied , as his thick unctuous lips parted with a smile at his companion 's allusion to another and a hotter place ; " but I think our good capitano would have a cot slung for my little priest in the saloon of the big building there . It is always cool on the crag , you know . " " Ah ! perhaps he will , " said the doctor , reflectively ; " I 'll see about it . " Stepping again to the bedside of the little sufferer , he laid a hand gently on his forehead , where the soft curls lay in confusion about his temples , and then quickly touching his pulse , he regarded him attentively for a few moments , while at the same time a light glow of perspiration came faintly over the innocent face and spread itself down the neck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " whispered the doctor to the padre ; " his breath is regular and cool , and he is sleeping sweetly . Now , if you like , we will go to see the captain , and , if he consents , I will carry the child when he wakes to the dwelling . " The doctor carefully closed the door of the room as he and his companion stepped out into the open court-yard , and moved toward the spacious sheds beyond . CHAPTER XIII . A MANLY FANDANGO . " While feet and tongues like lightning go With  --  What cheer , Luke ? and how do , Joe ? Dick Laniard chooses Meg so spruce , And buxom Nell takes Kit Caboose . " " Now around they go , and around and around , With hop , skip , and jump , and frolicsome bound , Such sailing and gliding , Such sinking and sliding , Such lofty curvetting And grand pirouetting , Mix 'd with the tones of a dying man 's groans , Mix 'd with the rattling of dead men 's bones . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stars came timidly out one by one , and then in sparkling clusters the brilliant constellations illumined the blue heavens as the rosy twilight faded again away . Then the ripple of the inlet came with a tranquil musical sound upon the white pebbly beach , the lizards in the holes and crevices of the rocks began their plaintive wheetlings , the frogs and alligators joined in the chorus from the low lagoon in the distance , and the early night of the tropic had begun . But louder far than the hum of the insects and reptiles , and brighter than the lamps of heaven , arose the wild shouts and songs of the pirates carousing , where the torches and wax-lights lit up the scene of their orgies with the glare of day . The great mess-room was a blaze of light from candles and lamps , stuck in brackets or gilt sconces about the walls , or hanging awry in broken chandeliers from the lofty beams . The remains of their feast had been cleared away , and the tables were covered with bottles , cups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted coals . At one end of the room was a large table , on which was laid a black cloth with a broad silver border  --  sometimes used by the padre on great occasions  --  and covered with cards and piles of Mexican or Spanish dollars . At the other end was a raised platform , where four or five swarthy fellows with guitars in their hands were strumming away in the clear rattling harmony of Spanish boleros and dances , shrieking out at intervals snatches of songs in time to the music , or twirling the instruments around their heads in a frenzy of excitement . At the tables , too , were more of the excited band , vociferating with almost superhuman fluency in various languages their exploits , pausing occasionally amid the hubbub to clink their glasses together , and then chattering and yelling on as before . In the centre of the apartment were some half dozen of the same sort , either spinning around the floor in the waltz , or moving with a certain air of careless , manly grace one toward another in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sixty or seventy of these fellows in the room together , most of them above the middle height , with finely-developed muscles , broad shoulders , bushy whiskers , and flowing hair . They came apparently from all climes , from Africa to the Mexican Gulf , and their features and complexions partook of every imaginable type , from the light skin and florid complexion of the Swede , to the low brow , oval olive cheek of the Mediterranean , and the coal-black hue and flat nose of the Bight of Benin . Their dress was uniform  --  frock collars cut square and thrown well back over their ample chests ; their nether limbs incased in clean duck or brown linen trowsers , with silk sashes around their waists , and large gold rings in their ears . Mingled here and there in the moving throng , or leaning over the large table with the black cloth cover , were a few fellows in the uniform rig of the Guarda Costa , in navy jackets and black silk belchers around their throats ; but all were without weapons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy . Sentinels stood at the doors of the mess-room with drawn cutlasses over their shoulders , so that in case of a violent quarrel or row , in dance , drinking , or gaming , the culprits might be cared for . While the uproar was at its height , and the lofty tiled roof was ringing with the gay and ribald songs and shouts of the excited crowds , two persons appeared in the doorway at the middle of the room , and entered . In a moment , as the busy revelers beheld them , the dance ceased , the music of the guitars died away in a tinkling cadenca , the glasses stopped clinking , the dollars no longer chinked , and the songs and shouts were hushed . You might have heard a real drop for a minute , until one of the individuals who had entered slowly walked forward a few paces and threw his right hand aloft in salutation . Then burst forth a hoarse , simultaneous shout of " Viva nuestro amigo ! Viva el capitano ! " Captain Brand did not pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he stood calmly looking around upon the swarthy groups , who crowded about in circles at a respectful distance from him ; and then amid the silence he spoke up , in a frank , off-hand manner , " Well , my men , I am glad to see you all once more around me . You have not been so successful as I hoped , but we must take the good and ill luck as it comes , and I have no fault to find with you . The times , however , are bad enough ; for I have certain news that our retreat here , where we have so long been hid , may be discovered "  --  the villains around held their breath and let their cigars lie dead in their mouths  --  " but , " went on their commander , " I shall do all that is prudent in the circumstances for the benefit of all of us ; and when we leave here you will still have me for your leader , with my head , heart , and blade ever ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking another cheer arose : " Viva , nuestro amigo ! viva ! viva ! El ' Centipede ' y el capitano ! Hasta muerto ! Long live the captain ! We stand by you until death ! " " Thank you , my friends ; I have but one more word to say . The men who have the relief at the signal-stations and the water-battery must keep sober . Now go on again with the music . " The captain , however , did not immediately quit the hall , but , while the revel began once more with all its enthusiasm , he moved amid the crowd of its adherents and said a cheerful word to many . " Ah ! Pepe , your arm in a sling , eh ! a graze of a grape-shot , eh ? Why , Hans , you here ! nothing can hurt you ! Well , Monsieur Antoine , how well thou art looking ; and that pretty sweetheart of thine at St. Lucie ! Bah ! never look sad , man ; thou shalt see her again . What , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , across your jaw  --  a splinter , eh ? Never mind ; a little plaster and half allowance of grog will put you all right again . So good-night , my friends . Adios ! " Saying these words , all addressed to the individuals in their different languages , he gave a graceful wave of his hand and passed out of the building . As he rejoined his friend , the commander of the " Panchita , " who had waited at the threshold , while his wary glim of an eye searched the faces and read the thoughts of all the villains who clustered about the room  --  they both stepped out into the court-yard and sauntered pleasantly on toward the crag . They had not , however , proceeded many paces before they encountered the padre and the doctor . " Ah ! " exclaimed the captain , who was in advance , " how goes it with my doctor ? " shaking his hand as he spoke . " Oh , mi padre , how art thou ? " turning to Ricardo . " Salve ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the old rheumatism in my head . " " Drunk ! " said sententiously the doctor . Then again with a gay laugh to the other , " Well , my doctor , your first cruise has not been so pleasant in the ' Centipede ' as I hoped it might be , but the next may be more agreeable . " " Perhaps so , Captain Brand ; but I shall have a word or two with you on that subject to-morrow ; and , in the mean while , senor , I brought a little boy back with me who is ill from fever , and my quarters are so stifling hot , and the air from the lagoon is so bad , that I would like to stow him for a day or so , with your permission , in your quarters , where it is cooler . " " Certainly , doctor ; why not ? my house and all in it are at your service . By the way , I was about to ask you and the padre to dine with me and Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then let us move on , for dinner must be ready by this time , and it would be a sin to keep Babette waiting . " Excusing himself for a few minutes , the doctor went for his sick charge , and returned with him in his arms to the pirate 's dwelling . CHAPTER XIV . A PIRATES ' DINNER . " But the best of the joke was , the moment he spoke Those words which the party seemed almost to choke , As by mentioning Noah some spell had been broke , And , hearing the din from barrel and bin , Drew at once the conclusion that thieves had got in . " When the guests had assembled in the pirate 's saloon it was some minutes before their host appeared . When , however , he did step into the room from his private apartment adjoining , he was altogether a different man in outward appearance than in the early morning . In place of the loose sailor summer rig which he then wore , he was now attired as a gentleman of elegant fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limbs were clothed with flesh-colored silk stockings , and fitted into a pair of pointed toed pumps with buckles of brilliants that a duchess might have envied . A pair of white cassimere breeches , which set off to advantage his well-shaped leg , were tied in a dainty bow of rose-colored satin ribbon below the knee , and fitted him like a second skin . His waistcoat was of rose-colored watered silk , embroidered with silver , and which , with its flaps and ample proportions , was halfway hidden by a dress coat of green velvet . This last garment had a sort of navy cut , with standing collar richly laced with silver , gold buttons in a double row of the size of doubloons , with loose sleeves and cuffs heavily laced with silver also . His linen was of the most gossamer fineness , the collar thrown slightly back and confined by a single clasp of rubies the size of beans , while below was a frill of cambric ruffles sparkling with opal studs framed in diamonds . The ruffles , too , at his wrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal brilliants , and he was altogether a dandy of such princely magnificence that the courtiers of the days of the old French monarchy might have taken him for a study . His manner , likewise , was every way in keeping with his splendid attire ; and the ease and grace with which he excused himself to his guests for keeping them waiting certainly denoted a knowledge of a higher order of breeding and society than that in which his lot had been cast . Illustration From the very moment of his entrance , however , Don Ignacio had measured him at a glance . His single glittering eye of jet had taken him in from the laced collar of his coat to the buckles of his shoes . Not a jewel in his dress , from the flaming opals in his bosom to the brilliant stones at his wrists , and down to the sparkling clusters at his feet , did not his one uneasy optic drink in the flash and estimate the value . Nay , he calculated by instinct the weight of the gold buttons on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in snowy folds about his hands . Oh , a rare mathematician was Don Ignacio ! What greedy thoughts , too , passed through that little Spaniard 's brain ! " Ah ! " thought he , " shall I take my debt in those priceless gems , each one the ransom of a princess , which the old Captain General may one of these days reclaim ? Hola ! no ! Or shall I receive more negotiable commodities in gold , cochineal , or silks ? Well ! Veremos ! we shall see ! " The effect produced upon the good Padre Ricardo was altogether different . As the captain entered with all his glorious raiment upon him , he started back , and , bowing before him as if he were Saint Paul himself , he seized his superior 's white hand , and kissed it with fervent devotion . Not satisfied with this mark of respect , he raised his dingy paws , holding his crucifix before him , and murmured , in a sort of ecstasy , " Mi hico ! mi capitano ! que brillante ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brilliant being you are ! " Singularly in contrast , however , was the effect produced upon the doctor , who merely raised his dark eyes in an abstracted gaze , gave a careless and rather contemptuous nod of recognition , and then turned to examine one of the richly-inlaid cabinets which adorned the saloon . All these various phases of sympathy , attraction , or contempt flickered like a sunbeam into Captain Brand 's reflecting brain , as , with a delicately-perfumed handkerchief in one hand , and a gold-enameled and diamond-incrusted snuff-box in the other , he bowed gracefully to his visitors , and seated himself at table . The table was now rolled out into the centre of the saloon , laid with a snowy-white damask cloth , and covered with the equipage for a banquet . At either corner were noble branches of solid silver candelabra , which would have graced an altar , as perhaps they had , and holding clusters of wax-lights , which shed their rays over the display below . In the centre arose a huge epergne of silver , fashioned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of frosted silver , and about the trunk played a wilderness of monkeys . Beneath , around the board , were cut-glass decanters , flat bulbous flasks of colored Bohemian glass , crystal goblets , delicate and almost shadowy wine-cups from Venice , silver wine-coolers , all mingled in with a heterogeneous collection of rare china and silver dishes . Such wines , too , as filled those vessels ! not a prince or magnate in all the lands where the vine is planted could boast of so rare and exquisite a collection . Pure , thin , rain-water Madeira , full threescore years in bottle ! Pale , limpid Port , whose color had long since gone with age , and left only the musk-like odor ; flasks of Johannisberg of pearly light ; bottles of Tokay for lips of cardinals ; tall , slim stems of the taper flasks of the Rhine ; while the ruby hues of wine from the Rhone stood clustering about amid pyramids of pine-apples , oranges , and bananas , and all loading the air of the saloon with their delicious fragrance . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while the host was bailing out the soup from an enormous silver tureen with a tea-cup  --  for it did not appear that he had ever been presented in the usual way with a ladle  --  fishing out the floating morsels of rich callipee , with the delicate frills of his sleeves turned back , he began the conversation in the Castilian language : " Well , amigos , we are taking our last feast together , I fear , on this little cluster of rocks , for a long time to come . " " How ! " exclaimed the padre , as he stuffed a wedge of turtle fat in his oily mouth , and opened his round black eyes to their fullest extent in manifest surprise . " Como , mi hico ! " he repeated , as he passed a dirty paw over his smooth chin , and looked inquiringly . " Yes , holy father , our good friend Don Ignacio here has brought us somewhat startling intelligence . Capital soup , this . I shall give Babette a dollar . Yes , the eagles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleet ; the Lord only knows how many ships , and brigs , and gun-boats . Glass of Madeira with you , doctor ? " wiping his thin lips with a corner of the damask table-cloth as he spoke ; " and they have tampered , too , with my old friends the custom-house people . Take away the tureen , Babette  --  and , in point of fact , I should n't be the least surprised to see a swarm of those navy gentlemen off the reef here at any moment . A sharp knife , Babette , for these teal  --  a duck should be cut , not torn . Try that Moselle , Don Ignacio ; I know your fancy for light wines . This was given me by a Captain  --  ' pon my soul , I forget his name ; he had such a pretty wife , Madame Matilde , " glancing at the frame of miniatures on the wall ; " sweet creature she was ; took quite a fancy for me , I believe , and might have been sitting here at this moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , it makes no difference : the wine is called Moselle . " Now be it here observed that Don Ignacio drank very little wine or stimulants of any sort , and never by any chance a drop from any vessel which , with his single bright eye , he did not see his host first indulge in . This self-imposed sacrifice may have been owing to his diffidence , or modesty , or deference to Captain Brand , or , perhaps , other and private reasons of his own ; but yet he never broke through that rule of politeness and abstemiousness . Sometimes , indeed , he carried his principles so far as to refuse a meat or the fruits which his host had not partaken of , and always with a slow shake of his brown fore finger , as if he did not like even to smell the dish presented to him . " What ! not even a sip of that nectar , compadre mio ? " The compadre shook his digit , and observed that drinking nectar sometimes made people sick . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning to drink does the harm , and not the art , when properly acquired . " During all the foregoing interlude the doctor remained in his grave , calm humor , and only when the captain alluded to the lady whose husband 's name escaped him did he show signs of interest . Then his eye followed the look toward the miniature , and his jaws came together with a slight grating spasm . Padre Ricardo , however , was in excellent sympathetic spirits , eating and drinking like a glutton of all within his reach , and turning his full eyes at times , as if to a deity , upon his friend the captain . Once he spoke  --  " But , my son , you were talking of leaving this quiet retreat , where we have passed so many happy hours . " " Yes , friend of my soul ! Those fellows with commissions , and pennants at their mast-heads , and guns , and what not , seem determined to do us a mischief . " The devout padre crossed himself , and pressed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would no doubt arraign us before some one of their legal tribunals . Put us in prison , perhaps ; or maybe give us a slight squeeze in a rope or iron collar ! " The padre groaned audibly , and dropped the wing of a teal he was gnawing , forgetting , strange as it may seem , to cross himself . " Hola , mi padre ! cheer up ! We are worth a million of dead men yet . The world is wide , the sea open , and with a stout plank under our feet and one of these fellows "  --  here he balanced a long carving-knife , dripping with blood-red gravy , in his hand  --  " in our belts , who can stop us ? " There was the cold , ferocious-eyed gleam of a dying shark in the speaker 's eyes as he went on with his carving ; but the priest gave a jerk of trepidation with his chin , and appeared anxious to hear more . " Don Ignacio , try a bit of this roast guana ; it 's quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of that rabbit stew ! " The one-eyed individual was likewise helped to some of that savory ragout , and proceeded to pick the bones with much care and deliberation . " Still triste , my padre ! Come , come , this will never do . Join me in a bumper of this generous old Port . Bueno ! may we attain the same age ! By the way , where did this rich stuff come from ? " holding up the decanter between the light and his face as he spoke . Don Ignacio 's glittering optic pierced clear through the light ruby medium of the wine , cut-glass decanter and all , as he furtively watched his host , and was prepared to dodge in case the heavy vessel should slip out of the captain 's hand . Such things had happened , and might again ; besides , a hard flint substance with a multitude of sharp projections , two or three inches thick and five or six pounds in weight , falling from a height on a man 's head , might kill him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his sleeve with his hand under the table . But Captain Brand , it seemed , had no intention of smashing his elegant dinner set of glass , and putting down the decanter and raising a finger to his forehead , he said , " How did that wine come into my possession ? " " Somebody gave it to you , perhaps . Quien sabe ? ( Who knows ? ) " suggested Don Ignacio . Without heeding the interruption , the captain 's eye rested on the brilliant snuff-box on the table beside him , where the letter L was set in diamonds and blue enamel on the back , and catching it with a rap , his face lighted up , and as he took a pinch and passed the box to the padre , he exclaimed , " Ah ! now I remember , my old friend  --  the Portuguese countess from Oporto . Dios ! de mi alma ! ( God of my soul ! ) what a stately beauty was her daughter ! " Here Captain Brand sneezed , and , drawing a delicately-perfumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile the box went round the table ; Padre Ricardo took a huge pinch with his dirty fingers , and feasted his eyes upon the precious lid . The doctor scarcely gave the elegant bawble a glance as he helped himself . The Don , however , examined it with the eye of a connoisseur , and not only that , but he threw a spark at the captain 's flashy waistcoat , and thought he detected some other article in the capacious pockets vice the handkerchief . Perhaps he may have been mistaken and perhaps not , though he was so very suspicious an old villain that he sometimes did his friends injustice . Nor did he put his thin brown fingers , with the few grains of snuff he had dipped from the box , to his sheepskin nostrils till he had watched the effect it had produced on those around him . " Ah ! my friends , I remember distinctly now all about it , " continued the captain , as he returned the kerchief and shook a few specks of the titillating dust from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just before you came to live with me , padre , that we fell in with a large ship bound to Porto Rico . She had been disabled in an awful hurricane , which had taken two of her masts clean off at the decks , and was leaking badly . We , too , had been a little hurt in the same gale , and having made a pretty good season , I was anxious to get back here and give the crews a rest . Well , we made out the ship about an hour before sunset , and it was quite dark before we came up with her . There she lay , rolling like a log , though there was not much sea on , and we could hear her chain-pumps clanking , and saw the water spouting out from her scuppers as pure almost as it went into her hold . As we came up alongside they hailed me for assistance , and said the ship was sinking , and could not live till morning . " Of course I could give them no actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrator smiled as he glanced round upon his guests  --  " it would have been simply absurd , you know , the idea of my putting men on board to keep her afloat for the nearest gibbet . Bah ! I did not dream of such ridiculous nonsense . However , I determined to make her a visit , and , if there should be any thing to save from the wreck in an undamaged condition , why , I should look around . " Not too much of that Port , mi padre ; think of your rheumatism in the morning ! Doctor , you do n't drink ! " Well , going on board , I found two lady passengers  --  the wife and daughter of an old judge of the island of Porto Rico , with half a dozen servants , who were all screaming , and praying , and beseeching me to save them  --  all but one , a tall , graceful girl , with a large India shawl wrapped around her shoulders , her white arms glancing through the folds , and a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never before seen . The fact is , my friends , I had always before fancied blue . But there stood this girl , with eyes like a wounded stag , leaning up against the weather bulwarks near the open cabin door . " Babette , take away all but the wine and fruit , and bring fire . Pass that box this way , if you please , compadre ! Thank you . " Don Ignacio seemed to have an affection for the trifle , and had counted the brilliants over and over again , and made a mental calculation of their weight and value ; and when he did move it as he was desired , his greedy eye followed it with fascination . " Yes , it 's very pretty , and I set a great store by it , " parenthesized the host , as he resumed his tale : " The girl never screamed or even spoke , and , amid all the hubbub of a drunken skipper and a disorderly crew , she remained quiet and unmoved . To assure the people , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what I could for them . At this the old lady clasped me around the neck , and kissed me , and blubbered over me more than ever she did , I imagined , to the old Spanish judge , her husband  --  imploring me too , by all the saints she could think of , to take herself and daughter out of the sinking vessel at once . You may believe that I would much rather have been treated in that way by the lovely girl with the wonderful eyes instead of the fat , rancid old woman beside her ; but there was no help for it just then , and so I consented , with all the professions of sympathy I could make , to do as she desired . " Here the captain lit a pure Havana , and , after a few puffs and a sip of Port , continued : CHAPTER XV . DROWNING A MOTHER TO MURDER A DAUGHTER . " At last she startled up , And gazed on the vacant air With a look of awe , as if she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I assured the old lady that I would transfer them to my vessel than her daughter made a step forward , and , letting her shawl fall upon the deck , she seized my hand with both of hers , and said , in a low contralto voice , " ' Heaven bless you , senor ! ' " By the cestus of Venus , caballeros , the pressure of that girl 's hand , and the deep , speaking look of gratitude she gave me out of her liquid eyes , quite did my business ! " " And the senorita 's too , I think , " chimed in the one-eyed commander , as he wagged his uneasy head at the narrator . " Quien sabe ? " ( who knows ? ) went on Captain Brand : " at all events , I raised her soft patrician hand to my lips and kissed it respectfully . Ha ! I noticed , too , as I released her round , slender fingers , that she wore a sapphire of great brilliancy  --  ay , here it is now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saying this , the host shook back the lace ruffles of his sleeve , and , crooking his little finger , exhibited the jewel to his guests . " Go on , my son , " said the padre , as his sensual face expressed his satisfaction at the recital  --  " Vamonos ! " " My holy father , " responded the narrator , " beware of that wine-flask ! You have grand mass to-morrow ! it is the feast of our patron saint , you know . " " Si ! si ! hijo mio ! your padre is always ready , " crossing himself in a half tipsy way as he spoke  --  " Vamonos ! " The doctor looked as cold as marble , and said not a word . " Well , gentlemen , " went on Captain Brand , " I soon got that ship in a tolerably wholesome state of command . I made my trusty old boatswain , Pedillo , lock the fuddled skipper up sound and tight in his own stateroom , and the rest of my men took a few ropes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they went to work at the pumps with renewed vigor . I also insisted upon the scared male servants of the passengers lending a hand at that innocent recreation , for you see I had no intention of letting the ship go down  --  " " With the Capitano Brand in her , " interrupted Senor Sanchez . " No , by no manner of means ; for the ship , I felt , was settling fast , and I could hear the loose cargo , which had broken adrift below in the main hold , playing the devil 's own game ; smashing and crushing from side to side as the vessel rolled , and coming in contact with the stanchions and beams , with a surging swash of water , too , which told the tale without the trouble of breaking open the hatches . I took , however , the precaution to run my eye over the manifest to see if , perchance , there was any treasure in the after run or any where else , as , in case there had been , I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , there was nothing on board but wine , dried fruits , and heavy bale goods , not worth the time or trouble , in the aspect of affairs at that time , to save as much as a single cask or a drum of prunes . I glanced , too , at the clearance list , and saw that the names of the passengers were La Senora Luisa Lavarona , and the Senorita Lucia , lady and daughter , with half a dozen orders and titles , of the judge in Puerto Rico . Bueno ! roll me an orange , if you please , doctor ! Ah ! gracias , thanks . " The doctor rolled the orange , and , had it been a grape-shot or any other iron missile , its aim would have gone straight through the captain 's body , just above his left waistcoat pocket . " In the mean while the old lady rushed around in a tremendous hurry , in and out of the cabin , losing her balance occasionally in the lurches , ordering her maids to pull out trunks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hug to relieve her feelings , and praying and crying between whiles in the most whimsical manner . Not contented either with getting out a pile of luggage and chests that would have swamped a jolly-boat , she insisted upon waiting until a locker was broken open in the cabin pantry for the purpose of rescuing six cases of old Port wine , which had been , she told me , sent as a present from the Archbishop of Lisbon to his friend the judge . At this juncture I persuaded her to send her daughter and a few light articles first on board my vessel , when the boat would then return for herself and the remainder of their property . Accordingly , I carefully wrapped the lovely girl in shawls and cloaks , and got her over the side and down into my boat , pitched a few light caskets and cases in after the young beauty , and then , with a quiet word or two into Pedillo 's sharp ear , the boat shoved off . I suppose it may have been half an hour before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coxswain that he had shown his charge down into my private cabin , and she appeared as comfortable and resigned as possible . Well , we made quick work of it now , tumbled a good many things into the boat , when I myself got in to receive the old lady and her retinue . By the way , among the articles were the boxes of wine  --  this is some of it "  --  tapping the decanter , now nearly empty from the attacks of the priest  --  " and in my opinion it does great credit to the taste and judgment of that venerable archbishop . " " Ave , purissima ! " said the padre , with a hiccough ; " I shall be a bishop myself one of these days . Ora pro nobis ! " " You 'll be a cardinal , " gibed in the doctor , " if swilling wine will do it . " Captain Brand went on with his narrative : " Where was I ? Oh ! ah ! We were waiting alongside the ship , with her lower chain-plates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hoisted over the rail , since she would not permit any of her attendants to precede her  --  though Heaven knows they were anxious enough to do so . By this time , too , after my men had left the deck of the ship , the crew had somehow got hold of a barrel of wine , and , letting the pumps work themselves , were guzzling away in grand style . I began to lose patience at last , and shouted to the old lady to come at once , or I should be compelled to leave her . She merely leaned over the rail , however , and chattered forth that all she had in the world was at my service  --  of course , figuratively she meant  --  but she must stay another minute to find a jar of preserved ginger , which was her only cure for the cholic . " " You did n't take the offer of the old lady as a figure of speech , I presume ? " asked the doctor . " No ! " muttered the one-eyed old wretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ginger spared her any more attacks of cholic ! " " Caballeros , you are both right . I did accept the gift of her worldly goods in the frank spirit in which it was offered , without any reservation ; and , to my almost certain knowledge , the Senora Lavarona was never more troubled with illness of any kind . " The fact was , that , finding the ship fast sinking , and her crew becoming boisterous and rebellious as the imminent danger burst upon them , they proposed , since their own boats were stove , to take possession of mine ! That was a joke , to be sure ! A dozen drunken swabs , with naked hands , to capture ten of the old ' Centipede 's ' picked men , with a pistol and knife each under their shirts ; and "  --  here the speaker laughed heartily  --  " and Captain Brand beside them ! Diavolo ! what silly people there are in this world ! " The good padre joined his superior in this ebullition of feeling , and seemed to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from side to side , kissing his crucifix , and exclaiming , with devotion , " Que hombre es eso ! "  --  " What a man he is ! " Illustration : THE PIRATE 'S PREY . " Well , senores , the next minute we let go the painter and floated astern past the ship 's counter , and a few strokes of the oar-blades sent us dancing away to leeward , where the schooner was lying with her main-sail up , and the jib-sheet hauled well to windward . We made no unnecessary noise in getting alongside , and it took no great time to get the boat clear , a tackle hooked on , and to swing her on board over the long gun . Then we drew aft the sheets , set the fore-sail , and the ' Centipede ' was once more reeling off the knots on her course . " " But the ship , my son ? " " Why , my padre , I was so busy attending to the schooner , and afterward going below to break the sad news to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I had no time to devote to the ship . Pedillo , however , told me that he heard a good deal of frantic shrieking , and prayers , and cursing , with , for a little while , the renewed clank of the chain-pumps , but after that we had got too far to windward to hear more . About midnight , though , Pedillo and some of the watch thought they saw a white shower of foam like a breaking wave , and a great commotion in the water , but that was all . So , you see , what really became of that old craft we do not positively know ; though for a long time afterward I read the marine lists very attentively , yet I never saw any accounts of her arrival at her destination . " Perhaps , " added Captain Brand , with a peculiar smile , as he lit a fresh cigar , " her arrival may have escaped my notice , as I hope it may , though I think not . " Don Ignacio intimated , by waving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope had no possible foundation in fact ; and he stated , too , that he knew the underwriters had paid the full insurance on the missing ship . " Ah ! well , that seems to settle the matter , truly , " murmured the captain , as if he had long entertained painful doubts on the subject , and now his mind was finally relieved . " But , hico mio ! Son of mine ! La Senorita  --  hiccough  --  with the almond-shaped eyes  --  Santissima !  --  hic  --  how did she bear the  --  death of her  --  hic  --  mother ? " " Por Dios , padre ! there was a scene which would have drawn tears from a  --  " " Pirate , " suggested the doctor . The padre blubbered outright , and his round , tipsy eyes nearly popped out of his head . " Ay , monsieur , even from mine ! But to go back a little . When I had got all snug on board the schooner , I went below , and moved softly on tiptoe along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You remember , amigo , " said the narrator , turning toward Don Ignacio , " how that cabin was fitted , and how much it cost to do it . I think you paid the bill for me ? No ? " Oh yes , Captain Brand was quite right . Don Ignacio remembered it well , and the bill was a thousand gold ounces , sixteen thousand hard silver dollars ; and by no means dear at that , for the Don never allowed any body to cheat him . " Cheats himself , though , sometimes . Do n't charge more than the usual commission . " The one-eyed usurer looked wicked at this remark , but he said nothing , being occupied at the moment rolling up a paper cigar with one hand , and wetting the brown fore finger of the other . " Well , caballeros , I peeped through the lattice-work of the cabin door , and there reclined my pretty prize  --  I recall her as if it were yesterday  --  on one of the large blue satin damask lounges of the after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivory arms , half hidden in the luxurious pillows ; her shawl , too , was thrown back ; and with a somewhat disordered dress , and a mass of glossy hair clustering in ringlets about her neck and white shoulders , I thought then , as I do now , that she was a paragon of loveliness . I saw her , as she thus reclined , by the light of a large shaded crystal lamp , which hung by silver chains from the cabin beams , and shed a rose-tinted effulgence over the whole apartment . When I first approached the door the girl was looking out of her own large liquid lamps , so superbly framed in a heavy fringe of dark lashes , in evident curiosity around the elegant cabin . Her looks wandered from the Turkey carpet on the floor to the beautiful silk hangings , that exquisite set of inlaid pearl ebony furniture , the display of knickknacks , and Dresden porcelain panels of the sides , and , in fact , nothing seemed to escape her ; and the good taste of the fittings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would turn her gaze out of the narrow little window of the stern , and peer anxiously over the vessel 's wake , which by this time was skimming along like a wild duck , and leaving countless bubbles behind her . At the first sound I made , however , in opening the door , she started up and stepped forward to meet me . " ' Oh , Senor Capitano , mi madre ! ( My mother ! ) What detains her ? We seem to be going very fast through the water ! ' " I gently took the girl 's outstretched hands and led her back to the cushioned transom . Then I told her , as kindly as I could , that I did all in my power to save her good mother , but that the crew had mutinied  --  they had taken possession of the unfortunate ship  --  great confusion existed  --  and as I feared , you know , that my own boat would be swamped by remaining longer alongside , I was compelled to leave her to her fate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , with anguish ; ' she was saved ? ' " ' No , senorita , ' I said , ' she went down with the ship ; but the last words she uttered  --  that is to me  --  were to invoke a blessing on my head , and to consign all she possessed to my care . ' The poor thing swooned away as I uttered these words , and it was a long time before she came to again . When she did , however , regain consciousness , tears came to her relief , and I did all I could to soothe her distress by telling her that , if the wind came fair , she would in the course of a few days be restored to her father . " " But the wind did n't come fair , eh ? " broke in Don Ignacio , " and she did n't see  --  " " No , amigo , the wind held steady from the opposite quarter , and I thought it better not to beat up with a fished fore-mast , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . " Captain Brand here wet his thin lips with a few sips of wine , said , " Babette , bring coffee ! " and resumed his story . " When the girl became a little more calm I induced her to retire to my stateroom , where I left her to sob herself to sleep . Do n't spill that coffee , Babette , and put the liqueurs on the table . There , that will do , old lady . " Well , senores , the next morning my pretty prize was too ill to leave her room ; but , as I handed her a cup of chocolate through the door curtains , she thanked me with much gratitude for what I had done , and knew that her dear father , the judge , would bless me . " " So he will , " snarled the one-eyed old rascal , " if he ever catches you , when he draws the black cap over your head . " " Possibly he may , though perhaps it will be some considerable time before he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Take care of yourself , my son , " hiccoughed the priest as he crossed himself . The captain gave a light laugh , sipped his coffee , and went on as if a dungeon , scaffold , and noose were the last things he ever thought of . " I amused myself during the day in looking over the trunks , caskets , and what not we had saved from the sinking trader  --  presented to me , as you know , by the old lady who was on board . There were , of course , a great quantity of ladies ' dresses , and a good many jewels and trinkets ; among the latter this fine snuff-box here , which our friend Don Ignacio so much admires , and which I set aside as an especial testimonial of the old lady 's regard . Try another pinch , amigo ? No ? Bueno ! I caused what I believed to be the daughter 's elegant raiment to be placed in the after cabin . For three days I never even saw my pretty passenger , though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out something for her to eat in the adjoining cabin . She sang , too , some little sad songs with a voice which vibrated upon my ear like the notes of an Aeolian harp sighing in the night wind . Dios ! how I regretted then and afterward that I did not have a cabinet piano ! " " Presented to you , " suggested the doctor . " Yes , presented to me , so that she might have touched the keys with those ivory and rose-tipped fingers . " So the time passed , the schooner flying on under whole sails , the wind about two points free , and the weather as fine as silk . It was the fourth evening , I think , after parting with the Oporto trader that I induced my fair passenger to come on deck and take a little breath of sea-air . You will observe , caballeros , that I did not make this suggestion in the daytime , because the ' Centipede 's ' crew , you know , were rather numerous , and some of them not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times care to behold . Besides , there were certain things about the decks  --  racks of cutlasses , lockers of musketry along the rail , and a long brass twelve-pounder , which is not altogether hidden by the boat , you know , and might have given rise to a little curiosity , or maybe suspicion , even in the mind of a girl , as to our character , pursuits , and so forth , which I should have been puzzled to answer . Therefore I chose a clear starlight night to pay my homage , and accordingly I went below about four bells of the first watch to escort the little lady to the deck . She was dressed , and waiting for me in the cabin ; and if I was so struck with her beauty when I first saw her , my heart thumped now against my ribs like a volley of musket-balls against an oak plank . She wore a black silk robe , such as Spanish women wear at early mass , and around the back part of her head  --  where the hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gold bodkin  --  fell the heavy folds of a black lace mantilla , the lower end fastened sash fashion around her lithe waist . She stepped , too , like a queen on a pair of slim , long , delicate feet , with arched ball and instep , as if she were in command of the schooner . " By my right arm ! " exclaimed Captain Brand , shaking that member aloft in a glorious fit of enthusiasm , " I am quite sure she had conquered me , and that was more than half the battle ! " Well , I led her to the quarter-deck , where some cushions and flags had been placed for her near the weather taffrail , and where she sat down . The schooner was at the time under the two gaff-top-sails , the main boom and sheets eased off a little , those long masts , with the sticks above them running clear away up the sky , almost out of sight , bending like whalebone , and reeling over the long swell when the breeze freshened ; and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light creak from the main boom as the broad white sail strained flat and taut over to leeward , or the rush of the water as it came hissing along from her sharp , clean bows , with a noise like a breeze through the leaves of a forest , away off over the counter into luminous sparkles as it swished out into our wake . The ' Centipede ' was indeed doing her best , and you all know what that is , when we have been chased many and many a time by some of the fastest cruisers going . " You remember , Don Ignacio , how the ' Juno ' frigate nearly ran us under , and yet never gained a fathom on us in nine hours ? " " Ay , amigo ; but , had she not carried away her fore-top-mast , in another hour there would have been nothing left of you afloat but a  --  hencoop perhaps . " " Quien sabe , compadre ? If hads had been shads you would have had fish for your breakfast , " rejoined the narrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet coat with an air of gentlemanly satisfaction , he hooked his thumbs in the arm-holes of his fine waistcoat , and went on . " Well , senores , the graceful girl beside me never spoke scarcely for half an hour . I divined , however , what her thoughts might have been in dwelling on the painful scenes she had recently witnessed , and I held my peace also ; for , you see , I have had considerable experience with women , and I have ever found that a man loses more by talking than by remaining watchful and attentive . " Captain Brand looked , as he gave utterance to this philosophical sentiment , as if he were a thirsty , cold-eyed tiger , lying in wait to spring upon an unwary passer-by . " Yes , I waited , until at last she spoke . " ' Capitano , ' she said , ' what a beautiful vessel you command , and how fast she sails ! ' " What I replied , my friends , is neither here nor there ; but I sank down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a torrent of passionate words  --  which I really felt , too , at the time  --  as I do n't think I ever uttered before or since . She was a little startled and nervous at first , but after a while I saw her stately head droop to one side till it rested on my shoulder ; I stole my arm around her yielding waist and clasped her to my breast . " Here Captain Brand looked as if the tiger had already sprung upon the passer-by , and was sucking the blood , with his claws buried deep into the carcass . " ' Senor , ' she murmured , in the low , sweet , plaintive note of a nightingale , ' I am a young and inexperienced girl , of an old and noble family ; you have saved my life ; my mother is gone , and I have no one to advise with , and , if my dear father smiles upon my choice , I will marry you ; but do not , I implore you , deceive me ! ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " broke in the doctor , with a shiver of light from his determined eyes that was almost painful to see , so earnest and terrible it was , as he leaned forward with both of his clenched hands quivering nervously on the table . Captain Brand looked at the doctor with rather a suspicious stare , and letting his thumbs drop from his armpits till they rested on the flaps of his waistcoat pockets , he replied , in a careless tone , " Oh no , monsieur , I never deceived  --  a  --  that is to say , intentionally deceived a woman in all my life ! " " Let us hear more , my son , " said the priest , thickly , who had now woke up from a short nap . " Bueno , caballeros ! " continued the narrator , as he tossed off a thimbleful of maraschino from a wicker-bound square bottle after his coffee . " Well , gentlemen , the young Portuguese damsel , Senorita Lucia , and I sat there under the weather rail till the first faint streaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming of the gray morning . Then she arose , and , leaning with a soft pressure on my arm , I took her to her cabin , kissed her sweet hands , and bade her good-night . " At this stage of the narrative Captain Brand threw himself triumphantly back in his large Manilla chair , and ran his white muscular hands through his dry light hair . Ay ! the tiger had clutched his prey . An unprotected , young , and lovely girl had been won and lost , and her palpitating heart was soon to be torn from her tender body . CHAPTER XVI . NUPTIALS OF THE GIRL WITH DARK EYES . " With a pint and a quarter of holy water He made the sacred sign , And he dashed the whole on the only daughter Of old Plantagenet 's line ! " " But the count he felt the nervous work No more than any polygamous Turk , Or bold piratical skipper , Who , during his buccaneering search , Would as soon engage a ' hand ' at church As a hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair , stepped to the settee , and , pulling the signal-cord on the wall , held a short dialogue with the man at the station ; then , saying in a low , sharp whisper through the tube , " A bright look-out , Pedro ! " he resumed his place at the table . The doctor had , in the mean while , got up and gone to the veranda , where , swinging in a Yucatan grass hammock , shielded from the night wind , lay his little patient sleeping soundly . Carefully closing the curtains again around him , he returned to his place . The padre was now all awake again , with his thick lips open , waiting for the captain to go on with his story . As for Don Ignacio , he never stirred body or limb , but his eye traveled about perpetually , and he observed the movements of his companions all at the same time . Still the hoarse roar of the pirates in their carouse arose from the covered sheds in the calm night , and the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twinkled above the basin of the inlet . " And now , amigos , " began again Captain Brand , after he had assured himself that all was going on as he could wish without , " I shall inform you of the sequel of my adventure with the Senorita Lucia . The evening after the night on which I had declared my passion , we were seated at dinner in the after cabin . Such a choice little dinner , too , as only our late friend , Lascar Joe , could prepare ! Poor fellow , he 'll never make another of those famous curries , though , no doubt , he 'll find fire and pepper enough where he is , if the devil chooses to employ him . What a neat hand he was , too , with that spiral-bladed Malay creese of his ! Ah ! well  --  we were sitting over the dessert , and I was relating to my pretty passenger some account of my early days , and of my lady mother and my old squire of a father , omitting , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander of the felucca cackled , and his black , beady eye glittered as the thought flashed through his head as to what details his villainous compeer had omitted . How he forged his old father 's name , which brought down his gray hairs in sorrow and disgrace to the grave ; and how his poor mother , too , died of grief , together with other bitter memories , all of which Captain Brand , the pirate , omitted to mention . " Yes , I related likewise some of my early privateering adventures , when all the broad Atlantic was alive with the fleets of France , England , and Spain ; how I was captured by a Spanish brigantine "  --  omitting again to state that he got up a mutiny with the crew of that brigantine , poniarded the captain and mate in their sleep , and , assuming command of the vessel , changed her colors for a black flag , and began his career as a pirate in the Caribbean Sea  --  " and how I escaped . To all this she listened with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosom swelling with sympathy as I proceeded , when suddenly the cabin door opened , and my ugly friend Pedillo put his head in , and gave me a warning nod . " ' What is it ? ' I said , rather sharply , to Pedillo ; ' and how dare you intrude inside my cabin ? ' I fear , too , that I came very near doing a mischief to my boatswain ; for I am rather impulsive at times , and by the merest accident I happened to have a small pistol in my pocket . " Don Ignacio twitched his sleeve , and looked as if he believed such accidents as pistols being found in the narrator 's pockets happened quite often . " ' Senor , ' said Pedillo , ' there are two sail standing out from the lee of Culebra Island , and one of them appears to be a large  --  ' " I stopped any farther particulars from the lips of my subordinate by a motion of my finger , and then , kissing the hands of the girl , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cabin and jumped on deck . " The schooner was now running down through the Virgin 's Passage between St. Thomas and Porto Rico , with a fine breeze on the quarter , and the sun was just sinking behind the last-named island . I snatched a spy-glass from the rail , and looked ahead . There , sure enough , was a sixteen-gun brig on the starboard tack heading across our track , and a large frigate under single-reefed top-sails stretching away over to the opposite shores of Culebra , while they were telegraphing bunting one with another as fast as the bright-colored flags could talk . And , as luck would have it , as I swept the glass round , what should I see but a long rakish corvette in company with a huge whale of a line-of-battle ship , with her double tier of ports glimmering away in the slanting rays of the sun , both on the wind , and coming out from under the lee of Culebra Point , just a mile or two astern of us . By the blood of Barabbas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the hounds were in full cry ! I immediately , however , luffed the schooner up , and steered boldly for the frigate ; and , as a puff of smoke spouted out from the lee bow of the admiral to windward , and before the boom of the gun 's report reached us , I hoisted American colors . Seeing this , the brig hove in stays , and , perhaps being ordered to board me , came staggering along on the other tack across our forefoot , while the frigate went round too , and held her wind toward her consorts to windward . Now this was just the disposition which I wanted of the vessels , and it could not have been done better for my plans had I been the admiral of the squadron . In less than a quarter of an hour , the brig  --  and no great things she was , with a contemptible battery , as I could see , of short carronades  --  hove aback a little on the bow of the schooner , and gave us a warning of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , at the same time hoisting the English ensign . " So ho ! " ejaculated Captain Brand , as he twisted the point of his nose , accompanied by a malevolent scowl , " senores , I at once hauled flat aft the fore-sail , dropped the main peak , and put the helm up , as if to round to under the brig 's stern ; whereupon my man-of-war friend dropped a cutter into the water , and she had just shoved off in readiness to board me , when , before you could light a paper cigar , I ran up the main peak , got a pull of the sheets , and the ' Centipede ' was off again like a shark with his fin above water , heading for the narrow passage between Culebra and Crab Islands . It was at least five minutes before that stupid brig could believe his eyes , and ten more before he got hold of the boat again , when she filled away and began to pop gun after gun at me as fast as he could bring his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skipped on board us , and that only smashed both legs of a negro , and then hopped off through the fore-sail to windward . " Had I not had a good dinner that day and pleasant society on board "  --  how peculiarly the speaker smiled  --  " I should perhaps have taught that brig such a lesson that he would not have cared to report it to his admiral . But as I knew I had the heels of him , and as the rest of the squadron were now crowding all sail and keeping off in chase of me , I ordered Pedillo , just by way of touching my hat and saying ' Adios , ' to clear away the long gun and return the brig 's salute . The shot struck him just forward the night-heads by the bowsprit , and by the way the splinters flew and his jib and head-sails came down , I knew I had crippled him for an hour at least . At the same time , to prevent any mistakes as to our quality , and to satisfy the admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set our swallow-tailed flag ! " " Rather dark bunting ! no ? " edged in Don Ignacio . " Ay , amigo ! as black as that eye of thine , though not half so murderous , " retorted the pirate as he continued his narrative . " Bueno , there came the whole of the squadron down after us , spitting out from their bridle ports mouthfuls of cold iron , which all went to the bottom of the Virgin 's Passage , for not one came within a mile of the schooner ; and then I led them such a dance through that intricate cluster of reefs and islets , that soon after dark they gave up the game , and I said ' Buenos noches ' to them all ! " Here Captain Brand paused , made a careful selection of a beautifully turned trabuco cigar from the box , shouted to Babette to produce some old Santa Cruz rum , sugar , lemons , and hot water  --  screeching hot , he said  --  at which the padre crossed himself ; and then throwing his fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chair beside him , and while his eyes gazed fondly on the brilliants sparkling in the buckles of his shoes , he resumed his tale . " When I went below again , after every thing had become quiet on deck , I found my stag-eyed sweetheart waiting to receive me ! How superbly she looked as she made a movement from the cushions where she had been reclining , and exclaimed , " ' Oh , senor , what has happened , and what was the cause of all that noise of guns , and those cries of agony I heard above ? ' " ' Querida Lucia , dearest , ' I replied , ' we have been where there are  --  a  --  pirates , but fortunately have escaped , and the cries you heard were from one of my poor crew who got slightly wounded by a shot ! ' " ' Ah , malditos piratos ! cursed pirates ! ' exclaimed the charming beauty , as she put both her hands in mine , ' and how thankful am I that you are not hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she went on , ' when shall we get to Porto Rico and our dear father ? We must be near , for I heard one of your sailors shout to you the name of the island ! ' " In reply , I told her that we had been near Porto Rico , but that  --  a  --  circumstances were such , on account of the dangerous pirates who infested those seas , that I felt obliged , for her safety  --  you understand  --  to run along by way of Hispaniola  --  she not having a very clear idea of the position and geography of those parts  --  and that our cruise might probably be prolonged for a few days more . " " And into h  --   --  , perhaps , " said the doctor , with a hollow voice and a calm cold eye . " Oh no , my friends , certainly nothing so bad as that . Possibly to heaven ! but , quien sabe ? no one can tell ! " However , " pursued the captain , " I soon succeeded in allaying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , and implored her to risk her father 's displeasure and to marry me at once ; that she knew her father was cold , stern , and obdurate , and should he frown upon my suit I should die of despair ! " " Cierto ! " murmured Ignacio , with the grin of a skeleton . " I used these passionate appeals and many more , until at last the fond girl yielded her consent to my entreaties . " ' But the priest , querido mio ! ' she exclaimed , as she rose and disengaged herself from my arms . I told her that I chanced to have one on board as a passenger , who would perform the ceremony . " And so I had , " added Captain Brand , " or at least a very near approach to one , for my ugly boatswain , Pedillo , had been bred up  --  as an acolyte  --  you comprehend  --  in the house of a rich old prelate of San Paulo Cathedral in Trinidad , to whom Pedillo , one fine morning , gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria ! " exclaimed Padre Ricardo , starting back with horror , and telling his beads . " Ay , mi padre ! Pedillo assassinated the holy father , and plundered his cash-box besides ; and so you see Pedillo was just the man I wanted . " Don Ignacio nodded his wicked old head through a cloud of cigar smoke as a sign of approval . " Accordingly , senores , the next day I made the trusty Pedillo cut off all the bushy beard about his ugly face , and had the crown of his head shaved besides  --  quite like that round , oily spot there on the top of good Ricardo 's poll  --  and then he rigged himself out in a clerical gown , to which the trunks of my bride 's old mother contributed , and , take my word for it , he was as proper and rascally a looking priest as could be found on the island of Cuba . He performed the ceremony , too , by way of practice , on Lascar Joe and the second cook beforehand , with as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benediction , as his old Trinidad uncle , the prelate , ever did . Well , that evening we were married . " " How many times has the capitano been married ? " grunted out Don Ignacio . " Why , let me reflect , " as he threw his cold , icy look at the frame of miniatures on the opposite wall . " You mean , compadre , how often the ceremony has been performed . Ah ! I think on eleven occasions . No , it was only ten . Madame Mathilde had two husbands living when I made love to her , and declined to take a third . But then , you know , I have an affectionate disposition , and I can not set my heart against the fascinations of the sex . " He gave vent to these moral sentiments as if he really meant them to be believed and generally adopted by his audience . " Well , that same evening I was married to the beautiful Senorita Lucia Lavarona , though I am sorry to say that Pedillo did not perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected of him , from his practice in the morning . He stammered a good deal , and when he raised the crucifix to the lips of the young girl , her innocent looks and maidenly majesty of deportment so struck my coadjutor with confusion that he let the crucifix fall to the deck at her dainty feet . This little incident caused me some displeasure ; but , reflecting that the poet tells us ' A tiger , ' t is said , will turn and flee From a maid in the pride of her purity , ' I said nothing to the abashed Pedillo as I gave him back the emblem ; but I favored him with a look , with my right hand in my pocket  --  this fashion . " Here the cold-blooded scoundrel dipped his thumb and fore finger into the flap of his waistcoat , while the commander of the " Guarda Costa " waved his brown digit before him , as if he knew what was there all the time . " Ah ! that restored my new-made priest to his senses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " However , " said Captain Brand , turning with lazy indifference toward Padre Ricardo , " ever after this I resolved not to take the risk of such another chance of failure , and this is the reason why I first sought your services . " " Gracias a Dios ! Thanks be to heaven , my son , that you found me ! " said the sacrilegious wretch , as he bowed to his superior and sipped a glass of rum punch . " Vamonos ! let us hear more . " " At the conclusion of our nuptials , while I held my sweet Lucia to my heart , and kissed her pale brow , and while tears of crystal drops , half in rapture and half in sorrow , dimmed her large , sparkling black eyes , she withdrew this royal sapphire from her slender finger , and gently placing the gem on mine  --  where you see it , amigos  --  she said , " ' My dear and only love , this is the talisman of my race . It has been for ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our hope and honor . Receive it , friend of my heart , and be the protector of the young girl who yielded up to you her very soul ! ' " The doctor started as if he had been stung by a scorpion ; but Captain Brand , heedless or inattentive to the movement , went on : " Yes , caballeros , those were her very words ; murmured , too , in her low contralto tones with a pure , lisping Castilian accent , as she laid her stately head on my shoulder . " Ay , those were rapturous moments ; and it was in some degree  --  yes , I may say in truth  --  entirely her own fault that they did not last . " Well , for some days  --  eight or ten , perhaps  --  with light baffling winds , we crept stealthily along the south side of St. Domingo ; but the weather was delightful , and the time passed on the wings of a zephyr . In the warm , soft evenings , with the moon or stars shedding their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the deck of the schooner , watching with girlish interest the white sails above her head , or singing to me the sweet little sequidillas of her native land . And again , starting up from my arms , she would peep over the counter , trace the foam as it flashed and bubbled in our wake , or point to the track of a dolphin as he leaped above the luminous waves and went like a bullet to windward . " I flatter myself , caballeros , that there have been periods in my career on the high seas , or on land , and may be again , for aught I know , " continued the elegant pirate , as he crossed his legs and threw back the lappels of his velvet coat , so as to expose the magnificence of his waistcoat , and the frills on his broad , muscular chest , " when men of high birth and breeding , and lovely women too of noble lineage , have not thought it beneath them to dine with or to receive the homage of  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  the narrator did not consider it unbecoming his cloth and profession to swear in a foreign language  --  " por Dios ! senores , I have known the time , too , when I have played whist with a French prince of the blood and two knights of the Golden Fleece . " " And you fleeced them ? No ? " muttered Don Ignacio , with an envious glimmer from his greedy eye , as if no one had a right to rob the community but himself . " And not only that , " continued the captain , rapidly , " but the daughter of an English peer of the realm once proposed to run away with me . Ho ! ho ! yes , she actually proposed to elope with me ; but as she was verging on fifty years , and only weighed fifty pounds , with never a pound in her pocket , I sighed my regrets . Ay , great compliment it was , but I declined the honor . You yourself , compadre , must remember how I was received by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obispo blessed me , the old general embraced me , and the beautiful marquesa , with the hour-glass waist , smiled on me . " " Cierto ! " That astute old Spaniard never forgot any thing , particularly a debt due to him ; and he remembered , moreover , to have heard that when the noble Mi Lord Inglez left the villa one dark night , a good deal of plate , jewels , doubloons , and other valuable property disappeared with him . Ay , the sly old fellow had a faint recollection as well of seeing a heavily-armed schooner running the gauntlet through the forts before daylight , and that she left a certain bag of gold ounces for him  --  Don Ignacio Sanchez  --  somewhere in a secret hole beneath a well-known rock inside the harbor . Oh , a wonderful memory for matters of this nature had our rapacious one-eyed acquaintance ! " Yes , " went on his partner in many a scene of pillage and crime , " I have every reason to know that I won the hearts , and purses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I met in refined society . But yet there have been occasions when the game has gone against me  --  " Don Ignacio 's tenacious memory came again into play , and he looked back to the time when he himself had cleaned his profuse friend out of all his gains at the card-table , even to the buttons off his coat ; but he gave no sign of remembrance of those days , and only blew a dense cloud of smoke from his thin yellow nostrils as the captain spoke . "  --  Though those occasions have not been of frequent recurrence . " The good Padre Ricardo at this juncture hoped that , by Saint Barnabas , luck might , in all time to come , befriend his son and patron ; croaking , too , with a goblet of punch to his unctuous lips , " Vamonos ! Tell us more of the adorable Dona Lucia ! " Captain Brand rapped his snuff-box , opened the diamond-crusted lid , took a dainty pinch , laid his cambric handkerchief over his kerseymere breeches , and resumed his narrative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one morning , the high mountains back of Port Guantamano were reported to me , I felt a presentiment that my dream of bliss was drawing to a close . Indeed , I might probably have remained at sea a week or two longer , but the men were getting a little impatient , and I thought it better to sacrifice my own pleasure to theirs . That day we caught a cracking breeze out of the Windward Passage , and toward midnight we came up with this little sandy island here . " The preparations for going into port excited the curiosity of my bride ; for , poor thing ! she believed we were bound into Porto Rico , and I had some trouble in inducing her to go below before we crossed the reef . Bueno ! the coast was clear , the signals were all right , and an hour later the schooner had her anchor down and sails furled pretty much in the spot where she now lies moored . " While , however , we were sweeping up the inlet , I sent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Babette , to have every thing prepared to receive her new mistress . Just then one of those terrible thunder-storms came up ; heavy masses of clouds obscured the sky , followed by such double-barrel shocks and intensely vivid lightning as is only beheld in the tropics preceding the equinox . The rain , too , came along in horizontal sheets , driven by a squall which burst in fury over the island , and it seemed to me that all the devils from hell were howling and shrieking in the air . " Shielded from the storm by a large boat-cloak , I carried my beautiful bride , with her face nestling on my breast , to the cove , and then I bore her into this fine saloon . " I shall never forget the sweet words she whispered , and the loving caresses she gave me on that little journey , even while the tempest almost dashed me to the ground , and the sharp flashes of lightning nearly blinded me . They were the last she ever lavished upon me . " No sigh escaped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; no sign of feeling for the ruin of a gentle girl whom he had betrayed to his piratical den of infamy and crime  --  whose dream of life was destroyed like a crushed rose-leaf , and all her hope gone from that moment . CHAPTER XVII . DOOM OF DONA LUCIA . " I went into the storm , And mocked the billows of the tossing sea ; I said to Fate , What wilt thou do to me ? I have not harmed a worm ! " Thy dim eyes tell a tale  --  A piteous tale of vigils ; and the trace Of bitter tears is on thy beauteous face ; Beauteous , and yet so pale ! " " Thus it ever is , caballeros , and ever will be , " went on Captain Brand , in rather a reflecting strain . " There is a point to begin and stop , and an end to joy as well as grief . We should , however , take the world as it comes and as it goes . I do , and so do you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Ignacio to attract his attention  --  " and , therefore , we should never look too far ahead , and live only for the present . " Indulging then in this train of thought , as I set down my lovely burden here , and the cloak fell from her shoulders , I was prepared for any thing which might happen . I wore a slightly different costume at the time than that she had been accustomed to see me in , as I always do when I think there might be a chance of a surprise or trap laid for us in entering the inlet . So , instead of fine linen and velvet , I had on a red flannel shirt , canvas trowsers , with a cutlass slung to my side , and a pair of pistols in my belt . I do n't think I appear handsome in that rig , but the fellows at my back somehow think it is becoming to me , especially when we are engaged in a hand-to-hand fight ! What say you , compadre ? " The Don said nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress was not a matter to which he devoted much attention . He thought , however , that sleeves should be cut loose for knives when the pockets were not too small for pistols ; but he uttered no word . " Bueno ! There I stood "  --  pointing to the corner of the room as he spoke  --  " drenched with rain , and there stood my tall and lovely wife ! " The saloon was brilliantly lighted ; a profusion of plants and flowers were clustered here , there , and every where , on cabinets and tables , in striking contrast to the display exhibited yonder in that armory , where pikes , muskets , and knives were gleaming through the open door . " Quick as the lightning which was piercing deep into the inmost crevices of the rocks and lighting up the crag without , Lucia 's dark eyes flashed around the apartment from floor to ceiling , from flower to blade , resting an instant on the frame of miniatures there  --  hers was not among the collection then ; it is the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knives on the table , or else , from the deadly look the doctor gave , he might have perhaps sprinkled the narrator 's heart 's blood on the floor . "  --  Until at last her gaze of terror rested on me ! No one , I fancy , can tell the power of Spanish girls , who has never seen them when the whole passion of their souls , either in love or hate , comes pouring in a black blaze of jet from their gleaming eyes . " Advancing a step toward me , with her white hands clasped together , she said , in a hurried , beseeching voice  --  and low as was the sound , I heard it distinctly during the crashing thunder which shook the rocks of the crag to their foundations  --  " ' Senor ! where am I ? My father ! Who  --  who  --  in the name of the Blessed Virgin , art thou ? ' " Again giving a look of the utmost horror around the room , she pressed her hands to her eyes , and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speak , senor ! For the love of our holy Savior , speak ! ' " I felt that the girl had saved me , by her own instinctive perception , a world of painful explanations , and I replied , " ' Lucia ! I divine that all farther concealments are useless ; you are in the haunt of the most noted pirate of these seas , and that man stands before you . ' " Caballeros ! " continued Captain Brand , " had my pretty prize swooned away , or fallen down in a fit , or gone into hysterics and torn her hair out by the roots , I should not have been greatly surprised ; but she did none of those things . On the contrary , she became as calm as marble  --  frightfully so , in fact  --  and pushing back the bands of her magnificent tresses from her pale forehead , she raised her round white arm aloft , with her slender fore finger quivering like the tongue of a viper in mid air , and then poured forth such a torrent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , senores , I am no coward , take me when you will ; but on this occasion I must honestly admit that I stood powerless before the gaze and gesture of that slight , delicately-formed woman . " ' Pirate  --  wretch  --  monster ! may the curses of hell be heaped upon thee ! Murderer  --  betrayer ! may thy heart be burned , and thy soul blasted forever ! ' " I need not pain you , senores , by reciting the cruel words that came hissing through her closed teeth , nor yet farther describe the terrible concentrated gaze of hate and fury which streamed from those gleaming eyes . Suffice it to say , that though often afterward I was treated in the same manner , yet , on the occasion alluded to , I cut short the interview by summoning Babette to see her mistress to her chamber , and then , glad to escape , I went out of the house and attended to the duties which required my presence . " The padre , with his flat lips half open , eagerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of his patron ; the doctor , calm , unmoved now , and thoughtful ; the one-eyed old rascal , still puffing his cigarettes and allowing no rest to his uneasy , suspicious optic , all sat listening , with each an interest peculiarly his own , to the fate of Dona Lucia . The narrator leisurely arose and held his hourly confab with the man at the signal-station , and then returning to his place , proceeded with his discourse : " I shall pass rapidly over , my friends , many little incidents of a rather unpleasant nature which occurred here , in this my rocky retreat , for some months after the interview which I have described . I tried every argument and persuasion I was master of to bring my proud bride to reason , but to all my entreaties she turned a cold and chilling stare of obdurate hate . Day by day the intensity of her detestation grew stronger and stronger , and seemed to have become a part of her nature . Yes ; the gentle , yielding girl I had won on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unbending as a rock , and my controlling power over her mind and love was gone . I left her entirely to herself for some weeks , until one day I thought her passion might have subsided , and once more , attired in a rich and splendid suit , I came in here , as she sat like a marble statue at table . She never looked up at my entrance , but her eyes shone like stars as she mechanically went through the forms of the dinner laid before her . " ' Lucia ! ' I said , gayly . No answer by word or look . ' Lucia ! querida mia ! ' I repeated , and , sinking on one knee beside her , attempted to take her hand . " By all the saints , senores , that came near  --  very near  --  being the last time that I ever should kneel to a woman ; for with a movement so sudden that I had barely time to leap aside , she snatched a long pointed carving-knife from the table and lunged full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artery , inflicting a slight wound . But she never turned round to see the extent of her effort , and again sat calm and rigid at the table . " This was my last visit save one . I had long before abandoned these comfortable quarters entirely , and occupied the rooms you do , mi padre , out there among the men . In fact , my stern young bride was in entire command of the island ; and even my good Babette here stood in such awe of her that she always crossed herself when called to approach her mistress . " Month by month matters went on in this way , until the rainy season had gone , and I was preparing for another cruise in the schooner ; but hour by hour the consuming passion which flamed in the veins of Lucia was doing its work . I sometimes beheld her standing out on the veranda , tall and stately as ever ; and when the moon was at the full , it threw its light upon her wan and sunken cheeks , and thin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an almost transparent statue of alabaster , with her dark eyes shining with an unearthly light , turned in one long tearless gaze upon the ledge and combing breakers to seaward . It was singular , too , the effect she produced even upon the horde of these brave fellows of mine , for no persuasion could induce a man of them to come within pistol-shot of that part of the house while she was thus keeping her nightly vigils . And as for Pedillo , he acquired such a superstitious dread of the girl he had married , and lived in such a state of abject terror , that I had serious thoughts of shooting him through the head to avoid the contaminating influence he exercised over his comrades . " Well , caballeros , late one Saturday night , while the men were carousing and drinking success to the coming cruise  --  we were to sail on the following Monday  --  and while I was returning from my usual stroll to the Tiger 's Trap to see the battery in order and the look-outs wide awake , I met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' What is it , old lady ? ' You know , amigos , that Babette never spoke a word in her life , but she made signs to let me know that I was wanted at the crag , and that there was no time to be lost . I quickened my pace , and , preceded by Babette , I once more darkened my own threshold . The curtains and hangings were all closely drawn in the saloon here , and it was dark as a tomb ; but there was a light burning yonder in the passage leading to the chamber , and I made my way to the door . " I shall never forget what I saw , though I should like to , as it comes to me sometimes in the night , or when I am left much alone by myself . " The pirate passed his hands over his eyes as if he saw something while he spoke , and then , letting his voice drop to an almost sepulchral pitch , he went on hurriedly : " I stood at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was drawn to the middle of the chamber to get the air through the narrow loopholed windows , with the gauze curtains falling square on all sides , lay Lucia . Her attenuated frame scarcely presented an uneven surface beneath the snowy sheet which covered it . Her superb hair was spread in great black masses on the pillow , and her pale marble face reposed there like an ivory picture in an ebony setting . Her eyes were wide open , large and luminous , and her thin delicate hands were clasped around a silver and pearl crucifix , which rested on her hollow breast . A single taper in a silver lamp threw a lurid , flickering ray about the room , and beside it was Babette on her knees quivering with terror , while from one of the loopholed windows a broad white band of moonlight streamed directly across the pillow and face of the dying girl . " Captain Brand 's face assumed a deathly pallor , and , with his icy blue eyes fixed on vacancy , and his voice sunk to a hoarse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the portals of the door , Lucia slowly raised her fore finger , and beckoned me to approach . I could no more have resisted the summons than if a chain cable to a frigate 's anchor had caught me in its iron coils , and was dragging me to the bottom of the sea . I moved to the foot of the bed . " ' Pirato ! ' came from her slightly-parted lips , in her old low and distinct tones . ' Pirato , behold your cruel work ! Destroyer of mother and child  --  of soul and body  --  may the curses of a dying woman and her unborn child haunt you by day and by night ! ' I was dumb , and my pulse stopped beating . " ' Ave Maria purissima ! ' were the last words that came in a sweet , pure whisper from her parted lips ; she clasped the crucifix tighter , and the spirit departed . I tore aside the gauze net to lay my hand on her heart , when , on my soul ! her right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rising to a vertical line , with the fore finger pointing upward , quivered in the light of the waning moon , like , as it was , a supernatural warning ! Yes , that finger  --  " Illustration : " A SUPERNATURAL WARNING ! YES , THAT FINGER  --  " " Mamma ! mamma ! " came in a weak , plaintive voice from the piazza , while the villain , with his hands before him as if to shut out a frightful vision , and eyeballs starting from their sockets , was hoarsely whispering to his horror-stricken audience the last warning of the dead Lucia . As the low moaning cry in the stillness which reigned around the saloon struck his ear , he sprang with a bound to his feet , and , quick as thought , with a pistol in each hand , he shouted , " Who 's there ? " " It is the little sick boy , senor . Do him no harm at your peril ! " and the doctor stood towering before the pirate 's leveled weapons . " Maldito on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quieting down , and returning the pistols to his pockets . " How nervous I am ! Excuse me , caballeros . I was thinking of something else . " CHAPTER XVIII . END OF THE BANQUET . " There was turning of keys , and creaking of locks , As he stalked away with his iron box . Oh , ho ! oh , ho ! The cock doth crow , It is time for the fisher to rise and go . Fair luck to the abbot , fair luck to the shrine ! He hath gnawed in twain my choicest line ; Let him swim to the north , let him swim to the south , The pirate will carry my hook in his mouth . " In the pause which followed the dreadful episode just recounted by Captain Brand , the padre was occupied in pattering a prayer , counting his beads , and elevating his crucifix as if he was mumbling high mass at the altar . Don Ignacio slowly waved his brown fore finger , and his single spark of glowing eye glared fiercely and fixedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pallid brow of the doctor , and his hands were clutched before him on the table like the jaws of a steel vice . And still the drunken shrieks and cheers of the piratical crew at the sheds arose wild and shrill in the calm night , making a gloomy echo for the banquet . The doctor was the first to break the awkward silence which pervaded the saloon . " Capitano ! " said he , in his habitual calm , deep voice , " with respect to what you said in the early part of the evening , of breaking up this establishment , what , may I ask , are your plans for the future ? " " Gracias ! amigo doctor ! Thank you , my friend , for changing the conversation . My plans ! eh ! ah ! Well , they are these  --  " Here Captain Brand 's face assumed its usual expression ; and entirely himself again , he went on to state , in a precise , business-like way , the views he had resolved upon for future action . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellows out there , after mass , will need rest all the day . On Monday , however , I shall begin to change the rig of the schooner , fill up with provisions for a long cruise , take on board all the loose odds and ends we have stowed here , of course , " he added , as he remarked an inquiring and a rather alarmed mercenary look from the Tuerto 's glim  --  " of course , after having squared up all claims of our compadre there ! " " Hum ! " croaked that sharp rascal , with a nod of satisfaction quite like an old raven . " Then , senores , I shall burn or destroy the old sheds , and bury the cannon and heavy articles we can not find room for in the ' Centipede ; ' when , if nothing happens , we shall trip anchor and spread our sails for sea ! " Babette ! Babette ! Really I believe that dear old negress has fallen asleep . Babette ! ah ! there you are , my beauty ! See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gumbo before we break up here ! " Babette had not been asleep . Oh no ! She had her ear to the door of the saloon , and was listening to the sad history of Dona Lucia , and when her master came to the final scene the old woman fell on her knees and shivered all over , where she remained until the sound of the captain 's voice again called her to her duties . " And when we have left these quiet waters , my son ! " broke in the padre , " what then ? " The fact was , that the carnivorous and vinous Father Ricardo knew that his stomach was not suited for high winds and rough oceans , and was hoping that some scheme might be devised to allow him to remain tranquilly on the island . " Why , holy padre , I propose to steer clear of the West Indies by some unfrequented track , and , striking the broad Atlantic , stretch down the coast of Brazil . Perhaps we may double Cape Horn , and see what those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then maybe across the Pacific , to the lovely islands and maidens of Polynesia ; so on to the China Seas , where we may fall in with an outward-bound Canton trader , or a galleon with a ton or two of silver on board  --  who knows ?  --  there is plenty of blue water and fine ships every where ; so we must be content . " Padre Ricardo made the sign of the cross , kissed his thumb and fore finger , and , reaching his dirty paw over to the captain , shook hands with him . " Ay , amigos ! " continued the leader , without minding the friendly interruption ; " yes , my friends , we shall , I trust , give the hounds in search of us the slip ; and even should they scent out this retired little spot , they will have their trouble for their chase , and find nothing but a few stones and heaps of rubbish above ground . " " They may find some little matters below , though , " chimed in the commander of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pirate , with a meaning scowl , " I 'll put the spy who betrays it to such a torture as that he 'll wish himself below ground when I come back here . " " Cierto , amigo ! no fear of that ! " muttered the Tuerto , with some little trepidation of manner . " My papers are white . " " Captain Brand , " said the doctor , " my contract with you is nearly up , and since I only agreed  --  as you know  --  to enlist my professional services here on shore , I presume you will have no objections to permit me to depart with Don Ignacio in the felucca . " It would be difficult to say what caused the flush of passion which overspread the leader 's face as he listened to this simple request , but it was full a minute before he replied , and then , having weighed the matter carefully in his mind , he said , in a precise and determined tone , in French , " Monsieur le Docteur ! the compacts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me have never been broken except by death . I can not , therefore , consider your request , and I shall expect you to sail with me in the schooner . " Then he added , quickly , as he noticed a certain haughty expression in his subordinate 's face , " Pardon me , monsieur ; we had better not discuss this question now . Suppose you see me on the morrow . " " Willingly , senor , and you will find my resolution unchangeable . " Rising as he spoke , he bowed to his companions at table , and saying " Buenas noches ! ( good-night ! ) " he passed from the saloon to the piazza . There he paused a moment , as if communing with himself , and then approaching the grass hammock where the sick boy was sleeping , he gently took the little fellow up in his arms . The child murmured " Mamma , mamma ! " and was borne away . Captain Brand followed the doctor with his searching , sharklike eyes until he had left the apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look ; but he uttered no sound , and , placing a finger on his lip , he nodded meaningly to the padre . A moment after Babette brought in the steaming gumbo soup , and the pirate 's feast was nearly ended . Don Ignacio waited until his companions had swallowed a goodly portion of the grateful mess , when he too refreshed himself . Then making his salutations in his usual observant manner , he departed . He declined , however , the offer of his host 's society to his boat , saying he had , he knew , half a dozen of the felucca 's crew outside the building to guard his footsteps , and he would not put the capitano to the trouble . When the padre rose to give his benediction to his patron , the captain took him impressively by the rope which girded his cassock about the loins , and giving it a sharp jerk or two , he said , " My holy father , I think we shall have a sad duty to perform to-morrow . Our old friend Gibbs has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now in the Capella dungeon . After early mass go and console him . " The padre returned a meaning smile , crossed himself , and slowly left the pirate alone in his saloon . CHAPTER XIX . FANDANGO ON ONE LEG . " God ! ' t is a fearsome thing to see That pale wan man 's mute agony  --  Those pinioned arms , those hands that ne'er Shall be lifted again  --  not even in prayer ! That heaving chest ! Enough ; ' t is done ! The bolt has fallen ! the spirit is gone . " Day dawned in the east . The early spikes of morning shot up in rosy bands from behind the lofty hills of Cuba and announced the coming of the sun . The inlet and basin , framed in by their rocky walls , were still clothed in the gloom of night , and dimly reflecting the fading stars on the calm unruffled surface where the schooner and felucca were moored . Away off in the distance a dense white misty vapor hung flat and low over the lagoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air to disturb the noxious fog or quiver a leaf in the silent groves . The revels , too , of the drunken sailors had long since ceased ; the sentinels , with their cutlasses in the sheaths , paced slowly to and fro before the doors of the sheds , and the look-outs at the signal-stations and battery peered through the early dawn to seaward ; else not a sound or moving thing , save a teal or two fluttering with a sharp cry up and down the lagoon ; the music of the tiny ripples lapping on the shelly beach ; and the low roar , in a deep bass , breaking and moaning over the ledge beyond the island . Such was the appearance of things where our scene is laid in the Twelve League Group of Keys , on a Sunday morning , in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and five . Half a mile , perhaps , inland from the sheds where the sailors lived , and beneath the steep face of the ridge-like crag which split the island in two parts , stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together and roofed with tiles . A rough iron cross was fastened over the doorless entrance , and at the other end was a stone balustrade , with a rude painting of the Virgin over the altar , on which stood four or five tall brass candlesticks and a lighted taper . Outside the building was a narrow and secluded inclosure , surrounded by a low wall of coral rocks , with a few head-stones marked with black crosses  --  the graves of the pirates whose bones reposed beneath . At one end of this burial-place was still another subdivision , where stood ten upright flat white stones , on whose faces were rudely carved initial letters , with the years in which the eternal sleepers had been laid beneath the sand . Far and near sprang up close and almost impenetrable thickets of cactus , whose sharp and pointed needle-shoots defied the passage of any thing more bulky than land-crabs and lizards . One or two narrow pathways had been cut out here and there , but they were overgrown again by the stubborn , hardy vegetation ; and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having one 's legs cut in gashes , could a human being struggle through it . Within the chapel kneeled a dozen or more of the " Centipede 's " crew , the coarse and sodden faces and uncombed locks , from their night 's debauch , in striking contrast to the place and the apparent devoutness of manner in which they crossed themselves while the rites of the Church were going on . Before the altar stood Padre Ricardo , with his breviary on the chancel beneath the taper , and chanting forth from his deep lungs the services of the mass . In a few minutes the unholy hands and lips which performed the solemn ceremony ceased word and gesture , and with a sonorous benediction at the elevation of the Host , and a tinkle of a bell , the sailors arose from their knees and again staggered back to the sheds , to slumber through the day . When all had gone , the padre clasped his missal , tucked it into his bosom , and making the sign of the cross with a genuflexion before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pursuing the winding path which led to his own habitation for a certain distance , he then turned to the left , and carefully picking his way through the sharp cactus and Spanish bayonets along the face of the crag , he stopped at a yawning fissure which gaped open in the rock . Here , too , the same wiry vegetation had crept , and it was with great difficulty , and many an " Ave ! " and " Santa Maria ! " that the padre succeeded in passing into the dark , rugged mouth of the cavern . " By the ashes of San Lorenzo ! " he muttered , " there are serpents and venomous insects in this pit of purgatory . Oh , misericordia ! what has pierced my leg ? Why should my son drag me through this hole ? Ah ! blessed Saint Barnabas ! a slimy reptile has crossed my instep ! " Feeling with his outspread hands in his fright , as he gradually made his way into the dripping cavern , getting narrower and lower as he proceeded , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and fifty yards , came to a loose pile of stones . Here opened another low narrow fissure on the left , and , in some doubt , he was about to enter ; but the noise he made by stepping on a stone was answered by the hissing warning of a serpent , and the scared padre fell back at his full length in a pool of stagnant slimy water . " O Madre di Dios ! I am stung by a cobra ! Holy Virgin ! my new cassock ruined too ! Ave Maria ! light me out of this abode of the devil ! " Slowly recovering , however , from his fright , he once more regained his feet , and , after a few steps , which he was obliged to accomplish by scraping his crown against the jagged rocks above , his outstretched hands touched an iron-bound door . " Gracias a Dios ! Thanks be to all the saints , I am here at last ; but , alas ! curses on me , I shall be obliged to return by the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casa . " Cautiously searching with his fingers as he muttered these words , he touched a bolt , and , grasping it with both hands , drew it partly out like the knob of a bell . Then , placing his ear to the door , he presently heard a rattling , creaking noise , as if a beam of timber , with pulley and chain , was being raised from behind the entrance . When the sound ceased the door yielded to the padre 's sturdy shoulder , and there was just room to admit his portly body . Here the passage was wider , the rock evidently chiseled away by the hands of man , and on one side was an artificial chamber , blasted out of the solid rock , with a narrow door with heavy iron bolts on the outside . At this opening the padre paused and listened . No sound caught his ear at first , but as he clutched the bolt and it grated back in its bands , he was saluted by such a volley of frightful curses as to make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice of Master Gibbs , lying there on a low iron settle in the noisome dungeon , with not a ray of light to cheer him , and only a jug of water and some weevily biscuit to save him from starvation . All through the day and during the long , long hours of the awful night , in pain and suffering from his lopped-off limb and bruises , had he lain on his hard bed with clenched hands , blaspheming and impotently raging in his agony and despair . No prayer , however , dawned in his ruthless heart , or was breathed from his brutal lips ; but curses upon curses came thick and fast , till his tongue refused to give them utterance , and he fell back in utter exhaustion . As the noise , however , of the bolt struck his ear , he clutched the stone water-jug from the floor , and hurled it , with a yell of execrations , toward the door , where the fragments fell with a clattering crash on the stone pavement . Grinding his teeth in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once put these hands on your bloodstained carcass , and if the mother that bore ye will know her spawn again , my name 's not Bill Gibbs ! Ha ! you miserable swab , with your soft words and white hands ! when I get out of this hole I 'll blow you and your infarnal hounds to  --   --  ! Give me fair play , and , even on one of my legs , I 'll cut the cowardly heart out of you , Captain Brand ! Come in , will ye ? ye son of the devil , and I 'll bite the tongue out of your mouth by the roots ! " Illustration : SHRIVING A SINNER . Here the hoarse and panting wretch again ceased his roarings , and the padre timidly opened the door . " Ha ! who 's that ? Babette ? " " No , my son , it is your good Padre Ricardo , come to console you . " What the maimed villain replied to the priest , and what means the holy father took to allay the passion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dungeon , or whether successful in his mission , is not important to state in detail . An hour later , however , the priest seemed relieved in body and spirit as he retired from the loathsome hole , and shooting the bolt as he closed the door , cautiously felt his way along the dark and narrow passage . Presently , as he turned an angle , a ray of light from the loopholes of the great stone vault beneath the pirate 's dwelling lighted his pathway ; and a moment after , with a hearty sigh of satisfaction , he seized a cord above his head and gave it a jerk . A bell sounded above , and then a large , square-hinged trap-hatch fell down , swinging gently to and fro from the beams above . At the same time the padre put his arms about a square wooden stanchion which supported the floor of the saloon , and then painfully sticking his toes in some deep-cut notches at the sides , he slowly began to mount upward . When , however , his oily shaved crown appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasp was laid on his shoulders , and he was pulled up like a flapping lobster and rolled into the apartment . It was Captain Brand who kindly assisted the holy father , and it was the captain 's hollow laugh which saluted him in his torn and soiled raiment , as , with difficulty , he regained his perpendicular . " Laugh not , hijo mio , at my sorrowful plight , " said the bruised Ricardo , with some asperity ; " I have met with dangers of venomous serpents , and been stabbed cruelly by those villainous cactus . " " But I raised the beam , my padre , the moment you made the signal . " " You did , my son ; but what I suffered in the cavern was as nothing to what I endured when I entered the dungeon of the English Gibbs . Jesus Maria , what an infidel he is ! " " You did not find his spirit subdued , then , by bread and water ? " " Far from it , my friend . He rages like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everlasting torments ! But , what is more impious still , " went on the padre , as he crossed himself , " he damned your holy father , and hoped I would roast in hell ! " " But he confessed , Ricardo , and you gave him absolution ? " " If calling me thief and assassin , and hurling his stone water-jug at my head , be confession and forgiveness of sins , the ceremony has been performed . Ah ! my son , he needs no more mercy in this world ! " " Of course not , my padre ; and we will give him a short shrift and a long rope . " " Babette ! " continued Captain Brand . " Ah ! my Baba , you have not forgotten to feed our jolly Gibbs there below ? No ? I thought not . Well , then , it is Sunday , you know ; give him a pint of pure rum for his morning 's draught . And , Baba , my beauty , slip a pair of iron ruffles over his wrists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his , and lug him here beneath this hatch . Go down by your own ladder , and be quick , my Baba , as I wish my breakfast presently ! " All this was said in a cool and rather an affectionate tone , as Captain Brand sipped a spoonful or two of chocolate from a cup of Dresden china . Then turning to the padre , he said , " You would perhaps like a cordial , my father , to take the chill off your stomach ? Yes . You will find some capital Curacoa in that stand of bottles there . " The padre , forgetful of the dignity of his calling , shuffled with indecent haste to the spot indicated , and , without going through the form of filling one of the diminutive thimble-shaped glasses in the stand , he boldly raised the silver-netted flask to his lips , and sucked away until it was nearly empty . Then seating himself on the settee , he lugged out his illuminated missal and pored over its contents . Captain Brand occupied himself with opening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and securing the end firmly on the stout cleat at the wall . So passed the time until a noise beneath the room of a voice in anger , and a body bumped and dragged along , once more attracted the attention of those in the saloon . " Oh ho ! is that you , Master Gibbs ? " exclaimed Captain Brand , in a cheerful voice . " You have risen early ; but stop that profane language , my friend , or you will never see daylight again ! " The maimed ruffian only muttered , " Your friend , eh ? blindfolded and manacled ! " And then , apparently abashed by the cool , commanding tone of his superior , he held his peace . " Well , you are quiet , my lad . Now we 'll see if we ca n't hoist you up here in the saloon . " " Thank ye , sir ! " said Gibbs , aloud ; and then he muttered to himself , " Let me jest get one grip of ye , and I 'll show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think we shall need assistance , my son ? " whispered the padre into the ear of his patron . " Diavolo ! No . I never wanted help in these little affairs , except in the case of that violent Yankee whaler , who gave us much trouble , you know , and we were obliged to call Pedillo , " replied the captain , in the same low tone . Then , raising his voice , he said , " Hark ye , Master Gibbs ! Babette will lift you off the stones , and the padre and I will raise you up to the room here . You do n't weigh so much as you did before you had your leg hacked off with a hand-saw  --  ho ! and I dare say you are as light now as a dried stockfish ! Up with him , Baba ! There  --  steady ! all right  --  here you are ! " Saying this , Captain Brand , with the assistance of the stout negress and the padre , raised the once burly ruffian , with a vigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saloon , where they laid him out at full length on his back . " Wait a moment , my hearty , till the hatch is raised , and then we will raise you . Unpleasant position , no doubt , " continued Captain Brand , as the trap came up and was secured by a spring ; " but then , you know , you would have that pin of yours cut off , and somehow you have been so careless as to dispose of the nice leg you had the other day , made out of the spruce fore-top-mast of the ' Centipede '  --  a very tough bit of a spar it was . " Here Master Gibbs grated his teeth and grinned hideously . The captain smiled like a demon , and , approaching the prostrate cripple , said cheerfully  --  ay , in a frank and hearty tone  --  " Now , my padre , place a comfortable chair for Master Gibbs , and we will help him to a seat . " The considerate Ricardo placed a large , roomy Manilla chair on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their victim to the position assigned him . As they performed this operation , the captain , with the gentleness of a tiger before he strikes his prey , and with a wink to the padre , lightly passed the noose of the silk rope over the ruffian 's hairy throat , where it lay like a snake with its slack coil squirming at the back of the chair . " Now , Master Gibbs , I am about to remove this bandage from your beautiful red eyes , " said Captain Brand , in his cold , chilling , deliberate manner , " and if you so much as move when daylight shines before you , I 'll blow your brains out . " Here the pirate leisurely cocked a pistol close to his subordinate 's ear , removed the bandage , and laid the weapon on the table within reach . " No noise either , Master Gibbs ! " continued Captain Brand , as he stirred up the remains of his chocolate and gulped it down ; " for it is Sunday morning , and we must respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he tells me , just now , and even said some disrespectful things of me . What have I done to vex you ? " The manacled wretch tried to raise his horny hands to his face when the cloth was removed from his eyes , and rub those organs , while he glared suspiciously around ; but the captain pointed with his white finger in a threatening way to the cocked pistol , and Master Gibbs let his hands fall again . " Well , Captain Brand , I s'pose now you 're going to treat me as a faithful man who has sarved under you ought to be treated ; and I 'm willin ' to forgive what has passed . " There was no look of forgiveness , however , in those brutal bloodshot eyes , nor much signs of repentance in those grinding teeth and compressed lips . " Why , no , my Gibbs , I am not going to treat you as a faithful man , but I tell you what I will do "  --  here the captain moved his chair nearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " I will drink a glass of grog with you in forgetfulness of the past and forgiveness for the future . " " Thank ye , Captain Brand ; I do feel dry . That stuff Babette gave me a while ago did n't touch the right spot , and I 'll be glad to jine you . " " Ah ! bueno , my old friend ; you shall drink something that will touch the right spot ! What shall it be ? you have only to name it . " " I 'll take a toss of that old brandy you gave me the other day , if it 's the same to you , sir . " " Oh , Master Gibbs , it 's all the same to me . Delighted I am to oblige you ! Padre mio ! a glass of old Cognac for our friend  --  a tumblerful ; a wine-glass will do for me . " The padre poured out the brandy as he was desired , handed the lesser glass to the captain , and the tumbler he placed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdued ruffian raised the glass to his mouth , careful not to spill a drop ; then , before draining it , he cleared his throat , while at the same time the captain rose to his feet , his right foot resting a little on the heel , and held the wine-glass before him . " Now , then , Master Gibbs , for a toss that will touch the right spot . " " Ay , ay , captain ! " said Gibbs ; " and here 's forgiveness for the future . " Scarcely had the words been uttered , and the liquor began to gurgle down the hairy throat of the manacled wretch , than the pirate before him pressed his foot with a quick , nervous action on the spring . Like a flash the trap fell , carrying chair and man with it . The hinges of the hatch creaked , the wicker-work chair fell with a bound on the stone floor below , the heavy beam overhead gave a jarring quiver as the strong silk rope brought up with a shuddering surge on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a gasping , choking cry of pain mingled with the ring of the shattered tumbler on the pavement , the ruffian of a hundred crimes fell full three feet , and hung struggling in the death agony . With almost superhuman force he raised his clenched hands and struck his forehead till the manacles were twisted like wire by the effort , spinning around too by the lopsided weight of his body , while the beam above yielded slightly to the strain , and the deadly cord , no longer squirming , but taut as a bar of iron , held the wretch in its knotted embrace , clasped tight around the throat . In a minute or two the hands ceased beating the inflamed face and head , and fell with a clank before the body ; the legs gave a few convulsive twitches , a last and violent spasm shook the frame , and there Master Gibbs hung , a warm dead lump of clay . While this murderous business was going on , and the poor crippled wretch was struggling in the jaws of death , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breviary the Salve Domine , and his patron coolly took down a telescope and swept it over the blue water to seaward . When , however , after a quarter of an hour had elapsed , and the body of their victim gave no more signs of life , the captain laid down the telescope as the padre closed his missal , and remarked quietly , while glancing critically down at the suspended body , " He did not go off so easy as I had anticipated ; his bull-neck is not broken , though the knot was perfectly well placed . However , he is stone dead , and we will lower him down . You , my padre , will bury him ! " " Hijo mio ! son of mine ! spare me that troublesome duty . Would you have me drag such a carcass through the cavern and consign him to consecrated earth , when he refused the last holy offers of salvation ? " " Bueno , my padre , I respect your feelings ! You need not put him under the sand ; take him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his bed . " " Thank you , my son ; your orders shall be obeyed ! " Glad , apparently , to be relieved from farther exertion , though with manifest symptoms of disgust , the priest , more infamous even than the scoundrel he had assisted in hanging , clumsily descended the hatchway by the way he came up , and awaited the movements of his chief . The captain stepped to the wall , and , casting off the turns from the cleat , he slowly lowered the body down till it rested on the pavement . " Unbend the rope from his neck , my padre , and hitch it on to that Manilla chair . There  --  all right ! you may return this way and breakfast with me . " Saying this , Captain Brand rounded up the chair , detached the silk rope , hung the loop in its accustomed place , and then waited the reappearance of his confederate . Not many minutes elapsed before the padre , having performed the last rites , again ascended the stanchion , and was assisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got hold of a ring-bolt in the trap , drew it up and secured the spring , placing square bits of mahogany over the countersunk apertures , so as to prevent accidental falls or hangings of themselves . Even while performing these mechanical operations , the priest puffed out an account of his proceedings below : how he had dragged the body to the dungeon ; how , when there , he had inadvertently stumbled and fallen on the top of it ; and that his lips  --  maldito !  --  came in contact with the open mouth of the late Master Gibbs ; but when he had recovered from the horror of this frightful caress , he had said a short prayer and bolted the door . " You have done well , my padre ; and now let us break our fast . Babette , a couple of broiled snappers and a cold duck ! Be lively , old lady , for I have business to attend to after breakfast . Hola , mi padre , will you wash your hands in water before sitting down ? No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , the oily Ricardo never washed his hands , save wetting the tips of his fingers in holy water in the chapel ; and , indeed , he rarely touched water in any quantity either outside or in ; and it was with a look of surprise , not unmingled with contempt , that he beheld his patron retire for a bath . CHAPTER XX . BUSINESS . " He had rolled in money like pigs in mud , Till it seemed to have entered into his blood By some occult projection ; And his cheeks , instead of a healthy hue , As yellow as any guinea grew , Making the common phrase seem true About a rich complexion . " The business which Captain Brand alluded to when he was about to partake of breakfast with his friend the padre was , in the first instance , to arrange some matters in the way of payment of debts to his compadre , Don Ignacio Sanchez , commander of the Colonial Guarda Costa felucca " Panchita . " Accordingly , when he rose from table , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of affairs in and around the den and island from the men at the signal-stations , he summoned Pedillo . When that worthy appeared below the veranda  --  for be it remembered that Captain Brand never permitted the inferior officials of his band to pollute his apartments , unless , perhaps , as in the case of his deceased subordinate , Master Gibbs , it was on urgent business  --  Captain Brand ordered his gig manned . Pedillo threw up his hand in token of assent , and walked down to the brink of the basin to execute the command . Then , after a few minutes , Captain Brand lit a cigar , dismissed the padre , put on his fine white Panama straw hat , unlocked a strong cabinet with a secret drawer , glanced over a paper before him , and , making a rapid calculation , he caught up a heavy bag of doubloons , and left the house in charge of Babette . The captain always told his guests that his fellows had such love and respect for him that he rarely locked up his property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The truth was , that his fellows  --  scoundrels , miscreants , and villains as they were  --  stood in such fear and dread of their leader , that they were glad to keep out of his way . Moreover , he never boasted or made any display before them , living on shipboard , as on shore , by himself , but always ready and terrible when the moment came for action ; treating his crew , too , with the most rigid impartiality , adhering strictly to his promises and compacts with them , and never overlooking an offense . So Captain Brand left his dwelling in charge of his dumb housekeeper Babette , and tripping down the rope ladder from the piazza in a clean suit of brown linen and straw slippers , his beardless face shaded by his broad-brimmed hat from the sun , and the bag of gold on his arm , he jauntily walked toward the cove . " Ah ! good morning , my doctor ! Glad to meet you ! How are the sick ? Doing well , I hope ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call upon you in relation to the conversation we had last evening , and  --  " " Pardon me , Monsieur le Docteur , but I have been very busy this morning , and am now going to see Don Ignacio on matters of importance "  --  here the elegant pirate took the cigar from his thin lips and held it daintily between his thumb and fore finger in the air  --  " and really , monsieur , I am very sorry to miss your visit . But , " he added , with one of his usual smiles , " I shall be at leisure this afternoon , and in the cool of the evening we can take a stroll . What say you ? " The doctor nodded . " Apropos , docteur , suppose we have a little game of monte afterward at your quarters . I never permit gaming in mine , you know . The padre will not object ; and I am confident our compadre , the Tuerto , will be delighted . " " As you please , captain , " replied the medico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I will join you in the promenade , and I shall be ready to receive you in the evening . " " Hasta huego , amigo ! " said Captain Brand , as he again stuck his cigar between his teeth , waved his hand in adieu , and walked to his boat . " You do n't love me , doctor , " thought the pirate . " I do n't fear you , captain , " thought the doctor . It was a touch of high art the way this notorious pirate pitched the bag of gold toward his coxswain , crying , " Catch that , Pedillo ! " and then the almost girlish manner in which he pattered about the beach and held up his trowsers , so that he might not even get his slippers damp . Had that salt water been red blood , he would not have cared if his feet had been soaked in it . And then , too , the little exclamation of joy when he finally stepped into the stern-sheets , and sat down beneath the awning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cushions . Oh , it was certainly a touch of high piratical art ! " The old ' Centipede ' is looking a little rusty after her late cruise , Pedillo ! " throwing his head back to evade a curl of smoke , and casting his cold eyes like a rattle of icy hail at the coxswain . " But I am glad Pedro took your place "  --  puff , puff  --  " that knife-stab prevented you , of course "  --  puff  --  " and we shall have her all tight and trig again in a day or two . " " Si , senor ! " said Pedillo , respectfully ; " and how goes Senor Gibbs , capitano ? " The capitano rolled his icy eyes again at the coxswain , and replied , carelessly , " Why , Pedillo , our friend Gibbs came to see me when the ' Centipede ' anchored , but almost before "  --  puff  --  " he had given me an account of his unfortunate cruise he fell down in a fit . The fact is , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hard drinking and inflammation which set in on the stump of his lost leg , he has been in a very bad way "  --  puff  --  " quite in a dangerous condition indeed , requiring all my old Babette 's care and attention "  --  puff  --  " but this morning the good padre went to see him , and he told me a while ago that he left him without fever , and altogether tranquil . " Pedillo 's wiry mustaches twirled of themselves . Meanwhile the boat skimmed lightly over the basin , and as the captain ceased speaking she ran alongside of the felucca . Don Ignacio , with his bright single eye in full burning power , and a cigarette between his wrinkled lips , was on the deck of the vessel to receive his visitor ; and as he saw the coxswain follow his superior with a weighty bag under his arm , his glimmering orb became brighter , if possible  --  as if it was piercing through the thick canvas of the bag , and counting , ounce by ounce , the contents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasped cordially by the white hand of Captain Brand . " Como se va ? How goes it with my compadre ? Stomach and head all clear after our long dinner of yesterday ? " The compadre said that his head was particularly clear that morning , and as for his stomach he had not yet inquired ; but if the capitano had any doubts as to the former proposition , he had better step below and decide for himself . In accordance with this ambiguous invitation , the visitor and commander disappeared down the small cuddy in the afterpart of the felucca , where was a low , stifling hole of a cabin , dank with stale tobacco-smoke , and smelling awfully of rats and roaches . There was a little round table in the middle , and on one side was a single berth , with some dirty bedding , which had not been cleaned , apparently , since the vessel was built . Light was shed from a skylight above . Captain Brand gave a sniff of disgust as he entered this floating sanctum of Don Ignacio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stool , and waved a perfumed cambric kerchief before his nose . Commander Sanchez , catching the inspiration , merely observed that it was a little close certainly , and not so spacious as the superb cabin of the schooner , and that sometimes , when lying in a calm off the lee side of Cuba , it was hot enough to melt the tail off a brass monkey ; but yet it was his duty , and he did not particularly mind it . Hereupon Captain Brand requested Don Ignacio to produce his papers , and they were presently laid upon the table . For a few minutes the pirate was absorbed in running his cold eyes over the accounts  --  making pencil-notes on the margins , and comparing them with a memorandum he took from his pocket ; but at last he threw himself back and exclaimed , " Compadre , the account of old Moreno , at the Havana , is correct to a real  --  three hundred and twelve doubloons and eight hard dollars . Yours , however , has some few inaccuracies  --  double commissions charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and all profits credited to you . " Don Ignacio spread out the palms of both his hands toward his companion , as if to exorcise such unjust charges from the brain of his confederate . " O si , si , compadre ! it is as I state , and you know it is true ; but , nevertheless , a few dozens of ounces more or less makes no difference ; and , to make short work , I am ready to pay . But , " said Captain Brand , laying a hand on the heavy bag of money beside him , " though I am quite ready to cancel my debts in hard cash here on the spot , yet , as I am bound on a long cruise  --  Heaven only knows where  --  I would prefer to keep the gold and pay you in something else . " Don Ignacio threw his head back and fixed his eye like a parrot on the captain , waiting to hear farther . " What have I on hand besides gold ? Well , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some cases of French silks , which you can have at a fair market value ; then there is all that collection of silver table-service , which you can take by weight ; and , besides , lots of rare furniture , which you may set your own price upon  --  altogether much more than enough to pay Moreno and you both . What say you , compadre ? is it a bargain ? or shall I carry the stuff with me , and run the chance of disposing of it on the Spanish Main ? " It was a long time before the crafty old Spaniard could make up his mind whether to receive his pay in a simple portable currency , or take more bulky matter , with the hope of making double the money by the operation . Finally , however , his greed overcame his prudence , and he accepted the last proposition , with the understanding that the articles should be transferred to the felucca the next night . " Ah ! " said Captain Brand , with another sniff of disgust , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am glad the affair is settled , for I would n't remain another hour in this filthy hole for all the money you have cheated me out of , you old rascal . " He said the last portion of this sentence to himself as he emerged from the cuddy . " But listen , amigo ! " he continued , as they both reached the deck . " You will give me duplicate receipts on the part of Senor Moreno , so that I can forward one to him from the next port I visit . And , by the way , suppose you come on shore this afternoon for a stroll , and in the evening we will have a little game of monte  --  eh ? " " Cierto ! ( certainly ! ) " returned the commander of the felucca ; when Captain Brand , with his bag of gold intact under his arm , got into his boat and was pulled to the shore . CHAPTER XXI . TREASURE . " Gold ! gold ! gold ! gold ! Bright and yellow , hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled ; Heavy to get , and light to hold ; Hoarded , bartered , bought , and sold ; Stolen , borrowed , squandered , doled ; Price of many a crime untold  --  Gold ! gold ! gold ! gold ! " It was long past noon when the pirate returned to his island home , and the day was hot , for the sea-breeze had not made , and the tropical sun was pouring down its burning rays until the sand was roasting as in a furnace ; the very rocks throwing off a trembling mirage of heated air , and the lagoon almost boiling under the fiery influence . The sailors , with aching heads and parched mouths , were swinging in their grass hammocks beneath the sheds ; and , save the watchful vigilance of the men at the look-outs and battery , the little island was wrapped in repose . Captain Brand , however , was as cool as a cucumber ; and regardless of the heat , and indifferent about siesta , he drew the curtains of the saloon , and took some active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babette to get out some camphor trunks and pack the contents of his splendid wardrobe . This operation was performed under the critical eye of Captain Brand himself , to which he personally lent his aid by stowing away , here and there , his caskets , trinkets , and treasures  --  those which had been presented to him by the unfortunate people who had the ill luck to make his acquaintance on the high seas , or in midnight forays on shore . Then the captain opened and rummaged cabinets , bureaus , and bookcases , making liberal presents to his trusty housekeeper ; and , turning from that occupation , he had all his table furniture spread before him , when he made careful estimates of the value of the silver , china , and glass . This concluded , Captain Brand ordered Babette to furnish him a slight repast ; and while it was preparing  --  the captain taking the precaution to bolt his handmaiden in her kitchen  --  he went quietly into his bedroom , and when he came out he bore heavy burdens in his muscular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trap in the floor . Then letting the hatch swing softly down , he lowered the heavy articles by the silk rope , as he had Master Gibbs , though not so suddenly , going down himself as nimbly as a rat after them . In the vault beneath , Captain Brand struck a light and set fire to a torch , which blazed out luridly , and illumined the dark excavation and passages like day . Going slowly on , with his burden in his arms , by the path by which we traced the padre , he came to the outer door , which opened into the fissure in the crag ; and , after a vigorous effort , the beam was raised , and he passed out . Once outside , he felt his way cautiously , stepping clear of the stagnant pools beneath , and guarding his head from the jagged rocks above ; and then , lighting his way over the stones which had upset the equilibrium of Don Ricardo , he crept slowly into an aperture on the right . Illustration : " HE CREPT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UP THE DAMP AND DRIPPING ROCKS . " No serpents or venomous reptiles disturbed the pirate 's progress ; for , though there were plenty of them coiled or crawling near , yet their instinct probably taught them that he was a monster with a more deadly poison than themselves , and whose fangs were sharper , though his tongue did not hiss a note of warning . Captain Brand put down his burden and crept forward on hands and knees , the blazing torch lighting up the damp and dripping rocks , all green and slimy from the tracks of the snake and lizard . Where the narrow fissure seemed to end by a wall of natural rock , the pirate rolled aside a large stone at the base , and scratching away the sand , a large copper lock was displayed , in which , after pushing aside the hasp , Captain Brand touched a spring , and it opened . Then , exerting all the force of his powerful frame , a rough slab of unhewn rock yielded to the effort , and rose like a vertical door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large stone at the opening , so as to prevent the slab falling to its place , the captain stood the torch within the opening , and went back for his burden ; then he returned , and squeezed himself with it into a small excavated , uneven chamber , where he sat down . " Nasty work , " communed the pirate with himself , " but a safe place to lay up a penny for a rainy day ! Let me see . These two bags of doubloons , and the small one my Gibbs brought me , with those three , there , of guineas , and those sacks of dollars , will make about ten thousand pounds . That will make me a nest-egg when I retire from the profession and return to Scotland . They will have forgotten all my boyish follies by that time . " Captain Brand alluded to forging his father 's name , and other little peccadilloes of a similar nature . " And I may be elected to Parliament  --  who knows ? It is something of a risk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then it 's a greater risk to carry it in the schooner "  --  he argued both ways  --  " and then , again , damp does not decay pure metal . But , " thought Captain Brand , " suppose somebody should discover this little casket in the rock . Ah ! that 's not probable , for no soul besides myself knows of it , and even the very man who made the door did not know for what it was intended ; besides , he died long ago . " Captain Brand had forgotten , in this connection , that the man who cut out the stone chamber and door , and fashioned the hinge and lock , took too much sugar in his coffee the morning the job was finished , and died in horrible convulsions before night . Oh yes , that incident had entirely escaped his memory ! Captain Brand , having now thoroughly reasoned the matter out , gave each of the bags lying on the sand a gentle kick to get a responsive echo from the coin ; and then creeping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stone , and the heavy slab fell again into its place . Then clasping the lock , covering it over with sand , and rolling back the stone , he seized the torch and quickly returned to the vault beneath his saloon . There , putting out the torch by rubbing it against the stone pavement until not a spark was left , by the sunlight , streaming through the loopholes around , he passed to one side and began removing the cases of cochineal , silks , and what not , near to the strongly-barred portcullis door , which opened toward the basin fronting his dwelling . It was hard work , but Captain Brand seemed to enjoy it ; and even after he had arranged the packages intended for shipment in his compadre 's felucca , he began again . Going to the farther corner of the vault , he stopped before a strong mahogany door , and taking a key from his pocket , unlocked and threw it wide open . It was as black as night inside , floored and lined with wood , and emitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls were some fifty or a hundred small barrels with copper hoops , and branded on the heads with the word " powder . " Unmindful of the odor and the rather combustible material around him , Captain Brand again resumed his work , and rolled a large number of the little barrels toward the doorway , near the merchandise already there , saying to himself the while , " I think that will about fill the ' Centipede 's ' magazine , and we must make a proper disposition of the remainder . " Hereupon Captain Brand , actively bent upon the work of disposing of his treasures , rolled out a dozen or two more of the little barrels . Strange to say , among the very few articles that were never presented to him , but actually bought of Senor Moreno , was this highly useful and indispensable material of powder , and he therefore set much store by it . And it was with a sigh of regret that the pirate stood the little barrels on their ends in a line across the great vault of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and especially beside the square upright stanchions on which the interior of the building rested . Not content with this , he took a copper hammer and knocked in all the heads of the little barrels , and then , with a scoop of the same metal , he dipped out large quantities of the black material , and poured thick trains of it from barrel to barrel , sometimes capsizing one , but always particularly cautious not to rasp a grain of it beneath his grass slippers and the pavement . Then he took a piece of match-rope , and sticking one end deep into a barrel , he just poked the other end out of a loophole , to be in readiness whenever Captain Brand should deem proper to touch his lighted cigar to it . " There , " said Captain Brand , " that piece of tow will burn about thirty or forty minutes , and then  --  stand from under ! " Ascending the hatchway again with the agility of a cat , he drew up and secured the trap , and in ten minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India panjammers , a grass cloth jacket and vest  --  with , of course , the usual knickknacks in his pockets  --  and seated at table , where his busy housekeeper had placed a broiled chicken and a bottle of old Bordeaux before him . CHAPTER XXII . PLEASURE . " But ever , from that hour , ' t is said , He stammered and he stuttered , As if an axe went through his head With every word he uttered . He stuttered o'er blessing , he stuttered o'er ban , He stuttered , drunk or dry ; And none but he and the fisherman Could tell the reason why . " " Babette , " said Captain Brand , as he tapped a spoon against his coffee-cup and puffed his cigar , while the stout dumb negress was removing the remains of the light dinner , " Babette , old girl , you know that we are going to leave here in a few days , and I should like to know whether you care to go with us or remain here on the island . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head till the ends of her Madras turban fluttered . " Ho ! you do , eh ? Well , my Baba , I shall be sorry to leave you , for you will be very lonely here , and it may be a long , very long time before I come back . " Babette jerked her chin up this time , and did not grunt . " It 's all the same , eh ? old lady ! Well , I shall leave enough to eat to last you a lifetime ; but you will have to change your quarters , my Baba , and live in the padre 's shed , for I  --  a  --  do n't think this house will be inhabitable long after I am gone . " The negress gave another grunt and nod of assent . " Yes . Well , old lady , the matter is decided , then ; but , in case you should have any visitors here after we have gone , you wo n't take any trouble to describe what you have seen here ? No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they roast you alive ? " The hideous sign of understanding that the woman expressed in her dumb way would have convinced any body without the trouble of uttering a word . " Bueno ! " said Captain Brand ; " that will do for to-day . " Rising as he spoke , he stepped to a cabinet , slipped a large handful of doubloons in his trowsers pocket , put on his hat , and walked out . The sea-breeze swept over the island with its full strength , making the lofty cocoa-nuts bow their tufted tops , the palm-trees rustle their broad flat leaves and clash the stems together . The mangroves bent , too , before the wind , and the sand eddied up in tiny whirls amid the great expanse of cactus , while the vessels swung with taut cables to their anchors . Even Captain Brand 's hat nearly was blown off his dry light hair as he joined his compadre , Don Ignacio , at the landing ; and the sandy dust blinded  --  though only for a moment  --  that one-eyed individual 's optic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of the breeze . But yet they walked on in the direction of the sheds , and as they passed through the court-yard , where the men were lounging about in yawning groups or sitting under the piazza , playing cards  --  getting up and touching their hats as their chief passed  --  Senor Pedillo accosted him thus : " Capitano , the people are thirsty , and desire a barrel of wine . " " Not a drop , Senor Pedillo  --  not so much as would wet the bill of a musquito ! To-morrow at daylight let all hands be called , for we have work to do , and we must be quick to do it . " Pedillo slunk away , abashed by the positive tone of his commander ; and Captain Brand , with his companion , passed on to the domicile of the padre and doctor . Pausing at the open door of the shed , they looked in . The padre was lying flat on his back on his narrow bed , with his mouth wide open , and snoring like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  misplaced emblems in contact with drunkenness and debauchery  --  were reposing on his ample chest . The doctor was sitting beside his own couch , whispering words of childish comfort to the little boy , whose pale cheeks and brown curls reposed on the pillow of the bed . The poor child 's thin , limp fingers rested like the petals of a drooping lily in the dark , bony hand of his friend , and his dim hazel eyes were turned sadly toward him . " Holloa , amigos ! " shouted Captain Brand , in a hearty voice . " We are losing the glorious sea-breeze . Vamanos ! let us take a stroll to the Tiger 's Trap . " Hereupon Captain Brand entered the room , and gave the padre a violent tweak of the nose , at the same time puffing a volume of cigar-smoke into his beastly mouth , which combined effort brought the holy father to life in a trice , choking and sputtering , as he arose , a jargon of paternosters , which an indifferent hearer might have mistaken for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Take a sip of Geneva , my padre . There it is on the table . Ah ! do you call half a bottle a sip ? Well ! Come , doctor , let us be moving . " Down by the narrow gorge of the inlet , and over the smooth rocks and shelly shore , the party took their way , Don Ignacio leading with the amiable priest , on whom he glared with his malevolent eye as if  --  he not being a person from whom money or its equivalent could be squeezed  --  the greedy old Spaniard would like to transfix him with a glance . In the rear came Captain Brand and the doctor , the former as gay as a bird  --  of the vulture species  --  and his companion grave , severe , and preoccupied . Stopping as they reached the Tiger Trap Battery , where , after Captain Brand had made a close inspection of the guns , and held sharp confabs with the men who rose to receive him , he moved away a few steps , and , resting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed the cigar from his frozen lips , and said , " The arguments you have urged , monsieur , and the views you entertain , have a certain amount of reason in them . It is true you were deceived in coming here , but yet you swore to remain and not betray us when you did come . Well  --  ah ! do n't interrupt me ; I divine what you are going to say  --  you did not know what our real character was . Perhaps not . Nevertheless , I can not consent to your going away with that old rascal , Don Ignacio , there  --  that is , if he would take you , which I think he would not , as your presence on board might compromise him with the Cuban authorities ; and , " went on Captain Brand , as he crossed his legs , and held his fine Panama hat on his head as a ruffle of the sea-breeze shot around the rock , " with respect to your remaining here on the island , you will only have that dumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is highly probable that the English or American cruisers will be down upon you before a change of the moon , and they might  --  a  --  hang you , perhaps , for a pirate . Ho ! ho ! " " If Don Ignacio declines to take me , Captain Brand , of course I can not go in the felucca ; but , let come what will , I am resolved not to sail in the ' Centipede . ' " The pirate regarded the doctor for a moment with a cold , freezing look , not wanting , however , in a partial glimmer of respect and admiration , as he thus resolutely stated his determination ; and then , putting his finger lightly on the doctor 's arm , as he saw Don Ignacio and the padre draw near , he said impressively , in a low tone , " Monsieur le Docteur , do not make hasty resolutions . I command here , and my will is law . I will turn the matter over , however , in my mind , and give you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return . The sun is down , and the rocks are slippery . " " Well , caballeros , let us have a little social amusement , " said Captain Brand , as he sat down at the table in the padre 's and doctor 's quarters , and wound up his splendid watch , the present from the Captain General of Cuba . " But bear in mind that we must break up at midnight , for our compadre here has a multitude of articles to get on board his felucca to-night , and I must be astir at daylight . " Did Captain Brand think , while he turned the key of that gold repeater , of the bloodstained wretch he had put to death in the morning , who was lying stark and still in his narrow , damp resting-place , or of the poor little sufferer who had been torn from his heart-broken mother sleeping near him ? Oh no , certainly not . Captain Brand was thinking of a little game of monte . The padre lugged out a small store of dollars , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , down to quartitos or eighths of doubloons  --  all of it donations made him for remission of sins and absolutions , presented at one time and another from the pirates of his flock , such donations falling in pretty rapidly after a successful cruise , but dwindling away to most contemptible gifts long before his flock took to sea again . Captain Brand was very liberal to his crew , dividing a great deal of money with them , but , since he rarely visited any foreign ports , they had little chance of squandering it ; and in the end it served merely as a gaming currency to play with , and eventually coming back to him as contributions for stores , ammunition , rigging , and so forth . The captain , therefore , was a large gainer by the operation , as most of the articles in eating and drinking , and the vessel 's outfit , were  --  as we know  --  generally presented to him , so that he was enabled to stow away the cash for future gratification . Don Ignacio Sanchez was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long pouch of solid gold , which he made into little piles before him of the exact size of those of the captain . The doctor , however , declined to play , and sat an indifferent spectator of the game . " Let us begin , senores ! " exclaimed the Don , as he rapidly shuffled the cards , and his keen , black spark of fire lit up with animation at the rich prospect before him . " We are losing precious time . I 'll be banquero ! Vamanos ! " So they began . The cards were dealt , and the betting went on . The padre forgot breviary and beads in his excitement , and as his little pointings were swept away , he forgot , too , the sacred ejaculations he was wont to lard his discourse with , and he became positively profane . The captain won largely in the beginning , and jeered his compadre with great zest and enjoyment ; but that one-eyed , rapacious old Spanish rascal was not in the least disturbed , and bided his time . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisting upon the doctor describing minutely how he had hacked his friend Gibbs 's leg off with a hand-saw , laughing hugely thereat , and wiping the icy tears from his cold blue eyes with his delicate cambric handkerchief . Then the fascinating game began to fluctuate , and the luck set back with a steady run into the piles of the banker . Captain Brand liked as little to lose his money as any other gambler in cards , stocks , or dice , and he was somewhat chafed in spirit ; but what especially irritated him was losing it to that wrinkle-faced , one-eyed , greedy old scoundrel , with no possible hope of ever seeing a dollar of it again . As for the padre , he was dead broke ; and since his friends would not lend him a real , and the banker did not play upon credit , he sat moodily by , and gloated over the winnings of the Tuerto , cursing his own luck and that of his companions likewise . " Ho ! " growled Captain Brand , " maldito a la @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even while he spoke the poor little boy murmured in a sobbing voice , " Mamma , chere mamma ! " and turned uneasily in his little nest from his fitful slumber . " That crying imp again ! " said the now angry pirate , as he hurled the padre 's half empty gin jug in the direction of the couch , which crashed against the wall , and fell in a shower of glass splinters over the little sleeper . The child gave one terrified shriek , and , starting from the bed in his little night-dress , now soiled and torn , he ran and threw himself on his knees before the doctor . Another bottle was raised aloft by the long muscular arm of the pirate ; but , before you could wink , that arm was arrested , and the missile twisted from his grasp . " For shame , you coward ! Do n't harm the boy . He will die soon enough in this awful den without having his brains dashed out . " " Ho , Monsieur le Docteur ! " muttered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart's-blood of the resolute man who stood before him , as he pushed a hand into his waistcoat pocket , " do you presume to call names and oppose my will ? " But , controlling his passion with a violent contortion of face that would have made one 's blood run cold to see it , he changed his tone and said , " Nonsense , doctor ; you seem to take rather a strong interest in the brat  --  possibly an injudicious one ; but , since he is my prize , you know , by law , come  --  what will you give for him ? Ah ! happy thought , we will play for him ! There , deal away , compadre . Sota and cavallo ! I take the knave again , and you ten doubloons against the boy on the horse . " The doctor said not a word , but nodded assent , and seemed absorbed in the game . " Presto ! Turn the cards , you old sinner ! Quick ! Por dios ! horse has kicked me , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then starting up , Captain Brand hastily pulled out his watch , and said , " Hola , caballeros , the time is up ! I must say good-night . " Don Ignacio 's brown thin fingers , like a dentist 's steel nippers , laid down the cards , and carefully picked up his winnings , even to the smallest bit of the precious metal , and dropped it piece by piece into his long pouch , following them each with his glittering eye , like a magpie peering into a narrow-necked bottle , and smiling with his wrinkled old lips as the dull chink of the coin fell upon his ear . When he had performed this operation , he tied up the mouth of the bag as if he was choking somebody to death ; and then , twitching something which was partly hidden in his sleeve , he arose in readiness to go out . As , however , Captain Brand turned to follow his compadre , he looked carelessly toward the doctor , and said , " By the way , monsieur , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you shall remain on the island . No thanks . Adieu . Now , Don Ignacio , if your men and boats are at the cove , we will make sharp work with your business . Vamanos ! " CHAPTER XXIII . WORK . " Skeleton hounds that will never be fatter , All the domestic tribes of hell , Shrieking for flesh to tear and tatter , Bones to shatter , And limbs to scatter , And who it is that must furnish the latter , Those blue-looking men know well ! " When the pirate stood in his saloon on the morning subsequent to the pleasurable events of the Sunday previous , he , as well as his saloon , presented altogether a different aspect . The apartment had been stripped of all its rare and costly furniture , cabinets , candelabra , plate , china , and glass , and nothing of value was left save the camphor trunks on the floor , the cane-bottomed settee , a few chairs , and a table . All the beautiful things , ornamental as well as useful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the great vault beneath . The late possessor , however , of all that worldly wealth did not appear to be at all discomposed , or to cherish the faintest pang of regret at his loss . In truth , he seemed to be relieved from an uncomfortable load of responsibility ; and feeling assured , perhaps , that in roaming about the world he could collect a still more valuable collection  --  only give him time  --  and he would exercise his critical taste with every pleasing variety . It was thus he consoled himself as he stood there in his now denuded room , attired in a pair of coarse canvas trowsers , a red flannel shirt , with a short sharp hanger on his hip , and a double-barreled pistol in his belt  --  quite the costume in which he so singularly shocked Dona Lucia , whose lovely miniature once hung there on the wall in company with the other miserable victims of his lust . Captain Brand had just entered his dwelling , having been up and actively occupied ever since we last parted with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dry toast ; and , while Babette was bringing that simple breakfast , the pirate stood , tall , erect , and powerful , with one muscular arm resting high above his head on the side of the doorway , and the other lying lightly on the shark's-skin hilt of his cutlass , looking out to seaward  --  a very model , as he was , of a cool , prudent , desperate villain . " Ah ! there you go , you crafty old miser , in your guarda costa ! Take care , my compadre , of that reef . If that felucca 's keel touches one of those coral ledges there wo n't be a tooth-pick left of her in ten minutes . San Antonio ! but that was a close shave ! How the sharks would rasp your bones , for there 's no flesh on them ! Grazed clear , eh ? Bueno ! now you 're in blue water , you rapacious scoundrelly old wretch , and make the most of it . " Captain Brand waved his hand in adieu to the felucca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crept through the coral gateway , and , with her great lateen sail and green glancing bottom , was rising and falling on the long swell as she slipped away to the eastward . He then gulped down his tea , made one or two savage bites at his toast , and again walked out to the veranda , descended the ladder , and took his course toward the basin . There , too , the scene had changed ; and instead of the tranquil , shelly shore , only agitated by the musical rippling from the pure little inlet , the faint cry of a sea-gull , or the chirps of the lizards in the crevices of the rocks across the basin , those sounds had given place to the nimble feet and voices of busy sailors . The " Centipede , " also , had been towed from her moorings to a jetty which projected into the water from the shore , and there she lay , careened down , her keel half out of the water , with a dozen of her crew scrubbing her lean sides till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burnished gold . With her slanting masts lashed to the jetty , carpenters were engaged reducing the length of the fore-mast , and trimming out a spar for a new bowsprit . The long gun , with its carriage , lay near , and artisans were at work at a temporary forge , hammering out bolts and straps to replace those which were weakened by long service . On the shore , too , were a score or more of the piratical gang  --  Spaniards , negroes , Indians , Italians , and who not  --  ferocious-looking scoundrels , busy as bees , splicing and knotting ropes , stretching new rigging , cutting running gear from the coils of hemp or Manilla-grass rope , or making spun-yarn and chafing-mats ; while beneath the low mat sheds hard by , sail-makers were stitching away with their shining needles , making a set of square sails for the changed rig of the " Centipede , " or repairing old sails . But this was not all ; for in a shed beyond was the armorer , with a few hands , grinding pikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still was the gunner and his mate , filling powder-cases for the long gun and swivels , and making up musket and pistol ball-cartridges . In the midst of all these busy throngs moved Captain Brand , hither and thither , from vessel to forge , from sails to rigging , giving clear , sharp directions in various languages  --  commendation here , reproof there  --  inspecting with his own cold eyes every thing ; judging of all ; quick , active , ready ; never at a loss for an expedient , and urging on the work like a thorough-bred seaman as he was , who knew his own duty and how to make others do theirs . So went on the refitting of the " Centipede , " all through the burning hot tropical day ; and while the half-exhausted crew took a respite in the scorching noon for dinner , still their leader toiled on . Or , if he took a rest , it was in closely scrutinizing the progress made by his men , in puffing a cigar like to a small high-pressure engine , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signal-station , where he would peer away in all directions around the island  --  never missing the glance of a pelican 's pinion or the leap of a fish out of water . Then he would return to the cove and begin anew the work . It was no longer the elegant Captain Brand , in knee-breeches , point-lace sleeves , and velvet doublet , seated at his luxurious table , groaning under splendid plate , fine wines , and brilliant wax-lights , and dispensing a profuse hospitality , but Captain Brand the pirate , in tarry rig , amid sailors , sails , and cordage , munching a bit of hard biscuit at times , or a cube of salt-junk out of a mess kid , but ever ready , never weary , and always up to the professional mark . At the first gray blush of dawn on the following day Captain Brand was astir again , and before the sun went down behind the waves the schooner " Centipede " had been transformed into a brigantine , her fore-mast reduced , new standing rigging fitted for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised four or five feet by shifting bulwarks , and a temporary house built on deck over the long gun . She was also painted afresh , with a white streak ; and , with false head-boards on her bows to hide her snakelike snout of a cutwater , no one , unless in the secret , could have known that the clumsy box of a merchantman lying there was once the low , swift , piratical schooner which had made so notorious a name in the West Indies . Still the work was driven on with scarcely any intermission  --  a few hours ' repose for the crew at night , and an hour for dinner in the day ; but as for Captain Brand , he never slept at all  --  a doze for an hour or two , perhaps , on his settee in the saloon , and a cup of tea in the morning , with cigar-smoke , satisfied his frugal requirements . The next day , by noon , the water and stores were got on board the brigantine , her magazine stowed , the dunnage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's camphor trunks on board and cabin in order , the sails bent , anchors on the bows , and , swinging to a hawser made fast to the rocks , the vessel was ready to put to sea at any moment . " Pedillo , " said Captain Brand , as his vigilant gaze took in all around him and then rested on the " Centipede "  --  " Pedillo , you may warp the vessel down to the mouth of the Tiger 's Trap so soon as you 've strewed some fagots ready for lighting in the sheds . When you get to the Trap , tell the gunner to take a gang of hands and give that battery a good coat of coal tar , plug the vents of the guns , and bury carriages and all in the sand beside the magazine . Tell him to destroy the powder , and pitch overboard all he ca n't conceal ; and let him bear a hand about it , for we shall sail with the last of the sea-breeze toward sunset . " And , Pedillo "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " come back after the vessel is secured , and bring that Maltese fellow without a nose with you . It will be as well , perhaps , for you to provide yourself with a few fathoms of raw-hide strips , as we may have occasion to use it . Quien sabe ? " Senor Pedillo 's black wiry beard fairly bristled as he grinned understandingly at his superior ; and , getting into a bit of a canoe at the jetty , he paddled off to the brigantine to execute his orders . Meanwhile Captain Brand slowly bent his steps toward the house under the crag , and entered his spacious saloon for the last time . On the bare table , too , was his last dinner , served on a few odd dishes and cracked plates . " Babette , old girl ! " said he , as he sat down to this repast , " you have a bottle of good Madeira , and a flask of Hock left ? No ? " The negress shook her head violently , made the sign of the cross , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Padre Ricardo had dropped in , drained both bottles , and then had reeled off on board the brigantine . " The drunken selfish beast ! " muttered Captain Brand ; " it will be the last taste of wine he will swallow for a long time . " The pirate was quite correct in his schemes for the padre 's reform , for the next copious draught the holy father imbibed was the briny salt water from the Caribbean Sea . " Well , my Baba , a drop of water , then ! Thank you , old lady . Here 's to your health while I am gone . There  --  you need not blubber so over my hand  --  good-by ! " And so passed away from Captain Brand 's sight the only creature in the wide world who loved him . CHAPTER XXIV . CAUGHT IN A NET . " I closed my lids and kept them close , And the balls like pulses beat ; For the sky and the sea , and the sea and the sky , Lay like a load on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Captain Brand did not linger long over his frugal dinner , and when he had finished , as if he had not had enough exercise for the last three days , he began to walk with long nervous strides across the saloon . " He called me coward , did he ? and dared to lay his hands on me ! By my right arm , my Creole doctor , I 'll teach you not to call hard names again , and I 'll paralyze your hands for all time to come . " The pirate 's jaws grated like a rusty bolt as he hissed out these murderous threats ; but as his eye caught the squirming green silk rope as he swung round on his heel in his walk , he paused and muttered , " That bit of stuff may be of use . I 'll take it by way of precaution . " Hereupon he rapidly unrove the cord and coiled it away in the bosom of his shirt . Then looking at his watch , he said , " Ho ! the time approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he left his dwelling for the last time ; and , after pausing to hear a report from Pedillo that his orders had been executed and the vessel all ready for sea , and whispering a few precise directions in return , Captain Brand mounted up the steep face of the crag again , and accosted the signal-man at the station . " Any thing in sight ? " " Nothing to the eastward , capitano ; but it has been a little hazy here away to the southward since meridian , and I can hardly see through it . " " Bueno , my man ! give me the glass . You can go on board the brigantine . I 'll take a last look myself . " While the signal-man scrambled down the crag , Captain Brand rested the spy-glass on the trunk of the single cocoa-nut-tree , whose skeleton-like fingers of leaves rattled above his head like a gibbeted pirate in chains , and then he searched steadily along the hazy horizon . As he was about , however , to withdraw his eye from the tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention . Quickly dropping the glass , and as rapidly rubbing the large lens and carefully adjusting the joints , he raised it again , as a backwoodsman does his rifle with an Indian for a mark . For full five minutes the pirate stood as motionless as the crag beneath him , intently glaring through the tube at the speck in the distance . At last he let the glass fall at his side , and pulling out his watch with a jerk , he muttered to himself , " It is a large and lofty ship ; but , should she be a cruiser after me , she will find the bird flown and the nest empty . Ho , now for action ! " Springing down the precipitous declivity as he spoke , he paused a moment at a loophole of the vault beneath his dwelling , and puffing his cigar into a bright coal , he carefully twitched the match-rope which led to the train , opened the loose strands , and placed the fire to it . Waiting an instant till he saw the nitre sparkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swinging strides toward the sheds . There , glancing through the now deserted halls the crew had occupied , where quantities of fagots , and kindling-wood , and barrels of pitch were standing , he continued on till he came to the quarters of the doctor . The doctor was standing at the open door on the thatched piazza , looking quietly at the brigantine , whose sails were loosed , and the vessel hanging by a sternfast , with her head just abreast the Tiger 's Trap . " Ah ! Monsieur le Docteur , I have merely called to bid you a final adieu before I go on board ; and as I have a few moments left , and a few words to say , suppose you walk with me toward the chapel . Allons ! there is a suspicious sail off there , " waving his glass in the direction , " and I wish to take a good look at her . " " Doctor , " continued Captain Brand , as they reached the little esplanade facing the graves and church , " you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb Babette , and the chances are rather remote for your getting away , without , perhaps , some of the West India fleet should happen to drop in here , which I do not think probable . I rely , however , upon your keeping your oath , even if they do come , and not betraying the secrets you are acquainted with . " The pirate said this in an off-hand , friendly way , as he had his glass leveled toward the sail he saw in the offing . " Captain Brand , " replied the doctor , " I was deceived in coming here , as you well know ; but I shall religiously keep my oath for the twenty years , as I swore to do . After that , if we both live so long , my tongue and arm shall speak and strike . " The pirate stepped back a little as he shut up the joints of the spy-glass with a crash , and , with a scowl of hate and vengeance combined , he said , in a loud voice , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an iceberg , " And I , too , keep my oaths ; and , without waiting twenty years , I strike now ! " Even while the treacherous villain spoke , two swarthy , sinewy scoundrels crept stealthily from within the chapel , and , with the soft , slimy movements of serpents , as their leader uttered the last word , they sprang at the back of the doctor , and wound their coils around him , twining strong strands of raw-hide rope about his arms , legs , and body . Bound as in a frame of elastic steel , their victim was thrown , face downward , upon the sand . " Be quick , Pedillo ! the time is flying ! Gomez , bring the corpse trestle from the chapel . " In a moment a wooden frame with legs , and stretched across with a bed of light wire , which had been used to carry the mortal remains of the pirates  --  and the poor women , too , beside them  --  to their last resting-places , was brought out from the little church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face upward ; again the hide thongs were passed in numerous plaits until the body was lashed firmly to the trestle . " Place it on the edge of that rock there , with his head toward the cocoa-nut-tree . Take this silk rope , Gomez , and clove-hitch it well up the trunk . There , that will do . I myself will perform the last act of politeness . " Saying this , the pirate widened the noose of the cord , and , slipping it over the doctor 's head , he placed the knot carefully under his left ear . The victim gave no groan or sigh , and his dark , luminous eyes were fixed on the blue sky above him in heaven . " Monsieur le Docteur , " said Captain Brand , as he hurriedly looked at his watch and raised his hat , " I have but one word of caution to give you : if you struggle you will have your neck broken before you are stung to death ! Talk as much as you like ; but , as Babette is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I doubt if she comes to your assistance ! Adieu ! " Illustration : " A DULL , HEAVY , BOOMING ROAR , THAT SHOOK THE CRAG TO ITS BASE , ANNOUNCED THE RUIN OF THE PIRATES ' DEN . " The retreating figures went leaping toward the inlet , and , as they rushed through the sheds , applied a torch to the combustible material deposited there , and then sprang on toward the Tiger 's Trap . A few minutes afterward the doctor turned his eyes in that direction , and saw the sails of the brigantine sheeted home and run up like magic ; and , taking the last breath of the sea-breeze on her quarter , the sternfast was cast off , and she slipped easily out of the gorge-like channel . Still , as those dark stern eyes watched the receding hull of the " Centipede , " a sudden jar shook the island , a heavy column of white smoke rose from below the crag like a water-spout , and , spreading out like a palm-tree , came down in a deluge of timber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaped out from the gloom , and an awful peal , followed by a heavy , booming roar , that shook the crag to its base , announced the ruin of the pirate 's den . At the same time the red fires gleamed in fitful flashes from the sheds , and , rapidly making headway , all at once burst forth in wild conflagration , till the whole nest was wrapped in flames . The shock of the explosion and the fires killed the wind , and a lurid pall of smoke and cinders hung like a gloomy canopy over the island . CHAPTER XXV . THE MOUSE THAT GNAWED THE NET . " There passed a weary time . Each throat Was parched , and glazed each eye . A weary time ! a weary time ! How glazed each weary eye ! When , looking westward , I beheld A something in the sky . " As the powder vomited forth its dreadful thunder , and as the stones and timbers from the blasted den were hurled high in air , and scattered by the explosive whirlwind far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in dropping hail upon the red-tiled sheds and the doctor 's dwelling . At the first shock the lonely child started up in his little bed , and while the earth rocked and the stones came pelting and crashing on the roof , he screamed , " Mamma ! mamma ! " No loving echo came back to those innocent lips , and naught was heard save the crackling of the flame beyond , licking its tongue along the dry timber and roaring joyously as it was fed . " Mamma ! chere mamma ! " Yet no answer , and still the savage flames came careering wildly on till the very stones of the court-yard cracked like slates , while the burning flakes and cinders loaded the air , and the eddying volumes of smoke reeled in dense clouds , and poured their suffocating breath into the room where the forsaken child was crying . One more panting , helpless cry , and the little fellow instinctively flew through the open doorway , where , blinded and choking with the devastating element around him , he staggered feebly beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted up the forked and vivid flames , and chased the child before it . Oh , fond mother ! in your poignant grief for the loss of your poor drowned boy , you were spared the agony of seeing him , even in imagination , struggling faintly before that tempest of fire and smoke , calling plaintively for her on whose tender bosom his head had rested , while his naked feet were cut and bruised by the sharp coral shingle beneath them . But onward and onward the boy wandered , and fortunately his footsteps took the path into a purer atmosphere which led toward the chapel . Here he looked timidly around at the lurid glare behind him , and then entered the church and sank down exhausted , his feverish , smarting eyes closing in slumber on the hard pavement beneath the image of the Virgin Mary . Then came the close and sultry night  --  no murmur of a land-wind to drive the smoky canopy away  --  the black cinders falling in burning rain on basin , thicket , and lagoon , till even the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crevices of the rocks . Midnight came . The dim and silent stars were obscured by a veil of heavy clouds , and with a low , muttering sound of thunder , the vapory masses unclosed their portals , and the rain fell in torrents . The flames , now nearly satisfied with their work , leaped out occasionally from the fallen ruins , but were quenched by the tropical deluge , and smouldered away amid the charred and saturated timbers . Then the thunder ceased , the lizards and scorpions came from their retreats , the teal fluttered over the lagoon , and the noise of the waves bursting over the reef came again to the ear . Still there was no breath of air ; the atmosphere was thick and damp ; and out from the mangrove thickets and wide expanse of cactus , swarms of insects , musquitoes , and sand-flies in myriads went buzzing and singing in the sultry , murky night . So dragged on the weary hours until day broke again , and the sea-birds floated off seaward for their morning 's meal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave , as the dolphins glittered in gold and purple after them below the blue water . No bright and blazing sun came over the hills of Cuba to light up this picture , but all was blight and gloom , with murky masses of dead , still clouds hanging low down over the island . The little suffering boy , lying there on the coral pavement , with his head resting on the thin , delicate arm , with pale , sweet face turned half upward toward the Virgin , gave a feeble cry and opened his eyes . He rose to a sitting posture , with his little hands resting on his lap and little ragged shirt . Then , with his dim hazel eyes fixed upon the painting , while the tears coursed slowly down his pallid cheeks , he put forth his hands in a childish movement of supplication , and murmured again his tearful prayer , " Mamma ! mamma ! " Presently rising , he turned his feeble footsteps toward the doorway , and as his eye caught the stone bowl of holy water standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his feverish head and slaked his parched lips . Revived by this , he timidly looked out from the chapel , and shuddering as he beheld the gloomy wilderness around , he once more screamed in a thin piercing cry , " Mamma ! oh , ma chere mamma ! " That was the last sad wail for help for many and many a long year that those infant lips were destined to utter ; and when he again called upon that dear name , his manly arms would clasp a joyful mother to his swelling heart . " Henri ! " came back like an echo in a clear shout to the shriek of the boy . " Henri ! Henri ! " was reiterated again and again , each time in a voice that seemed to split asunder the canopy of clouds above . The boy started and listened . " Henri ! Henri ! this way to your good friend the doctor ! Quick , my little boy ! " Now with the step of a fawn the child ran out upon the sharp sandy esplanade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow pathway between the needle-pointed cactus , in a moment he stopped , with a look of horror , beside the trestle on which the bound and nearly naked man was stretched . Ay , it was a sight to make a strong and stalwart man turn pale with sickness and horror , much less a baby-boy of three or four years old . There lay the man , all through the dreadful night , with swarms on swarms and myriads upon myriads of stinging insects , biting and sipping , and sucking his life-blood with distracting agony away . Ah ! think of the hellish torture often practiced by those bloody pirates upon their victims in the West Indies ! The bound man 's eyes were closed , the lips and cheeks puffed and swollen out of all human proportions , and the inflamed body was one glowing red and angry surface . No needle could have been stuck where the venomous stings of a thousand sand-flies or musquitoes had not already sucked blood . Ay , well might the child start back with horror ! " It is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French , still in a strong but kindly voice . " I can not see you , but get me a knife . No , my child , never mind  --  you can not find one ; do n't leave me . " Here the child timidly put his little hands out and brushed away the poisonous insects , and then touched the doctor 's face . " Ah ! Henri , see if you can not slip that pretty silk rope over my head ; yes , that is the way  --  doucement  --  easily , my child ! Well , now , my Henri , you are weak and sick , my poor little boy ; but listen to me  --  yes , I feel your little hands on my eyes . Well , bite upon that cord that goes across my throat . Bite till it snaps asunder ! I am nearly choking , little one ; but do n't cry . " True , the strips of raw-hide , which had partially slackened in the rain that had washed the body of the victim , now began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lay half hidden in the swollen throat , stomach , and limbs of the tortured sufferer . Henri 's sharp little teeth fastened upon the strand , biting and gnawing , until finally it was severed , and the doctor gave a great sigh of relief . Illustration : " AH ! HENRI , SEE IF YOU CAN NOT SLIP THAT PRETTY SILK ROPE OVER MY HEAD . " " Blessings on you , my poor boy ! " he murmured , painfully . " Now bite away on the strands which bind the arm . There ! Do n't ! do n't hurry ! Rest a little , my child ! Ah ! it is well ! " Again those sharp little teeth of a mouse had gnawed through the net which bound the lion-hearted man ; the ends of the raw-hide drew back and twisted into spiral curls , and the right arm , though numbed and four times its original size , was free . " Thanks be to God for all His mercies ! " exclaimed the doctor , as with difficulty he raised his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lids from his closed eyes  --  " and to you , my little friend , for saving this wretched life ! " Waiting a few moments to recover his strength , the doctor made a mighty effort , and some of the coils whose strands had been cut by those little teeth yielded and gradually unrove , so as to leave the upper part of his body free . Then , while the child was once more cutting the lashings of his feet , he himself unfastened the knots of his left arm , and by a vigorous effort he tore the net from off him and sat upright . Clasping his numbed and swollen hands together , he turned his face and almost sightless eyes to heaven . " May this awful trial serve as a partial forgiveness of my sins , and make me a better man ! " He paused , and laid his heavy arms around the child , while warm and grateful tears trickled down his cheeks . Slowly , and like a drunken man , his feet sought the sand , and then , weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path , the boy tripping lightly before him , till he fell exhausted on the floor of the chapel . " Water , my Henri ! water ! " The child scooped it out from the stone bowl with his tiny hands and sprinkled it on his friend 's face . " There , that will suffice , my brave boy ! Lay your cheek to mine ! " What a sight it was  --  that dark , swollen , yet powerful frame lying on the coral pavement , and the innocent child , like a dewdrop on the leaf of a red tropical flower , nestling close beside it ! CHAPTER XXVI . THE HURRICANE . " ' T was off the Wash  --  the sun went down  --  the sea looked black and grim , For stormy clouds with murky fleece were mustering at the brim ; Titanic shades ! enormous gloom ! as if the solid night Of Erebus rose suddenly to seize upon the light ! It was a time for mariners to bear a wary eye , With such a dark conspiracy between the sea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canopy of dark , murky clouds fell lower and lower , until they nearly touched the earth , wrapping as in a blanket the single cocoa-nut-tree on the crag , and shutting out the light and air of heaven as they settled over the noxious lagoon , the mangrove thickets , and pure inlet . The sea-birds came screaming in from seaward , fluttering their wide-spread wings in the sultry atmosphere , and alighting on the smooth rocks , where they furled their pinions and put their heads together . The flying-fish no longer skimmed over the waves , and the dolphin and shark sank deep down in the blue water , or lay still and quiet beside the coral groves . The rolling , swelling ocean of the tropic , with its glassy , greasy surface unruffled by the faintest air , rolled heavily on until it struck the coral ledge , when , with a dull , heavy roar , it broke over in creamy foam , and came sluggishly in to the sandy beach . There the tiny waves lashed the shelly strand , and all was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birds , and serpents , and insects gasped for breath . The fish below the sea , the animated nature above , and the very leaves and vines of the forests and thickets knew what was brewing in the great vacuum around . Slowly and painfully the man in the chapel regained his feet , and with the child by the hand , moved on to the farthest corner by the rude altar , where he sank down again , and , clasping the boy to his heart , waited in breathless awe . As if the powder and flames had not done their destructive work , the wrath of heaven was to be poured out over the devoted den of the pirates . Then came a bellowing roar as a current of wind swept over the sea , cutting a pathway in the blue water , and scooping it up in an impalpable mist , hurrying on to the low beach of the island , and tearing the sand and shells up in heaps  --  and then a lull . Now , as if all the demons of winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth , and like the shocks of artillery , volley upon volley , came the hurricane . The sea became one boiling , seething , hissing surface of foam , pressed and flattened by the weight of the tempest , which laid the black rocks bare on the ledge , and drove the water into both mouths of the inlet , until , with a crashing shock , it met in the basin , and broke over and over the cove , and high up the wall of rocks on the other side . Two or three streams of whirlwind meeting , too , over the island , drove the lagoon hither and thither , catching up the white pond-lilies by their long stems , twisting off the dense thickets of mangroves by the roots , burrowing holes in the sandy beds of the cactus , and shearing off their flat , thorny leaves and needle points by the acre together ; then a rushing whirl around the cocoa-nuts , bowing their tufted tops at first till they nearly touched the earth , when , the stout trunks snapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base to crown , careering and dancing aloft , borne away with sand and mangrove , cactus , flowers , and sticks , into the flying clouds before the hurricane . Then another lull ; and from the opposite direction again thundered the terrible breath of the demons , sweeping thousands of sea-birds , with broken pinions , screaming amid the gale , hurling them against the crag , stripping the feathers from their crushed carcasses , and in a moment burying them a foot deep in clouds of sand . No more pauses or lulls now in the hurtling tempest ; but with a steady , tremendous roar , which made the earth tremble , the rocks quake , and laid every vestige of vegetation flat to the ground , it came on mightier and mightier , and fiercer and fiercer , with black masses of never-ending clouds sweeping close down like dark midnight , as if heaven and earth had come together . All through the gloomy day and through the night this elemental war , with its legions of careering demons , continued to lash the sea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vengeance , the clouds belched forth in red lightning , vomiting out peal upon peal of awful thunder as a parting salute , and then , moderating down to a hard gale from another quarter , broke away . The blue sky appeared , and the glorious sun once more came up in his majesty over the distant hills of Cuba . CHAPTER XXVII . THE VIRGIN MARY . " A weary weed , tossed to and fro , Drearily drenched in the ocean brine , Soaring high and sinking low , Lashed along without will of mine ; Sport of the spoom of the surging sea ; Flung on the foam , afar and near , Mark my manifold mystery  --  Growth and grace in their place appear . " With the boy clasped to his heart , the doctor sat beside the altar of the chapel during all the direful strife without , shielding his little charge from the clouds of fine sand and rubbish that every few minutes came swirling within the temple , dashing the padre 's candlesticks into battered lumps of brass on the pavement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls by the pirates . But , as if in mercy to the trustful souls lying there , the Virgin Mary still looked down in sweet pity upon them , and the little chapel stood unharmed . When at last , however , the hurricane 's back was broken , and Aeolus had reined up his maddened chargers and curbed their flying wings , and when all the demons of the wind had gone moaningly back to their caverns in the clouds , the doctor arose , and with the boy beside him , knelt devoutly before the altar while he uttered a fervent prayer of thanksgiving . " Come , my Henri , now we may go out and see if we can find something to eat and drink . You are weak and hungry , my poor little boy ; but you shall not suffer much longer . " That strong man , with the heart of a gentle woman , had no thought of how ill , and famished , and thirsty he himself was from the terrible torture he had endured . No , he only thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the chapel the sand and bushes were piled up in ridgy heaps , the coral wall around the cemetery had been thrown down , while the flat head-stones over the pirates ' graves had disappeared entirely . Not so , however , with the white slabs near by where those poor doomed women were lying ; for the hurricane had spared their tombs , and a pall of pure white sand was sprinkled evenly over their remains . Bending over them was the trunk of the cocoa-nut , with its top stripped and its leafless branches quivering in the wind ; while from below them streamed out the long , thin green silk rope which had so often served Captain Brand , the pirate , for his private executions . Near at hand lay the trestle on which the doctor had been stretched  --  caught by the base of the cocoa-nut column , and half buried in sand  --  while the cruel strips of raw-hide which had lashed the victim down were tied and twisted into a maze of complicated knots by the nimble fingers of the winds . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anger as he beheld the unconscious implements designed for his torturing murder ; and leaving the child at the doorway to the chapel , he sallied out , detached the rope , loosened the trestle from its sandy bed , and placed them in a corner of the chapel . Then carefully picking his way , with the boy in his great arms , over the trees and debris which obstructed the pathway , he speedily reached the site on which had stood the sheds of the " Centipede 's " crew . Fire , water , and wind had done their work effectually , though the fire had partially spared the detached storehouse and shed which he had shared with the infamous padre . All else was a ruin of loose blocks of stone , broken tiles , nearly buried in banks of sand . From a well in the once busy court-yard , and which had also escaped the devouring elements , the doctor drew a bucket or two of water , in which he slaked the boy 's thirst and then his own , and afterward poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smouldering beam which puffed out at intervals a thin curl of smoke from beneath one of the sheds , he lit a fire in the court-yard , while from the wreck of the storeroom he succeeded in rescuing some hard biscuit and a ham . This last he tore in shreds , and placing them on sticks before the fire , they were thus enabled to make a hearty meal , first providing for the wants of the child , however  --  soaking the biscuit for him , as if it were his first duty on earth . Again raising the boy in his arms , he passed from the ruined sheds and bent his steps toward Captain Brand 's former dwelling . The road was heaped with shells and sand , strewed with shoals of dead fish and wounded or dying birds , while the wreck of a boat , mingled with the timbers and planks of the jetty to the basin , were lying pell-mell on the beach of the little cove . Casting his eyes around in search of the once spacious dwelling , with its vaults , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace a vestige of the structure . The powder , more destructive even than the hurricane , had tossed walls and building into a confused heap of rubbish ; then came the wind and sand on top of the rocks which had tumbled down by the concussion of the first explosion , and then the water , packing all together as if no habitation had ever existed there . The doctor walked slowly around until he came to the angle where the kitchen once was , and there , three fourths hidden beneath a mass of blackened stones and charred timber , peered forth the white skeleton of a human being . The flesh had been seared and burned from the face and skull by the instantaneous flash of the powder , and there lay the remains of Babette , whitely bleached , as if she had been thrown a lifeless corpse on the sea-beach . A few yards below this frightful spectacle lay a number of shattered boxes and trunks , then a confused bundle of clothes , and a sandy saturated collection of kitchen utensils and crockery . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many a cruel scene , ignorant or uncertain of the warning given her by the master she loved , had fallen another tribute to his long list of victims . The doctor only waited long enough to select a few necessary articles from the heterogeneous heap before him , and then , with the child still clinging contentedly to his shoulder , he returned to the chapel . CHAPTER XXVIII . THE ARK THAT JACK BUILT . " Good heaven , befriend that little boat , And guide her on her way ! A boat , they say , has canvas wings , But can not fly away ; Though , like a merry singing-bird , She sits upon the spray . " The land wind sighed and murmured ; the sea-breeze wafted its rustling influence over the waves ; the long swells broke over the ledge ; the inlet flowed pure and limpid ; and the gulls and sea-mews floated gracefully over the reef , as if a hurricane had never poured its baneful wrath upon it or the lonely island . Day by day and week by week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and better , worked and worked . He with his great arms hewing and sawing , and the child attending upon him like a shadow . By great toil and exertion the doctor had succeeded in placing some of the timbers of the jetty together as launching-ways , and on the cradle he had laid the wreck of the old boat . Then , with an old saw and some tools he found near the site of the mat sheds by the cove , he began to build the frail ark which was to carry him and the child from the hated island . From the storehouse , too , he obtained plenty of provisions to supply their wants , and old sails and rope he found in abundance . Babette 's collection of worldly wealth provided them with linen and clothing , together with utensils for eating and drinking ; and he had made their dwelling in the little chapel clean and habitable . Here they slept by night on an old sail , and soundly too , the sleep of repentance and innocence . With the early morning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cove . The little fellow was clean and tidy now , dressed in a little loose calico frock , and a queer contrivance of an old bonnet fashioned out of Babette 's gear , and on his feet were a pair of little canvas slippers , stitched for him by his protector . After a bath in the basin of the inlet the fire was kindled , and the simple breakfast prepared . Then , while the strong man hewed , and sawed , and hammered beneath a temporary awning which covered the open workshop , the boy would pick up shells along the cove , or with a little rod and line , seated on a flat rock near by , jerk out fish from the basin to serve for dinner . Sometimes he would wander about in search of nails and spikes for the boat , or gather sticks for the fire , but never out of hail , and never beyond the watchful eyes of his friend . Yes , those watchful , kind eyes followed his slightest movements ; and while the hammer was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chipping away a timber , his pleasant voice sang Creole songs to the child , or encouraged his innocent prattle . A loaded musket , which , with some ammunition , he had dug out from the wreck of his old quarters , stood leaning against an upright post under the shade , and woe to the man or beast that might have dared to approach the boy ! In the burning heat of the tropical day the labor ceased , and the child either lay on his back on the soft sand beneath the awning , kicking up his little legs , watching the small gulls as they skimmed across the basin , or , with his brown curly head resting on the doctor 's knees , slept sweetly . Happy and contented he was , too , with the return of health and strength ; and if his budding memory looked back to her he had lost , and the recollection of his faithful Banou , it was only for a moment , and , like a childish dream , it passed away . Illustration : BUILDING THE BOAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done for the day , the doctor , with Henri in his arms and the musket on his shoulder , would climb the crag , and peer all around the island ; but never a sail did he see from the hour the " Centipede " spread her canvas , while he lay helplessly bound on the trestle with the green noose around his neck . As the twilight faded , the sole human occupants of the island returned to the chapel , and when they had said a simple prayer , kneeling before the Virgin , they laid themselves down on their canvas bed to rest till the dawn . Many a silent hour in the watches of the tedious night did the doctor lie awake , while the cool sweet breath of the child fanned his cheek as he lay nestling beside him , pondering and wondering on the fate of his charge . He knew absolutely nothing about his history save that he had been pitched overboard from the brig the pirates were robbing ; but what was the name or nation of the vessel , where from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had questioned the leader Gibbs on that occasion after the chase by the corvette , when he had lopped off the brute 's leg ; but , what with suffering and drink , the ruffian had either forgotten the brig 's name , or feigned to , and all he could impart was the belief that she was an English trader . Even from the boy , too , the doctor could elicit nothing of importance , though day by day he tried every means of leading the child 's mind back to the past , but always with the same result . " Oui , ma chere mama ! Bon Banou ! " and " Ma petite cousine , Rosalie ! " These were the only words the little fellow had to link his fate with the future , and even they became fainter and fainter on his mind and tongue as the time passed on . With this delicate web around the destiny of the child , and that he spoke French , and had evidently been tenderly nurtured , the doctor was forced to be content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so the work went on , and the little ark began to assume a wholesome look , and to be capable of plowing the distant main . Then , when she was planked up , with a gunwale on , and half-decked over forward , she was calked , and the seams payed with pitch . When all ready for launching , early one morning the doctor and the boy went gayly down to the cove . There , as the first golden rays of the rising sun shot athwart the inlet , Henri stood up in the bows , and with a large pearl-shell of pure spring water , he waved his tattered bonnet round his curly locks , and with childish delight , as the vessel began to move , he emptied the shell of its sparkling treasure , shouting , as she slid off the ways into the basin , " Ma petite cousine Rosalie ! " The builder , too , took off his hat and shouted , in his deep bass , till the rocks gave back the echo of " Rosalie ! Rosalie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her captain and crew , and there she rode on the basin , a little pinnace of about ten tons , which had been once used to carry anchors , chains , and stores about the harbor . A week or two more , and she was fitted with a single mast , stepped well in the bows , for a jib and one square lug-sail . Then ballast in bags of sand was laid along her keelson , and a couple of breakers of fresh water got on board , together with a quantity of cooked salt meat and hard biscuit stowed away under the half-deck forward  --  where , too , was a cozy little nest of spare canvas , with an oakum pillow , for the boy ! Yes , there lay the good ship " Rosalie , " outward bound , with sails bent and gear rove , cargo on board , and waiting for a wind . Meanwhile the doctor had tried her under sail , and satisfied himself that every thing worked well , and that she was in proper trim . Then he moored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moon to light him on his voyage . Whither ? Carefully , too  --  like one who had passed a lifetime on the ocean , from the China Seas to the broad Atlantic , under the suns of the tropics as well as in the dim gloom of high latitudes  --  the doctor studied the clouds and watched their course , noting the flight of the birds in the air and the track of fish in the sea . At last the trade breezes began to blow regularly and steadily ; the land winds , too , in the gray of the morning , fluttered timidly away out to sea , and the round pearly moon shone bright and mellow over rock and water . " To-morrow , my brave boy , we shall sail away from the island . Ah ! you clap your hands , eh ? Yes , we shall go to find mamma ! " This was said as man and child stood for the last time on the lofty crag , while the former ranged his dark eyes scrutinizingly around the horizon . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where , for the first time in all their association , putting the child to sleep by himself , the doctor sat down on the trestle by the entrance , and , lighted by the brilliant moon , he caught up the tangled mazes of the hide net which had bound him , and sedulously applied himself to a task before him . Any one who has seen the effect produced by a violent gale upon the tattered shreds of a shivered main-top-sail , bound up into the most tortuous knots that it is possible to conceive of , and so hard and solid that you might saw the canvas balls in slices like boards , may form some idea of the task the doctor had imposed upon himself to loosen the hide strands tied together by the furious fingers of the hurricane . Patiently and quietly , with no sign of temper , he applied himself to the work , and with nothing but a sharp-pointed spike to aid his hands , he began to unravel , bit by bit , the laced knots and bunches of raw-hide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon sank glimmering down , the tangled mass lay in clear coils beside him  --  though in several pieces , where it had been severed by the teeth of that little mouse purring behind the altar  --  and the task was done . Then raising the trestle , he bore it within the altar , and with the now unraveled coil of hide , and the softer silk rope for a pillow , he again stretched himself upon what once had been his bed of torture . For what possible object all this labor had been undertaken , or for what future purpose  --  vague they must have been  --  no one but the persevering man who did it can tell ; and there he lay , no sound coming from his compressed lips till the day dawned . Then he arose , and , kneeling over the sleeping child , he again solemnly repeated the oath he had before taken in his hut  --  " Sleeping or waking , on land or sea , I devote the remainder of my wretched life to returning this lost child to his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirred , as if the angels and the sweet Virgin were whispering their protecting power over him , and , with a smile dawning upon his rosy , dimpled cheeks , he raised the lids from his bright hazel eyes , and put his fat round arms around the doctor 's neck . If two great drops fell upon that upturned innocent little face from the dark full eyes bending over him , they were not tears of sorrow ! Oh , no ! It was the dew of hope and trustfulness falling from the soul of a repentant sinner relying upon an all-wise Providence . " Come , my Henri , say your little prayer of the morning , and we will go . " The man had taught the child that little prayer which he himself had learned at his mother 's knee . Up again to the crag , and down to the shelly margin of the shore ; and a long look the man gave at the ruin of shed and den , as he gently placed the child on a sand-bag in the stern-sheets of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vessel to the hated strand , hoisted the sail , and , as she bubbled along the inlet with the first sigh of the land wind , he stood at the helm with his bare head lighted up by the beams of the rising sun , and his lips moved in prayer . On , noiselessly through the Tiger 's Trap sailed the little pinnace till she bowed her rugged cutwater in the yielding waves , and with her square lug-sail swelling gently to the freshening breeze , she held her course to sea . I question much if the stanch brigantine , named the " Centipede , " which had preceded her through this tiger 's gorge , with all the ruffianly crew that manned her , and their villainous captain on her quarter-deck , stood half the chance of a prosperous voyage as the tiny ark , called the " Rosalie , " which followed , with her noble , brave commander , and his weak and boyish mate . Who can tell ? END OF PART I. PART II . CHAPTER XXIX . LAYING UP THE STRANDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifting Currents of the restless main , Till in sheltered coves and reaches Of sandy beaches , All have found repose again . " It was in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and twenty-two , and in the broad and commodious harbor of Kingston , a great mercantile haven , crowded with shipping from all parts of the commercial globe ; landlocked by reef and ridge , with the rocks and heights crowned by frowning batteries of heavy cannon ; while beyond were spread the lower and upper town , in masses of low two-story buildings , with piazzas , bright green jalousies , stately palm , tamarind , and cocoa-nut-trees waving above them . At the mouth of the harbor strait , where stands Fort Augusta , lay a magnificent double-banked American frigate , with a broad blue swallow-tailed pennant at her main , standing out stiff , like a dog-vane , from the lofty mast , as the ship rode to the strong sea-breeze . The stays and rigging came down from trucks , cross-trees , and tops in straight black lines , from the great length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and from side to side , till they met the long majestic hull and taper head-booms ; while below were two rows of ports , with the guns run out and the brass tompions gleaming in their muzzles . The awnings were spread in one flat extended sheet of white cotton canvas from bowsprit to taffrail , and from the wide-spread lower booms at the fore-chains boats were riding by their painters . Within a cable 's length of the frigate 's black quarter lay a low rakish schooner , like a minnow alongside a whale , with a thin little coach-whip streaming from her main-mast head , a long brass gun amidships , and looking as trig and tidy as a French maid beside her portly mistress . The bell struck in twin notes eight on board the frigate , echoed back from the pigmy schooner in a faint , double succession of tinkles ; the whistles resounded from deck to deck in ear-splitting notes , surging and chirruping all together , and then suddenly ceasing with a rattling beat of a drum and a short bellow of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main deck , and about the spar-deck battery forward of the main-mast , sat five hundred lusty sailors on the white decks around their mess-cloths , bolting hot pea soup after their grog , and chatting and laughing in a devil-may-care sort of a strain , as if the grub was good and the timbers sound , as they were , of the stanch frigate beneath them . No noise , no confusion , but just as polite and courteous , in their honest , seamanlike way , as half a legion of French dancing-masters , they whacked off the salt pork before them with their sheath-knives , munching the flinty biscuit , and all as happy and careless of the past and future as clams at high water . Ay , there they clustered , those five hundred sailors , in their snowy duck trowsers and white , coarse linen frocks , with the blue collars laid square back over their broad shoulders , exposing their bronzed and hairy throats , wagging their jaws , and ready at any moment , at the tap of the drum , day or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battery dance a jig as the solid iron food went amid sheets of flame toward a foe . Yes , and ready , too , in the gentle breeze or the howling tempest , to leap at the shrill pipe of the whistle from the busy deck or their snug hammocks , and , like so many monkeys , jump up the shrouds , lie out on the enormous yards while the frigate was plunging bows under in the tumultuous seas , grasp the writhing canvas in their sinewy paws , and wrap it up close and tight in the hempen gaskets . Man-of-war sailors , for battle , or gale , or spree , every one of them . On board that little consort near were about forty more of the same sort , only older , more bronzed , and more deliberate and methodical in manner , sipping their pea pottage after blowing away the steam , cutting their pork after much reflection , and cracking their biscuit tranquilly . Their conversation , too , was slow and dignified , each word well considered before it came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as did the younger harum-scarum chaps in the big ship near . But yet those weather-beaten old sons of Neptune , who had each one of them seen sights that would make your hair stand on end to think of , could handle that schooner when her low deck was buried waist-deep to the combings of the main hatch in angry water , and make that Long Tom amidships there spin round on its pivot , and never threw away idly one of its solid globular messengers . Ay , trust them for that . Then honor to them all , those gallant tars who have fought the battles of our country by sea and lake , and upheld those Stars and Stripes until they are respected to the uttermost ends of the earth ! Glory to them , ye wise legislators , who sit in council upon the nation 's wealth and grandeur ! Think of the fearless arms that have shielded your otherwise unprotected shores when circled in a ring of dreadful fire from the guns of a haughty foe . Illustration : THE UNITED STATES FRIGATE " MONONGAHELA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! whose valuable cargoes roll hither and thither over the trackless deep , cared for by those toiling tars who fight and bleed for the flag that waves o'er your treasure  --  in stinging gale , with frozen fingers , or under burning suns , with panting breasts  --  think of them when your noble ships come gallantly into your superb ports , and unlade their floating mines of wealth into your spacious warehouses , while you in your lordly mansions sip your wine ! Think of those arms grasping the shivering sail in the mighty tempest , in the black night , and the coarse fare they eat , the sometimes putrid water they drink , and the hard beds they lie upon , while you are reposing on downy pillows with your wives and little ones beside you ! Ah ! take pity on the sailor , and scatter your shining gold over him in his distress . When the time comes , as come it may , when the cannon of a hostile fleet are thundering at your ports ; when your lumbering craft are flying before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hissing through the pure air , bursting in your marble palaces and blasting your stores of wealth to dust , then you will turn with blanched faces to the sea , and wonder why you have so long forgotten the noble hearts and stalwart arms that once were thrown around you . But not before . On the flush quarter-deck of the frigate , by the raised signal lockers abaft , stood a bronzed old quarter-master , a spy-glass resting on his arm , through which every minute he peered around the harbor , giving an eye , too , occasionally to the half-hour glass , whose sands dribbled steadily into the lower bulb on the locker beside him . What cared he  --  no wife or child to cheer him ! No cares save but to see that the ensign did not roll foul of the halyards , that the broad pennant blew out straight , that the half-hour glass did not need turning , and that no boat approached the frigate without his reporting it to the officer of the watch . Naught else save , perhaps , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there on the gun-deck , had wiped from his lips the moisture of the midday grog , and would be up in time to take the relief while the pea soup was warm . Nothing else . The lieutenant of the watch briskly paced the solid deck , scrubbed white as milk with lime-juice and molasses , the even seams between the planks glistening like the strands of a girl 's raven tresses as his profane and rapid feet pressed upon them . What thought he in his careless walk , with the gleaming bunch of bullion on his right shoulder , sword by his side , white trowsers , and gilt eagle buttons on his navy-blue coat ? He was thinking how his pittance of pay would support , in a scrimpy way , his poor mother and sister , who looked unto him as their only hope and refuge . And he thought , too , as he tramped that noble deck , made glorious by many a battle and victory in which he had borne a humble part , that his rich and powerful country would eventually reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar which lay alone in his trowsers pocket , and the light mist which arose off there beyond the Apostles ' Battery , opposite Port Royal Harbor , an evidence of one or a sign of the last aspiration ? We hope not ; but we shall see. * Three or four midshipmen , too , pranced over that frigate 's white quarter-deck , on the port side , in their blue jackets and duck trowsers . Little gay madcaps they were , scarcely well into their teens , with little glittering toasting-forks of dirks dangling at their sides , and ready for any lark or mischief . And what thought those boyish imps of reefers ? Did they trace the flight of that tropic man-of-war bird , sailing high up in the heavens , heading seaward , away into the distant future , through clouds and sunshine , rain and storm ? And did they think , as they fluttered along the deck , that their own career might lead them in that direction , toward the star of promotion which shone so brightly near at hand , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to come tumbling down with a crippled pinion , and hobble out their lives on shore ? No . Those gay young blades , whose mothers were dreaming and sighing for them , had no reflections of that kind . They were chattering about the little frolic they had on their last liberty day , when the captain ordered them off to the frigate at sunset , and planning another for the week to come . Happy little scamps , let them dance their careless thoughts away ! " Two bells , sir , " said the quarter-master to the officer of the watch . " Very good ! Young gentlemen , tell the boatswain to turn the hands to , and have the barge manned . Let the first lieutenant and the marine officer know that the commodore is going to leave the ship . There , no larking on the quarter-deck , Mr. Mouse ! " This last command was addressed to a tiny youngster who was hardly big enough to go without pantalettes , much less to wear a jacket and order half a hundred huge sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be his great-grandfather . But yet that small lad did it , and could steer a boat , too , or fly about like a ribbon in a high wind up there in the mizzen-top , while the men on the yard were taking the last reef in the top-sail . " Go down to the cabin , sir , and let the commodore and his friend know the boat is ready . " Down the ladder skipped Mr. Mouse , and while he was gone , the guard , in their white summer uniform and cross-belts , stood at ease , resting on their muskets on the quarter-deck , eight side-boys and the boatswain at the starboard gangway , with the first lieutenant and the officer of the watch standing near . Presently there came up from the after cabin hatchway a fine , handsome man , in the very prime of life , in cocked hat , full-dress coat , a pair of gleaming epaulets , sword by his hip , and his nether limbs cased in white knee-breeches , silk stockings , and pumps . The one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grizzled locks , a dark , stern face , and without epaulets . The first raised his hat as he stepped on the quarter-deck  --  not a thread of silver was seen in his dark hair  --  and then both bowed to the officers , who saluted them as they moved toward the gangway . The boatswain piped , the marines presented arms , the drum gave three quick rolls , and the commodore went over the gangway , preceded by his companion .  --   --  - * This was written before the " Pay Bill " was passed . CHAPTER XXX . OLD FRIENDS . " What though when storms our bark assail , The needle trembling veers , When night adds horror to the gale , And not a star appears ? True to the pole as I to thee , It faithful still will prove  --  An emblem dear of constancy , And of a sailor 's love . " The barge left the side of the frigate , a broad blue pennant with white stars on a staff at her bow , with fourteen handsome sailors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with straw hats and flowing black ribbons around them , on which was stamped in gold letters , " Monongahela . " The double bank of white ash oars flashed in the rippling waves of the harbor as the barge was urged over the water , the current seething and buzzing under her bows , and bubbling into her wake as she flew on toward the town . In a mahogany box at the stern sat a bushy-whiskered coxswain , whose body swayed to the stroke of the oars , while his hand grasped the brass tiller as he steered amid the shipping . The commodore had settled himself down under the boat 's awning on the snow-white covered cushions in the stern-sheets , and , with one foot resting on the elegant ash grating beneath , he began to talk to the grave gentleman who sat opposite to him . " It is many a long year since I last visited this superb harbor , but I remember it as if it were yesterday . You never were here before , I think ? No ? Well , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was first lieutenant of the old ' Scourge , ' are yet alive , we shall have a pleasant time ! " " One fine fellow , " went on the commodore , " I know is . His name is Piron . I had a note from him as soon as the frigate anchored yesterday , and I shall ask him to dine sociably with me on board this evening . I hope you will join us . " The grave gentleman said that he had business which would detain him on shore all night . The barge swept up to the mole , the oars were thrown up at a wave of the coxswain 's hand , and came into the boat on either side like shutting up a pair of fans , while the boat-hooks checked her way , and she remained stationary at the steps of the landing . The awning was canted , the commodore and his friend got out and mounted the stairway , while the boat 's crew stood up with their hats off . On the mole were four or five people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and broad Guayaquil sombreros . " Cleveland ! " exclaimed a tall , handsome man , as he seized the commodore by both hands , " how glad we are to see you ! Here is Tom Stewart , and Paddy Burns , and little Don Stingo , attorneys , factors , and sugar-boilers , all of us delighted to welcome you back once more to Jamaica ! " Crowding about the commodore , shaking hands and slapping one another on the back , standing off a step or two to see the effect of time on each other 's appearance , laughing heartily with many a happy allusion to days gone by , those old friends and former companions , unmindful of the hot sun , stood there with their faces lighted up and talking all together . " And you are a commodore , eh ! Cleveland , with a broad pennant and a squadron ? Ah ! we have kept the run of you , though . Read all about that action you were in with the ' President , ' and that bloody battle in the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Porter . And here you are again , safe and sound , and hearty ! " " And you too , Piron ! The same as ever ! Not tired of cane-planting yet ? But how is madame ? " " Lovely a girl as ever , Cleveland , but never entirely got over that sad loss of the little boy , you know . However , she will be overjoyed to see you . She 's been talking of you ever since we saw your appointment to the station fifteen months ago . Apropos , we have her widowed sister with us , whose husband was killed at Waterloo , and our little niece who came from France  --  all out there at the old place of Escondido , where you must come and pass a week with us . Nay , man , no excuse ! The thing is arranged , and it would be the death of Stingo , Tom Stewart , and Paddy Burns if you disappoint us . " " Well , Piron , I am your man , but not for a day or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authorities . Meanwhile , gentlemen , you all dine with me this evening on board the frigate , every mother 's soul of you ! Coxswain , go on board and tell my steward to have dinner for six . Stop at the schooner as you go off , and say to Mr. Darcantel that I shall expect him to join us . Now , my friends , that matter is arranged , and we will all go off in the barge at sunset . " " Dry talking , is n't it , Stingo ? " said Piron ; " so , commodore , come , and we 'll have a sip of sangaree and a deviled biscuit to keep our mouths in order . But , halloo ! where is your friend , Cleveland ? that tall man in black ? Parson or chaplain , eh ? " " No , " replied the officer ; " an old friend of mine , my brother-in-law , who takes a cruise with me occasionally ; but he never goes in society , and has taken himself off , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a glorious fellow , though , and I hope to present him to you yet . Never mind him now . " Arm in arm went the blue coat and bullion , locked in white grass sleeves , along the busy quays , crowded with mule-carts and drays for stores or shipping . Spanish dons , dapper Frenchmen , burly John Bulls , standing at warehouse and posadas , all with cigars in their teeth , which they puffed so lazily that the smoke scarcely found its way beyond the brims of their wide sombreros . Negroes , too , with scanty leg gear , and still scantier gingham shirts , having bales , or boxes , or baskets of fruit on their heads , never any thing in their hands , chattering and laughing one with another as they danced and jostled along the busy mart ; then through the hot , sandy ruts of streets , pausing now and then to shake hands with some old acquaintance beneath the overhanging piazzas ; sedan-chairs moving about , with a negro in a glazed hat and red cockade at either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they bore their burdens of Spanish matron , or English damsel , or maybe a portly old judge , or gouty admiral , on a shopping or business excursion to the port ; so on to the upper town , where the dwellings stand in detachments by themselves  --  single or in pairs  --  with spacious balconies and bright green Venetian blinds , all surrounded by gardens and vines ; with noble tamarind-trees , and cocoa-nuts swaying their lofty trunks , and rattling their branches and leaves over the negro huts and offices below . Here the party stopped , and , entering a house , were ushered into a cool , lofty room , where there were a lot of mahogany desks , and a single old clerk , who resembled a last year 's dried lemon , with some few drops of acid juice for blood , perched up on a hard stem of a high stool , with four or five quill pens , like so many thorns , sticking out above his yellow leafy ears . " All by myself here , Cleveland , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there at Escondido . Very little business doing just now , and Paddy Burns and Tom Stewart have n't had a suit or a fight for the last six months . Inkstands dry , and my old clerk , Clinker , there , has forgotten how to write English . " However , " went on Piron , as the party threw themselves back on the wicker arm-chairs , and enjoyed the breeze which fluttered merrily through the blinds , " the cellar is n't quite dry yet ; and I say , Clinker , suppose you tell Nimble Jack , or Ring Finger Bill , to spread a little luncheon here , with a bottle or two of Bordeaux , or something of that sort ! " The dried , fruity old gentleman dropped off his branch at the desk like a withered nut , and then , with a husky kind of shuffle , betook himself off . Illustration : " QUEER OLD STICK , THAT ! " SAID THE COMMODORE . " Queer old stick , that ! " said the commodore , as he unbuckled his sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he grew here , and will blow away one of these days . My father used to tell me that he looked just the same when he first sprouted as he does now . But he is a dear faithful old stump ; and you must remember hearing , Cleveland , of that frightful earthquake here in seventeen hundred and eighty-three , which killed so many people ? Yes ? Well , it was old Clinker who saved my sweet wife that is now  --  and her sister ; though he was nearly squeezed  --  drier , if any thing , than he is now  --  in doing it . He lay , you know , Stingo , supporting the whole second story of the house for seven hours , pressed as flat as a tamarind-leaf , while they were getting those twin babies out of their cradle . Yes , God bless him ! " Starting up , while a flush of feeling darkened his face  --  " but , what is more , he threw himself precisely where he did , as he saw the walls giving way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injured when the beams came down . My father has told me since , that when they got a lever under the timber and wedged old Clinker out , he gave a kind of cackle ; but , in my opinion , he has not drawn a breath from that day to this . And , generally , he is a very taciturn old root , and rarely opens his rind ; but latterly he talks a good deal about the earthquake ; says he 's sure there 'll be another awful one before an interval of forty years has passed , and wants us to go away . No objection , however , to coming back when the thing is over , and then waiting forty years for another . Do n't laugh , you Paddy Burns , for if ever the ' Tremblor ' gives you one little shake , you 'll jump higher than you did when that ugly Frenchman ran you through your waistcoat pocket , and you thought it was your midriff . Now , Tom Stewart and Don Stingo , what are you grinning about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quake that you wo n't , either of you , be able to deliver a charge to the jury over a false invoice , or suck another drop of old Antigua rum . " " But really , Piron , " broke in the commodore upon this voluble harangue , " do you give heed to these barkings of that old clerk ? " " Why , yes , Cleveland , " replied Piron , with rather a grave manner , " I do ; and , moreover , my sweet wife Rosalie out yonder , who has never got over her grief for the loss of our boy , regards every word old Clinker says as so much prophecy ; and the upshot of the business is , I have made up my mind to leave the island . " " For where , my friend  --  back to France ? " " No . Since the war and the peace , with Bonaparte at St. Helena , France is no place for an Englishman , even with a French father , and I am going to try America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear it . But what part of America ? " " Why , I 've bought a fine sugar estate at a bargain in Louisiana , and there we shall pass the remainder of our days . " " He ! he ! " sniggled Tom Stewart , while Don Stingo and Paddy Burns cackled incredulously ; but , at the same moment , Ring Finger Bill and Nimble Jack , two jet-black persons , in loose striped gingham shirts and bare feet , with an attempt at a grave expression of thick-lipped coffee-coolers , the whites of their eyes turned up with becoming decorum , and preceded by the old twig of a clerk , who seemed to crackle in the sea-breeze as he again hung himself , stern on , to his stool of a trunk , entered the cool counting-house , bearing trays , fruits , and bottles , which they methodically arranged on the large table . " Massa ! him want small , red , plump snapper , make mizzible brile ? " said Nimble Jack . " S'pose Massa Ossifa him pick shell of land-crab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no ! Put those cool water-monkeys on the table and be gone ! Come , Clinker , take a bite with us ! " Leaving this pleasant party to sip their claret and water , and nibble their midday food , while they rambled back to the past or schemed into the future , we will return to the frigate . CHAPTER XXXI . THE COMMANDER OF THE " ROSALIE . " " The handsomest fellow , Heaven bless him ! Setting the girls all wild to possess him , With his dark mustache and his hazel eyes , And cigars in those pretty lips  --  " " That girl who fain would choose a mate , Should ne'er in fondness fail her , May thank her lucky stars if Fate Should splice her to a sailor . " " The ' Rosalie 's ' gig coming alongside , sir , " reported the quarter-master to the officer of the watch . " Very well . A boatswain 's mate and two side-boys . Mr. Rat , have the barge manned , and send her on shore for the commodore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands to furl awnings . " While these orders were being executed , the whistles ringing through the ship , the sailors lining the white hammocks , stowed in a double line , fore and aft , around the nettings of the frigate , in readiness to cast off the stops and lacings and let fall the awnings , the officer on deck stood near the gangway . At the same time there tripped up the accommodation-ladder , lightly touching the snowy man-ropes , a young fellow of about one-and-twenty , dressed in undress frock-coat , one epaulet , smooth white trowsers , and shoes . Catching up his sword in his left hand as he reached the upper grating of the ladder , he took off his blue , gold-banded cap , and half bounded , with a springy step , on to the frigate 's deck . Observe him well , young ladies , as he stands there ; for of all the scarlet or blue jackets on whose arm you have leaned and looked up at with your soft violet , blue , or dark eyes , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those eyes , or those warm hearts too , throbbing under your bodices , or who would drive you wilder to possess him , than that gallant young sailor standing on the " Monongahela 's " deck . Ay , observe him well , that tall , graceful youth , with a waist you might span with one of your short plump arms ; those slim patrician feet , that might wear your own little satin slippers ; then that swelling chest and those elegantly turned shoulders , which will take both of your arms , one of these days , to entwine and clasp around them ! Ah ! but the round throat and chin , the smiling mouth , half hiding a double row of even teeth , with the merest moonshine of a mustache darkening the short upper lip , and then those large , fearless hazel eyes , sparkling with health and fun , shaded by a mass of chestnut curls , which cluster about his clear open forehead ! Ay , there he stands , " a king and a kingdom " for the girl who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fist , my boy ! How do you get on aboard your prize ? Not so roomy as the old frigate , eh ? And a little more work than when you were playing flag-lieutenant , eh ? Well , glad to see you , but ca n't stop to talk . So jump down below there in the wardroom ; the mess are just through dinner , and yours wo n't be ready for an hour yet . Come , bear a hand , or I 'll let these awnings fall on your new gold epaulet . " The new-comer tripped as lightly down the ladder to the gun-deck as Mr. Mouse , and making another dive down to the berth-deck , exchanging a rapid volley of pleasantry with the midshipmen in the steerage , he opened the wardroom door and entered . There , in a large open space , transversely dividing the stern of the ship , with rows of latticed-doored staterooms on either side , lighted by open skylights from above , with a barrel of a wind-sail coming down between the sashes , and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , and the deck so clean that you might have rubbed your handkerchief on it without leaving a stain on the cambric , around a large extension mahogany table stretching from side to side , the cloth removed , decanters and wine-glasses here and there , and water-monkeys in flannel jackets hanging like criminals from a gallows from the beams above , sat the wardroom mess of the frigate . " By all that 's handsome , here 's Darcantel ! Why , Harry , we are delighted to see you ! " exclaimed half a dozen voices ; " come , sit down here and take a glass of wine with us ! " As the handsome young fellow entered the wardroom , all faces lighted up as they saw him . The old sailing-master , who seldom indulged in more than a scowl since he lost his right ear by the stroke of a cutlass in capturing the tender to the " Plantagenet " seventy-four off the Hills of Navesink ; the rigid old major of marines , who pipe-clayed his very knuckles , and wore a stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard ; the dear , kind old surgeon , who swallowed calomel pills by the pint , out of pure principle , and who lopped off limbs and felt yellow fever pulses all through the still watches of the hot nights with never a sign or look of encouragement ; and the staid old chaplain , who had often assisted the surgeon and helped to fill cartridges , contributing his own cotton hose for the purpose when those government stores gave out in battle , and who never smiled , even when committing a marine to the briny deep ; the purser , too , prim and business-like , looking as if he were a complicated key with an iron lock of his own strong chest , calculating perpetually the amount of dollars deposited in his charge , the total of pay to be deducted therefrom , and never making a mistake save when he overcharged the dead men for chewing tobacco ; and the gay , young , roistering lieutenants , who never did any thing else but laugh , unmindful of navigation , pipe-clay , pills , parsons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharpish , exacting executive officer at the head of the table  --  all welcomed , each in his peculiar way , the bright , graceful young blade who dawned upon them . And not only the mess were cheered by his presence , but also a troop of clean-dressed sable attendants , whose wide jaws stretched wider , while the whites of their eyes seemed painfully like splashes of whitewash on the outside of the galley coppers , as they nudged one another and yaw-yaw 'd quietly away aft there in the region of the pantry . " Here , my salt-water pet , come and sit down by me , where all those old fellows can see you ! Steward , a wine-glass for Mr. Darcantel ! What ? you wo n't take a sip of Tinta , and you can only stop a minute because you are to dine with your uncle the commodore , eh ? Well , I 'll drink your uncle 's health even if you do n't ! " said the first lieutenant , as he familiarly laid his hand on the young fellow 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what the deuce did you come down here for ? " squeaked out the purser , as he unscrewed his lips into a pleasant smile . " You 've put an end to that interesting account the master was giving us of how he lay inside Sandy Hook for six months with a glass to his  --  " " Mouth , " broke in the surgeon . " It was Sam Jones the fisherman , Who was bound to Sandy Hook ; But first upon the Almanac A solemn oath he took  --  That he would catch a load of clams ! " " Silence there , you roarer ! " said the surgeon , as he popped a filbert into the wide mouth of the rollicking fourth lieutenant , which cut his song short off . " Yes , Harry , that 's what you have done in coming here for a minute . But stay a week with us , and the master will tell it you again . We 've heard it once or twice before . " The old grizzled sea veteran scratched the remains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darcantel . " Ah ! my dear boy , and I 'll tell you how the surgeon and nipcheese there were entertained by a one-eyed old Spaniard at St. Jago . " " Let 's hear it ! " roared every body except the medico and purser . " Out with it , master ! " " Well , messmates , when we were in the old ' Scourge , ' a long time ago , one day we anchored in St. Jago de Cuba . " Here the surgeon and purser smiled horribly , and implored the grizzled old navigator not to go on ; every body had heard that old story ; he might fall ill with the vomito pietro , and would require pills ; or else there might be found a mistake in his pay account , and he would like , perhaps , to draw for the imaginary balance not due to him , and to drink his grog and scratch the remains of his old ear , or turn his attention to the load of clams waiting for him at Sandy Hook ! But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long-forgotten yarn ! " Well , messmates , in less than an hour after we had anchored in St. Jago they went on shore , and made the acquaintance of a little thin , sharp old villain , with one eye , who invited them to make him a visit , and pass the evening on a fine estate he owned near the base of the Copper Hills , some distance  --  about four leagues , I believe  --  from the town . He was a most respectable person , very rich , and commanded a Cuban guarda costa to boot . The capitano , Don Ignacio Sanchez  --  was n't that his name , doctor ? Oh ! you forget  --  all right ! Off they started with a guide , on hired mules ; but when they pulled up at their destination they found the Don was n't there , though they were handsomely entertained by the senora  --  a comely , fat , and waspish body , with very few clothes on  --  who cursed her Don for sending people to see her , and the visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not dined , she fed them bountifully on a supper of the nastiest jerked beef and garlic they had ever smelled . You told me so , purser . " Both Pills and Purser had forgotten all about it , and thought it would be better to talk of something else ; that there was plenty of good wine to drink in place of drying his lips on such dusty old rubbish . " Well , messmates , after the supper the old lady demanded a little game of monte , and she insisted , too , on making herself banker , though she had no money on the table to pay with in case she lost  --  which she had no intention of doing . So she won every ounce , dollar , real , and centavo they had in their pockets ! The doctor and purser told me they saw her cheat boldly ; but yet she not only bagged all the money , but she won their mules into the bargain ! " Here those individuals confessed roundly  --  standing on the defensive  --  that the fat old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ample bosom , and had cheated them in the barest manner conceivable ; but yet they had no appeal , and were inclined , out of gallantry for the sex , to behave like gentlemen , though she did drink aguardiente . " Well , messmates , toward midnight that hospitable wife of the Don began to abuse our friends for not bringing more cash with them when they visited ladies , and then fairly kicked them out of the house ! Yes , you both told me so when I lent you the money to pay the boatmen , after being obliged to tramp all the way back to the port on foot , nearly missing their billets in the old ' Scourge . ' " " Go on , master ! Tell us all about it ; do n't stop ! " " Well , messmates , I was on deck while beating out of the channel , and just abreast the Star Castle I saw a boat with two gentlemen in the stern , stripped to a girt-line , and howling at rather than hailing the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take either of you unless you gave them your coats and trowsers before shoving off . And do n't you remember , Hardy , how they yelled at us , and we thought they were deserters from that English gun-boat in St. Jago ? And how the captain arrested the pair of them when they got on board for going out of signal distance ? This is the first time I ever told this yarn , " concluded the old navigator , tugging away at the lobe of his lost ear . The young lieutenants shouted , and the old major of marines , forgetful of his iron-stuffed stock , laughed till he nearly sawed his chin off , rubbing his chalky knuckles into his eyes the while . " But first upon the Almanac A solemn oath he took  --  That he would catch a load of clams  --  " " The barge is coming off , Mr. Hardy , with the pennant flying , sir ! " reported a reefer , in the midst of the conversation , to the first lieutenant , as he shoved his bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Beaver ; but hark ye , sir ! the next time you go ashore in the market-boat , look sharp that the men do n't suck the monkey . Three of them came off drunk this morning . And inform Mr. Rat and Mr. Mouse that if I see their heels on the cutter 's cushions again , I 'll take a better look at them from the main-top-mast cross-trees . You understand , sir ? Steward , a glass of wine for Mr. Beaver ! " Saying this , the executive officer , with Harry Darcantel , arose and went on deck to receive the commodore . CHAPTER XXXII . A SPLICE PARTED . " Oh ! for thy voice , that happy voice , To breathe its loving welcome now ! Fame , wealth , and all that bids rejoice , To me are vain ! For where art thou ? " " What is glory  --  what is fame ? That a shadow  --  this a name , Restless mortal to deceive . Are they renown 'd  --  can they be great , Who hurl their fellow-creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grieve ? " The drum rolled , the marines presented arms , the boatswain piped , the side-boys and officers took off their caps ; and as the colors dropped with the last ray of sunset from the peak , and the broad blue day-pennant came fluttering down from the lofty main truck , Commodore Cleveland and his friends stood on the splendid deck of the flag-ship " Monongahela . " It must have been with conscious pride that the brave and loyal commander gazed around him on the noble frigate and her gallant crew . The white decks , the tiers of cannon polished like varnished leather , with the breechings and tackles laid fair and even over and around them ; the bright belaying-pins , holding their never-ending coils of running gear  --  the burnished brass capstan  --  the great boom  --  board to the boats amidships with a gleaming star of cutlasses , reflecting a glitter on the ring of long pikes stuck around the main-mast near , all inclosed by the high and solid bulwarks ; while towering above , like mighty leafless columns of forest pines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sight to the trucks in the fading light , supported by stays and shrouds , singly and in pairs , and braided mazes  --  black , and straight , and taut  --  never a thread loose on rigging or ratlin  --  and spreading out as they came down in a heavy hempen net , till they disappeared over the rail , and were clenched and spliced , or seized and clamped to the bolts and dead-eyes of the chain-plates outside . Holding up too , in mid-heaven , on those giant trunks  --  like a child its toys  --  the great square yards of timber branches , laying without a quiver , in their black lifts and trusses , with their white leaves of sails crumpled and packed in smooth bunts in the middle , and running away to nothing on either hand at the tapering yard-arms . Grand and imposing is the sight . And well may you wonder , ye land lubbers , why all that mass of timber , sails , and cordage , with its enormous weight , does not crush with the giant heels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an egg-shell , and tear the stanch live-oak frame to splinters ! The commander of the frigate saw all this , and he beheld at the same time the clusters of happy sailors , sauntering with light step and pleasant faces up and down the waist and gangways ; and he heard , too , the scraping of a fiddle on the forecastle , the shuffling , dancing feet , and the least notion of a jovial sea-song coming up from the gun-deck . Yes , it must have been a glorious pride with which that gallant officer gazed around him from the quarter-deck of the magnificent frigate . Did he say to himself , " I am monarch of this floating kingdom ; my will is law ; I say but the word , and those sails are spread and the ship moves to wherever I command . My subjects , too , who watch my slightest look and whisper , with that flag above , will pour broadside upon broadside  --  ay , they have !  --  from those terrible guns upon whoever dares to cross my track . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a plank left in this huge ship to stand upon , and while there is a rope-yarn left to hold the ensign  --  ay ! even until my pennant , nailed to the truck , sinks beneath the bloodstained waves ? " Did the commander think of all this ? Perhaps he did . And yet , in all the pride of rank and power , bravely won and maintained in many a scene of strife and deadly conflict , with visions of honest patriotism and ambition for the future , did his thoughts go back long years ago into the shadowy past , and was his spirit in the silent church-yard , where the magnolia was drooping over a grass-green grave ? The sweet mother and her baby boy  --  the girl who had so fondly loved him , and the child who played about his knees  --  oh that they could have lived to share the wreaths of victory which were hung around his brow ; that they could have lived to see the sword his country gave him , to twine but for one little moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnolia waves its white flowers over mother and boy , and they sleep on in their heavenly and eternal rest . Did Commodore Cleveland , as a saddened flash of thought swept over his handsome face , while he stood on his quarter-deck , dwell on those scenes ? Yes , we know he did . By day and night , in war and peace , in gale or calm , on deck or at banquet , in dream and action , the girl and mother he so dearly loved was close clasped to his heart , and the child still playing at his knee . " Gentlemen , let me make you acquainted with the first lieutenant , Mr. Hardy ; and permit me also to present my nephew , Mr. Darcantel , captain , if you please , my friends , of the one-gun schooner ' Rosalie , ' formerly the slaver ' Perdita , ' cut out of a river on the Gold Coast by the young gentleman who stands before you . " " Rosalie ! why that 's the name of my niece , " exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your trim little craft , sir . But you must come with the commodore to Escondido , and judge for yourself . But , bless my soul ! you resemble our Rosalie , even if your schooner do n't . Why , look at him , Paddy Burns ! " Don Stingo , and Tom Stewart , and the Paddy did look at him , and all shook hands with him , laughing the while at Piron , and asking when old Clinker looked for another earthquake . " Come , Piron , come , gentlemen , do n't let us keep the soup waiting ! By the way , Mr. Hardy , will you do me the favor to take a glass of wine with us after gun-fire ? " " Thank you . " " Suppose you bring little Mouse with you ; I like children ; and perhaps you will excuse the younker from keeping his watch to-night ? A little extra sleep in hammock wo n't hurt him , you know . " And so Commodore Cleveland raised his hat , followed by the eyes of respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the ladder and entered his spacious cabin . CHAPTER XXXIII . THE BLUE PENNANT IN THE CABIN . " To Bachelors ' hall we good fellows invite To partake of the chase that makes up our delight . " " Ask smiling honor to proclaim What is glory , what is fame ? Hark ! the glad mandate strikes the list'ning ear ! ' The truest glory to the bosom dear , Is when the soul starts soft compassion 's tear . ' " " Now , gentlemen , let me get off this heavy coat and epaulets . There ! all right , Domino ! put the sword in its case , and give me a white jacket . Choose your own places , my friends . Piron , sit here on my right ; Henri , take the foot of the table . " These last words were said in French ; whereupon Piron started and whispered to the commodore , " By George , Cleveland , is that youth 's name Henry , and does he speak French ? " " Hush , Piron , he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks the language like a native . She died when he was a baby , and he does n't like to allude to it . Come , steward , we are all ready . Serve the gumbo ! " The cabin of the frigate was divided by a light lattice-work bulkhead in two parts , running from quarter to quarter of the vessel . The after part had a large sleeping stateroom on either side , resting on the quarter galleries , and opening on to another gallery which hung over the stern of the frigate . Inside , in the open space , was a round table , cushioned lounges , a few chairs , with a bronze lamp pendent from a beam above , while taking the curve of the stern over the after windows was a range of bookcases , half hidden by the gilt cornice and curtains of the windows . The entire fittings and furniture of cabin and staterooms , including the neat Brussels carpet on the deck , were elegant and useful , though by no means luxurious . The forward cabin , where no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It took in the two after ports of the gun-deck ; and the carriages and cannon within the sills of the ports were painted a marble white , as were the ropes , in covered canvas , that held them . In a recess forward was a large mahogany sideboard , or buffet , the top fitted with a framework for glasses and decanters , which were reflected from a large mirror let into the bulkhead . In the middle of this space was the dining-table , lighted by a pair of globe lamps hanging from above , while neat racks for bottles and water-jugs , moving on sliding brass rods , were also suspended from the paneled beams and carlines of the upper deck ceiling . On the right  --  the starboard side  --  was a door leading into a roomy pantry , where the steward and Domino , and the servants of the commodore , bestirred themselves at dinner-time . " So , my friends , " exclaimed the commodore , " you wish to hear what became of me after I last parted with you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear , and  --  " Here Piron 's appeal was interrupted by the heavy report of a bow gun , which gave a slight , though almost imperceptible jar to the frigate . " Smithereens ! Stingo ! what noise is that ? " exclaimed Burns . " Only the nine o'clock gun , sir , " replied Darcantel . " Hech , mon ! " said Stewart , " ye needna upset ma glass of auld Madeira in yer mickle fright , for I 've seen the time when ye ha ' laughed at the music in the report of a peestol and the ping of a bullet ! But your nervous seestem seems to be unstrung ever since the sma ' French dancing count untied the string o ' your waistcoat with his rapeer . " " You do n't think , Paddy , the commodore here is going to bang a forty-two pound shot into our stomachs after all the good prog he 's filled them with ? " added Stingo , sotto voce , while the rotund Milesian threw his head back and twinkled careless defiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port-cabin door open , and standing up as rigid as a pump-bolt , with a finger to the visor of his stovepipe hat , in cross-belts and bayonet , he announced " Lieutenant Hardy and Midshipman Mouse ! " " Ah ! Hardy , glad to see you ! " rising as he spoke ; " squeeze in there between Stewart and Burns , or Darcantel ! Here , gentlemen , let me exhibit to you Mr. Tiny Mouse ! Do n't move , Piron ; I 'll make a place for him near me . " Saying this , the commodore took the lad affectionately by the hand , and as he sat him down on a chair at his elbow , and while the conversation went on with his guests , he said , in a kindly tone , " Tiny , my dear , the first lieutenant tells me you are a good boy and attend to your duty . I hope you pay attention to your studies also , and write often to your dear mother . Ah ! you do ? That is right ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was killed . There , sir , you may swig a little claret , but do n't touch those cigars . " " Come , Cleveland ! Cleveland ! you are forgetting your adventures , my boy ! " " Well , my friends , you shall hear them . " CHAPTER XXXIV . THE DEVIL TO PAY . " And how then was the devil dressed ? Oh ! he was dressed in his Sunday 's best ; His jacket was red and his breeches were blue , And there was a hole where the tail came through . " " Hairy-faced Dick understands his trade , He stands by the breech of a short carronade , The linstock glows in his bony hand , Waiting that grim old skipper 's command ! " " The last dinner I had in Jamaica , and a very jolly one it was , as you all know , was out at Escondido , where we kept it up so late that I only got on board the ' Scourge ' at daylight , in time to get her under way with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windward , and for a week afterward we rolled about in a calm off Morant Bay , maybe twenty leagues off the island , and one morning we discovered a sail . She was a large merchant brig , heading any way , and bobbing about , as we were , in the calm . Toward noon , however , a light air sprang up , and we got within hail , and I went on board to say a word or two to the skipper , for we had news before leaving Kingston that that infamous pirate Brand , in his long-legged schooner ' Centipede , ' had been seen off Guadaloupe ; and , in fact , we had actually chased him off Matanzas three months before ; so I was ordered to give the brig a warning , particularly as she had reported a suspicious craft in sight that same morning at sunrise . When I got on board of her I saw  --  " Here Piron placed both hands to his face as he leaned his elbows on the table , and the commodore , checking himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept the brig in sight all day , and ran round her once or twice in the evening , but toward midnight the trade wind freshened , and , as the coast seemed clear , and we were anxious to make up for lost time in the calm , we gradually came up to our course , and went bowling away to windward . " I remember going below at the time , and just as I was about to turn in , I heard a quarter-master sing out to Hardy there , who was junior lieutenant of the ship , and who had the middle watch , that he saw a light going up to the brig 's gaff . In five seconds I was on the poop , where I met the captain . " This is his only son , gentlemen , and a braver or more skillful seaman never trod a ship 's deck , " said the commodore , as he passed his hand affectionately over the boy 's head , who was sitting beside him . But he forgot , perhaps , to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was struck dead by a cannon-shot , and that afterward he had the boy appointed a reefer , and , out of his own means , helped the widow to eke out her pittance of a pension . Yes , Cleveland forgot all that as he smoothed the youngster 's soft hair , while , with the men around him , he drained his glass in silence to the memory of his departed friend and chief . Then resuming , he went on : " In less than no time after the light was seen  --  for you must know , gentlemen , that it was an understood signal between us  --  the ' Scourge ' was flying off with a stiff breeze abaft the beam , the crew at quarters , and the boats ready to be lowered from the davits . When we ranged up alongside the brig , and even before , we felt certain that our misgivings would prove true , and so they did ; and merely slamming a shot over her , and dropping a couple of armed boats into the water , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cursed schooner  --  venomous snake as she was  --  just hoisting her sails , and creeping away to windward . " We let her have two or three divisions of grape , and followed the dose up with round shot . I am sure we hit her , and that pretty hard , for we knocked away her fore-top-mast , and we saw the splinters fly in showers from her hull . However , she was well handled , and lying nearer the wind than the ' Scourge , ' when day dawned she was clear out of range , and leaving us every minute . So we up helm and ran down again to the brig , to see what mischief had been done and to pick up our boats . " Ah ! yes , you all know what had taken place , so I wo n't go over the details ; but the same afternoon , after seeing the brig pointed straight for Port Royal , and while we were once more on our course , we fell in with a water-logged boat , in which were half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mongrel Indian from Yucatan , who was frightfully torn by two or three grape-shot , before he died on board  --  as did all the others  --  gave us , in his confused dialect , some account of the pirate he had served under , and the haunt he frequented . As near as we could learn , the haunt was situated somewhere on the south side of Cuba , on a rocky island having a safe and secure inlet ; but as he did not know the latitude or longitude , we were left somewhat in the dark . The last words , however , the mangled wretch uttered , as the gasping breath was leaving his body , were , that the spot could be distinguished by a tall cocoa-nut-tree which grew from a craggy eminence in the middle of the island . We buried them all , pirates as they were , decently , and then we clapped on all sail on our course . " Steward , another bottle of the old Southside that Mr. March sent me from Madeira ! Here , Domino , take Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cot in the after cabin . Dear little fellow , he is sound asleep ; and mind you draw the curtains around him , lest he take cold from the draught of the stern windows ! " Rather a striking contrast this to the way Captain Brand , the pirate , treated the little Henri in the den there in the Doce Leguas . " Well , gentlemen , for some weeks after these occurrences we sailed about the islands , touching here and there , until at last we arrived at the Havana , took in stores and water , and then continued the cruise . The orders were to beat up the south side of Cuba , where we expected to fall in with the Musquito fleet and some English vessels , especially detailed to destroy two or three nests of pirates who had for some years swarmed in those seas and infested that coast . In the course of time we beat all around the south side of Cuba , and at last dropped anchor in St. Jago , where we learned from the English consular agent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Carvalo reef , were identified as having been part of a piratical crew who had plundered an English vessel with a free passport bound to Havana , and had been sent there in irons for trial . " The truth was , that the Spanish colonial authorities had so long connived , winked at , or been indifferent to what was going on during the wars of the Continent , that they allowed these piratical hordes to exist and thrive at their very doors . The matter had already been brought to the notice of the administrador of the port , and all other ports as far along the coast as Cienfuegos , and in such a threatening manner , too , that the governor at St. Jago , fearful of having his town blown down , exerted himself in the arrest of the rascals I have alluded to , and likewise in procuring information by dispatching guarda costas along the south side of the island . " Accordingly , the very morning we anchored I went ashore with the captain of the custom-house , where we met the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was in the colonial service , and who professed to know the haunt , or at least he said he thought he did , of that notorious villain Brand . " I remember distinctly spreading a chart before him , and while he traced with the end of his cigarette a course for the captain to steer by , I stood near , watching him narrowly . But the fact was , that he had the very sharpest spark of an eye set , or rather standing out , beside his nose that any body ever saw in a human being 's head ; and instead of me watching him , he seemed to be looking straight through me , and divining my thoughts and suspicions . However , the spot he pointed out , and the way he described it , with a cocoa-nut-tree on top of a rock , and the passage through the reef , so nearly corresponded with the confused account the Yucatanese gave us before he died , that the captain was entirely convinced we were on the scent , though I myself was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Isle of Pines , three hundred miles off ; but , to make the thing more plausible , that one-eyed old scoundrel was detailed to run along the Doce Leguas Cays , see what information he could pick up there , and then follow down after us . " That night , or early the next morning , we were off again , and ran down the coast , with a good offing to keep the wind , until we got to the ground , and passed in by Cape St. Francis , and doubled round into the Bight of Pines . There we fell in with a whole fleet of English and American cruisers and schooner craft , who informed us that they had searched every accessible spot where a man could walk dry-shod upon , from Guayabos to the Isle of Mangles ; that they had destroyed several old and deserted piratical nests , and hung two or three ostensible fishermen by way of wholesome warning to their allies the pirates ; but that was all ; and from what they had learned , there did not seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cays and reefs for four or five years . " So you see we had our cruise for nothing , and then the captain agreed with me that we had both been most egregiously deceived by the Spanish commander of the guarda costa . Well , we hauled our wind once more , standing well out to sea , and after a tedious beat of some days we again edged in toward the coast , somewhere near the Boca Grande of the Twelve League Cays on the westernmost side . It was in the morning when we made the land , and , steering close in , we got a good slant off the shore , and kept the glasses going from the topmost cross-trees down all through the day . For my part , as Hardy may perhaps remember , I scarcely took the glass from my eye for eight hours , and from the mizzen-top I feel quite sure that there were not many objects , from the size of a blade of grass to a mangrove bush , that I did not examine , from the coral reefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we were in search of . " Toward afternoon , however , the weather came up hazy , the wind began to fall off , and the barometer began to exhibit very queer spasms indeed , rising with a sort of jerk at first , and then dropping down the tenth of an inch at a clip , with the atmosphere becoming close and sultry , and the men gasping about the decks as if we were about to choke at the next breath . It was during the hurricane months , and the indications certainly should have led us as far as our legs could carry us to open water , instead of being caught embayed perhaps with half a thousand reefs around us on what might prove a lee-shore ; but , nevertheless , the captain decided to hold on till sunset , and then make an offing . The breeze still held in the upper sails , and so we slipped on in smooth water till about five o'clock , when I heard a fellow sing out from the main royal yard , " ' On deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island here on the port bow ! ' " Before the words were well out of his mouth I too caught the object , and I knew at the first glance that it was the spot we were looking for . At the same time the haze lighted up a bit , and we saw the ridge of rocks and every thing as the haunt of that pirate Brand had been described to us . So , my friends , we were all alive once more on board the ' Scourge , ' and the captain resolved to dash in upon the scoundrel 's nest before he could have time to leave it . " The engine was rigged and water spirted over the sails from the trucks down , to make the canvas hold the wind , and in an hour after we were within two leagues of the island , and just as the sun fell below the horizon we caught sight of the mast-heads of a large vessel sticking up over some bluff rocks near the bold shore . Not five minutes later the hull of the craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we discovered her to be a long and rather lumbering-looking brigantine , painted lead-color , and bearing no resemblance to the schooner we had twice chased before . Simultaneously , however , with her coming out into full view , as she rounded in her head-yards and got a pull of the main-sheet , with the breeze abeam and heading to the eastward , we beheld a great volume of white smoke spout up over the rock near the cocoa-nut-tree , with a vivid sheet of flame at the base , and before the vast column turned , like the crown of a palm-tree , in its descent , we were greeted by a dull , heavy roar , the concussion of which fairly made the ' Scourge ' tremble . Then , as the white smoke partially broke away , an avalanche of rocks and timbers was scattered far and near , and nothing visible but a veil of dust and masses of heavy smoke . Nearly at the same moment of this explosion wreaths of heavy black smoke arose from another spot nearer to the gap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red fires , and soon after a great conflagration burst forth , swirling flakes of burning cinders all over the island , and casting a lurid glare upon the water around us . " CHAPTER XXXV . AND THE PITCH HOT . " He is born for all weathers ; Let the winds blow high or blow low , His duty keeps him to his tethers , And where the gale drives he must go . " The wind blew hard , the sea ran high , The dingy scud drove ' cross the sky , All was safe lashed , the bowl was slung , When careless thus Ned Halyard sung . " Said the commodore , with a knowing shake of his head , " Ah ! gentlemen , if the fellow , whoever he was , who was creeping away so nimbly in that lazy-looking brigantine , with English colors at the peak , had written down in detail what he had been doing on that secluded nook of an island , and sent the information off to us in a letter , we could have read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that little scoundrel with one eye had purposely misled us , and had given him warning to quit his strong-hold ; and that he had hastily got his plunder and people on board his vessel , blown up and set fire to his nest , and that the brigantine he was now on board of was once upon a time the notorious schooner ' Centipede ! ' Yes , we knew all that by instinct . " Piron sat with his eyes fixed upon the speaker , taking in every word as it fell from his lips , the teeth set close together and the hand clenched which supported his head on the table . Paddy Burns and Tom Stewart , too , looked eagerly that way , as did Harry Darcantel , while Hardy sipped his wine and puffed his cigar leisurely , as if he knew the tale by heart . " It had fallen nearly calm . A light air perhaps in the royals , though nothing down below . But as we hauled down our colors at sunset , which had been hoisted to let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then there we both lay looking at each other . He knew by instinctive experience that we were the American corvette ' Scourge , ' mounting eighteen twenty-four-pounder carronades and two long eighteens in the bow ports ; for the brigantine had once or twice determined their exact calibres , and that we were the fastest cruiser , with the wind a point or two free , that had been seen in the West Indies for twenty years . Illustration " Yes , he knew all about us , but he was still a little in doubt whether we knew all about him . He lay  --  unfortunately , perhaps , for him  --  a little beyond the range of our long guns , or else he might have been spared a good deal of time and uneasiness , and we a long chase and considerable risk . Ah ! as the night came , the very fires he had kindled in his den on shore prevented his escape ; for while the calm lasted the bright flames shone upon him with the glare of hell ! There we lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until day dawned  --  and such a day as did dawn ! " Meanwhile the barometer had fallen an inch and a half , until the master began to believe the bulb leaked , and the mercury was dropping into the case . Then , through the murky gloom of daylight , with the sea one flat greasy surface , with never the splash of a fish to disturb it , while the lowest whisper of the topmen aloft could be distinctly heard on deck , as if we were hung in the vacuum of an exhausted receiver where a feather would drop like a bullet , suddenly there came a sound from the direction of the cays . Suppose , Burns , you saw a forty-two pound shot coming toward you , and without you dodged quick , your head would be flying off with it in the same direction ? " " Whist , mon ! " said Stewart , with a groan , " dinna be calling up sic peectures of the brain , Cleveland . Paddy , there , ne'er thinks of ony meesals bigger than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ran precisely a similar risk , though the cloudy embrasures over the island had not quite enough thunder to reach us . However , the brigantine knew what would follow as well as we did  --  better , perhaps  --  and before you could swallow that glass of wine she was stripped as bare as a bone , and down came her yards too , but keeping the sticks up , and spreading a patch of a storm staysail forward that you might apparently have put in your pocket . Her decks and rigging were crowded with men while she was doing all this , but the moment it was done , and well done too , they ran into their holes below like so many rats , and we could only see a man or two left on deck near the helm . " All hands had been called on board the ' Scourge ' at four o'clock , and , with the exception of securing the battery , every thing was ready to make a skeleton of the ship the moment we saw the brigantine begin ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of letting her give us the slip the third time . I had the trumpet , however , and with the captain at my elbow , the instant he saw that the brigantine was once more rigged nearly in her old way , he gave me the word , ' Now , Cleveland , work sharp ! ' " With a hundred and twenty men aloft , jumping about like cats , the light sails , studding-sail booms , royal and top-gallant yards came down , the top-gallant masts after them , and the flying jib-boom rigged in . Then the top-sails close reefed and furled with extra gaskets , and so with the courses ; preventer braces clapped on , rolling tackles hooked , and the spare purchases set up by the lower pennants . Meanwhile the divisions on deck had got hawsers over the launch amidships , the chains unbent , the anchors lashed down on the forecastle , and the quarter boats triced well inboard and secured with the davits . At the same time the light stuff from aloft was got below , the hammocks piped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatches , and stood ready with the tarpaulins to batten them down . I never beheld a smarter piece of work done afloat  --  not even , Hardy , in the ' Monongahela . ' " As I turned round an instant a hoarse , howling bellow struck my ear from the island , and I just caught a glimpse of the tall cocoa-nut-tree flying round and round in the air like an inverted umbrella with a broken stick ; while at the same time the men from aloft had reached the deck , and , jumping to the battery , the guns were run in and housed , spare breechings and extra lashings passed , and life-lines rove fore and aft . After that , gentlemen , there was no farther need of a trumpet . " You all know pretty well what sort of a thing a hurricane is , and the one I speak of must , I think , have given you a touch of its quality here in Jamaica . " " Ay , by the holy Moses ! we remember it well , bad luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , for it did n't lave a stick of sugar-cane standing from Montego Bay to Cape Antonio . " " Yes , " said Stewart ; " and to show ye what a piff of wind can do , the whirl of it caught up an eighteen-foot Honduras plank , and laid it crosswise , like an axe , full seven inches into an old tamarind trunk standing in my garden , and then twisted off the ends like a heather broom ! Hech , mon , ye may see it there now any day ! " Piron was thinking of the barks that were driving before that hurricane , with no thought of the damage done to his own plantations . " Well , then , I shall spare you all prolix description of it ; and you need only fancy a ship blown every where and every how except out of water  --  now with the lower yard-arms cutting deep into the sea like rakes , the lee hammock-nettings under water , the stern boat torn away into splinters , the main-top-sail picked , bolt by bolt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the lee anchor twisted bodily out of its lashings and swept overboard ! " Then a lull , while the sea got up and the ship dashed down on the other side on her bow ; then staggering back and making a stern-board till the water was plunged up in a deluge over the poop . Recovering herself again , and almost quivering on her beam-ends , the guns groaning and creaking as the terrible strain came upon the breechings , with the shot from the racks bounding about the decks , dinting holes in the solid oak waterways big enough to wash your face in , and then hopping out of the smashed half-ports to leeward . The spar-deck up to your armpits in water , and every man of us holding on to the life-lines or standing rigging like grim death , while all the time the roaring , thundering yell of the hurricane taught us how powerless we were , by hand or voice , to cope with the winds when they were let loose in all their might and fury ! " Nor need I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags , tables , crockery , flying from deck and beam to stanchion , smashing about in the most dangerous way , pell-mell , while the worst of the tempest lasted . But , gentlemen , the ' Scourge ' had a frame of live-oak , to say nothing of two or three acres of tough yellow-pine timber in her , a good deal of fibrous hemp to hold the masts up ; and , moreover , she was well manned , and , though I say it myself , she had a skillful captain and thorough-bred officers , in whose sagacity the crew could rely , to manage that old ' Scourge . ' " " That she had , " exclaimed Hardy ; " and the most skillful and the coolest of them all was the first lieutenant ! " The " Monongahela 's " executive officer here bounced off his chair as if he was prepared to fight any man breathing who did not subscribe to that opinion . " Well , my friends , that awful hurricane continued for about twenty hours , from late one morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was none ; for the sea and black clouds made one long night of it . Fortunately , too , we had been driven off shore , and when the murky gloom broke away , and we were able to look around , our first anxiety was to see what had become of the brigantine . " Yes , and I truly believe , in all that turmoil of the elements , while we were on the brink of foundering and going down to old Davy 's locker , that there was not an officer or man , from the captain to the cook , who was not thinking of that pirate , and hoping that he might go down first . I myself , however , felt a sort of confidence , as I was held lashed on the poop to the mizzen rigging , that the brigantine might be caught and whirled about  --  so long as she was above water  --  by the same blows of the hurricane that beat upon the ' Scourge ; ' and when the tornado broke , and some one sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be the ' Centipede . ' " CHAPTER XXXVI . THE CHASE . " With sloping masts and dipping prow , As who pursued with yell and blow Still treads the shadow of his foe , And forward bends his head , The ship drove past , loud roared the blast , And southward aye we fled . " " Clap on more sail , pursue , give fire  --  She is my prize , or ocean whelms them all . " " So many slain  --  so many drowned ! I like not of that fight to tell . Come , let the cheerful grog go round ! Messmates , I 've done . A spell , ho , spell ! " " It was all hands again , gentlemen . The hurricane had settled down into a moderate gale from northeast , though it was some time before the awfully confused sea got to roll regularly . Then we judged ourselves  --  for reckoning and observation had been out of the question  --  to be a long way south of Jamaica , and even to the southward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time for the pirate to lead us in getting ready for a race , but we got up a bran-new suit of top-sails and courses out of the sail-room , and , so soon as the men could go aloft with safety , they were ordered not to unbend the few tattered rags still clinging to the yards , but to cut away at once . Up went the top-sails and courses , and they were soon brought to the yards and set close-reefed , with a storm-jib to steady the ship forward . Presently we gave her the whole fore-sail and main-sail , and I think that even then , for some hours , but one half the corvette 's upper works could have been visible as she plunged through the angry heaving seas . " It left us dry enough , however , to pay some heed to the brigantine ahead of us . She was about four miles off , a little on our weather bow , and as she rode up  --  splendid sea-boat that she was  --  like a gull on the back of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere boards and canvas , probably  --  had been washed away , the house between her masts gone too , and , no doubt , her long gun , or whatever else had been lying hid under it . And now she was once more the schooner ' Centipede , ' long and sharp , and without any rail to speak of , so that we could see her deck from the stem to her taffrail at every lurch she made . The only difference in her appearance was a short fore-mast with cross-trees , and a top-mast for square sails . Almost as soon as our top-sail sheets were hauled home , her own yards went up and the sail was spread , while with the bonnet off her fore-sail , the whole jib and a close-reefed main-sail , she went flying to the southward with the gale a point abaft the beam . Illustration : THE STERN CHASE . " Thus we went on , the sea getting more regular every hour , so that we could send up the top-gallant masts , get the yards across , shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scourge ' in order . The schooner needed no encouragement from us , but cracked on more sail until her long main-mast reeled and bent over , as she came up on the breaking ridge of a wave , like a whip-stalk . By noon the clouds had gone , and left us a clear sky , with the gale going down into a full top-gallant breeze , sending the corvette along good eleven knots . We got an observation for latitude , and five hours later we determined the longitude and our position to be a few leagues to leeward of the Sarrana Keys , with that bird of a schooner before us heading for the Musquito coast . " If we had caught a cataract of water as it rolled over our bows in the morning , the schooner was taking her bath in the afternoon , for occasionally , for five minutes at a time , there was nothing seen of her deck , and only the masts and broad white canvas above , like jury-sticks out of a raft . But when she did slide up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till nearly half her keel , with the copper sheathing flashing in the sun , was visible , she looked like a dolphin making a spring after a shoal of flying-fish . And then on her narrow deck we could see a few fellows lashed about the fore-mast , and a couple more abaft steering her like a thread through a needle . " We began to gain upon her now , and whenever she kept a little away before the wind the gap between us closed more rapidly ; for the ship could evidently outcarry the schooner , and , had the breeze freshened and the sea kept up , we could have run her under if her masts did n't go out of her , as we hoped and expected every minute they would . Gradually , however , she watched her chance and hauled up till she brought the wind barely abeam , and steered true for the Musketeers  --  a bad cluster of low keys nearly surrounded by as terrible ledges and reefs as any to be found in the Caribbean Sea . " Her captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he thought he would not find another ready to lay down the same stake , he was greatly mistaken ! It was about sunset when we made the keys , and there we went  --  the schooner leading us about a mile  --  at a rate which would have made both vessels leap clear over the first ledge they struck , and perhaps have thrown summersaults of us into the bargain . I asked the captain , who had never left my side on the poop , if we should keep on . " ' Yes , sir , ' he replied , ' so long as we have a gun and a plank to float it ! ' " And , by Saint Paul ! we kept on . And there was not a soul on board the ' Scourge , ' from the drummer-boy up , who did not agree with the captain . How those villains on board the pirate relished this decision we could only surmise ; but , at all risks , he held his course with a nerve that might have made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well down , and a brilliant moon was riding high in the heavens ; but , as bright as it was , the fellow who commanded that schooner required an eye as keen as an albatross and a hand as steady as an iron bar to guide his craft in the direction he was going  --  too late for either of us to think of hauling off . " He must , too , have had a thorough knowledge of the reefs and keys , and trusted , perhaps , if he got clear himself , that the corvette , drawing eighteen feet water and ignorant of the channel , might touch something which would throw the game in his hands . Our men had the ropes stretched along the decks and the battery clear on both sides , so as to be ready to wear , or tack , or fire , as our pilot ahead might require . " The reefs were to leeward of the string of low keys , which made the water comparatively smooth , though the wind still swept strongly over us and sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centipede ' entered , going like wild pigeons the pair of us . The outer reef had a fair , deep passage , and so had the next ; but the inner one presented but one narrow gateway , scarcely wide enough for a ship to scrape through , with the whole reef one uninterrupted fringe of black pointed rocks and roaring white breakers , which toppled over , and boiled and eddied like a thousand whirlpools into the smoother water inshore . " As the ' Centipede 's ' stern gave a sharp pitching jerk when she entered this boiling gorge , we saw , in the moonlight , her head-yards laid square , the fore and aft sails flowing in the sheets as she fell off with wide wings and the wind on her quarter , and flew down inside the reef . " Five minutes after we too entered this maelstrom chasm , and , though the helm was hove hard up , and the after-sails shivered , yet , before the ' Scourge 's ' bows , going at the rate she was , could turn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a coral ledge , and grooved and broomed the planks and copper away like so much sea-weed ! But yet that slight graze never stopped us a hair 's weight , and , with additional sail , we rushed after our pilot , mile after mile , through reef , ledge , breakers , inlets , and keys , now braced sharp up , and again going free , until at last the fellow , having run us a dance of full ten miles , once more emerged into the open water , close jammed on the wind , steering nearly due east . " There , Hardy ! " exclaimed the commodore , " I am tired of talking ; suppose you take up the thread of the yarn . Domino , another bottle of tinta ! " CHAPTER XXXVII . THE WRECK OF THE " CENTIPEDE . " " Gun bellows forth to gun , and pain Rings out her wild , delirious scream ; Redoubling thunders shake the main , Loud crashing falls the shot-rent beam . The timbers with the broadsides strain ; The slippery decks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and high And shrill is heard the death-pang cry ! " " She struck where the white and fleecy waves Looked soft as carded wool ; But the cruel rocks they gored her side Like the horns of an angry bull . " Piron turned his gaze toward the first lieutenant , moved away the full glasses of wine , which he had never raised to his lips since the commodore began , and , resting his bloodless cheek on his other hand , listened . " It 's vera interesting indeed . " " Tear an ' ages , boy ! Fire away ! " quoth the Scotchman and his Milesian crony in a breath . Hardy threw his arm over the shoulder of Harry Darcantel as if it was a pleasant Corinthian column to lean upon , and breaking off the ashes of his cigar on the rim of a wine-glass which he had specially devoted to that purpose , he forthwith began : " I am quite confident , gentlemen , that I can not describe what afterward took place so well as Commodore Cleveland , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor do I remember very distinctly the events of the night after we got out of the Musketeers Keys ; for I was pretty well fagged out myself , and all of us who had the watch below turned in to take the first wink of sleep we could catch for forty hours . " The next morning , however , when I took the deck , I found the corvette under royals and flying-jib , with a fresh trade wind blowing from about east-northeast , and a smooth sea ; though close hauled as we were , and going ten knots , the spray was flying well up the weather leech of the fore-sail . The ' Centipede ' was about a mile and a half ahead , jammed on the wind , and trying all she could to eat the wind out of us ; but , as the commodore there said at the time , he had thrown that trick away when he cut off eight or ten feet of his fore-mast , and made a brigantine of the craft , so that he could not brace his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . " I remember , also , that two or three of the officers and half a hundred of the sailors were very anxious to pitch shot at the chase from the long eighteen in the weather bridle port ; but the captain refused , and said we might lose a cable 's length or two in yawing off to fire , and it would be better to save the powder until we could slam a broadside into him . But all the while that ' Centipede ' was handled and steered in such a thorough seamanlike manner , and proved herself such a beautiful sea-boat , that I doubt if there was a man on board the ' Scourge ' who would not have given a year 's pay to have taken her whole , and only expended a spare top-mast studding-sail halliards for the necks of her crew . " From the top-gallant forecastle we could see every thing that took place on the schooner 's deck : sometimes a lot of fellows forward reeving some fresh gear , peering about the low bowsprit , or putting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chap or two aloft stitching a chafing-mat on the lee backstays ; and then aft a man shinning up the main shrouds with a tin pot hung around his neck , greasing the jaws of the main gaff , and twitching a wrinkle out of the gaff-top-sail , so that it would lie as flat as this dining-room table set on end . " But always , from the very first moment we descried her  --  before the hurricane and afterward  --  there were two fellows abaft by the taffrail . One a large fat man , in a long dark dress , who appeared at times to be leaning over the rail as if he were sea-sick ; and the other a spare , tall-built fellow , who sat there with a quadrant in his hands and smoking cigars , measuring the distance between the two vessels as if he were a government surveyor , and especially appointed to make a hydrographical chart of the Caribbean Sea . Occasionally , too , we could see him approach the binnacle , spread a chart on the deck at his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands , and then he would return to his seat on the taffrail , cigar in his mouth and quadrant to his eye as before . " Nor were we idle on board the ' Scourge ; ' for when the breeze lulled we slacked up the lower rigging and stays , got down all extra weight and hamper from the tops , sent the watch below to the berth-deck with a round shot apiece in their hammocks , moved a couple of carronades about the spar-deck till we got the ship in the best sailing trim , and then we went skipping and springing through the water with the elasticity of an India-rubber ball . " At noon the sailing-master reported the position of the ship to be two hundred and eighty miles from the nearest land , which was the Darien Coast . So all that day and all that night , with a moon to make a lover weep to see , we went bowling after our waspish consort in hopes before long of taking the sting out of her . No kite ever pursued its quarry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever leaped after a wolf with the froth streaming from his jaws and blood-red thirsty eyes , than did the ' Scourge ' chase that infamous pirate . The delay only made our eyes sparkle and our teeth sharper in expectation ; for we knew we would have our prey sooner or later , and it was only a bite and a pleasure deferred . " The next morning and all the day there was no change to speak of in our respective positions . The ' Centipede ' went skimming on over the water with every thread of canvas she could spread , reeling over on her side at times when the breeze freshened , while the spray flashed up joyously and sparkled in the sun , leaving a bubbling current of foam in her wake , which , before it had been entirely lost in the regular waves of the sea , the corvette 's sharp bows would plunge into , and again make it flash high up to her fore-yard , and then go seething , and hissing , and kissing her black sides until it rippled around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And all the time that man sat with a cigar in his mouth on the pirate 's taffrail , while Commodore Cleveland there stood with a spy-glass to his eye on the poop of the ' Scourge . ' " You may imagine , gentlemen , " continued Hardy , as he again knocked the ashes off his cigar , " that going to sea is attended with some few discomforts , such as battening down the hatches in a sirocco in the Mediterranean off Tripoli ; a simoom in the China Seas ; a bitter northwest gale off Barnegat , with the rigging and sails frozen as hard as an iceberg ; but if a man can catch forty winks of sleep once in a while , whether in a hammock , or on an oak carronade slide with the breech of a gun for a pillow , he may manage to weather through it . But from the moment we first saw that pirate till we saw the last of him , neither the first lieutenant of the ' Scourge ' nor the commander of the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wo n't anticipate . " Piron reached over his hand and shook that of his friend Cleveland convulsively . " Vera weel , mon ! vera weel ! " " He 's the very man to do it ! " said Stewart and Burns to Stingo , nodding backward at the commodore . Another striking contrast to the hand-shaking , virtuous compact between Captain Brand and his friend , the pious padre Ricardo ! I wonder if they are shaking hands now ! Probably not . " Gentlemen , " resumed Hardy , as he shook the ashes level in his wine-glass , as if he wished to preserve them to clean his teeth with after smoking , " I will not detain you much longer . Both vessels were making great speed , and long before sunset we had been keeping a bright look-out for the land . At last it was reported , trending all around both bows , low and with a trembling mirage of pines and mangroves looming up , and a multitude of rocky keys dead ahead . We were steering directly for Las @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigators save , perhaps , the buccaneers of the Gulf of Columbus , and perhaps , too , with the intention of running us just such another dance as our pilot had a night or two before . However , we were again all prepared to explore the unknown reefs ; and , moreover , we got the starboard anchor off the bow , and bent the cables to that and the spare anchors amidships , so as to be all ready to moor ship in case our pilot required us to do so . And likewise the cutters were hanging clear from the davits  --  the same boats which had once before paid a complimentary visit to some of his friends  --  supposing he would like to entertain us in person . " The sun went down again in a fiery blaze , and with its last ray there slowly rose to the main truck of the pirate a swallow-tailed black flag , with a white skull and cross-bones in the dark field . It fluttered for a moment out straight and clear , and then twisted itself around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or halliards ! That was the last glimpse those pirates ever caught of the murderous symbol they had so often fought and sailed under ; and it was the last sun that a good many aching eyes ever looked upon who were sailing there in that half league of blue water . The moon , however , was riding bright and beaming , as clear as a bell , overhead , and that was all the light we cared for . The ' Centipede , ' no doubt , would have preferred no moon at all , with a cloudy sky and a bit of a rain squall , to pursue the intricate navigation before her ; but Heaven arranged the atmospheric scenery otherwise . " ' By the deep eight ! ' sang out the leadsman in the port chains . ' The mark five ! ' came from the opposite side . ' Another cast , lads  --  quick ! ' ' And a half four ! ' ' Six fathoms , sir ! ' " ' We must have stirred up the sand , Cleveland , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the starboard chains cried , ' Three fathoms , sir ! ' and while each instant we expected the ship to bring up all standing , and the masts to go by the board , the other leadsman sung out , joyfully , ' No bottom with the line , sir ! ' " Well , we were safely through that bed of coral , doing , no doubt , some trifling damage to the tender shoots and branches , as we flew through a narrow channel , with the waves breaking and moaning on the sandy shores over the keys , out into deep water again . " Four or five miles beyond stood out a bluff rock , looking in the moonlight like a dozing lion with his paws crossed before him , ready to bound upon any who should approach his lair in the dense jungle of pines and tangled thickets which stood up like a bristling mane on the ridge behind . " The ' Centipede ' was now but a short half-mile ahead of us , her deck alive with men , and manifestly ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , stood that man , tall and erect , his feet steadied by the cavil of the main boom , a spy-glass to his eye , and looking at the rocky lion now close aboard him , still with a cigar in his mouth ; and we thought we could even see the thin puffs of smoke curling around his face . Suddenly , too , we saw the spy-glass whirled around his head , and at the instant the vessel fell dead off before the wind , the great main-sail flew over with a stunning crash and clatter of blocks and sheets as the wind caught it on the other quarter , making the long switch of a mast to spring like a bow , while the weather-shrouds slacked up for a moment in bights , and then came back taut with a twang you might have heard a mile ! We could now see , as the space opened behind the rock , another frightful jagged ledge , on which the rollers were heaving in liquid masses high up a precipitous rock , and where the channel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foaming gloomy inlet , where not even the beams of the moon could penetrate ! I heard the captain say , in his old decided way , " ' Now for it , Cleveland ! You take the battery , and I 'll look out for the ship ! ' " Then , gentlemen , " said Hardy , with unusual animation , as he waved his right arm aloft with an imaginary cutlass swinging over his head , " came the word ' Fire ! ' " Yes , the entire starboard broadside , round shot , grape , and canister , all pointed toward a centre , were delivered with one simultaneous shock  --  the hurricane a mere cat's-paw in comparison  --  which shook the corvette as if she had struck a rock , while the smoke and sheets of flame spouted out from the cannon , half hiding the black torrent which gushed forth from so many hoarse throats ; and as the roar of the concussion was taken up in terrible echoes from the lion on the rock , a peppering volley of musket-balls from the marines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music . " Meanwhile the helm of the ' Scourge ' was hove hard down , and as she just swirled , by a miracle , clear of the ledge under our lee , and came up to the wind with the sails slamming and banging hard enough to send the canvas out of the bolt-ropes , the courses were clewed up , every thing aloft came down by the run ; anchor after anchor went plunging to the bottom , and before the cables had fairly begun to fly out of the hawse-holes with their infernal jar and rattle , high above the sounds of flapping sails , snapping blocks , running chains , and what not , came another clear order , ' Fire ! ' " Then pealed out the port broadside at a helpless , dismasted hulk within two hundred yards of our beam , rolling like a worm-eaten log on the top of a ruffled broad roller , going to break , in ten seconds , on the ledge , whose pointed rocks stood up like black toothed fangs to grind its prey to atoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth gave it a shake ; and as the breath of our bull-dogs was swept aft by the fresh breeze , we could see the sluggish mass almost rise bodily out of water as it was torn and split by the round iron wedges , the fragments flying up in dark , ragged strips and splinters with squirming ropes around them , looking , in the moonlight , like skeletons of gibbeted pirates tossed , gallows and chains , into the air , and then coming down in dips and splashes into the unforgiving water . " A minute later , all that was left of the shattered hull fell broadside into the open fangs of the ledge , which ground it with its merciless jaws into toothpicks . But in all the lively music and destruction going on around us  --  which takes longer to tell than to act  --  we heard no human voice save one , and that came in a loud , terrified yell amid the crunching roar of the ledge , " ' O Madre ! Madre dolorosa ! ' " This , gentlemen , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centipede . ' " CHAPTER XXXVIII . VULTURES AND SHARKS . " Oh ho ! oh ho ! Above ! below ! Lightly and brightly they glide and go ; The hungry and keen on the top are leaping , The lazy and fat in the depths are sleeping ! " " Ah ! well-a-day ! What evil looks Had I from old and young ; Instead of the cross , the albatross About my neck was hung . " When Hardy had concluded his part of the tale , he stuck the stump of his cigar into the wine-glass of ashes , as if he had no farther use for either , moistened his throat with a bumper of tinta , and almost unconsciously passed his left arm around Harry Darcantel 's neck . Stingo drank two bumpers , as if he had a particularly parched throat ; but Paddy Burns and Tom Stewart , strange to relate , never wet their lips , and passed their hands in a careless way across their eyes , as if there were moisture enough there  --  as , indeed , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own generous natures , for their dear friend who sat opposite . Piron 's head rested , face downward , on his outspread hands , and a few drops trickled through his close-pressed fingers , but they were not wine . And as he raised his head and looked around the board , where glowing , sympathizing eyes met his , he said , in a low , subdued voice , " I trust I may thank Heaven for avenging the murder of our child ! " Even as he uttered these words , his gaze rested on the face of Darcantel ; and striking the table with a blow that made the glasses jingle , he started back , as he had done on the frigate 's quarter-deck , and exclaimed , " Great God ! can it be possible that that boy was saved from the clutches of the drowned pirate ! " Not so fast , good Monsieur Piron  --  not so fast . Your boy was saved , and Captain Brand was not drowned . So keep quiet for a time , and you shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he departed this life ; only keep quiet ! Paddy Burns said , with a violent attempt at indignation , " Wirra , ye spalpeen ! is it thinking of old Clinker and his ' arthquake ye are ? " While Tom Stewart ejaculated , " Heeh , mon ! are you for breaking the commodoor 's decanters and wine-glasses , in the belief that ye are the eerthquak yersel ? " Stingo , who was more calm , and a less excitable Creole , merely murmured , " Commodore , we want to hear more of what took place , and then what became of you for the past sixteen or seventeen years . " " You shall hear more if you are not tired , gentlemen , though I have very little to add to what Hardy has already related of the ' Centipede . ' Steward , let the servants turn in ; and brew us , yourself , a light jorum of Antigua punch ! Now , then , " said Commodore Cleveland , " I 'm your man ! " After we had scaled the guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardy has told you , the captain thought it an unnecessary trouble to lower the boats to pick up the chips floating about the mouth of the channel ; and , besides , it would have been a bit dangerous , since the sea was coming in savagely , boiling about the ship , with a very uncertain depth of water around and under us ; and , moreover , we had our hands full the best part of the night in reeving new running-gear , bending a new sail or two that had flapped to pieces when every thing was let go by the run in coming to anchor . However , before morning , we were in cruising trim once more , and ready to cut and run in case it was expedient to lose our ground-tackle , and get out of what we afterward learned was the Garotte Gorge . But by sunrise the wind fell away into a flat calm , and with the exception of the long , triple row of rollers heaving in occasionally from seaward , we lay as snug and quiet as could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Hardy took one , and I got in the other , and we pulled in toward the jaws of the channel , between the Lion Rock and the ledge on the opposite side . " There were still a good many fragments of the wreck , which had escaped the reacting current out to sea , floating about on the water ; some of the timbers , too , of the hull were jammed in the black gums of the ledge , shrouded in sea-weed and kelp , as if all had grown there together . Farther on was part of the fore-mast and top-mast , swimming nearly in mid-channel , anchored as it were by one of the shrouds  --  twisted , perhaps , around a sharp rock below . The top-sail was still fast to the yards , hoisted and sheeted home , and laid in the water transversely to the masts , just as it fell under the raking fire of our first broadside , jerking over the main-top-mast with it . " A myriad of sea-birds , from Mother Carey 's chickens to gulls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were clustered on the wreck as thick as bees  --  screaming , croaking , and snapping at each other with their hard beaks and bills , while thousands more were hurrying in from seaward , and either swooped down over the ledge , or tried to find a place on the floating spars . " The gorge , too , was alive with barracoutas and sharks , leaping out of water , or with their stiff triangular fins cutting just above the surface , and sometimes even grazing the blades of the cutter 's oars . I pulled slowly toward the wreck of the fore-mast , and hooked on to the reef-cringle of the fore-top-sail . The birds did not move at our approach , and one old red-eyed vulture snapped on the polished bill of the boat-hook , leaving the marks of his beak in the smooth iron . Down in the clear green depths , too , the water was alive with ravenous fish , and we could see at times hundreds of them with their heads fastened on to some dark object , rolling it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the glance of a clean-picked bone shining white in the limpid water as the mass was jerked out of our sight . " The bowmen , however , attracted my attention , and one of them sang out , as he pointed with his finger , ' I say , Mr. Cleveland , here 's the captain and his priest lying in the belly of the top-sail ! ' " I walked forward , while the men fired a few pistols to scare away the birds , and looked in . There , about a foot below the water , lay one drowned man and half the body of another , who had evidently been cut in twain by a twenty-four pound shot at the stomach , leaving only a few revolting shreds of entrails dangling beneath the carcass . The other corpse was a large , burly , fat man , wrapped in a black cassock , with a knotted rope to confine it at the midriff , and around his thick bare neck was a string of black beads , holding a gold and ebony crucifix , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with half a body had been picked out by the gulls , but he still possessed a fang-like tusk , sticking through a hare-lip under a fringe of wiry mustache , which gave me a tolerable correct idea of his temper even without seeing his eyes . The truck and shivered stump of the main-top-mast , too , with the piratical flag still twisted around it , lay across his chest ; but , as we approached , an eagle seized it in his beak , and , tearing it in tattered shreds , flew aloft , with the remains of the parted halliards streaming below his talons . " The large lump rolling slowly over beside him had the crown of the head shaved , and the mouth and eyes were wide staring open , as if it was chanting forth a misericordia for his own soul . As I stood gazing at these revolting objects , and while the men were firing pistols and slashing the oars and boat-hooks around to drive away the greedy birds , a huge pelican , unmindful of powder or ash , made one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and spread his broad pinions  --  nearly as broad as the sail itself  --  he held in his pouch the crucifix from the padre 's neck , and as he slowly flapped his great wings and sailed away , with the beads dropping pit-a-pat-pat on the glassy surface of the water , a cloud of cormorants , gulls , and vultures took after him to steal his plunder . " At the same time the sharks  --  many of them resting their cold , sharp noses on the very leech of the top-sail  --  waiting like hungry dogs for a bone , with a thousand more diving and cutting in the water beneath , at last cut through the canvas belly of the sail , and , before you could think , the floating corpses were within their serrated jaws . In another moment the bodies rose again to the surface outside the sail and wreck ; then another dash from the monsters , and a greedy dive and peck from the birds ; a few bubbles and shreds of black threads , and that was the last of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As for Hardy , he pulled higher up the gorge , and examined the rocks and pools on both sides , but saw nothing living or dead , and we both returned to the ship . " Had Dick Hardy landed at the flat rock where the eddy swept in under the Lion 's paws , he might have seen the footprint of a man , with a straw slipper in it ; and following the track a few yards farther , he would have passed his sword through a villain lying bleeding in a mangrove thicket ; and found , too , in his belt , snugly stowed away , a lot of gleaming jewels , with a sapphire gem of priceless value on the finger of his bloody hand . But never mind , Hardy ! You will hear more of that man one of these days , and you will have no cause for regrets  --  though he will , perhaps ; and , meanwhile , let him wander in quest of fresh villainies over Spanish South America . " Well , gentlemen , " resumed Commodore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carcass we saw in the sail was the captain of that notorious ' Centipede , ' yet I felt confident at the time , and do now , that it was scarcely possible for him or a man of his crew to have escaped our fire and the water and rocks combined . So that evening , when the land-wind made , we tripped anchor and sailed away from the coast of Darien . " " Come , my friends , " said Piron , in a low , tremulous voice , rising as he spoke , " we must not push Cleveland too far to-night , for it is getting late , you know , and they keep early hours on board men-of-war . " " No hurry , Piron ! I 'll talk to you all night , if you have the patience to listen to me . No ? Then I 'll have the boat manned . " He touched a bell-rope which hung over his head , and the cabin door opened . " Orderly , my compliments to the officer of the watch , and desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gentlemen in the forward cabin left the table , and stood about in groups chatting till the boat was reported , Piron put his arm around the commodore 's belt , and they moved aft into the starboard stateroom . Little Mouse was lying sound asleep on the elegant cot , with all his clothes on , but with a smile on his lips , and dreaming , maybe , of the dear widowed mother he would one of those days make proud of him . " Cleveland , my old friend , tell me more of that young Darcantel ! " " Hist ! Piron , do n't wake little Tiny ! There 's nothing to tell more than he is my adopted nephew , and the son of the gentleman who occupies that stateroom opposite . But when we go out to Escondido I 'll tell you about his father , who has led a very adventurous life . " " Well , good-night ! You will bring young Darcantel with you , and this little rogue , too , here in the cot . My wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good-night ! " As the " Monongahela 's " bell struck eight for midnight , the commodore 's guests got in the barge and pulled toward the shore . At the same time , a light gig , with handsome Harry Darcantel , went alongside the " Rosalie , " and Commodore Cleveland turned into his friend 's cot opposite , leaving small Mr. Mouse to sleep his dream out till morning ; while , as the barge ran up to the landing at Kingston Harbor , and a gold ounce was slipped into the old coxswain 's honest paw , what did they all think about ? Good-night ! CHAPTER XXXIX . ESCONDIDO . " They bore her far to a mountain green , To see what mortal never had seen ; And they seated her high on a purple sward , And bade her heed what she saw and heard ; And note the changes the spirits wrought , For now she lived in the land of thought . " " ' Twixt Africa and Ind , I 'll find him out , And force him to restore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foul death , Cursed as his life . " Hidden in a cleft of the hills of Jamaica , fifteen hundred feet above that blue tropical sea below , on the brow of a cool valley , where that bounding stream of white water rushes from the tall peak in the sky in tiny cataracts , till it forms a pool there , held in by the smooth rim of rocks , where the cane-mill is lazily turning its overshot wheel , with the spray flying off in streaming mist , and the happy blacks stacking the sugar-cane in even fagots as they unlade the huge carts with solid wheels cut out of a single drum of a cotton-tree ; the six or eight yoke of oxen ahead ruminating under the shade of the tropical foliage , with never a switch to their tails ; while the lively young sea-breeze comes flurrying up the valley , whistling among the coffee bushes below , bending the standing cane on the slopes , rattling the tamarinds , cocoa-nuts , and plantains , and then climbing with noisy wings up the mountain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscures the lofty peak . Below the mill , where the mule-path crosses the foaming torrent by the shaky bridge , which stands on cocoa-nut stilts , and never yet has been thrown down by an earthquake , nestling under a precipitous crag , stood the mountain seat of Escondido . Vines and parasitical plants , mingled with scarlet creeping geraniums , made a living wall of dewy green and red on the face of the hoary rock , falling over here and there at some projecting acclivity in leafy torrents , and then forming a glowing green cornice along the topmost edges of the height . The buildings stood on a flat esplanade below , looking down the gorge as from the apex of a triangle , and taking in the overseer 's houses on the plantations , with their cone-shaped roofs , the fields of cane and coffee groves , the cataract between , down to the white snowy beach at the sea-shore , and the blue water crested by waves as far as the sight could reach . The main house was square  --  standing on stilts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fenced in by straight bamboos , of one story , with a broad roomy veranda going all round , where half a dozen grass hammocks were slung between the windows which opened into the dwelling . A great airy saloon and dining-room faced the valley , while six or eight cool bedchambers looked out from the rear up at the green wall of the precipice , and down on the sparkling stream of the mill . But there were no loopholes for musketry , nor vaults and dungeons . The sun had long passed the tall peaks of the blue mountains above , and the shadows had fallen down the valley until even the patch of white pebbly cove at the shore had become dim ; and no sounds were heard save the rustling of the sea-breeze , the splash of the torrent as it fell off from the rickety old wheel of the cane-mill , mingled with the shrill cries and songs of the negroes as they unloaded the carts . Yes ; but there were other sounds  --  the low , sweet tones of women 's voices  --  inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within that lofty saloon , hand clasped in hand , and gazing with glowing pride upon a lovely girl , who waved lithe as a lily on its stem before them . It is about seventeen years since we last saw this charming trio . And now look at them , old bachelors , and tell me if , while old Time has been scraping the hair off your own selfish heads , and pinching the noses , too , of the ancient maids beside you , has not the scything old wretch spared these lovely matrons ? Look at their rounded forms , those soft dimpled cheeks , and those bands of brown tresses , kissing the pear-shaped ears before they are looped up in one magnificent knot of satin at the back of the head . Look at them , you miserable old procrastinators , and then kneel down before the ancient damsels you have sneered at , even if they have the pelican gout and a crow's-foot at the corners of their eyes ! They are better than you are , any day ; so bear a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But come here , my young gallants , and take a peep at that Bordelaise demoiselle standing before those fair matrons . Strange to say , she is nearly a blonde , with large blue eyes , so very blue that  --  fringed with lashes that cast a shade over the cheek  --  they seem almost black . Then , too , that low , pure forehead , with great plaits of hair going round and round her elegant head like a golden turban , and thin hoops of rings quivering in the pearl-tipped ears . Tall and waving in figure , as maidens are ; with slim , arched feet , dimpled at the ankle ; and round , tapering fingers too , with a wrist so plump and soft that no manacles of bracelets could press it without slipping off the ivory hand . Dressed she was in a light mousseline , coyly cowering in loose folds around her budding bosom to the slender waist , where , clasped by a simple buckle of mother-o ' - pearl , it fell flowing in gauzy , floating waves to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is Rosalie ! " They are coming to-day , my aunt ; and Uncle Jules says that our dear old Captain Blunt has just arrived at Kingston , and is coming with them . " " What else , my daughter ? " The girl held a letter before her face , maybe to hide a little blush which suffused her cheeks . " Why , mamma , he writes that the spring-cart , with Banou , was to start overnight with the ' traps '  --  that means trunks , I suppose  --  and that  --  " " What , Rosalie ? " " That there is a handsome young officer , the nephew of Commodore Cleveland  --  merci , mamma ! some of Uncle Jules 's nonsense ! " No such great nonsense , after all , mademoiselle , when your uncle Piron tells you to keep that fluttering little heart safe within your bodice , for there are thieves in blue jackets in the island of Jamaica . Strange , too , as she spoke  --  with her animated face , large blue eyes , and graceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely women , with their darker coloring , who sat smiling sweetly upon her . " Oh ! here comes Uncle Banou . Well , my good Banou , what news of your master ? " said Madame Piron , as she put out her hand to the black , who raised it respectfully to his lips . " He will be here with his friends at sunset , eh ! And Mademoiselle Rosalie must place the gentlemen 's things in their rooms , and see that the billiard-house has some cots made ready in it . " " Nothing more ? " " No , madame . " " Allons ! Rosalie , we have no time to lose . " Winding through the mazes of the tropical forest , over the broken stony road , leading through a brilliant labyrinth of wild fig and acacia , plume-like palms , white shafts of silk and cotton , and lance-wood , mahogany , and ebony , parasitical plants in green and red , with endless varieties of gay flowers strung and laced in superb festoons on trunk and branch ; singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingled with the delicious fragrance of orange-blossoms , cinnamon , and pimento , the fresh breeze wheeled through clump and leaf , changing the hues of plant and flower from white to crimson , green , purple , and gold , as Nature painted them in gorgeous dyes . Through this brilliant vegetation , along the uneven road , came the sound of horses ' feet , with hearty shouts and laughter ; and presently appeared a cavalcade , mounted on mules and horses , all making the forest ring with merriment . Ahead came Tom Stewart , on a small , sure-footed pony ; and beside him Mr. Tiny Mouse , reefer , on a high mule , with a scrubbing-brush mane , looking like a fly pennant at the mast-head of the frigate , kicking his little heels into the old mule , as if that mule minded it even so much as to shake his long ears ! Then straggling in the centre were Darcantel , Stingo , and Paddy Burns ; and behind them came a tall , muscular man , on a mettled barb , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And at his side , on the most diminutive of the donkey breed , with feet touching the ground , clung stout Jacob Blunt , the sailor , in a more dreadful trepidation than he had ever known on board his old teak-built brig , lying there in the Roads of Kingston ; while the rear was brought up by Piron and Commodore Cleveland . " Now , you little madcap , look sharp when we turn the curve of the mountain , and you 'll catch a peep at Escondido ; and do n't you pinch that old mule again on her back , or she 'll pitch you up into that silk cotton-tree . " " If it pleases Providence to restore me safely to my dear old ' Martha Blunt , ' I 'll take my davy never to sit astride of any d  --   --  brute on four legs again ! " This mild vow came from the lips of Jacob Blunt , and he honestly meant every word he said . " Give us another jolly song , Stingo ; it will keep your throat clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my old timbers , sir , and as you vally my wife 's blessing , do n't sing ! There , you infarnal beast , you 've yawed sharp up into this ere bush , and put my starboard glim out forever ! I say , Don Spanisher , do n't sing  --  I 'm going fast enough ! " shouted the poor skipper , as he passed his paws around the little brute 's neck , with his hat over his eyes . " Colonel , " said Burns , as he reined up , and gave the perverse little donkey a cut with his whip , which elicited another hoarse roar from the old sailor as the animal half doubled himself up , and then ambled away like a yawl in a short sea , until he came up to the people ahead , when he stood stock-still and brayed maliciously , " have you another cigar , colonel ? Thankee ! Fine scenery this about here  --  never visited Jamaica before ? Ye have been off the island , eh ? It 's a nate little spot Piron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us will be mighty sorry to lose him . Is he going to lave ? Yes , he is ; and , what is worse , he is going to take his swate wife and her sister . Is the sister handsome ? Begorra ! handsome ? Why , man , she 's a beauty ! And did n't I crack the elbow-joint of that ugly , abusive divil , Peter Growler , for saying he had seen a gray hair in her head , when I knew it was only a loose thread from her lace cap  --  and me in love with her all the time . Bad luck to him ! he 's never fired a pistol since . " Here Paddy Burns 's small eyes twinkled as he slowly raised the stock of his riding-whip at a slender lance-wood-tree about twelve yards off , and gave the lash a sharp crack . The person on the spirited barb almost unconsciously put his right hand in his pocket . Take care , Paddy Burns ; the colonel has a cool hand and a colder eye , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , perhaps . Knows the cutlass exercise as well , and has had considerable experience in bullets , knives , and ropes . Has murdered women  --  lots of them . Would n't stick at killing a child with a junk bottle . And as for men  --  pshaw ! Keep a bright look-out , Paddy . Why , he 'd drown your mother if you had a sister to love . For did n't he drag his own old father and mother down to a dishonored grave ? and do you think , you brave , honest little Irishman , that he would sleep a wink the less sound for putting you to death ? Bah ! man . Shoot all the game you spring , but do n't waste powder on a tiger or a shark . You would like to take a mutual shot with him , though ? Of course you would  --  who doubts it ? But then , gentlemen fight gentlemen ; and this colonel at your elbow is a scoundrel , miscreant , villain , assassin , and  --  pirate ! So you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHAPTER XL . PAUL DARCANTEL . " From the strong will , and the endeavor , That forever Wrestles with the tide of fate ; From the wrecks of hope far scattered , Tempest shattered , Floating waste and desolate . " " Well , Piron , as I have told you , after the peace was made in 1815 , I had command of a brig , and took a cruise on the coast of Brazil . After that I was appointed to a thirty-six gun frigate  --  the old ' Blazer '  --  and went , for three years , to the East Indies , and round home by the Pacific . When we were paid off I made a tour in Europe with that boy 's father , Dr. Darcantel , and  --  " " But you promised to tell me , Cleveland , something about him . " " Nothing easier ; and , if we have half an hour before we get to Escondido , I will give you all I know , in a general way , of his history . Yes ? Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldest and best Creole families in our State of Louisiana , and the plantations of my family and his father were contiguous to each other on the Mississippi , some leagues up the coast above New Orleans . We had the same tutor when we were children , and we grew up from infancy to boyhood together . He was passionate and ungovernable even as a child ; but as he was the heir to a large estate , and his father dead , his weak mother humored and allowed no one to curb him . I myself , one of a numerous family , was put in the navy , and I went away on cruise after cruise , and did not get home again to the old plantation for full seven years . I was a man then , had seen some active service , and I held a commission as a lieutenant in the navy . " In the mean while , Paul Darcantel , who had taken , at the time I left , a strong fancy for medicine and surgery , had been sent to France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know ; but with a large letter of credit he spent a great deal of money ; and we heard that , with great talents and wonderful skill in his profession , he was yet unfitted for close application , and plunged madly into the vortex of dissipation around him . I heard , too  --  or at least my brothers told me  --  that his extravagances had seriously impaired his fortune , and that his duels had been so numerous and desperate as to make his name dreaded even in Paris . On one occasion , at a cafe , he had cut a bullying hussar 's head clean off with his own sabre for knocking a woman down ; and in another duel , where he had detected a French count cheating him at cards , he shot his nose off for a bet . With this unenviable reputation , and at the urgent solicitations of his agent , after years of absence he returned to his ancestral home . We met as of old  --  it was Paul and Henry  --  and though still the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he yet always listened patiently to what I said , and I could , in a manner , control him . He paid very little attention to his property , however , and when he did go to the city to consult with his factor or trustee , he got into some wild frolic , duel , and scrape , and came back worn out with fatigue and dissipation . He was a fine , stern-looking youth in those days , with great muscular power , which , even with the endurance put upon it by gaming and drinking , seemed not to be lessened . " After one of these visits to New Orleans , where his long-forbearing agents had at last awakened him to a bitter sense of his delinquencies , and when mortgage upon mortgage were laid with all their shocking truth before him , he returned and came to me . With all his vices and faults , he was truthful and generous . He told me all , and how he would try to do better , and soothe the declining years of his too indulgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion almost of my cradle , and I loved him , I think , better than my own brothers . Well , he spread all his affairs before me , and in my little den of an outhouse on the plantation we both went systematically over the papers . We were two days and nights at the business ; and when , at last , I showed him that he would still , with a little prudent economy , have a fair income , and eventually , perhaps , redeem his hereditary property , he burst out in a wild yell of delight , and hugged me in his arms . When he had put away the papers , I said , " ' Paul , you know I am engaged to be married , and I have not seen my sweetheart for two whole days ; she has a sister , too , prettier than my Fifine , whom you have never seen since we were boys together . Come , will you go with me ? We can pull ourselves across the river . ' " He hesitated ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he refused to accompany me , for dreadful misery came of it . " The commodore gave a deep sigh , and touched his horse with the spur . " I do n't know , though , Piron ; there is a fate marked out for us all , and we should not exclaim against the decrees of Providence . Paul went with me across the river . There , on the bank , was a little bower of an old French-built stone house , where dwelt the last of a line of French nobility who dated back to the days of Charlemagne . It was an impoverished family , consisting of a reckless brother and two sisters , who , with a few acres of sugar-cane and some old faithful servants , managed to make both ends meet , and to support the establishment in a certain air of elegance and comfort to which they had been accustomed . They were of a proud and haughty race  --  the brother a disdainful and imperious gentleman , smarting and brooding over the reverses of his family , and rarely visiting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were trustful , happy girls , and Josephine had been my childish love . " Here Cleveland bent over his saddle-bow , and if the quiet old horse he bestrode believed the large drops which fell upon his sleek neck came from the clouds , or the drooping foliage of the forest , that animal was never more deceived in his quadruped life . We know that fact , for it stands upon the angelic record . " Well , my dear Piron , as we entered the little saloon where Fifine was seated at the piano , playing the sweet airs she had sung to me when a little bit of a girl , and her beautiful sister bending over a table near , absorbed in a book , while the candles under the glass shades lighted up her dark passionate eyes and brunette complexion , Paul approached her . It was not love at first sight , because they had played together when children ; but it was such a love as only begins and dies with man or woman . The brother came in soon afterward , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they met in a manner which seemed to revive the early dislike they had entertained one toward the other in boyhood . " So the time passed , and in the course of a few months Josephine and I were married , and our home was made on my own old place . Still , night by night , in storm , calm , or freshet , Paul pulled himself in a skiff across that mighty river , and we could see the lights shining to a late hour in the little bower . He had changed a great deal , for he loved with the whole force of his fiery and impetuous nature . Pauline loved too , though still she feared him . The brother , however , bitterly opposed their union , and stormy scenes arose . Josephine and I did all we could to put matters on a happy footing , but Jacques , the brother , grew more determined as his sister refused to cast off her lover , till at last his feeling against him broke out into open scornful insult ; and though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the impetuous spirits of the two men would , at any moment , burst out into open violence . " Darcantel , however , controlled himself , avoided as much as possible any altercations with Jacques , applied himself to the duties of his plantation , and always promised me that he would wait and see if time would not induce the brother to give his consent to the marriage . Meanwhile Paul 's mother died . A year passed . Fifine gave me a little boy , who was called after me , and then I went again to sea . Nearly three years later I returned , and the very night before I reached the plantation a dreadful tragedy had occurred . I might , perhaps , have prevented it had I been there , but it was ordered otherwise . " It seems that two days previously Jacques wrote to Paul  --  I saw the letter  --  and it was something painful to read ; for he not only recapitulated his vices and follies , but he taxed him with being a ruined gambler , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended by swearing , in the most solemn manner , that if he dared again to speak to his sister or darken their doors , he would shoot him like a dog ! " That evening , as usual , the skiff pursued its way across the river , and late at night when it returned there was a fluttering white dress in the stern . Scarcely , however , had the skiff left the bank than a boat shoved out from the other side manned by four negroes , and came swiftly over in pursuit . What afterward transpired I heard from an old married couple of servants who had passed their lives with the family . It appears that Paul , with Pauline in his arms , had barely reached the hall of the great house , and was giving orders to close the doors , when Jacques rushed in with a naked rapier in one hand and a pistol in the other . Paul adjured him , by all he held sacred , not to attack him , as his blood was up , and , unarmed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pauline , too , implored him by a sister 's love to desist ; but seeing him still advance , as she partially shielded Paul , she told him that the man she loved was her husband . " Blinded with haughty rage , this last admission rendered him ungovernable , and he lunged with all his force at Darcantel . Paul parried his rapid passes , though receiving some sharp thrusts in his arm and shoulder , and still supporting his drooping , terrified wife on his left arm till , by a quick spring , he got within Jacques 's guard , and , seizing him by the wrist , wrenched the weapon from his grasp . This was enough to make the brother totally insane by passion from baffled revenge , when he leveled his pistol and fired . There was a faint cry with the report , and a groan from Jacques as the sword went through his body and heart , till the hilt struck hard against his ribs as he fell , a dead man , on the marble pavement . But the bullet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she lay a bridal corpse in her husband 's arms . It was horrible . " I spare you all the afflicting details , Piron , and will only add that Paul left the plantation that night , and when I got home I found an envelope post-marked ' New Orleans , ' inclosing a paper , which constituted me his sole executor , and leaving our little boy his heir . I had but a short leave of a month , and duty called me again away . It was on the anniversary of the day the tragedy occurred , after another long interval of four years in the ' Scourge , ' that I again returned , and then there was wailing and moaning in my own dwelling . My poor Josephine had never recovered from the shock ; she drooped away like a lily , her little boy by her side , and both died during my absence . " What makes the strong man 's eyelids quiver and voice tremble  --  those eyes that have looked calmly on death and carnage in every shape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to battle at his side ? Ah ! " It was midnight , and I walked out to the little grave-yard where my fathers had been buried , and bending my steps to a cluster of magnolias on a little mound by itself , I  --  I  --  a  --  kneeled down beside the sod where reposed all I had loved on earth ! I do not know how long I remained there , but presently I heard a groan near by , and a tall man rose up from where he had been stretched , face downward , on the ground , and I beheld Paul Darcantel ! I could hardly recognize him at first , for he seemed fifty years older than when we had last parted . " ' Cleveland , ' he said , in a hollow , choking voice , ' forgive me ! I am a changed , and , I trust , a better man . I have been drawn to this holy spot by the same errand which brought you hither , and though I did not expect to meet you , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say you forgive me , and you will shed a ray of hope and salvation into the heart of one who will suffer unto the end ! Speak ! ' " Old memories crowded around me , and I saw before me the child in the cradle , and with our arms round each other 's necks as we played together . I forgot , for the moment , the sisters lying there  --  bride , mother , and baby-boy . The magnolias bowed their white flowers in the light of the waning moon , and we fell again into each other 's arms . " After a time he said , ' My only friend , I have brought home with me a little helpless boy ; he is named Henry , after you , and will take the place of the lost little one lying here . Whoever of us survives shall inherit that estate . Come with me and look at him ! ' " He led me to the other mound , and there , beside the tree , a beautiful child lay calmly sleeping , wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a straw hat , and the head resting on one arm on the grave beneath him . " ' Be good to him , ' Paul went on , ' for the sake of those we have lost ourselves ! His mother 's name was Rosalie . ' " He stooped down as he said this , and , raising the boy in his arms , he kissed him passionately , and then put him gently in mine . ' Let him kneel sometimes at this grave , my friend , and pray for me . ' " In another moment Paul Darcantel had gone . The little fellow partly woke , and put his arms affectionately around my neck , and whispered ' Mamma ! mamma ! ' That dashing , brave young fellow ahead there was once that boy . " Well , I took the child to the house , where my good mother and sisters went wild over him , and there he passed a happy boyhood . Years went by , and he grew apace , the pride and delight of us all ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts I gave him of my life at sea , I had him appointed a reefer in the navy . Since that he has seen a great deal of service ; been distinguished in action ; and , on shipboard as well as on shore , liked and respected by all who know him . " In the mean while his father went away , nobody knew whither , for years and years . He wrote to me , however , and to his son , from all parts of the world ; and when I made the tour in Europe I spoke about , Darcantel was my companion . But while there he passed a retired life , never went into society , but visited every hospital in every sea-port from the Mediterranean to Aberdeen in Scotland ; for he is not only a surgeon , as I have reason to know , of wonderful skill , but a thorough-bred seaman too ; and when he has been with me on board ship there is no one whose opinion of the weather , or other nautical matters , do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a dozen times when his advice to me has saved serious damage . And during all these years Darcantel 's estates , under the careful supervision of my eldest brother , have been redeemed from their load of debt , and now he enjoys a noble income  --  or , rather , he spends nothing on himself , but devotes it to widows and orphans , and sick or worn-out sailors . " In the seventeen years which have gone by since he brought his child to me he has made several visits of a month or two 's duration to the plantations , but only when Henry was on leave from duty . Then it was a pleasant sight to see them both together , and the touching air of affection which bound the youth to his father . Henry , from a child , often went and prayed beside the grave under the magnolias , and to this day he believes that his own mother lies buried there . Perhaps it is as well that he should cherish this early belief ; for I may tell you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is the illegitimate offspring of some erring passion of Darcantel , though none of us have ever learned it positively from his father 's lips . He is not a person to be questioned by any one , not even by me ; and as he seems anxious to throw a thick veil over the past , we never venture to draw it aside . " When , however , I was appointed to my present command , Darcantel desired to sail with me , and see the West India Islands , which he had not visited for an age . I was only too happy to have him , especially as Harry there  --  whom I love like a father  --  was named to the little schooner he had cut out in Africa on his last cruise , and ordered to join my squadron . But whenever we get into port his father goes quietly on shore ; passes his time , I think , among the sailors of the foreign shipping , spending money freely among the deserving , and again coming back in his calm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yesterday , that perhaps he might accept your kind invitation to come up here , though not for some days . By George ! " said the commodore , " that must be Escondido ! " Piron sighed as if a pleasant dream had vanished . CHAPTER XLI . INSTINCT AND WONDER . " ' Ho ! sailor of the sea ! How 's my boy  --  my boy ? ' ' What 's your boy 's name , good wife , And in what good ship sailed he ? ' " " Through the night , through the night , In the saddest unrest , Wrapped in white , all in white , With her babe on her breast , Walks the mother so pale , Staring out on the gale , Through the night ! " As the cavalcade trotted round the curve of the peak , and then walked the cattle down the steep zigzag road of the beautiful valley , the commodore said , " But , Piron , tell me who that large man is with the black hair and blue eyes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he landed at Kingston in a vessel from the Isthmus of Panama , and is going to Cuba on his way to England . He came to me , hearing that I was the consignee of old Blunt 's older brig , bound to New Orleans , and so home , to know if he could be dropped at St. Jago , where he has some property or debts to collect ; and since the old skipper has no objection , he has taken passage in the brig when she goes with me and my family . I have since met him  --  he calls himself Colonel Lawton  --  at dinners of our set , and he seems to be an Englishman or Scotchman . Tom Stewart thinks the latter from his accent , and for his liking for snuff ; but Paddy Burns differs , and believes he do n't like snuff , but only takes it to show his splendid box . Any way , he speaks all languages , Spanish , French , Italian , and English , and can talk slang in them all like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own account , with Bolivar there on the Spanish Main ; and he was with Cochrane in that desperate affair of cutting out the ' Esmeralda ' in Callao Bay . A very amusing , entertaining vagabond he is , and I asked him to join us to make the acquaintance of my people on our last frolic to the valley ; but , somehow , I am rather sorry that I gave him a passage with us in the brig , for I do n't altogether like his looks . " " Neither do I , Piron ; his hair is too black for his light blue eyes . However , we must make the most of him . " Over the shaky bridge of the torrent , where Jacob Blunt prayed earnestly for Martha Blunt , and d  --   --  d his donkey as if he had never rocked on water before ; Mr. Mouse , with a last tiny kick on the saddle-flaps of his lofty mule , tumbled off ; Colonel Lawton swinging himself from the saddle of his barb as if he had been part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stingo sliding off any way ; Harry Darcantel trying to descend in fine style , and failing miserably ; Piron and the commodore doing the thing leisurely ; Jacob Blunt pulled off bodily ; while the laughing blacks took the beasts and led them away . There were three pair of eyes that watched all this grace and clumsiness from the windows of the saloon . Two pair of dark ones smiled , and the pair of blue opened until they seemed like azure globes , and then they closed until the fringe of chestnut lashes nearly hid them from sight . " Colonel Lawton , do me the favor to follow my old friend Banou  --  you too , Captain Jacob , and Lieutenant Darcantel and Mr. Mouse ; Paddy Burns and Stingo , here , will show you your quarters in the old billiard-room . Come , commodore , the rest of us will find quarters in the casa . " An hour later the saloon and sala were all alight , and the sashes of the jalousies closed , for it was cool at times up there at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen , Mr. Mouse being a prominent figure in the background . Then came a rustling of robes , and as the great folding doors swung open , the three ladies lit up the saloon in a halo of loveliness with brighter rays than were shed from the wax-lights in the chandelier . Two fair hands were placed in those of Cleveland , and the look which accompanied went back to the happy morning on the old brig 's deck , away off there to sea . " Oh , monsieur , I can not say how glad I am to see you once more ! Let me present you to my sister , Madame Nathalie Delonde , and our daughter . Ah ! my dear Captain Blunt , both your children before you again , and you have come to take us away . " " Colonel Lawton , ma chere , " said Piron . " And , mesdames , " said the commodore , " let me also present my nephew , Lieutenant Darcantel , and Mr. Mouse . " What caused that woman to start as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulsively clasped those white hands together , while her heart beat in yearning throbs , and her bosom rose and fell like billows by the shore ? Why did she then raise one hand to her fair neck , and , as if in a dream , feel for the golden links of the chain , with the other hand pressed to her panting heart for the locket which once reposed there ? How was it that , bewildered by a mother 's instinct , she gazed at the youth before her , and then turned her eyes hopelessly around in search of her husband in the crowd ? " Yes , madame . This is my nephew , Henry Darcantel . " " Ah ! Henri ! Excuse me , monsieur . I am charmed to see you ! " Why , now , did the touch of his hand make her heart beat faster , and send a thrill of joy through her frame ? Only be a little calm , madame , for a while longer , and do n't be sad and ponder all night , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will tell you all he knows when you are alone to-night . The doors of the sala were thrown open . The broad pennant leading with Madame Rosalie ; the military chieftain marching beside Madame Nathalie , much to the animosity of Paddy Burns . Then Mr. Mouse convoying mademoiselle , to the infinite disgust of the commander of the " Rosalie , " one-gun schooner , formerly the " Perdita . " But what made that old negro in spotless white , standing at the door , jerk his head back and open his great eyes till there was no black left in them ? And why did he blunder about the table afterward , and pour wine over the colonel 's richly-laced coat , while staring like an ogre at the young blue-jacket opposite ? That old Banou , perhaps , did not like to see his young mistress too much attended to by every gay scamp who came near her . Oh no ; of course not . But then , if that brawny negro in white had only known over whose arm and mutilated hand he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crammed that heavy cut decanter in powdered glass splinters down the chieftain 's throat . There would have been claret of a different color spilled then  --  quantities of it . You need n't feel in your pockets , colonel , or look round the sala to see if perchance there is a green silk rope squirming from the ceiling . We do n't keep any of those pretty things out at Escondido . So go on with your dinner , you cold-eyed scoundrel , and tell all the lies you can to that lovely woman at your elbow ; how you wanted to save Bolivar 's life , and it was saved without you . Do n't forget , either , to tell her how that patriot had you drummed out of his army , suspecting you of having assassinated the officer near you in the confusion of battle , and robbing him of his watch to replace the one presented to you by the captain general . Paddy Burns is watching you , Colonel Lawton , and that whole-souled little Irishman is not the man to be trifled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banou  --  you nearly twitched off the military gentleman 's hair . Tom Stewart saw it , and he noticed , too , a broad red seam , like the track of a musket bullet  --  honorable wound , no doubt  --  under your black glossy wig . Mr. Mouse had fallen desperately in love with the perfumed damsel beside him , and he knew she was up to her rose-tipped ears in love with him , oh ! fifty fathoms deep ; but his mother liked girls , and he would leave her half-pay ! Still he did n't forget his adoration for the roast duck ; and he slyly swigged some Madeira too , with a wary eye on the broad pennant through the flowers of the epergne . Talked , too , did that reefer  --  ay , chattered  --  and said that the quiet young officer on her left was very well liked in the steerage , and commanded a pretty little craft named the " Rosalie . " She knew that before , did she ? Well , his father was a cold , stern man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been very good to his poor mother , God bless him ! Commodore Cleveland talked in a low tone , all through the dinner , to the lady who did not eat at the head of the table , but who occasionally rested her white hand , with a trustful reliance , on the great tanned-leather paw of Jacob Blunt , that honest mariner not wishing to talk to any body , man or woman . That ancient mariner was mentally cursing donkeys ; speculating how he should get back to the " Martha Blunt " brig , in Kingston harbor ; and praying for Martha Blunt , wife , riding at single anchor near Plymouth beach . Piron took wine with every body , said a word or two all around the table , and talked to Tom Stewart about certain business matters connected with the plantation when he had gone . Then came the last course , and the dessert of delicious fruits , which quite stopped Mr. Mouse 's mouth , and even his palpitating heart ceased beating ; while Mademoiselle Rosalie nibbled some lady-finger biscuit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earnest lips beside her . We told you , miss , how it would be ; and , in spite of the warning , there you are  --  the color coming and going over your girlish cheeks , and never saying a word ! " What a couple that would make ! " thought Madame Nathalie . And what a resemblance in expression there is between them  --  he with his dark hair and eyes , and she fair and blue . Be careful , my sweet Rosalie ! And so thought her sister and her sister 's husband ; Stingo , too , old Banou , and every one save Tiny Mouse , who had no rivals but Rat , Beaver , and Martin , and he could take the wind out of their sails any day . The party of ladies rose from the table , and leaving the men  --  all except the captain of the " Rosalie " and Mr. Mouse , who would have remained had he not seen a shake of the broad pennant 's finger  --  went into the saloon . Then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a guitar by stronger fingers , an air from an opera , a song or two , much conversation  --  while Reefer Mouse slept on the sofa  --  and coffee . Then it was late ; every one was fatigued , bon soirs were said , and the party  --  coffee and all  --  separated . CHAPTER XLII . TRUTH AND TERROR . " In slumbers of midnight the sailor-boy lay , His hammock swung loose at the sport of the wind ; But watch-worn and weary , his cares flew away , And visions of happiness danced o'er his mind . " " And how the sprites of injured men Shriek upward from the sod ; Ay ! how the ghostly hand will point To show the burial clod ; And unknown facts of guilty acts Are seen in dreams from God ! " In a great square room , standing , as usual , on cocoa-nut stilts , which had once been used for a billiard-room , were half a dozen iron-framed cots , ranged along the walls , in which some of the Escondido 's guests were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and comfortable ; snow-white bedclothes and gauze musquito nets , lots of napkins and ewers , and things for bathing behind a screen of dimity curtains ; and not forgetting a large table  --  vice the billiard-table  --  in the centre , on which stood plenty of sugar and limes , cinnamon and nutmeg , bottles and flasks , red and white , and  --  very little water , in jugs . The occupants of this bivouac had turned in , and the lights had been doused . Conversation , however , was kept up , especially by the thin little voice of Mr. Mouse , who , having enjoyed a nap in the early evening , and having been danced and tumbled about on the trip to the lodge by Harry Darcantel , who was in tiptop condition , the reefer was as wide awake as a blackfish . Don Stingo chanted a few convivial airs and snored ; so did Jacob Blunt , with a spluttering groan intermixed ; and Paddy Burns fell off into a doze , saying blasphemous words addressed to the world at large , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a Bolivian patriot edgewise with a friend and companion of his , Mr. Joe Manton , at his side ; he would put an end to any more lies about charges of cavalry , and cutting out frigates in Callao Bay . That Paddy Burns would , though he did n't wear a wig and a large sapphire on the only finger he had left on his left hand , and with a diamond snuff-box , too ! Presented to you by a connection of your family , was it ? Take a pinch out of it ? D  --   --  him , no ! Begorra , the snuff is not Lundy Foot 's , and the box is brass , sir , brass ! " I say , Mouse , keep quiet , will you , and let me go to sleep ! " Harry Darcantel did not think of going to sleep ; that was a fib he told the reefer ; he wanted merely to shut his eyes and dream of  --  you know who  --  a tall , graceful girl with blue eyes and light hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was no sleep for him for ever so long . What did she say ? Why , she never opened her pouting lips to show those even pearly teeth . She only looked out of those soft blue eyes . That was all ! " Mr. Darcantel , I think of getting married . " " The d  --   --  you do ! And who to , pray ? " " Why , " said Mr. Mouse , as he rolled over and kicked the sheet off his slate-pencil built legs , " I have n't made up my mind ; but do you know that that pretty girl up there at the big house has taken quite a fancy to me , and when you were presented to her mother she gave me such a squeeze of the hand ! Oh my ! " Here Mr. Mouse 's narrative was cut short by a pillow hitting him plump on the mouth , clean through his musquito net . " Very charming young lady , Mr. Mouse , " said a quiet voice , in a cool tone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to take a violent fancy to you . " Mr. Mouse rolled over , and then , sitting up in his cot , replied , " Yes , sir ! and that was her mother sitting by you when the big nigger in white capsized the wine over your sleeve , and nearly pulled your a  --  hair off . " Look out , Mr. Mouse ! If that man there beside you once gives a twitch at your curls , he 'll pull something more than hair  --  perhaps a little scalp with it ! " Oh ! " was the sound that came back . " Yes , sir ; and the other beautiful lady next the commodore is her sister . She had a son just mademoiselle 's age , who was murdered by pirates off Jamaica ever so many years ago , and Commodore Cleveland chased them in a ship he was first lieutenant of  --  my father commanded the ship  --  she was the old ' Scourge . ' " " Hold your tongue ! " came from the cot where the spare pillow was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chieftain ; but if the room had not been so dark , the way his eyes opened and emitted an icy glare of surprise would have made Tiny Mouse shiver with cold . " Oh dear , yes , colonel , I heard the commodore tell all about it the other night on board the frigate . He thought I was asleep , but I kept awake through the best part of it . " " The best part of it ? " " Why , sir , how an old one-eyed Spaniard deceived my father , and sent him on a fool 's errand from St. Jago down to the Isle of Pines , and afterward how the ' Scourge ' chased the piratical schooner in a hurricane for ever so long , clear away to the coast of Darien , where they blew her out of water , and killed every scoundrel on board ! " Not every one , Mr. Mouse . There is the very greatest of those scoundrels grinding his teeth and glaring your way at your elbow . " What was the name of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I wo n't be quiet ; the colonel wants to hear all about it . There 's a good fellow , tell me ! " " Garotte Cape . " The listener slowly raised the mutilated hand , and put the finger with the sapphire ring to his throat , evidently not liking the name of that cape , for it caused a choking sensation to utter it  --  " Ho ! Cape Garotte ! " " Yes , sir ; and Darcantel 's father here once chartered a vessel , and went all the way down there to explore the place , and was gone fifteen months ! Was n't he , Darky ? " said the boy , familiarly . " Mouse , I tell you what it is , if you do n't shut up that little flytrap of yours , I 'll make Rat lick you when you go on board ! " " Rat lick me ? " said Tiny , as he jumped straight up in the cot ; " I gave him and Martin a black eye apiece only on our last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed his brother-in-law in a duel ! " " Hush , my dear little fellow ! you did a very foolish thing . There , say no more on that subject ; it gives me pain , my Tiny . So talk on as much as you like . " " My dear friend , " exclaimed the lad , in a broken voice ; as he plunged through his net and put his arms around Darcantel , " I would n't grieve you for the world ; but do you suppose , little as I am , that I would n't fight for the doctor , who is so kind to me , and has done so much for my poor dear sweet mother ? " Here there was a sob as he wound his arms closer round his friend 's neck , and cried like a child , as he was . " Well , never mind , Tiny ; go to sleep , now ! I am not angry . There , turn in ! " " I wo n't speak another word to-night , Harry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " I beg your pardon , monsieur , " said the colonel , in French , with a slight quiver on his tongue , " but did your father really go all the way down to Darien out of mere curiosity ? " " Yes , sir , he did go there to see if by any chance one of the pirates had escaped ; and he traveled , too , a good deal about among the Indians , making inquiries . " " Ho ! and did he pick up any information there ? " " Why , sir , I am not positive , but I believe that he got a hint that a European had wandered over that country who had been wounded in the head and hand , and was almost naked ; but the natives could give him but very meagre accounts . He continued on , however , down the Isthmus , on the Pacific side , by sea , as far as Chili , when he went into the interior to Peru , crossed the Andes , and followed down the Orinoco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh ! no other motive than curiosity ? " " Perhaps he had ; for he once told me he had some old scores to settle with the man who commanded the pirate , and if he was alive he felt quite sure he would , one of those days , put him to death . My father , sir , is a very determined person , and never forgets an oath . " " Truly , monsieur , you interest me . But what sort of a man in appearance is your father  --  a doctor , I think you said ? " " He is a tall gentleman of about fifty , sir , though he looks much older ; for he has suffered deeply in early life , when my mother  --  a  --  died ; but I shall have the pleasure of introducing him to you , colonel . He is now on board our frigate at Kingston , and told me he would be up here to-morrow or the next day . " " Ah ! thank you extremely , Monsieur Darcantel . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No more words that night ; but much thinking and moving of thin lips , and eyes staring in the dark , wide open . There was low grating of teeth , too ! And a man lay in that large room on a narrow cot , surrounded by a gauze net ; and , so far as mental torture went , it was not unlike a trestle net we once saw without gauze , where a gaunt frame was stretched , with myriads of sand-flies , musquitoes , and stinging insects sucking his heart 's blood . Sometimes the eyelids closed , as if they were a film of ice forming over the blue cold orbs within ; and again the fabric cracked , and they were wide open once more . They could read , too , those frozen orbs ; and like heavy flakes of snow falling on bloodstained decks , till it covered with a weight of lead the stark , stiff corpse beneath , they yet tried to pierce into the dark region beyond . And the heart beat with a slow and measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treacherous crust of snow , and then stood stock-still ! Had a letter , traced with the fingers of an icicle , been congealed a hundred feet deep in the heart of a toppling iceberg on the coast of Labrador , those eyes could have read it as clear as day ! " You infamous pirate , Captain Brand ! " it began  --  " the son of the man who destroyed the ' Centipede ' and her crew , and the boy whom your brutal mate tore from the mother you saw at dinner to-day , are near you ! That calm , stern , determined doctor , too , whom you laced down on the trestle for poisonous insects to kill , has been on your track for the past seventeen years , and will soon hold you in his iron gripe ! There will be no mercy then ! " The eyes closed , the heart stopped beating , and the thin lips and tongue , as dry as cartridge-paper , now took up the strain , while the mutilated hand clutched convulsively , as if there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assassinate my old doctor , and run the risk of being arrested and hung ? No ! He thinks me dead , and I will go back to the island , redeem my treasure , and pass the remainder of my life tranquilly in the highlands of Scotland ! " Do n't be too sanguine , Colonel Lawton ; for , though your ten thousand pounds in gold is still in the vault , yet there is Don Ignacio Sanchez , whose estates have been confiscated , and who has just got out of ten years ' imprisonment in the Moro of Havana , glad to save his neck from the iron collar , and , without the little jewel-hilted blade up his sleeve , is now turning about to see how he may redeem his lost fortunes . Do n't be an hour too late , I pray you , Captain Brand , for that sharp eye of Don Ignacio has already , perhaps , looked at the shiny cleft in the crag , and thinks he knows what lies hidden there ! Oh , si ! nothing but mouldy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fond of more substantial food , even though it were yellow greenish gold , mildewed by damp , but yet solid and refreshing . Cierto  --  certainly ! Quien sabe  --  who knows ? But be careful , Don Ignacio ! Do n't take your old wife with you on that projected expedition , for you have treated that old woman  --  who resembles a rotten banana  --  badly ! You have won back in monte all she ever won by cheating , besides the half ounces you used to give her for the Church  --  cheated her by drawing two cards at a time when you saw the numerals with that spark of an eye , and when you knew that she would win if you drew fairly ! Yes , you have , you old sinner , for more than two score of years ! And she hates you now  --  though you do n't think it  --  worse than you did Captain Brand ! Have an eye to that old banana ! So passed that short night  --  long enough , however , for somebody  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the valley , there was a mettled barb , with open nostrils , galloping up the broken road as if he had the devil on his back  --  as perhaps he had , or Colonel Lawton , or Captain Brand , possibly all three , but it makes very little odds to us . CHAPTER XLIII . PEACE AND LOVE . " And many a dim o'erarching grove , And many a flat and sunny cove ; And terraced lawns , whose bright cascades The honeysuckle sweetly shades ; And rocks whose very crags seem bowers , So gay they are with grass and flowers . " It was a delightful breakfast with the merry party at Escondido as they sat under the wide , cool piazza in the shade , with the sun throwing his slanting rays through the vines and clusters of purple grapes , and through the orange-trees , where the yellow fruit was fast losing its fragrant dew  --  all the men once more in summer rig , and the ladies in flowing muslin and tidy caps . " My dear , " said Piron to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests , Colonel Lawton ; he went away at daylight this morning , and left a message to me , and compliments to you all , that business of importance , which he had forgotten , demanded his immediate return to Kingston . " There was no sorrow expressed by the lady or her fair sister , and even the men treated it with indifference , except Mr. Burns , who remarked , as he snapped a tooth-pick in twain , that , for his part , he was glad the fellow had gone ; he did n't like his looks at all , though he did make himself so fascinating to the beautiful widow who sat next him . " Ah ! Monsieur Burns , think you I would prefer a scarlet coat when  --  " " You might get a blue ! " broke in Paddy , with a comical twinkle of his eye , as he winked in the direction of Commodore Cleveland , who sat opposite . " No , no , " exclaimed the pretty widow , hastily , as she shook her finger at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to say  --  when those red coats there from England killed my poor husband at Quatre Bras . " " Ah ! yes , my dear  --  bad luck to them ! But an Irishman would never have been so cruel , you know , though , ' pon me sowl , " went on Paddy , as he stuck a fork in an orange and began to divest it of its peel , West India fashion , to present it to the matron beside him , " I fear I should like to kill any man who loved ye , Madame Nathalie , myself . " " What a droll man you are , Monsieur Burns , " replied the widow , laughing outright , " when you know you would prefer a jug of Antigua punch , any day , to me . Stop , now ! did n't you say , at your grand dinner in Kingston , that you would never allow a woman to darken your doors ? " " I  --  a meant  --  a black woman , my dear ; as true as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What are you two laughing at , my sister ? " " Why , here is Mr. Burns making love to me at breakfast , and before night he will be abusing me for not pouring enough rum in his punch ! " " That 's his caractur , Madame Nathalie ; for I , Tom Stewart , am the only person he ever loved , and he sometimes offers to shoot me for giving him unco ' good advice . " " Howld yer tongue , ye divil ye ! and you too , Stingo , or the pair of ye shall niver taste another sip of the old claret . Ye 've ruined me cause entirely ! But I 'll lave ye me property , madame , when I 'm gone . " " He 's been talking of going , Nathalie , " said Piron , " for the last twenty years , and has left his estate to at least thirty women , to my certain knowledge ; but he has n't got off yet , and  --  " " Tom Stewart , ye miserable limb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . " Jacob Blunt unclosed his salt-junk mouth , and roared out in a peal of laughter that would have shivered his old brig 's spanker , and caused , perhaps , Martha Blunt , sposa , to have spanked him , Jacob , had she heard and seen that mariner wagging his old bronzed face at the lovely woman facing him . Mr. Tiny Mouse , who could not touch bottom on his high chair , with his little heels dangling about , forgetful of discipline , fairly kicked the broad pennant on the shins of his white ducks , screaming joyously ; the three women made the piazza vibrate with their musical trills ; Stingo and Stewart choked ; Cleveland and Darcantel were amused ; and old black Banou looked at his master , and grinned till his double range of teeth seemed like a white wave breaking at the cove . And then Paddy Burns took up the chorus , and after one or two Galway yells his friends took him up , thumped him smartly on the back , and stood him up against one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he did , however , recover the power of speech , he wiped his eyes and looked around till they rested on Madame Nathalie , when , with his white napkin held up like a shield beside his rubicund visage , he spluttered , " By me sowl , Tom Stewart , I mane what I say ; and Paddy Burns 's word is his bond ! " Ay , and so it was , you generous , whole-souled Milesian ! And you did this time make a will . Tom Stewart and Stingo witnessed it , with handsome legacies therein set forth ; and when one night you tumbled down  --  Well , we wo n't mention the particulars ; but Paddy kept his word . As the party rose from the breakfast table to get ready for a stroll down to the mill and around the plantation , one fair woman 's hand was placed with a confiding , friendly clasp in that of Monsieur Burns ; and then , as a graceful girl reached up to pull down her great flat straw hat from the post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she returned it too , as if she knew how to perform that ceremony even before people . Mr. Reefer Mouse had some thoughts of getting jealous , and calling Mr. Burns out , at ten paces , ships ' pistols , and all that sort of thing ; but the round , red-faced gentleman kissed him too , declaring the while , as he held him aloft , that he was first-rate kissing  --  that he was ; nearly as good as mademoiselle , which quite disarmed Tiny 's wrath , and then he hooked on to the damsel 's delicate flipper , and tripped away with her down the valley . Harry Darcantel exchanged a nod  --  not of defiance  --  with Paddy Burns , as much as to hint that those were not dangerous kisses  --  oh , not at all ; and passing his hand over his brown mustache , he followed after the couple before him . Yes , Harry , Tiny 's legs will get tired soon , and he will be hungry , and come back to old Banou for luncheon , while you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mademoiselle to keep her straw hat about her lovely face , and not to get tanned by the sun . And when she turns her humid eyes toward you , you begin to believe the sky is never so blue as those eyes ! Tom Stewart , Stingo , and Burns never walked ; they preferred lounging about the veranda , smoking cigars , and talking over the price of sugar and coffee , together with minor matters connected with factors ' profits and suits at law . Jacob Blunt leaned over the bridge , thinking of the " Martha Blunts , " brig and wife  --  not unfrequently confounding the two together  --  thinking this was to be his last voyage by land or sea , and that young Binks , his mate , should take command , and steer that old teak-built vessel carefully  --  oh , ever so keerful  --  or else the old hulk might come to grief . Piron and his wife going mournfully down the valley  --  she with her mother 's eyes gazing far out to sea , and he with his strong arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , night and morning , out over the blue water , from chamber and piazza , and seeing nothing but a breaking wave and a baby-boy drowning beneath it  --  nothing more ! Madame Nathalie and Cleveland went on gallantly ahead  --  he with his blue pennant flying , and she with a black silk widow 's ribbon around the frill of her cap , and a broader band about that muslin waist  --  talking of those they had both lost years ago , and trusting they were in heaven , as they believed they were ; hope to meet again themselves in Louisiana , and see a great deal of one another in time to come  --  not a doubt of it ! Yes , the cruise was more than half over , and he was quite tired of the sea . She , however , thought the sea beautiful , and never tired of looking at it . True , not rolling on top of it all the time  --  liked to sleep without rocking . When the sea-breeze came fluttering up the gorge again , through the canes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tropical forest , with the brilliant feathered tribes nestling close together on the lofty branches , and before the first salt breath had been exhaled in the clouds about the topmost peaks of the Blue Mountains , thousands of feet in the air , the party at Escondido had again returned to the broad piazzas , where , with blinds open , and swinging in cool grass hammocks , the men took siesta , while the ladies sought the pretty bowers within . So passed one happy day , like the one gone before ; and before the close of the week Dr. Darcantel joined the party , to take the place of Colonel Lawton ; and a few days after old Clinker crackled up , very dry and thorny , with parchment in his pockets to take inventories , and do musty business generally . Then the fair women , escorted by the navy men , and the Droger and Stingo , took their departure for the town house and ships in Kingston , leaving Paddy Burns , and Tom Stewart , and Clinker with Piron to close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Darcantel said he would remain with them likewise , since he had got through his business in Spanish Town and Port Royal , and wanted quiet . Madame Rosalie was the last to leave ; and before her husband lifted her into the saddle , they stood together on the piazza , she looking with that still yearning gaze over the sea , and seeing nothing but breaking waves . That was the last look from Escondido ! CHAPTER XLIV . SNUFF OUT OF A DIAMOND BOX . " Hark ! a sound , Far and slight , Breathes around On the night ; High and higher , Nigh and nigher , Like a fire Roaring bright . " " Not a word to each other ; we kept the great pace  --  Neck by neck , stride by stride , never changing our place ; I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight , Then shortened each stirrup , and set the pique right ; Rebuckled the check-strap , chained slacker the bit , Nor galloped less steadily , Roland , a whit . " Another week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as flat as last year 's palm-leaves , rustling himself like the leaves of an old book , and began to squeeze out a few dry remarks about earthquakes . He at last got Paddy Burns , who was a round , fat man , with much blood in him , in such a state of excitement , by talking about cracks , and yawning chasms , and splits in the earth , clouds of dust , sulphureous smells , and beams falling down and pressing people to powder over their wine , that Paddy declared he thought he was swallowing sawdust and eating dried codfish at every sip of Antigua punch and suck of orange he took . Tom Stewart , likewise , said he could n't sleep a wink for quaking , and had cut a slice clean out of his chin while shaving , because his glass shook by a slamming door , and he thought his time had come . Darcantel said nothing , but he took a quiet fancy to old Clinker , and talked for hours with him of the effect earthquakes had upon ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , being withal very particular with regard to the appearance of the crews . Piron looked grave , and heard the old clerk out , as if dried fruit were better than fresh , and limes sweeter than oranges . Well , they were all sitting over their dessert at their last dinner at Escondido , for they were all going to leave old Clinker in the morning . Illustration : " HIS RIGHT ARM POISED WITH CLENCHED HAND ALOFT , " ETC . " Well , Clinker , " said Piron , kindly , " do n't let us talk any more about the earthquake . You told me yesterday that you had a note from Colonel Lawton , saying he would not take passage in the brig with us to New Orleans , as his business obliged him to leave before we could sail ? " Clinker choked out something like " Yes , " as if it were the last sound a body could sigh with three or four hundred tons on his back . " I 'm dooced glad to hear it , Piron ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I do n't believe any more of his patriot sarvice than I do in Clinker 's earthquake . That colonel is a baste ; and if my words prove true , I 'll lave a thousand pounds to old Clinker there . " Paddy Burns 's words did prove true ; and old Clinker was with him when he gave a quake the earth had nothing to do with , it being entirely of an apoplectic nature ; but he got the thousand pounds nevertheless . " For once in your life , Burns , I agree with ye ; and if that military mon went to shoot grouse with me in the Hielands , I 'd tramp behind him , and keep both barrels of me gun cocked . The devil take his black wig and his green eyes ! and he passing himself ' aff for a Scot , too ! Tut , mon ! " " By the way , Clinker , " said Piron , during a pause in the conversation , " if the colonel is not going with us , I must take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us so suddenly the other morning . Here it is , with the letters of his name on it in brilliants . I thought it too valuable to send by one of the blacks , and I kept it to carry myself . " How singular it was that the colonel should have forgotten his royal treasure ! Keep your wits about you , Captain Brand , or one of these days you 'll be forgetting your pistols . " Given to him by a connection of his family , was it , Paddy ? Weel , mon , let 's take a peench for the honor of Sackveel Street , and then push it along to Meester Darcantel . " The doctor was sitting in his calm , grave way , listening to the disjointed words  --  like dry nuts dropping on the ground  --  from the shriveled lips of Clinker ; but as he abstractedly put his fingers in the box , and turned his eyes languidly as he pushed down the lid , he gave a bound from his chair  --  with the box clutched in his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even made Clinker believe the forty-year earthquake had come before its time . Standing there , with his tall , majestic figure , like a statue of bronze , his right arm poised with clenched hand aloft in a threatening attitude , his dark , grizzled locks bristling above his head , the black eyes flaming with an inhuman light , as if prepared to crush , with the power of a god , the pigmies around him , he said , in a deep low voice , which made the glasses ring and shudder , " Who owns this bawble ? " " It belongs to a Colonel Lawton who has been staying here ! " exclaimed Piron , quickly and hurriedly . " What sort of man ? " came again from those terrible lungs , without relaxing a muscle of his frame . " A square-built , tallish fellow , of about feefty , with greenish-blue eyes , a black wig , and a glorious sapphire ring on the only finger of his left hand ! " roared Burns and Stewart together . Again came the jar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses , and all shake , as Paul Darcantel strode with his heels of adamant out of the sala and to the veranda ; then a bound , which was heard in the room ; and after five minutes ' stupid silence Banou appeared . The buckra gentleman had torn rather than led his master 's barb from the stable , and scarcely waiting for a saddle , had thrown himself like an Indian across his back . There ! his master might hear the clattering of the hoofs up the steep . " The mon 's daft  --  clean daft , mon ! " " Be me sowl , it 's the only pair of eyes I iver would n't like to look at over me saw-handled friend , Joe Manton ! " " He 's taken the box with him , " crackled Clinker . But that was the last that Paddy Burns , or Stewart , or Clinker ever saw of man or box . Piron rose and listened to the sound of the receding hoofs from the veranda ; and when he resumed his place his lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the rest of them heard a good deal about the man and the box in time to come . Did that blooded horse , as he dashed round the curve of the peak , with his thin nostrils blazing red in the dark night , know who his rider was , and on what errand he was bound ? It was not snuff that distended those wide nostrils as he plunged down the broken road , through the close , deep forest , over rocks and water-courses , without missing a step with his sure , ringing hoofs ; and mounting the sharp gorge beyond with the leap of a stag , his mane and tail streaming in the calm , thick night ; the eyes lanterns of pursuing light , flashing out before his precipitous tread in jets of fire , as his feet struck the flinty stones , with a regular , enduring throb from his heaving chest , as an encouraging hand patted his shoulder and urged him onward . Down the mountain again , with never a shy or a snort  --  the horse knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lizards wheetling merrily , and the paroquets on the tree-tops waking up to chatter with satisfaction . Then into the beaten track along by the sea-shore , the horse increasing his stride at every minute , the spume flying in flakes from his flaming nostrils , and the man bending to his hot neck , smoothing away the white foam , until , with a panting stagger , horse and rider stood still in the town of Kingston . " Here , my boys , rub this your master 's horse down well , and walk him about the court-yard for an hour . There ! Take this between you ! " One last pat of the steed 's arched neck , a grateful neigh as the dark face pressed against his broad head , and Paul Darcantel strode away in the gray light of the morning . " Gor ra mighty ! Nimble Jack , look at dis ! Bress my modder in hebben , it am one gold ounce apiece , sure as dis gemman 's name Ring Finger Bill ! De Lord be good to dat tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him away on poor niggers ! " Even while the tall man strode on toward the port , and as the happy blacks were chattering over their yapper , and walking the gallant steed up and down the paved court-yard , a dull , heavy-sailing Spanish brigantine was slowly sagging past Gallows Point and the Apostles ' Battery , when , creeping on by the frowning forts of Port Royal , she held her course to sea . Very different sort of craft from the counterfeit brigantine , with clean , lean bows , slipping out from the Tiger 's Trap one sultry evening before a hurricane , which went careering , with a sea-hound after her , down to the Garotte Gorge . Different kind of a crew too ; and Captain Brand must have remarked the contrast , with his keen , critical , nautical eye  --  that is , if he chanced to sail in both brigantines , as there is much reason for believing he did  --  with great disgust , on board the dirty , dumpy old ballahoo now just clear of Drunkenman 's Cay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jago de Cuba . CHAPTER XLV . LILIES AND SEA-WEED . " Oh leave the lily on its stem ! Oh leave the rose upon the spray ! Oh leave the elder bloom , fair maids , And listen to my lay ! " " When descends on the Atlantic The gigantic Storm-wind of the equinox , Landward in his wrath he scourges The toiling surges , Laden with sea-weed from the rocks . " By day and night , under sun or moon , and in breeze or calm  --  by the resounding shore  --  on the rippling water  --  in saloon and grove , picnicking and boating  --  under vine or awning  --  all around in the whirling waltz , the measured contra-danza  --  amid the tinkle of guitar or trill of piano , the rattle and crash of the full band on board the frigate  --  gently rocking on the narrow deck of the " Rosalie , " or down in the brig of teak , there was ever a white arm linked in the arm of blue  --  now timidly , then with a confiding pressure  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a fixed , steady gaze from the brown to the light  --  here a palpitating pause , and then the blue arms wound around the waving stem  --  two white arms clasping , with a passionate caress , the neck of the weed  --  and , yes ! the lily floating on the white cheek of the pond had been caught by the strong weed , and with the reacting tide was going out to sea ! Ay ! the sailor had won the maiden ! But while the lily rocked hither and thither on the pond , with its blond leaves and petals of blue , and its pliant stem in danger at every tide , did the fond mothers watch it from the bank ? That they did , thinking of the time when they were lilies of the pond themselves , with no fears of danger near . But at last it came , and , like blooming flowers , they swung to and fro in the rain , dropping a tear or two from their own rosy leaves  --  more in dewy sorrow than in fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of roses the while one toward another , peeping out with their dark violet eyes , and listening , as the wind shook them , with a tremble of apprehension , and clinging hopefully to the straight support on which they reclined . By day and night , in burning sun with not a drop to drink , and in the sultry night with no morsel of food to eat  --  through the searing sand in the streets and lanes , down by the quays  --  to every vessel in the crowded harbor  --  in every hotel and lodging-house in Kingston  --  up and down Spanish Town  --  away off to Port Royal  --  occasionally going on board the frigate for gold , then on shore again  --  in ribald wassail and drunken dance , gaming hells especially , and low crimping houses , maroon and negro huts , and wretched haunts of vice  --  scattering gold like cards , dice , rum , and water  --  no end to it  --  in large yellow drops too  --  and still striding on , questioning , gleaming with those revengeful eyes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  went Paul Darcantel . Oh , Paul , that cowardly villain saw you from the very moment you took that pinch of snuff out of his blue enameled box  --  ay , even before , when you walked your mule slowly up the broken road , while a goaded barb was curbed back in the gloomy forest till you had passed , with his rider 's finger in his waistcoat pocket . And in all your ceaseless wanderings , by day and night , that now timid , terror-stricken villain has been following you ; dodging behind corners  --  under the well-worn cloths of monte banks  --  in the back rooms of pulperias  --  hiding in nests of infamy  --  every where and in all places steering clear of you . Oh , Paul ! what a deceived man you are ! And while you are doing all this , just turn your eyes out to the calm spot off Montego Bay , where that leaky old brigantine is bobbing about . The dirty , surly capitano kicking and beating the hands from taffrail to bowsprit , particularly one great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few dry thin hairs to shield his skull from the scorching sun ; cursing him , as he puffs a cigarette , for being the most idle scoundrel of a skulk on board ! But he  --  the scoundrel !  --  laughing with a hollow laugh up the sleeve of his filthy shirt , with never a dollar in his belt or an extra pair of trowsers in the forecastle , with bare feet , and still , cold eyes , now turned to green  --  eating nasty jerked beef and drinking putrid water  --  never sleeping for vermin  --  kicked and cuffed about the decks . But yet he smiled with a devilish satisfaction , Paul , for he has escaped you , and was bound to St. Jago de Cuba ! From there he would charter  --  steal , perhaps  --  a small boat , and run over to the Doce Leguas Cays , where there were ten thousand pounds in mildewed gold !  --  if nobody had discovered it , which was not probable  --  and he  --  the scoundrel !  --  would gather it up in bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . You must be very quick , Captain Brand , for the leaky brigantine does not sail so fast as the " Centipede , " and your ancient compadre , Don Ignacio , is just out of prison . His old , fat , banana wife is very sorry for it , but that 's none of your business . And you , Doctor Paul ! do n't you pity that flying , dirty wretch , with his mutilated hand , and soul-beseeching gaze out of those greenish frozen eyes , where a ray of mercy never entered , but whose icy lids fairly crack as your shadow stamps across them ? No , not a ray of pity or mercy for the infamous villain ; not even a twitch of the little finger of his bloody , mutilated white hand ! No , not the faintest hope of pity ! He shall die in such torments as even a pirate never devoted a victim . But you are worn out , Darcantel ; your prey has escaped you . The people think you mad , as you are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and your frame still as nervous as a galvanized corpse , yet flesh and blood can not stand it . Go on board the " Monongahela , " and talk to that true friend whose counsels you have ever listened to since you were rocking in your cradle ; or take that noble , gallant youth in your arms and console him  --  for he needs consolation  --  and think of the mouse who gnawed the net years and years ago . Well , you will , Paul Darcantel ; but before you do , you will step into that jeweler 's shop and buy a trifle for old Clinker there , out at Escondido . You want a ring , the finest gem that can be found on the island of Jamaica . There it is  --  its equal not to be bought in the whole West India Islands , or the East Indies either . " I gave a military man an ounce for the setting alone , but the sapphire-looking stone may be glass . He was going to sail the next morning in a Spanish brigantine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay his bill at the lodging-house adjoining . The senor might take it for any price he chose to put upon it . " What made that old dealer in precious stones and trinkets turn paler than his old topaz face as he yelled frantically for his older Creole wife ? The senor had seized the ring as he broke his elbows through the glass cases which contained the time-honored jewelry , and dashed a yellow shower of heavy gold ounces over the floor of the little shop , smashing the glass door of that too in his exit ! And when the little toddling fat woman appeared in the most indecent dress possible to conceive of , with scarcely time to light her paper cigar , she exclaimed , " Es lunatico , hombre ! ay , demonio con oro ! A crazy man  --  a demon with gold ! " And forthwith she picked up the pieces and looked at them critically to be sure of their value . " Son buenos , campeche ! All right , old deary ; we 'll have such a podrida to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . There 's the ounce you gave the officer man for the ring , and I 'll guard the rest . " That old woman did , too ; and that very night she won  --  in the most skillful way  --  from her shaky old topaz , in his tin spectacle setting , his last ounce , and locked all up in her own little brass-nailed trunk for a rainy season for them both , together with their daughter 's pickaninnies . Paul Darcantel whirled and spun round the corners and along the sandy streets till he reached the landing , moving like a water-spout , and clearing every thing from his track . There he sprang into the first boat he saw , seized the sculls , despite the shrieks and gesticulations of the old nigger whose property it was , and who jumped overboard with a howl as if a lobster had caught him by the toe , and paddled into a neighboring boat , where , with the assistance of another ancient crony , they both let off volley upon volley of shrieks , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a javelin toward the men-of-war . However , those old stump-tailed African baboons found a gold ounce in their boat after it had been set adrift from the American frigate . What a jolly snapping of teeth over a tough old goose stuffed with onions that night , with two respectable colored ladies and a case-bottle of rum beside them ! You can almost sniff the fragrant odor as it arises , even at this distance . I do , and shall , mayhap , many a time again , in lands where stuffed goose and comely colored ladies abound . CHAPTER XLVI . PARTING . " The very stars are strangers , as I catch them Athwart the shadowy sails that swell above ; I can not hope that other eyes will watch them At the same moment with a mutual love . They shine not there as here they now are shining ; The very hours are changed . Ah ! do ye sleep ? O'er each home pillow midnight is declining  --  May one kind dream at least my image keep ! " There had been a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bid the commodore good-by  --  all old friends of both parties  --  the Pirons , Burns , Stewart , Stingo , and Jacob Blunt . Clinker was not there , for he never went where it was damp , and if he got musty it must be from mildew on shore . The " Martha Blunt , " under the careful management of young Binks , the mate , with Banou and all the baggage on board , was being towed by two of the frigate 's boats down the harbor , with her yards mast-headed , all ready to sheet home the sails when the black pilot should say the land-wind would make and the passengers to come on board . The lights were twinkling from lattice and veranda in the upper and lower town , the lanterns of the French and English admirals were shining from the tops of their flag-ships , and the revolving gleams from the beacon on the Pallissadoes Point flickered and dazzled over the gemmed starlit surface of the water . The awning was still spread on the after-deck of the " Monongahela ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paced the forward part of the deck with the midshipmen to leeward , the sentries on the high platform outside and on the forecastle , the party of ladies and gentlemen stood silently watching and thinking . There is no need explaining their looks or their thoughts ; we know all about them . How Paddy Burns and Tom Stewart , with little Stingo , were going over the time , thirty years or more back , when with Piron there , boys together , they all swam on the beach of that fine harbor . The old school-house , too , with the tipsy old master , who whacked them soundly , drunk or sober ; their frolics at the fandangoes in Spanish Town ; their transient separations in after life on visits to France or the Old Country ; the hearty joy to meet again and drink Jamaica forever . And now their companion in tropical heat and mountain shade was going to part with them , and sail away over that restless ocean , never , perhaps , to meet again ! Even old Clinker , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his dried old lemon of a face lying in his leaves of hands  --  with no light in the dark , deserted old counting-house  --  looked out between his fibres of fingers and saw the cradle , with the sleeping twins within it , while the rafters pressed him as flat as the old portfolio before him . And now , as a drop or two of bitter juice exuded from his shriveled rind , he saw those lovely twins floating away , never more to be saved from an earthquake by old Clinker . Mr. Mouse , likewise , was wide awake , and hopping about with a kangaroo step , a little in doubt why Miss Rosalie was so pale , why those blue eyes were so dim , and why she said to him " Go away , little one , " with a quivering , tremulous voice and hand . Mouse told Rat , and Rat told Martin and Beaver , that the poor girl was in love with him , Tiny , and that he would make it all right one of these days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Softly , like the cool breath of a slumbering child , came a faint air from the land . The bell of the frigate , clanging in its brassy throat , struck for midnight . The sentinels on their posts cried " All 's well ! " The old brig was letting fall her top-sails , and the sound of the oars in the cutter 's row-locks ceased . " Cleveland , " said Piron , quietly , " while the ladies and our friends are getting into the barge , come down with me in your cabin . I wish to have a parting word with you . " So they go down . " Now , my dear friend , you have seen as well as I how wildly those young people are in love with each other ; so has my wife and her sister ; and , indeed , my sweet Rosalie seems more in love with him than our niece . I have not had the heart to put a thorn in the path of their happiness , and God grant it may all come right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an old and noble stock , where the bar sinister has never crossed our escutcheon , and I can not yet make up my mind to an immediate engagement . This our niece has consented to  --  Stop , Cleveland , hear me out . I do not , however , carry my prejudices to any absurd extent , nor have I spoken on this subject to the girl , and only to her mother and my wife ; but I wish you to explain the way we feel , in your own kind manner , to your friend 's son . Say to him what a trial it has been to us  --  how we all love him "  --  he pressed his handkerchief to his eyes  --  " and after he has learned all , if he still persists in urging his suit when the cruise is over , he shall have our consent and blessing . Time may work changes in them both ; and meanwhile I shall not mention the matter to our little Rosalie , as we fear for the consequences . " " Spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear Piron ! I have thought as you and your excellent wife do on this matter ; but , like you , I have not had the courage to give even a hint of warning to Henry . I shall , however , break the matter gently to him , and send my coxswain for his father also , whom I have not seen for a week , and who , they tell me , has been raging about Kingston ever since he ran away from you at Escondido . His son loves him devotedly , and a word from him will do more than I could say in a lifetime . " " The ladies are in the barge , commodore , " squeaked Midshipman Mouse , as he popped his tiny head into the cabin . " Very well , sir . And tell Lieutenant Darcantel that I wish to see him to-morrow morning , before church service . Come , Piron ! " On the lower grating of the accommodation-ladder stood the commodore , with his first lieutenant , as the barge shoved off . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob Blunt , " for your kindness to me ; and if Mr. Hardy will permit , I 'll give the boats ' crews a glass of grog for their trouble in towing the old brig . " Certainly ! Jacob knew what was proper under the circumstances , and liked a moderate toss himself after a hard night 's work as well as the lusty sailors in the boats , and the youngsters , Rat and Martin , who steered them . So the barge shoved off , with no other words spoken , though there were white handkerchiefs wet with women 's tears , and red bandanas , too , somewhat moist ; while following in the barge 's wake went a light whale-boat gig , pulled by four old tars , who could make her leap , when they had a mind , half out of water , for it was in those brawny old arms to do it . But now they merely dipped the long oar-blades in the water , and could not keep up with the barge . They knew  --  those corrugated old salts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stern-sheets , with the tiller-ropes in his hands , who steered so wildly about the harbor , had something more yielding than white-laced rope in his flippers ; and that the sweet little craft under white dimity , with her head throwing off the sparkling spray as she lay under his bows , was in no hurry to go to sea  --  not caring much , either , to what port she was bound , so long as she found good holding-ground when she got in harbor with both bowers down , and cargo ready for another voyage  --  not she ! Finally , old Jacob Blunt , master , again in full command of brig " Martha , " with Mr. Binnacle Binks catting the anchor forward , all sail made , sheets home , and every thing shipshape , with a fresh , steady land-wind , and a light gig towing astern , went steering out to sea , bound to New Orleans by way of the Windward Passage . At the first ray of sunrise the gig 's line was cast off ; and with the waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neptune bared their tattooed arms  --  illustrative of ships , anchors , and maidens  --  and bent their bodies with a will toward the harbor . " Take keer , sir , if it 's the same to you , or we 'll be on that ledge off the ' ' Postles ' Battery . ' It looks jist like that ' ere reef in the Vargin 's Passage as I was wunce nearly ' racked on , in the ' Smasher , ' sixteen-gun brig . " " No fear , Harry Greenfield . " " Beg your parding , Mr. Darcantel , but that ' ere wessel you is heading for is that old clump of a Spanish gun-boat ; our craft is off here , under the quarter of the ' Monongaheelee . ' " " Oh yes , Charley ; I see the ' Rosalie . ' " What made these old salts slew gravely round one to the other , as their sixteen-feet oars rattled with a regular jar in the brass row-locks , and shut one eye tight , as if they enjoyed something themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in blue ribbons , who lived somewhere in a sea-port town long years ago . But yet they loved that young slip of sea-weed , whose head was bent down to the buttons of his blue jacket , his epaulet lopsided on his shoulder , his sword hilt downward , and his brown eyes tracing the lines of the ash grating where pretty feet had once rested , while he jerked the tiller-ropes from side to side , and his gig went wild by reef and point toward the " Rosalie . " When the gig 's oars at last , in spite of her meandering navigation by her abstracted helmsman , trailed alongside the schooner , and while her crew were cracking a few biscuits and jokes on deck , with the sun high up the little craft 's masts , her captain hurried down to his small cabin , and changed his rig for service on board the frigate . CHAPTER XLVII . DEVOTION . " To walk together to the kirk , And all together pray , While each to his Great Father bends  --  Old men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay ! " " Farewell ! farewell ! but this I tell To thee , thou wedding-guest , He prayeth well who loveth well Both man , and bird , and beast ! " Sunday morning in Kingston harbor . The deep-toned bells from cathedral and church were wafted off from the town ; the troops at Park Camp marching with easy tread to their chapel ; matrons and maidens , with bare heads , fans , and mantillas , going along demurely ; portly judges , factors , and planters trudging beside palanquins of their Saxon spouses ; negroes in white ; Creoles in brown , cigarettes put out for a time ; while swinging censers and rolling sound of organs and chants , or prayers and sermons from kirk and pulpits , told how the people were worshiping God according to their several beliefs . On the calm harbor , too , and in Port Royal , lay the men-of-war , the church pennants taking the place of the ensigns at the peaks , the bells tolling , and the sailors  --  quiet , clean , and orderly  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the great spar-deck was comparatively deserted  --  all save that officer with his spy-glassing old quarter-master , and the sentries on gangway and forecastle . The ropes , however , were flemished down in concentric coils , the guns without a speck of dust on their shining coats , the capstan polished like an old brass candlestick , and every thing below and aloft in a faultless condition . As Harry Darcantel came rather languidly over the gangway , and went down to the main deck , where the five hundred sailors in snowy-white mustering clothes were assembled , Commodore Cleveland beckoned to him with his finger as he stood talking at the cabin door to his first lieutenant . " Hardy , I do not feel well this morning ; make my excuses to the chaplain , and go on with the service . Come in , Harry . Orderly , allow no one , not even the servants , to enter the cabin  --  except Dr. Darcantel , in case he should come on board . " The stiff soldier laid his white-gloved finger on the visor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag-draped pulpit at the main-mast , with those five hundred quiet , attentive sailors seated on capstan-bars and match-tubs between the silent cannon , and no sound save his mild , persuasive voice , as he read the sublime service from the good lessons before him . Then , after a short but impressive sermon , adapted to the comprehension of the honest tars around him , with a kindly word , too , for the sagacious officers who commanded them , he closed the holy book and delivered the parting benediction . As he began , a shore boat , in spite of the warning of the sentry at the gangway , came bows on to the frigate 's solid side , and as she went dancing and bobbing back from the recoil of the concussion , a tall , powerful man leaped out of her , and , by a mighty spring , caught the man-ropes of the port gangway , and swung himself through the open port of the gun-deck . Bowing his lofty head with reverential awe as the last solemn words of the benediction were uttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guttural voice , the word " Amen , " and strode on and entered the cabin . The curtains were closely drawn of the after cabin , even to shut out the first whisper of the young sea-breeze which was fluttering in from Port Royal ; and there stood that noble officer , with his strong arm thrown around the gallant youth  --  the picture of abject woe  --  talking in his kind , feeling accents , trying to console him , painting the sky bright in the distance , and begging him , by all the love and affection he bore him through so many years , to be a man , and trust to his good conscience and his right arm to cleave his way through the clouds and gloom which surrounded him . " There , Henry , you are calmer now . Sit down here in my stateroom , and while you think of that fond girl , give a thought to that poor bereaved mother , Madame Rosalie , who loves you for the resemblance she thinks you bear to her little boy , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very island . " " What do you say , Cleveland ? " said a voice behind him , with such deep , concentrated energy that the commodore fairly started . " What did you say about a lost child and a Madame Rosalie ? " Paul Darcantel stood there in the softened crimson light , with his sinewy , bony hands upraised , his gaunt breast heaving , with unshorn beard and tangled , grizzly locks , the iron jaw half open , and his dark , terrible eyes gleaming with unearthly fire . " Speak , Harry Cleveland ! For the wife you have lost , speak ! " " My dear , dearest friend , do be calm ! Why have you been so long away from me ? I wanted you here , but you did not come . Our poor boy has had his first lesson in this world 's grief , and I have felt obliged to tell him all  --  yes , every thing ! That the grave he has so often wept over , under the magnolia , does not contain his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Paul Darcantel , sinking down on his knees , with his hands clasped together , while the first tears for more than twenty years streamed from his agonized eyes . " There is a Providence in it all ! That boy is not my son ! I saved him from the pirate 's grasp , and that woman must be his mother ! " Lower and lower the lofty head bent till it touched the deck , the bony hands clasped tight together , and those eyes  --  ah ! those parched eyes  --  no longer dry ! " Paul , Paul , what is this I hear ? For the love of heaven and those angels who are waiting for us , speak again ! " " My father  --  my more than father , I am not illegitimate , then ! No such shame may cause your boy to blush for his mother ? " While strong and loving arms raised the exhausted man from the deck , and while he becomes once more the same determined Paul Darcantel , and with hand grasped in hand is rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cabin . CHAPTER XLVIII . ALL ALIVE AGAIN . " Among ourselves , in peace , ' t is true , We quarrel , make a rout ; And having nothing else to do , We fairly scold it out ; But once the enemy in view , Shake hands , we soon are friends ; On the deck , Till a wreck , Each common cause defends . " Down in the steerage , where a bare cherry table stood , and upright lockers ranged around , with a lot of half-starved reefers devouring their dinner  --  not near so good or well served as the sailors ' around their mess-cloths on the upper decks  --  with a few urchins utterly regardless of steerage grub , and a dollar or two in their little fists , all nicely dressed in blue jackets and white trowsers , waiting for the hands to be turned to and the boats manned , to go on shore for a lark . Abaft in the wardroom , two or three of the swabs , the surgeon 's mates , and the jaunty young marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and buckling on their armor to do sad havoc among the planters ' families in the evening , away there in Upper Kingston . As for the first lieutenant , the purser , the fleet surgeon , the sailing-master , and the old major of marines , they had been ashore before , and did n't care to go again ; growling jocosely among themselves on board the frigate , and glad to get rid of the juvenile gabble . Presently , and before the hands were turned to from dinner , the cabin bell rang so violently that the orderly 's brass scale-plate fixtures on his leather hat fairly rang too as he opened the sacred door . " Tell the first lieutenant I want him . " The dismayed soldier forgot to lay his white worsted finger on his visor as he slammed to the door and marched out on the gun-deck . " Mr. Hardy , unmoor ship ! Hoist a jack at the fore and fire a gun for a pilot ! Get the frigate under weigh , sir , and be quick about it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardy rapidly passed his old cronies , who were tramping along the deck as he mounted the after-ladder , he said , with a nod , " By the Lord ! I have n't seen the commodore in such a breeze since he blew that pirate out of water at Darien . " In a minute the " Monongahela 's " bell struck two , and the boatswain and his mates , piping as if their hairy throats would split , roared out , " All hands ! " and a moment later , " All hands unmoor ship ! " " What does that mean ? " said a cook of a mess to Jim Dreen , the old quarter-master , who had just come down from his watch . " Mean ? why , you lazy , blind duff b'iler , it means that I 've lost my blessed dinner . " " Hallo ! " says Rat to Beaver , " what 's that ? Unmoor ship on my liberty day ! I swear I 'll resign ! " No you wo n't , reefers , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry you  --  Mouse in company  --  up to the fore , main , and mizzen tops , and squeak there as much as you like ; but jump about and look sharp that nothing goes wrong , or Mr. Hardy will be down upon you like a main tack . Bang from the bow port and the union jack at the fore ! " God bless my soul , fellows , this is the most infernal tyranny I ever heard of ! " came from the wardroom ; " all of us engaged to dine and dance in Kingston this evening , and  --  " " It 's ' All hands up anchor , gentlemen ! ' " and away they all went . Down went the mess-kids , and down came the awnings , and up came the boats to their davits ; in went the bars to both capstans , the nippers clapped on , and the muddy cables coming in to the tunes of fifes ; while above the running gear was rove , the Sunday bunts to the sails cast off , and the five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigging of that American double-banked frigate , as if they could always work her sails and battery to the admiration of their good commodore there , who was looking at them from the quarter-deck . " Massa captan , " said the shining ebony pilot , in his snowy suit , as he took off his fine white Panama hat , " dis is de ole pilot , sa , Peter Crabreef  --  name after dat black rock way dere outside . Suppose you tink ob beating dis big frigate troo de channel ? Unpossible , wid dis breeze ! " " Peter Crabreef , " said the old sailing-master , to whom these observations were addressed , " you had better not give such a hint to that gentleman there in the epaulets ; for if you do , you 'll never see Mrs. Crabreef again ! You had better keep your wits about you , too , and plenty of water under the keel , for the commodore is fond of water ! " " Sartainly , massa ossifa ! I is old Peter , and never yet touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " On board the pigmy black schooner near , half a dozen old salt veterans were squinting at the flag-ship and holding much deliberate speculation as to what all the row meant . Old Harry Greenfield , however , with Ben Brown , who were the gunner and boatswain of the little vessel , observed that , " In the ewent of our bein ' wanted , ye see , Harry , it will be as well to have the deck tackle stretched along for heavin ' in , and get the prop from under the main boom . " Even as they spoke , a few bits of square bunting went up in balls to the mizzen of the frigate , and , blowing out clear , said , as plain as flags could speak , " Prepare to weigh anchor ! " At the same moment the " Rosalie 's " gig came bounding like a bubble over the water with the tall gentleman beside the young commander in the stern-sheets . There was a great , nervous , bony hand now holding his , but with as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the night before . Gig not steered at all wild now , but going as straight as a bullet to the schooner . The stirring sounds of the fifes as the sailors danced round with the bars in the capstans , with a beating step to keep time to the lively music , were still heard on board the frigate , and then came from the forecastle , " The anchor 's under foot , sir ! " " Pawl the capstan ! Aloft , sail-loosers ! Trice up ! Lay out ! Loose away ! " Almost at the instant came down the squeaks from aloft of , " All ready with the fore ! the main ! the mizzen ! " " Let fall  --  sheet home ! hoist away the top-sails ! " Again were heard the quick notes of the fifes on both decks , and in less than five minutes more the anchors were catted , and the " Monongahela , " under a cloud of canvas , began to move . But where was the " Rosalie , " late " Perdita , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with never a tack , through the narrow strait , lying over under the press of her white dimity like a witch on a black broomstick , as she shoots out to sea . And who is that tall man , on that narrow deck , clapping on to sheet and tackle , though there was no need of assistance , or skill , or seamanship to be displayed on board that craft , except by way of love of the thing ? And why does he , during a pause when there was nothing more that could possibly be done , stand by the weather rail , shaking a great huge old seaman by both hands till he almost jarred the schooner to her keel ?  --  Ben Brown , the helmsman , whom you have heard of on board the " Martha Blunt , " who , by some accidental word he dropped near to the tall gentleman , caused that hand-grasping collision . It was not another five minutes before the other thirty-nine old sea-dogs knew all about every body , and where they were bound , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the thousand silver dollars they were to have from the tall gentleman  --  not they ! They wanted merely to lay their eyes along that Long Tom amidships , and to have a cutlass flashing over their shoulders  --  so fashion ! Pistols and pikes ! Fudge ! But where was the " Martha Blunt ? " Oh , that old teak brig was bouncing along past Morant Point , with a good slant from the southward , pretty much where she was some seventeen years before , with a few more passengers in her deck cabin , reading their Bibles , and praying for those who go down to the sea in ships on that Sabbath day  --  one looking with her sad eyes out of the stern windows , and another doing the same , and both thinking of the same boy who had been dashed out of one of those windows ; and though both of them knew the other 's thoughts , yet they did not dream they were thinking of the same person at the time . And where was the Spanish brigantine , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times  --  and his pleasant mate , who would think no more of sticking a knife into you than he did of kicking that skulking , icy-eyed sailor on board  --  detesting as he did the entire Saxon race ever since Cadiz was bombarded  --  and feeding him on rotten jerked beef ? There were no prayers , only curses , on board that brigantine as she dropped anchor in St. Jago that fine Sunday morning . And where was our ancient one-eyed mariner , formerly in command of the colonial guarda costa felucca , the " Panchita , " named after his fat banana of a sposa ? Oh , the Don  --  simply Ignacio now  --  had had a quiet confab with the deputy administrador all about some treasure which he knew was concealed , and where  --  for he had seen with his bright eye the light of a torch in a cleft of a crag  --  and he would go shares with that official if he would give him a little assistance . " Oh , cierto ! " Why not ? And there was an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been proud to command ; and , in this fine weather , he might sail back to Port Palos in her . Oh yes ! But , to keep all secret , he would merely take old Pancha , his wife , for crew . And so , with a few bundles of paper cigars , and some dried fish and water  --  the only property they possessed , save his eye and a pack of cards , and those valuables rescued with difficulty  --  they sailed the night before the blessed Sunday . He never came back , though . No blame attributable to the eye  --  that was as bright and wary an old burning spark of suspicious fire as ever ; but then old Pancha held the cards , and this time she won . Very singular it was , cierto . If Ignacio had not gone back again for another bag which was not there , why , the sota of a knave being the next card  --  Ah ! we wo n't anticipate . But we are all alive yet , except those murdered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cactus , and poor Binks , and those slashing blades of the poisonous , many-legged " Centipede , " who were eaten by the sharks  --  all alive the rest of us , and wide awake ! CHAPTER XLIX . THE ROPE LAID UP . " The captain is walking his quarter-deck With a troubled brow and a bended neck ; One eye is down the hatchway cast , The other turns up to the truck on the mast . " " The breeze is blowing  --  huzza , huzza ! The breeze is blowing  --  away , away ! The breeze is blowing  --  a race , a race ! The breeze is blowing  --  we near the chase . " Well , the positions of all hands were simply these . The icy-eyed man , without snuff-box , or ring on that mutilated flipper , with two under pockets in his shirt , and something in them , a pair of filthy old canvas trowsers , and no hanger by his side , where there had been so much hanging in the good old times , slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at St. Jago de Cuba . Without a real of wages  --  for he was to work his passage  --  and because he did n't feel inclined to work , the capitano in command assisted his agile subordinate to kick him all the voyage . Had , however , the mate presented that cold eel his knife for a moment before he jumped overboard and squirmed to the shore , that cuchillo would have found a redder sheath than the crimson sash which usually held it . Fortunately perhaps for the mate , he was not of a generous disposition , save with kicks and ropes ' - ends , or else he might have regretted his philanthropy . So soon as the icy-blue man had congealed , as it were , in the sun until he was quite dry and frozen again , he slunk away to the ditch of the old fort , where he thawed till nightfall , and then entered the town ; hanging round the pulperias , smacking and cracking his parched lips for a measure of aguardiente , only two centavos a cup , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Port sent to him by the good Archbishop of Oporto ! But , not having the copper centavos  --  though his own coppers stood so much in need of moisture  --  he continued to skulk on . Presently , coming to the wide streets and to the outskirts of the town , he spied a large mule , ready caparisoned for the road , hitched to the door of a house , waiting for his owner to mount him . The icy green-eyed individual , disgusted for the time with blue salt water , and being , as we know , a capital cavalry-man  --  in dashing charges among the patriots , and caprioling also up the Blue Mountains to Escondido  --  thought he would take another gallop on the dry ground , just to keep his hand and little finger in ; so he quietly cast off the mule 's painter , and flung his canvas legs over the beast as if he belonged to him . And so he did ; for he told the man at whose place he passed an hour or two that night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mule had once belonged , that it had been presented to him by an old friend , whose name  --  as had the mule 's  --  escaped him . All this time the one-eyed man , with his banana woman , Pancha , were creeping along the water part of the land  --  with the Peak of Tarquina in sight  --  toward Cape Cruz , bound round that peninsula , and so on to the Doce Leguas Cays ; while the man on the mule navigated by the Sierras del Cobre of St. Jago , steering by bridle for Manzanillo , and then to take water again for the same secret destination . The cargo that both expected to take in there was about ten thousand pounds sterling in mildewed coin of various realms and denominations ; but it was there , and would pass current any where . So they sailed and navigated . It was tedious work , though ; and it took a week for the old launch with the torn sail to get into the Tiger 's Trap  --  fine weather , and no sea  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening hour the mule with his passenger planted his fore feet , like a pair of kedges over his bows , in the fishing village near Manzanillo , and foundered bodily , going down with his freight slap-dash in the mud . The passenger , however , escaped , and skulled along by the shore , where he fell in with a poor fisherman who was about to shove off in his trim , wholesome bark for professional recreation on the Esperanza bank . Glad was old Miguel Tortuga to have a strong man to assist him for the privilege of joining in a sip of aguardiente and catching a red snapper or two ; so they jumped on board and spread the sail . Had old Miguel , however , seen the sharklike eyes of his assistant in the sunlight , or dreamed what a snapper was about to catch him , he would not have gone fishing that night , and it would have saved him much tribulation at daylight the next morning , when he was picked off a small rock by a fisher acquaintance of his from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miguel ; and need only say , to console him , that his stanch boat went safely through the blue gateway of the roaring ledge of white breakers , and late Sunday night lay calmly in the inlet abreast Captain Brand 's former dwelling . To go back again for a week , the " Monongahela "  --  double-banked leviathan as she was  --  came plunging out to sea from Kingston , every man and boy , from Jack Smith on her forecastle to Bill Pump in the spirit-room , and from Richard Hardy to Tiny Mouse , knowing from the first plunge the frigate made what they all sailed for . With her proud head toward the east , she went dashing on past the White Horse Rocks , and woe to the small angry waves which did not get out of her way , for she smashed them contemptuously in foaming masses from her majestic bows , sending them back in sparkling spray and bubbles to hiss their angry way to leeward in her wake . On she went , far off to sea , where the trade wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her great square yards swinging round at every watch while beating to windward  --  the tacks close down , yards as fine as they would lay , and the heavy sheets flat aft . Every evening the surgeon , the purser , the chaplain , the major , and the old sailing-master were in the cabin , going over the chase of a certain pirate in a schooner " Centipede " away down on the Darien Coast , with Cape Garotte there under their lee , and the vultures and the sharks grinding the bones and tearing the flesh of the half of a man with the tusk gleaming out of his wiry mustache ; and the padre , with his eyes staring wide open , and the crucifix , borne away by the carnivorous birds of prey . All of those dreadful particulars , together with matters that had gone before  --  of a lost boy , a heart-broken mother , and a murdered mate , Mr. Binks , on board the brig " Martha Blunt "  --  the party at Escondido , the snuff-box , and Paul Darcantel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the plantation , his despair , and reckless life afterward , when he served in slavers , where he did something to allay the sufferings of the poor wretches ; and afterward how he was trepanned to the " Doce Leguas , " went a cruise with Mr. Bill Gibbs , whose leg he hacked off with a hand-saw , not knowing at the time about the locket ; the little child he had saved ; how that child had saved him from his torture on the trestle with his mouselike teeth ; how he had wandered the wide world over searching and searching for the mother of that boy ! And there the boy was  --  the manly , brave young fellow now  --  whom officers and sailors had always loved , flying away with the dark doctor  --  no longer Darcantel , but Harry Piron  --  with his fond father and mother in the distance , and the sweet girl he adored with her blonde head resting in her mother 's lap . Illustration : THE OLD WATER-LOGGED LAUNCH . Ay , every soul in the ship knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank to the happiness of the young couple  --  all save Dick Hardy , who moved energetically about the frigate 's decks , with his eyes every where , below and aloft , prompt , sharp , and quick , quite like Cleveland , there , beside him , when they were together in the old " Scourge " during the hurricane , and chased , to her destruction , the " Centipede . " " Sail ho ! " sang out the man on the fore-top-sail yard . " Where away ? " " Right ahead , sir . A brig on the starboard tack ! " Ay , the old " Martha Blunt " bouncing along under all sail , squaring off at the short-armed seas , and striking them doggedly , as she beat up for the Windward Passage between Hayti and Cuba . But there was an old sea-bruiser of a different build , who wore the belt in the West Indies , and was after that sturdy old brig with teak ribs for a hearty set-to ; and when she came up alongside , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lay for an hour side by side , there was considerable conversation ; so much talk , in fact  --  boats going to and fro , mingled with roars and shrieks , and clasping of hands on board the brig  --  never a sound on board the ship  --  that the blue pennant fluttered in such a way it was hard to tell whether it was Jacob , or Piron , or the sweet wife , or mademoiselle , or her lovely mother , who threw their arms around that pennant 's truck . Then yard-arm and yard-arm , the frigate with her canvas canopy of upper sails furled , and the brig in her best bib and tucker , they both filled away and moved side by side . For a day or two they went on , talking and laughing to one another in these friendly shakes of the hand over blue water , until one day , the brig being to windward , she came upon an old water-logged launch , with a broken mast and a torn sail hanging over her side . It fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the yawl and tow the boat alongside , and to be smart about it ; for the breeze might make so soon as the fog rose , and the commodore was not the man to be kept waiting in a big frigate . Mr. Binks was smart about it , and presently he returned  --  though there was no hurry , for the calm lasted a long time  --  with his water-logged prize . There was no human being in this prize ; but when she came alongside , and a yard tackle was hooked on to let the water drain out of her , Jacob Blunt and the people on board gave a pleasant yell of astonishment . It was not the soiled pack of Spanish cards , or the few bundles of saturated paper cigars floating about , which caused this excitement . No , it was several canvas bags lying there in the stern-sheets , strapped with strands of a woman 's red petticoat to the empty water-cask beneath the thwarts ; and not one of those canvas bags , or what was in them , injured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those bags  --  and they were weighty  --  lifted on board the brig , over the rail where the pirates swarmed some long years ago , on to the quarter-deck ; and then there was another joyous shout from Jacob Blunt , as when he had hailed the trade wind in that long past time . " By all that 's wonderful , here is my old bag of guineas , and some few Spanish milled dollars ! Look at the mark , my darlings ! " Another weighty bag was set aside for Mrs. Timothy Binks , and the rest were devoted , with some large doubloon reservations for crew , to Martha Blunt and Jacob Blunt in their declining years . Then , the weather being still calm and foggy , Jacob and his passengers went on board the double-banked frigate for church service , where they all prayed with much hope and thanksgiving for what had passed and what was to come ; and then they went into the commodore 's cabin , where they remained ever so long a time . Let us go back this same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been for every body , particularly so for the icy-eyed man , who was extremely anxious , as he kicked and lashed his mule , and kept looking round the south side of Jamaica , from Portland Point to Pedro Bluff and San Negril , throwing a ray of cold frost there day and night , expecting that tall doctor to come striding along in that deep water , heading due north . And at last the dark figure hove in sight , in the schooner " Rosalie "  --  the sweet little craft skimming exultingly over the seas , kissing them occasionally with both her dainty , glistening cheeks , reeling joyously over on her side , with her tidy dimity laced and spread in one flat sheet of white , while the slender arms bent like whalebone to the freshening breeze , and she left the dancing bubbles sparkling and flashing lovingly in her wake . Two hundred miles to go , and the breeze fell from fresh to light , until at last , shrouded in a thick fog , one Sunday morning , when there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea as smooth as a glass mirror with the quicksilver clouded . Then out sweeps , my lads ! Ten of a side , and two of those bronzed old lads at each sweep ! All except the two after ones , where Ben Brown and the tall doctor handled one apiece . Thus , with sails down and bare arms , the light little " Rosalie " continued gliding rapidly over the mirrored surface  --  a little ashamed of herself , perhaps , at being seen in such a scanty rig  --  while her commander guided her graceful course , and Harry Greenfield peered about forward to see that no harm should arrest her dainty footsteps . Presently was heard the toll of a bell . The sweeps paused , the hide gromets resting on the thole-pins , and the water raining from their broad blades . " That must be a man-of-war off here on the quarter , " exclaimed the young officer at the tiller , " ringing for church . " The old seamen at the sweeps unconsciously took off their hats , wiped the sweat from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the ' Monongahela , ' " said Ben , " though p'raps she took more of a breeze to wind'ard , off the island . " Still the schooner glided on noiselessly over the sea , until , a minute later , Harry Greenfield sang out , " Port , sir ! or we 'll be plump into a vessel here ahead . " The helm was put down , and the " Rosalie " sheered off to starboard within a biscuit-toss of a large brig . " By my grandmother 's wig ! " said Ben , " that 's the old ' Martha Blunt ! ' " " Henri , " said Paul Darcantel , in French , in his deep voice , " the last request I shall ever make is to keep on . There is not a moment to lose ! " " Give way , men ! " shouted the officer , in a decided tone , as the words came with a stifled gasp from his heaving breast , while the sigh that followed was drowned in the splash of the sweeps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the foam flashed away from the blades astern . But there was another splash . A white object sprang with a bound over the brig 's quarter , dipping below the surface of the calm sea , and when it came up , two great flippers , with a large black head between them , struck out like the paws of an alligator , breasting the water with a speed that soon brought him within a few fathoms of the schooner 's low counter . Then , seizing hold of the slack of the main sheet , which was thrown to him , he came up , hand over hand , as if he could tear the stern frame out of the schooner . A vigorous grasp caught him by one paw , and , with the other laid on the taffrail , he leaped on deck as if his feet had pressed a springboard instead of the yielding water . Again , as in the olden time , he held his little Henri aloft in his giant arms ; but this time it was Banou who was dripping from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give way , my souls ! Another thousand dollars if we get up to the Key before dark ! " said the deep , low tones of the tall doctor . " Good Lord ! " roared a voice from on board the brig , now shut up again all alone in the fog  --  " if that old nigger has not gone and jumped overboard , my name 's not Binks ! " " All right , Mr. Binks ; Banou is safe ! Send a boat on board the ' Monongahela , ' and report that the schooner ' Rosalie ' has passed ahead , " went back in a clear note . It was some considerable time before Binks could believe that he had not been hailed by David Jones himself , for he had seen nothing , being at the time in the lower cabin reading his Bible , and writing his name , " Binnacle Binks , Master of brig ' Martha Blunt , ' " on the fly-leaf ; and he was only disturbed in this praiseworthy occupation by a heavy body plunging overboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his comrades , been sleeping near , reporting that circumstance with his eyes half shut . Then young Binks took considerable more time to get a boat lowered , and send her , with the cabin-boy , to the large frigate close on his beam , whose bell had just struck seven . The boat , too , with four sleepy hands to pull her , took considerable time to find the ship , and then the whistles were piping to dinner , and all the good people from the brig , with the flag-officers , had retired to the commodore 's cabin for luncheon . When Jacob Blunt heard the news , regardless of sherry and cold tongue , he himself got in his boat , leaving his passengers in an excited frame of mind , but rather comfortable on the whole , and returned to the teak bosom of his " Martha . " There he took young Binks firmly by the shoulder , and walked him aft to the rail where his father  --  long since dead and murdered  --  had been used to sit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " this ' ere sort of thing would n't do ! even if he was a readin ' the Bible , which was all very good on occasion , sich as clear weather out on the broad Atlantic ; but in fog times , when schooners was creepin ' about in among the Antilles , and partick'larly off Jamaiky or the south side of Cuby , mates and men should be wide awake and lookin ' every wheres . And harkee , Binnacle ! when you commands this ' ere old brig , or maybe a bran-new ' Martha Blunt , ' and me and my old woman lying below together in narrow cabins , you must bear in mind these my words ! Well , my boy , do n't rub that ' ere sleeve over your eyes no more , and it will be all right . " Young Binks promised " that from that ' ere minnit he would never sit on no rails , or sip no grog , or even read his old mother 's Bible when he wos on watch , but always be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board , or bags of shiners in the lower cabin stateroom  --  that he would ! And his blessed old second father might take his davy he , young Binks , would never be caught foul again . " Meanwhile the girlish schooner tripped away far out of sight , and when the fog lifted and the breeze came to blow it to leeward she was once more tidily dressed in snowy white , and splashing the water from her black eyes , as the last rays of the setting sun showed her the Tiger 's Trap in the distance . " Henri , my boy , put your arms around me again as you did when I lay in torture on the trestle on that island . Have no fears for me ; we shall meet again . There ! now listen to me . Here is a packet which I wish you to carry to Porto Rico with this letter . The old judge is alive , I think , to whom this letter is addressed , and it may perhaps soothe his declining years . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown  --  no more force  --  and if , as I believe , that villain has returned to his former haunt , I will fulfill my oath to its very letter . Meanwhile , so soon as we have shoved off , while the breeze still holds , run down to the frigate  --  she is not three leagues off  --  and you will be in your yearning parent 's arms , and those of the girl you love , before they sleep . There ! I know you will think of me . Farewell ! " CHAPTER L. ON A BED OF THORNS . " An orphan 's curse would drag to hell A spirit from on high ; But oh ! more horrible than that Is the curse in a dead man 's eye ! " " O Heaven ! to think of their white souls , And mine so black and grim ! " " Ho , ho ! " said Captain Brand , as he stretched out his straight legs in their canvas casings on the sand of the little cove , " safe and sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that good old man Miguel ! " Ho , ho ! " continued he ; " here at last ! No Babette to cook for me  --  no ' Centipede '  --  nothing but that stanch little boat presented me by that generous fisherman , who , I fear , is drowned by this time . Well , let us enjoy ourselves ! Excellent real snapper this ! Sausage rather too much garlic perhaps ; but the brown bread and the aguardiente unexceptionable . Blaze away , my little fire ; your sticks cost me much labor to dig out of my once comfortable house , but you are better than gunpowder any day . " Just to think of the years that have passed ! That great bank of sand there over the sheds , nearly as high as the crag , where my brave fellows once caroused ; the young cocoa-nut springing up on the crag itself  --  not a vestige of my old habitation left , or the bright blades or pleasant guests to dine with me ! " Here there was something of the old cold murderous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of his nose . " Ah ! yes , there may be my wary-eyed Sanchez left , though the last I heard of him he was in the Capilla dungeon of the Moro . And that "  --  grating his teeth , and glaring with his icy eyes at the fire , as if those two blocks of ice would put it out  --  " cursed doctor who pursues me ! " Well , well , neither of those old friends are here yet , and before another sun sets I shall bequeath the old den to them both ! Ho , ho ! with those solid bags of clinking metal , I shall leave them as much sand and rocks as they choose to walk over . What a sly devil I was to stow that treasure away for a rainy day ! Never told a living being ! Poisoned the fellow , too , who made the lock ! Capital joke , ' pon my soul ! " This was the very last of the very few jokes that Captain Brand ever enjoyed . " And , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old mate 's bones are yet lying there in the vault . What was his name ? such a bad memory I have ! Oh ! Gibbs  --  Bill Gibbs  --  with one leg ! Ho , ho ! " Here Captain Brand drained some more aguardiente out of a cracked earthen pot , and slapped his fine legs with rapture . " And those dear girls who married me ! Lucia , too ! " The dirty wretch started as the wing of a sea-bird swooped down over the pure inlet ; and he thought he saw a white fore finger beckoning him on to his doom . " Pshaw ! " said he , smoothing down his filthy tattered shirt with the finger of his mutilated left hand , " how nervous I am ! But what a bungle Pedillo made of that marriage ! And my good Ricardo , too ! What a feast the sharks must have had on his oily , well-fed carcass ! Misericordia ! Ho , ho ! I believe I 'll bid my friends good-night . " Captain Brand stretched himself out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a clove-hitch round his right leg , which rode calmly in the little inlet ; his bald head , with the few dry gray hairs on his temples , resting on Miguel 's sennit hat , and the thin scum of frosty eyelids drawn over his frozen eyes  --  cracking their covering at times  --  until at last the pirate , aided by fiery aguardiente , slept . A few late cormorants and sea-birds sailed over him in his fitful slumber , and uttered a cold cry , as if their pecking-time had not come yet , but would shortly , as they sought their silent retreats on the wall of rocks opposite . And Captain Brand dreamed , too  --  of the old laird , his father , in prison ; his mother weeping over forged notes ; the sleeping , unsuspecting people he had treacherously murdered ; the pillages he had committed ; the men he had slain in open conflict ; those he had executed with his own private cord ; the poor woman who had died in worse torments , when , indeed , even knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mercy ; the agony and sufferings of those who survived them ; with all the concomitant horrors which make the blood run cold to think of , and which made the pirate 's almost freeze in his veins  --  living years in minutes  --  did Captain Brand , as he lay there on the chill sand in his troubled nightmare of a sleep . " Ah ! Dios ! Dios ! " chattered the Senora Banana Pancha , at the other outlet to the inlet , rolling over on the ledge of the rocks at the Tiger 's Trap . " What has become of my Ig  --  Ig  --  nacio  --  the one-eyed old villain who has persecuted me for forty years ? Why did I cut the old launch adrift before I got in myself ? And here I am alone and desolate on this cursed island , and my Ig  --  Ig  --  nacio  --  bless his spark of an eye  --  not come back to me ! Ah ! Dios ! Dios ! what has become of the little man ? He will kill me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone with all the money , which nearly broke his thin back to bring here ; but , Dios ! Dios ! I am dying of thirst , and not a shred of dried fish or jerked beef has gone into my old mouth  --  " Yes there has , Dona Pancha , for just then a piece of hawser-laid rope  --  rather dry , perhaps , for mastication  --  was placed across your crying mouth that you might bite upon , if you would only stop your old tongue . For while you were screaming on the rocks , and yelling for your Ig  --  Ig  --  nacio , who went back for the last bag of gold that was n't there , a light gig glided in like a blackfish , and a bigger blackfish jumped up and stopped your old mouth , Pancha , with that bit of hide rope . But if you will keep quiet , Pancha , and not exorcise Banou for the Evil One , that old nigger will give you a cup of liquid not known in the devil 's dominions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ah ! you will , eh ? and tell all about that thin curl of smoke , which you believe to have been made by that coal-eyed Ig  --  Ig  --  nacio , away up there by the inlet ? Now keep quiet again , old Lady Banana ; and while your screaming mouth is gagged , do n't cut this small gig away , or else she may navigate herself out to sea , as did your Ig 's launch , and you be left desolate again . The tropical night was still ; the lizards wheetled , the breakers roared on the outer ledge , the ripples washed musically on the shelly shores , the alligators flapped about on the surface of the lagoon , the insects buzzed around the mangrove thickets ; and as the gray dawn of morning appeared , and the rain began to fall , a steaming hot mist arose , through which the sea-birds flapped their wings and sailed away in search of their morning 's meal . The sharks and the deep-sea fish , however , lay still and motionless low down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cold , round eyes . Captain Brand , too , arose , and , opening his green-bluish eyes , smoothing his moulting feathers , and splashing his fins in the wet sand , took an observation . This was the rainy day for which Captain Brand had laid by all that money to spend it in ! It was a Monday morning  --  Black Monday for Captain Brand  --  when , after divesting his leg of the clove-hitch , he secured old Miguel 's boat to a large stone , and then , according to his own ancient practice , he clambered with difficulty up to the venerable crag . Captain Brand had no spy-glass , and there was a good deal of rain falling , but yet he thought he saw a large ship , a brig , and a small schooner in the offing . So Captain Brand scrambled down again , a good deal disconcerted , knowing it would be hours and hours before those vessels got up to the island , even were they so inclined ; but , nevertheless , he bestirred himself . Fortifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for breakfast , which quite refreshed him , he went to work . First , he took Miguel 's copper coffee-pot , into which he emptied that disciple of the net 's shark-oil jug , which Miguel himself used for a torch to attract the fish . Then , with a strip of old canvas  --  part of one leg to Captain Brand 's trowsers ; to such straits was he reduced  --  seized like a ball on the end of a stick , and a match-box , he was all ready for Black Monday 's work . Captain Brand , however , made one serious omission ; he snugly stowed away his beautiful pistols in a locker of the boat to keep them dry , never having been wet but twice before in all his marine excursions  --  the first time at Cape Garotte , and the next when he jumped overboard from the brigantine at St. Jago . He set great store by these valuable implements , for they had done him good service in time of need . Miguel came into possession of them afterward , and sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time , Captain Brand forgot his personal friends and bosom companions . It was a great oversight ; and he was extremely sorry when it was too late to go back for them . However , with the copper oil-pot dangling from his little finger , where the sapphire once shone , and the torch-stick in the other hand , he marched boldly over the sandy ridges toward the crag . But , Captain Brand , there had been three pairs of open eyes watching you through every mouthful of snapper you snapped , and every drop of fiery white rum you swallowed . Ay ! and while you tossed about on the shelly beach , with the red glow of the embers of the fire lighting up your cold-blooded , wrinkled face  --  while , twisting your nose , you muttered ho ! ho 's ! of murderous satisfaction  --  there was not a bird that swooped over you , or a lizard on the rocks with jet beads of eyes , that watched you so sharply as did those attentive beholders from the crag . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those watchers retired down the opposite side , and two of them clambered through a hole in the roof of the decaying little chapel , while the other moved to the little cemetery of coral gravestones , and there scooped a place in the sand and cactus behind the one cut with the letter L. Captain Brand meanwhile came on , picking his way through the dense cactus , which lacerated his legs , and sadly tore the remains of his loose canvas . The rain came down in torrents , the thunder growled and crashed as the tropical storm burst over the island ; and just as a vivid sheet of forked lightning seemed to stride the crag , and the awful peal that followed shook it to its base , Captain Brand crept for shelter within the cleft of the rock , and sat down to prepare for a more extended research . He may have been gone twenty minutes ; but when he again emerged the rain had ceased , the clouds were breaking away , and the gentle sea-breeze blowing , while Captain Brand looked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the million of wrinkles from his compadre , in addition to those he already possessed . The thin lids of his frozen green  --  now quite solid  --  eyes had apparently exhaled by intense cold , and left nothing but a stony look of horror . What caused our brave captain to reel and stagger as he plunged with a bound out into the matted cactus , without his tattered hat , like a wolf flying from the hounds ? Had he trodden on a snake , or seen his compadre , or had that white finger waved him away ? Yes , all three . But the interview with his one-eyed compadre had shocked him most . On he came , driving the hot , wet sand before him , toward the Padre Ricardo 's chapel . There he paused for breath , though it was only by a spasmodic effort that he could unclose his sheet-white lips , where his sharp teeth had met upon them , and held his mouth together as if he had the lockjaw , while he snorted through his nostrils . " Ho ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacked the cavern , and the gold must have gone in that launch I saw the night I came over the reef . Ho ! the traitor has found the torture I promised him ; but I would like to have killed him a little slower . " Here Captain Brand , having regained some few faculties and energy , moved on beyond the church , till he came to the white coral headstone , where he stood still . It was his last walk on deck or sand ! Shading his still horror-stricken eyes by both hands , he glared to seaward . " Ho , ho ! there you are , my Yankee commodore , with that old brig under convoy , and that pretty schooner ! Reminds me of my old ' Centipede . ' Bueno ! there are other ' Centipedes , ' and I must begin the world anew . I am not old ; here is my strong right arm yet ; and who can stop me ? " Captain Brand made these remarks in a loud tone , as if he wanted the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed in early life , and come to a strong resolution to retrieve his past errors . As he waved his strong right arm aloft , while , in imagination , blood rained from the blade of his cutlass after cleaving the skull by a blow dealt behind the back of an unsuspecting skipper or mate , suddenly he paused , and the arm fell powerless at his side , where it hung dangling loose like a pirate from a gibbet on a windy night . He caught sight of the old broken cocoa-nut trunk to which he had hitched the green silk rope , with its noose around his victim 's neck , and he endeavored to prevent himself falling to the sand . " Ho ! " he choked out , his jaws rattling like dry bones , " I see it all now . The column was snapped just where the rope was hitched , and the trestle must have been torn to pieces by the hurricane . Ho , ho ! That 's the way my man escaped , to dog me all over the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be here at any moment . " This was the last connected speech that Captain Brand ever made in this world , or in the world to come , perhaps , for at the last word Paul Darcantel rose in all his revengeful majesty before him . With folded arms he bent his dark , stern eyes upon the pirate , wherein the revenge of twenty years was gleaming with a concentrated power . " You palsied villain ! the oath I took to you , and for which I have been accursed , expired yesterday ! I took another myself , when we stood here last together , and I am come to fulfill that oath , and  --  strike ! " His terrible voice and words came back in an echo from the crag , and they seemed with their intense energy to pierce and shrivel the man before him into sleet . And the pirate would have fallen had not two huge , black , lignum-vitae paws grappled him about the body , pinioning his arms to his sides as if they had been bolted through and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough , sea-weed flippers wound a lashing round his straight legs , and they laid him gently down on the sandy esplanade . " The trestle , Banou . And you , Ben , bring the hide strands , the faded old cord , and that black altar-cloth ! " The pirate lay on his back , his eyes wide open  --  for he could not shut them , since the lids had gone in frost  --  but the solid balls , light green now in the light , rolled from side to side . He recognized the old apparatus too , though it was in different hands than those of Pedillo and his confederate ; and he saw , also , that , though the pale green rope was rotten , yet his knowledge of nautical matters taught him that it yet might bear a taut strain , and that those coils of hide thongs never gave way by any amount of tugging , and he saw as well that they had been recently dipped in grease . But what was to be done with that rotten , moth-eaten old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Saturday nights in the sheds , and on which the good padre played his cards likewise in the chapel ? It was not to keep the cold air away from him , or shield his half-naked body from the poisonous insects . Then what could it be for ? " Lift him up , men , and when you lash him down , leave only that little finger free ! " Ben Brown squatted himself on a stone beside the bier , and with his cutlass unbuckled and laid on the sand , and sleeves rolled up , began his work as if he had a chafing-mat to make for the dead-eyes of the frigate 's lower shrouds , and , though in a hurry , still intended to make a neat job of it . He had a small and rather sharp-pointed marline-spike , too , which he wore habitually , like a talisman , round his neck , and which stood him in hand in the intricate parts of his task . Taking in at a glance the exact amount of hide stuff he required , he middled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his old bronzed arms went backward and forward , under and over  --  sometimes pricking a little hole by accident in the pirate 's own thin hide as he passed the strips by the aid of his marline-spike , but always apologizing in his bluff , rough way , though without squirting tobacco-juice into his victim 's face , as did Mr. Gibbs to Jacob Blunt . " Beg pardon , ye infarnal pirate ! but that stick will do ye no harm . It 'll heal much sooner than the iron spike one of yer crew drove through both cheeks of my watch-mate when you gagged him on board the brig . " I say , old nigger , hand us a little more of that slush , will ye ? this ' ere strand wo n't lie flat . Thankee , old darkey ! Kitch hold on that lower end , will ye ? and draw it square up between his pins , and straighten out that ' ere knee-joint a bit  --  so fashion . " I would n't hurt ye , you ugly villain , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! suppose you just toddle down to the boat for that ' ere grafted bottle lyin ' in the starn sheets , and bring a tin pot of fresh water with you ; the gentleman might be thirsty , you know . I am  --  Benjamin Brown , of Sandy Pint , seaman . " So Benjamin plaited Captain Brand , late of the " Centipede , " down on his bier ; not a thong too little , or one in the wrong place . A strand between each of his toes , and the big ones turned up in quite an ornamental way , and worked around with a Turk's-head knot . " Breathin ' works all reg'lar , too , no bit of hide bearin ' an onequal strain over his bread-basket . Throat and jaw-tackle in fair talkin ' order , little finger free ; and there , Capting Brand , jist let old Ben reward ye , good for evil , ye child-murdering scoundrel , for the lick your mate gave him with the pistol on the head , by placing this soft pillow of green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little this side , so as ye can look at your finger , while I pass this broad piece of stuff over your ear . Do n't ye look at me , ye infarnal scoundrel , or I 'll let this ' ere copper spike slip into one of yer junk-bottle glims ! " Now , " continued Ben , " I 'll take a spell till the doctor and the old nigger come back . " Ay , the job was done , and the mat over the dead-eyes of the shrouds ! Illustration : " NOW CAPTAIN BRAND KNEW WHAT WAS COMING . " During this neat and seamanlike operation Paul Darcantel wandered away on the tracks of the flying wolf till he came to the cleft in the rock . There he picked up and lighted the torch and stalked on . Presently he came to the stones before the low cavern , and pushed his way in with the blazing torch before him . Had Paul Darcantel had nerves , they would have shaken at what he saw ; but having none to shake , he calmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the ancient Ignacio , caught , as he tried to creep out of the treasure-chamber , by the falling of the stone slab . It must have been sudden , for the stump of a paper cigar was still seized in his wrinkled lips , while the snakelike curls twined about his ears , and his wary eye looked out with its usual suspicious intensity , and seemed to throw out a spark of fire in the reflection of the torch . Rising from a coil in a slimy bed of sand before the head was a venomous serpent , with his graceful neck curved into the broad flat head , all like an ebony cane , straight , motionless , and elegant to the curved top  --  fascinated by that single living orb of the dead man . The human intruder left this well-matched pair to their own venomous devices , and winding his way on , he soon came to the open door to the vaults . A powerful kick smashed in the door of the dungeon , and while the rusty bolts were still ringing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He saw nothing at first save a few fragments of broken crockery and a rusty metal pot  --  not even a rat . But flaring the torch down upon the mouldy floor something sparkled in the light . This he snatched , and it was the long-lost locket and chain which had last rested around the baby-boy 's neck . When the doctor strode back to the esplanade of the chapel he found Benjamin Brown and Banou taking a friendly sip out of the tin pot . " Well , sir , " said Ben , as he got on his pins and strapped on his cutlass , " there he is , sir ! and as neat a piece of cross-lashing as ever I did . He looks as if he growed there , jist like a hawk-bill turtle a-bilin ' in the ship 's coppers , only he ca n't paddle about . " I did it marciful , too , sir , and tried to convarse with him , in case he had any presents to make to his friends . " Why , sir , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop of grog  --  mixed or raw  --  down his tight mouth , but he never had the perliteness to thank me or ax me a question , but only looked wicked at me . Consarn him ! if he had only winked , I would n't mind it ! " said Ben , with much indignation ; " but , howsever , I do n't b'lieve he 's any think to leave or any friends left ! " But Captain Brand , though speechless without being tongue-tied , and unable to wink , still thought . And what did the doctor propose to do with him in case he was not to be stung to death by insects , sand-flies , musquitoes , and what not ? " Lift the trestle for the last time , men , and stand it here over this thick bed of cactus , so as the little finger may touch the letter on this white tomb-stone . " Now Captain Brand 's doubts were relieved , and he knew what was coming . Oh ho ! ho ! " There ! that is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trestle up solid to the edge of the frame , so that a hurricane ca n't loosen it . " Big Banou went to work now , and presently his job was done  --  coral rocks , and loose head-stones of pirates , well packed down with sand , made the sides of the living tomb . Then the black pall was drawn over the body , and they left the pirate to his inevitable doom . Soon the three executioners reached the Tiger 's Trap . " Banou , take this locket and chain  --  ah ! you know it well  --  to your young master . Brown , the two thousand dollars will be placed in your and Greenfield 's hands for distribution among the schooner 's crew ; make a good use of it ! Tell the commodore that I shall take an old woman we have found here away with me in a stolen fisherman 's boat to Manzanillo , and within the year I shall be at home ! There ! shove off , my lads ! " As the gig skimmed through the Tiger 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sailed out by the Alligator 's Mouth , and as they crossed that roaring ledge , the sun sank in its unclouded glory in the west , and the young moon , with its thin pearly crescent , looked timidly down upon the island . And the night passed , and the next and the next , with scorching days and blazing suns between them ; while the mangrove , the palm , the cocoa-nut , and the cactus  --  ah ! that luxuriant plant throve apace  --  shooting up its steel-pointed bayonets two inches of a night in thorny needles as thick as pins in a paper , growing clean through the hide of ox or man like blood , till their hard-edged leaves met resistance , when , turning flat side up , they put forth a score for one of the needle bayonets ! No escape from them . From shoulder to heel one long , hopeless agony . The fierce sun flaming down , absorbed by the black pall of death ! The moon glimmering in pale white rays of splendor through the moth-eaten holes upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the night ! Was it a dream , Captain Brand ? No , a frightful reality ! Do n't you feel a fresh thorn at every slow pulse of the heart they are aiming at ? And do n't you hear those dread croakings of gulls and cormorants flapping in the air , who have left their prey on the reef to join the vultures in their feast on the shore ? You may almost catch the grating sounds of the rasping jaws of the sharks as they crowd into the inlet , and rest their cold noses on the shelly cove where you slept ! Flesh and blood , and pinions and beaks can endure it no longer . A cloud of carnivorous birds swoop down at last , snap the black pall in their talons and bills , and fly fighting and screaming away with it . Another cloud , darker than the rest , light upon the body , and while the needle-points pierce the palpitating heart , and the breath flutters on the still clenched lips and nostrils , the eyes are picked out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , till nothing is left but a hideous white skeleton , with the long bony finger pointing to the letter L. The lizards wheetled on the rocks , the alligators lashed the lagoon amid the steaming mist of the mangrove roots ; the sharks and birds returned to the reefs , the cocoa-nuts waved their tufted tops , the palms crackled in the shower and gale , and the pure inlet murmured musically on the shelly shore for years and years over and around the deserted key , until the whitened bones crumbled into dust , and were borne away by the four winds of heaven . * * * * * The hemp has been tarred and spread , the strands twisted , and the rope laid up . The knots have been turned in between good sailors and bad  --  between pirates and men-of-war's-men  --  and here Harry Gringo hauls down his pennant until his reading crew care again to take a cruise with him in blue water .

It will contain a carefully condensed and impartial record of the events of the day , pictorially illustrated wherever the pencil of the Artist can aid the pen of the Writer . In Politics it will advocate the National Cause , wholly irrespective of mere party grounds . Its Essays , Poems , and Tales will be furnished by the ablest writers of both Continents . A new Novel , by Mr. GEORGE AUGUSTUS SALA , entitled " QUITE ALONE , " will , by special arrangement with the Author , appear in the WEEKLY simultaneously with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Publishers will see to it that the current Volume shall justify the favorable opinions expressed by the loyal Press upon the Volume which has just closed . =Extracts from Notices by the Press. = " HARPER 'S WEEKLY is the best publication of its class in America , and so far ahead of all other weekly journals as not to permit of any comparison between it and any of their number . Its columns contain the finest collections of reading matter that are printed . Thus , if you look into the Volume for 1863 , you will find that its stories , and miscellaneous articles , and poetry are from the minds of some of the leading writers of the time . Its matter is of a very various character from elaborate tales and well-considered editorial articles to the airiest and briefest jests , good-humored hits at the expense of human follies , which proceed from the liveliest of minds . It is a vigorous supporter of the war  --  discussing all questions that concern the contest in which we are engaged with an amplitude of perception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed on the roll of loyal and liberal publications . Its illustrations are numerous and beautiful , being furnished by the chief artists of the country . Most of the illustrations are devoted to the war , including battle-pieces , scenes made renowned by great events there occurring , and portraits of eminent military and civil leaders . Even a person who could not read a line of its letter-press could intelligently follow the history of the war through 1863 by going over the pictured pages of this volume , "  --  Evening Traveller ( Boston . ) " HARPER 'S WEEKLY , besides being a literary paper of the first class  --  the only one among American or European Pictorials with a definite purpose consistently and constantly carried out  --  is at once a leading political and historical annalist of the nation . "  --  The Press ( Philadelphia ) . " HARPER 'S WEEKLY .  --  In turning over its pages , we were struck anew with the fidelity with which it delineates passing events : a true picture of the times . The scenes of the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the camp , are re-produced in excellent wood-cuts with marvelous promptness and accuracy . The letter-press furnishes an appropriate accompaniment to the illustrations ; presenting a pleasing variety , sprightly and entertaining . We can not wonder at the popularity of the Weekly when we observe the spirit and enterprise with which it is conducted . "  --  Journal ( Boston ) . " HARPER 'S WEEKLY FOR 1863.  --  From a careful examination of this work , as it came out in it weekly form , we can honestly advise our readers to purchase the stately and pictured volume . We dare not say how many duodecimo volumes of matter , and of good and interesting matter , it contains . As a record of the events and opinions of the past year , and as literally a picture of the time , it has a permanent value , while its wealth of excellent stories and essays makes it an endless source of entertainment . The original editorial articles are of a very high order of merit , and relate to subjects which attract the attention of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sentiment , and thorough-going loyalty find expression in the most exquisite English . Altogether , we should say that Harper 's Weekly is a necessity in every household . "  --  The Transcript ( Boston ) . " HARPER 'S WEEKLY and MAGAZINE , with their immense circulation , are grandly loyal and influential . The Weekly especially has been true to the cause ; and while it gives in admirable correspondence and accurate pictures a complete illustrated history of the war , with all its battles , incidents , and portraits of generals , it has splendidly enforced by argument and example its principles . Closer reasoning is not to be found than that to which its editors might fairly challenge answer . "  --  City Item ( Philadelphia ) . Notices of Harper 's Weekly . " HARPER 'S WEEKLY , of which the Seventh Volume is now issued in neat , substantial binding , shows the industry and zeal with which the cause of the Union has been maintained in its columns during the year 1863 . It has continued to increase the fervor of patriotic sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able editorial leaders commenting on the events of the day . In its present shape , the journal furnishes copious materials for the history of the war , and can not fail to find a place in public and private libraries as an important volume for permanent reference . "  --  Tribune ( New York ) . " HARPER 'S WEEKLY for 1863  --  a journal of the year , kept in the most interesting way ; and as we turn over the pages we revive many now almost forgotten sensations , and see , bit by bit , how history has grown . The volume closed and bound up becomes history ; but it would not be just to this publication to omit a remark on the influence which it has exerted during the year , and which it continues to exert . An illustrated journal like Harper 's Weekly , which circulates , as we have heard , over one hundred and twenty thousand copies per week , chiefly among families , and which has probably a million of readers , has necessarily a great influence in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union , the Government , and the great principles to develop which the Union was founded . Unlike most illustrated journals , Harper 's Weekly has displayed political and literary ability of a high order as well as artistic merit . Its political discussions are sound , clear , and convincing , and have done their share to educate the American people to a right understanding of their dangers and duties . In its speciality  --  illustrations of passing events  --  it is unsurpassed ; and many of the pictures of the year do honor to the genius of the artists and engravers of this country . Thus complete in all the departments of an American Family Journal , Harper 's Weekly has earned for itself a right to the title which it assumed seven years ago , ' A JOURNAL OF CIVILIZATION . ' "  --  Evening Post ( New York ) . HARPER 'S WEEKLY .  --  This periodical merits special notice at the present time . There is probably no weekly publication of the country that equals its influence . More than one hundred thousand copies fly over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , steamboats , and families . Our youth especially read them ; and as the family newspaper of the nation , its power over the forming opinions of the next generation of the American people is an important item . It is abundant , if not superabundant , in pictorial illustrations  --  a means of strong impression , especially on the minds of the young . Both by its illustrations and its incessant discussion of the occurrences and questions of the war it is a " current history " and " running commentary " on the great event , and there is probably no literary agency of the day more effective in its influence respecting the war in the families of the common people . Most happy are we then to be able to say that this responsible power is exerted altogether on the side of loyalty . No paper in the land is more outspoken , more uncompromising for the Union , for the war , for even the policy of the President 's " great Proclamation . " When the rebellion broke out we did the publishers the injustice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject . Steadily have they kept up with the Providential development of its events and questions ; not only abreast of them , but , in important respects , ahead of them . No periodical press in the nation deserves better of the country for its faithfulness and " pluck " in all matters relating to the great struggle . And we should do it injustice were we not to add that , with its outright loyalty and bravery , it combines commanding ability . The editorial leaders which it continuously flings out against all political traitors and flunkies strike directly at their mark . They are evidently from pens both strong and polished . On even the astuter subjects of policy , finance , &amp;c. , it is eminently able . And it makes no mistake in supposing its readers capable of an interest and of intelligence in these respects . American families look keenly into such questions , and with such a really educational force as this paper wields , it is especially right and commendable that it seeks to elevate the common mind to the higher questions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice and to remember the courageous and patriotic course of Harper 's Weekly in these dark times of hideous treason , and of more hideous , because more contemptible , semi-treason.  --  The Methodist , N.
