txt //to Dumpling Rocks . On the grassy parapet of the crumbling tower which once served the purposes of a fort , the transparent water hungering at its base , the rocks covered with fringe spotting the channel , the ocean on my right hand lost in its own vastness , and Newport out of mind save when the town bells rang , or the dip of oars beat in the still swell of Narragansett ,  --  I lay down , chafing and out of temper , to curse the only pleasurable labor I had ever undertaken . To me all places were workshops : the seaside , the springs , the summer mountains , the cataracts , the theatres , the panoramas of islet-fondled rivers speeding by strange cities . I was condemned to look upon them all with mercenary eyes , to turn their gladness into torpid prose , and speak their praises in turgid columns . Never nepenthe , never abandonne , always wide-awake , and watching for saliences , I had gone abroad like a falcon , and roamed at home like a hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pointed , and ever dropping gall ; the ineradicable stain upon my thumb ; the widest of my circuits , with all my adventure , a paltry sheet of foolscap ; and the world in which I dwelt , no place for thought , or dreaminess , or love-making ,  --  only the fierce , fast , flippant existence of news ! And with this inward execration , I lay on Dumpling Rocks , looking to sea , and recalled the first fond hours of my newspaper life . To be a subject of old Hoe , the most voracious of men , I gave up the choice of three sage professions , and the sweet alternative of idling husbandry . The day I graduated saw me an attache of the Philadelphia Chameleon . I was to receive three dollars a week and be the heir to lordly prospects . In the long course of persevering years I might sit in the cushions of the night-editor , or speak of the striplings around me as " my reporters . " " There is nothing which you can not attain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of the influence you exercise !  --  more than a clergyman ; Horace Greeley was an editor ; so was George D. Prentice ; the first has just been defeated for Congress ; the last lectured last night and got fifty dollars for it . " Hereat I was greatly encouraged , and proposed to write a leader for next day 's paper upon the evils of the Fire Department . " Dear me , " said Mr. Axiom , " you would ruin our circulation at a wink ; what would become of our ball column ? in case of a fire in the building we could n't get a hose to play on it . Oh ! no , Alfred , writing leaders is hard and dangerous ; I want you first to learn the use of a beautiful pair of scissors . " I looked blank and chopfallen . " No man can write a good hand or a good style , " he said , " without experience with scissors . They give your palm flexibility and that is soon imparted to the mind . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the pen ; if a little paste be prescribed at the same time , cohesion and steadfastness is imparted to the man . " His reasoning was incontrovertible ; but I damned his conclusions . So , I spent one month in slashing several hundred exchanges a day , and paragraphing all the items . These reappeared in a column called " THE LATEST INFORMATION , " and when I found them copied into another journal , a flush of satisfaction rose to my face . The editor of the Chameleon was an old journalist , whose face was a sealed book of Confucius , and who talked to me , patronizingly , now and then , like the Delphic Oracle . His name was Watch , and he wore a prodigious pearl in his shirt-bosom . He crept up to the editorial room at nine o'clock every night , and dashed off an hour 's worth of glittering generalities , at the end of which time two or three gentlemen , blooming at the nose , and with cheeks resembling a map drawn in red ink , sounded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Townsend , I look to you to be on hand to-night ; I am called away by the Water-Gas Company . " Then , with enthusiasm up to blood-heat , aroused by this mark of confidence , I used to set to , and scissor and write till three o'clock , while Mr. Watch talked water-gas over brandy and water , and drew his thirty dollars punctually on Saturdays . So it happened that my news paragraphs , sometimes pointedly turned into a reflection , crept into the editorial columns , when water-gas was lively . Venturing more and more , the clipper finally indited a leader ; and Mr. Watch , whose nose water-gas was reddening , applauded me , and told me in his sublime way , that , as a special favor , I might write all the leaders the next night . Mr. Watch was seen no more in the sanctum for a week , and my three dollars carried on the concern . When he returned , he generously gave me a dollar , and said that he had spoken of me to the Water-Gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pass for the Arch Street Theatre , and told me , benevolently , to go off and rest that night . For a month or more the responsibility of the Chameleon devolved almost entirely upon me . Child that I was , knowing no world but my own vanity , and pleased with those who fed its sensitive love of approbation rather than with the just and reticent , I harbored no distrust till one day when Axiom visited the office , and I was drawing my three dollars from the treasurer , I heard Mr. Watch exclaim , within the publisher 's room  --  " Did you read my article on the Homestead Bill ? " " Yes , " answered Axiom ; " it was quite clever ; your leaders are more alive and epigrammatic than they were . " I could stand it no more . I bolted into the office , and cried  --  " The article on the Homestead Bill is mine , so is every other article in to-day 's paper . Mr. Watch does not tell the truth ; he is ungenerous ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Axiom . " Alfred , " exclaimed Mr. Watch , majestically , " adopts my suggestions very readily , and is quite industrious . I recommend that we raise his salary to five dollars a week . That is a large sum for a lad . " That night the manuscript was overhauled in the composing room . Watch 's dereliction was manifest ; but not a word was said commendatory of my labor ; it was feared I might take " airs , " or covet a further increase of wages . I only missed Watch 's hugh pearl , and heard that he had been discharged , and was myself taken from the drudgery of the scissors , and made a reporter . All this was very recent , yet to me so far remote , that as I recall it all , I wonder if I am not old , and feel nervously of my hairs . For in the five intervening years I have ridden at Hoe speed down the groove of my steel-pen . The pen is my traction engine ; it has gone through worlds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and long experience has given it so great facility , that I have only to fire up , whistle , and fix my couplings , and away goes my locomotive with no end of cars in train . Few journalists , beginning at the bottom , do not weary of the ladder ere they climb high . Few of such , or of others more enthusiastic , recall the early associations of " the office " with pleasure . Yet there is no world more grotesque , none , at least in America , more capable of fictitious illustration . Around a newspaper all the dramatis personae of the world congregate ; within it there are staid idiosyncratic folk who admit of all kindly caricature . I summon from that humming and hurly-burly past , the ancient proof-reader . He wears a green shade over his eyes and the gas burner is drawn very low to darken the bald and wrinkled contour of his forehead . He is severe in judgment and spells rigidly by the Johnsonian standard . He punctuates by an obdurate and conscientious method , and will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , will eat with you , drink with you , and encourage you ; but he will not punctuate with you , spell with you , nor accept any of your suggestions as to typography or paragraphing whatsoever . He wears slippers and smokes a primitive clay pipe ; he has everything in its place , and you can not offend him more than by looking over any proof except when he is holding it . A chip of himself is the copyholder at his side ,  --  a meagre , freckled , matter of fact youth , who reads your tenderest sentences in a rapid monotone , and is never known to venture any opinion or suggestion whatever . This boy , I am bound to say , will follow the copy if it be all consonants , and will accompany it if it flies out of the window . The office clerk was my bane and admiration . He was presumed by the verdant patrons of the paper to be its owner and principal editor , its type-setter , pressman , and carrier . His hair was elaborately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dandyfied pens ; a broad , shovel-shaped gold pen lay forever opposite his high stool ; he had an arrogant and patronizing address , and was the perpetual cabbager of editorial perquisites . Books , ball-tickets , season-tickets , pictures , disappeared in his indiscriminate fist , and he promised notices which he could not write to no end of applicants . He was to be seen at the theatre every night , and he was the dashing escort of the proprietor 's wife , who preferred his jaunty coat and highly-polished boots to the less elaborate wardrobe of us writers . That this noble and fashionable creature could descend to writing wrappers , and to waiting his turn with a bank-book in the long train of a sordid teller , passed all speculation and astonishment . He made a sorry fag of the office boy , and advised us every day to beware of cutting the files , as if that were the one vice of authors . To him we stole , with humiliated faces , and begged a trifling advance of salary . He sternly requested us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domain  --  but sometimes asked us to watch the office while he drank with a theatrical agent at the nearest bar . He was an inveterate gossip , and endowed with a damnable love of slipshod argument ; the only oral censor upon our compositions , he hailed us with all the complaints made at his solicitation by irascible subscribers , and stood in awe of the cashier only , who frequently , to our delight and surprise , combed him over , and drove him to us for sympathy . The foreman was still our power behind the throne ; he left out our copy on mechanical grounds , and put it in for our modesty and sophistry . In his broad , hot room , all flaring with gas , he stood at a flat stone like a surgeon , and took forms to pieces and dissected huge columns of pregnant metal , and paid off the hands with fabulous amounts of uncurrent bank bills . His wife and he went thrice a year on excursions to the sea-side , and he was forever borrowing a dollar from somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be seen towards the small-hours , writing his highly imaginative department , which showed how the Sally Ann , Master Todd , arrived leaky in Bombay harbor ; and there were stacks of newsboys asleep on the boilers , fighting in their dreams for the possession of a fragment of a many-cornered blanket . These , like myself , went into the halcyon land of Nod to the music of a crashing press , and swarmed about it at the dawn like so many gad flies about an ox , to carry into the awakening city the rhetoric and the rubbish I had written . And still they go , and still the great press toils along , and still am I its slave and keeper , who sit here by the proud , free sea , and feel like Sinbad , that to a terrible old man I have sold my youth , my convictions , my love , my life ! CHAPTER II . THE WAR CORRESPONDENT 'S FIRST DAY . Looking back over the four years of the war , and noting how indurated I have at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recall with a sigh that first morning of my correspondentship when I set out so light-hearted and yet so anxious . It was in 1861 . I was accompanied to the War department by an attache of the United States Senate . The new Secretary , Mr. Edwin M. Stanton , referred me to a Mr. Sanford , " Military Supervisor of Army Intelligence , " and after a brief delay I was requested to sign a parole and duplicate , specifying my loyalty to the Federal Government , and my promise to publish nothing detrimental to its interests . I was then given a circular , which stated explicitly the kind of news termed contraband , and also a printed pass , filled in with my name , age , residence , and newspaper connection . The latter enjoined upon all guards to pass me in and out of camps ; and authorized persons in Government employ to furnish me with information . Our Washington Superintendent sent me a beast , and in compliment to what the animal might have been , called the same a horse . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such misnomer . The creature possessed no single equine element . Experience has satisfied me that horses stand on four legs ; the horse in question stood upon three . Horses may either pace , trot , run , rack , or gallop ; but mine made all the five movements at once . I think I may call his gait an eccentric stumble . That he had endurance I admit ; for he survived perpetual beating ; and his beauty might have been apparent to an anatomist , but would be scouted by the world at large . I asked , ruefully , if I was expected to go into battle so mounted ; but was peremptorily forbidden , as a valuable property might be endangered thereby . I was assigned to the Pennsylvania Reserve Corps in the anticipated advance , and my friend , the attache , accompanied me to its rendezvous at Hunter 's Mills . We started at two o'clock , and occupied an hour in passing the city limits . I calculated that , advancing at the same ratio , we should arrive in camp at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grim sabremen that sat erect at street corners , and ladies at the windows of the dwellings smothered with suppressed laughter as we floundered along . My friend had the better horse ; but I was the better rider ; and if at any time I grew wrathful at my sorry plight , I had but to look at his and be happy again . He appeared to be riding on the neck of his beast , and when he attempted to deceive me with a smile , his face became horribly contorted . Directly his breeches worked above his boots , and his bare calves were objects of hopeless solicitude . Caricatures , rather than men , we toiled bruisedly through Georgetown , and falling in the wake of supply teams on the Leesburg turnpike , rode between the Potomac on one side and the dry bed of the canal on the other , till we came at last to Chain Bridge . There was a grand view from the point of Little Falls above , where a line of foamy cataracts ridged the river , and the rocks towered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with its buildings of pure marble , and the yellow earthworks that crested Arlington Heights . The clouds over the Potomac were gorgeous in hue , but forests of melancholy pine clothed the sides of the hills , and the roar of the river made such beautiful monotone that I almost thought it could be translated to words . Our passes were now demanded by a fat , bareheaded officer , and while he panted through their contents , two privates crossed their bayonets before us . " News ? " he said , in the shortest remark of which he was capable . When assured that we had nothing to reveal , he seemed immeasurably relieved , and added  --  " Great labor , reading ! " At this his face grew so dreadfully purple that I begged him to sit down , and tax himself with no further exertion . He wiped his forehead , in reply , gasping like a triton , and muttering the expressive direction , " right ! " disappeared into a guard-box . The two privates winked as they removed their muskets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our backs were now turned to the Maryland shore , and jutting grimly from the hill before us , the black guns of Fort Ethan Allen pointed down the bridge . A double line of sharp abattis protected it from assault , and sentries walked lazily up and down the parapet . The colors hung against the mast in the dead calm , and the smoke curled straight upward from some log-huts within the fort . The wildness of the surrounding landscape was most remarkable . Within sight of the Capital of the Republic , the fox yet kept the covert , and the farms were few and far apart . It seemed to me that little had been done to clear the country of its primeval timber , and the war had accomplished more to give evidence of man and industry , than two centuries of occupation . A military road had been cut through the solid rocks here ; and the original turnpike , which had been little more than a cart track , was now graded and macadamized . I passed multitudes of teams , struggling up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way . The profanity of the teamsters was painfully apparent . I came unobserved upon one who was berating his beasts with a refinement of cruelty . He cursed each of them separately , swinging his long-lashed whip the while , and then damned the six in mass . He would have made a dutiful overseer . The soldiers had shown quite as little consideration for the residences along the way . I came to one dwelling where some pertinacious Vandal had even pried out the window-frames , and imperilled his neck to tear out the roof-beams ; a dead vulture was pinned over the door by pieces of broken bayonets . " Langley 's , "  --  a few plank-houses , clustering around a tavern and a church ,  --  is one of those settlements whose sounding names beguile the reader into an idea of their importance . A lonesome haunt in time of peace , it had lately been the winter quarters of fifteen thousand soldiers , and a multitude of log huts had grown up around it . I tied my horse to the window-shutter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewalk to the ricketty tavern-porch . Four or five privates lay here fast asleep , and the bar-room was occupied by a bevy of young officers , who were emptying the contents of sundry pocket-flasks . Behind the bar sat a person with strongly-marked Hebrew features , and a watchmaker was plying his avocation in a corner . Two great dogs crouched under a bench , and some highly-colored portraits were nailed to the wall . The floor was bare , and some clothing and miscellaneous articles hung from beams in the ceiling . " Is this your house ? " I said to the Hebrew . " I keepsh it now . " " By right or by conquest ? " " By ze right of conquest , " he said , laughing ; and at once proposed to sell me a bootjack and an India-rubber overcoat . I compromised upon a haversack , which he filled with sandwiches and sardines , and which I am bound to say fell apart in the course of the afternoon . The watchmaker was an enterprising young fellow , who had resigned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap jewelry and do itinerant repairing . He says that he followed the " Army Paymasters , and sold numbers of watches , at good premiums , when the troops had money . " Soldiers , he informed me , were reckless spendthrifts ; and the prey of sutlers and sharpers . When there was nothing at hand to purchase , they gambled away their wages , and most of them left the service penniless and in debt . He thought it perfectly legitimate to secure some silver while " going , " but complained that the value of his stock rendered him liable to theft and murder . " There are men in every regiment , " said he , " who would blow out my brains in any lonely place to plunder me of these watches . " At this point , a young officer , in a fit of bacchanal laughter , staggered rather roughly against me . " Begurpardon , " he said , with an unsteady bow , " never ran against person in life before . " I smiled assuringly , but he appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on honor of gentlemand officer , not in custom of behaving offensively . Azo ! leave it to my friends . Entirely due to injuries received at battle Drainesville . " As the other gentlemen laughed loudly here , I took it for granted that my apologist had some personal hallucination relative to that engagement . " What giggling for , Bob ? " he said ; " honor concerned in this matter , Will ! Do asshu a , fell under Colonel 's horse , and Company A walked over small of my back . " The other officers were only less inebriated and most of them spoke boastfully of their personal prowess at Drainesville . This was the only engagement in which the Pennsylvania Reserves had yet participated , and few officers that I met did not ascribe the victory entirely to their own individual gallantry . I inquired of these gentlemen the route to the new encampments of the Reserves . They lay five miles south of the turnpike , close to the Loudon and Hampshire railroad , and along both sides of an unfrequented lane . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Potomac , and had been ordered to hold themselves in hourly readiness for an advance . By this time , my friend S. came up , and leaving him to restore his mortified body , I crossed the road to the churchyard and peered through the open door into the edifice . The seats of painted pine had been covered with planks , and a sick man lay above every pew . At the ringing of my spurs in the threshold , some of the sufferers looked up through the red eyes of fever , and the faces of others were spectrally white . A few groaned as they turned with difficulty , and some shrank in pain from the glare of the light . Medicines were kept in the altar-place , and a doctor 's clerk was writing requisitions in the pulpit . The sickening smell of the hospital forbade me to enter , and walking across the trampled yard , I crept through a rent in the paling , and examined the huts in which the Reserves had passed the winter . They were built of logs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were thatched with straw . Each cabin was pierced for two or more windows ; the beds were simply shelves or berths ; a rough fireplace of stones and clay communicated with the wooden chimney ; and the floors were in most cases damp and bare . Streets , fancifully designated , divided the settlement irregularly ; but the tenements were now all deserted save one , where I found a whole family of " contrabands " or fugitive slaves . These wretched beings , seven in number , had escaped from a plantation in Albemarle county , and travelling stealthily by night , over two hundred miles of precipitous country , reached the Federal lines on the thirteenth day . The husband said that his name was " Jeems , " and that his wife was called " Kitty ; " that his youngest boy had passed the mature age of eight months , and that the " big girl , Rosy , " was " twelve years Christmas comin ' . " While the troops remained at Langley 's , the man was employed at seventy-five cents a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rose cooked and washed for soldiers , and the boys ran errands to Washington and return ,  --  twenty-five miles ! The eldest boy , Jefferson , had been given the use of a crippled team-horse , and traded in newspapers , but having confused ideas of the relative value of coins , his profits were only moderate . The nag died before the troops removed , and a sutler , under pretence of securing their passage to the North , disappeared with the little they had saved . They were quite destitute now , but looked to the future with no foreboding , and huddled together in the straw , made a picture of domestic felicity that impressed me greatly with the docility , contentment , and unfailing good humor of their dusky tribe . The eyes of the children were large and lustrous , and they revealed the clear pearls beneath their lips as they clung bashfully to their mother 's lap . The old lady was smoking a clay pipe ; the man running over some castaway jackets and boots . I remarked particularly the broad shoulders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left no traces upon her comeliness . She asked me , wistfully : " Masser , how fur to de nawf ? " " A long way , " said I , " perhaps two hundred miles . " " Lawd ! " she said , buoyantly  --  " is dat all ? Why , Jeems , could n't we foot it , honey ? " " You a most guv out before , ole ' oman , " he replied ; " got a good ruff over de head now . Guess de white massar wo n't let um starve . " I tossed some coppers to the children and gave each a sandwich . " You get up dar , John Thomas ! " called the man vigorously ; " you tank de gentleman , Jefferson , boy ! I wonda wha your manners is . Tank you , massar ! know 'd you was a gentleman , sar ! Massar , is your family from ole Virginny ? " It was five o'clock when I rejoined S. , and the greater part of our journey had yet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesy yielded to impatience , when spurring my Pegasus vigorously , he fell into a bouncing amble and left the attache far behind . My pass was again demanded above Langley 's by a man who ate apples as he examined it , and who was disposed to hold a long parley . I entered a region of scrub timber further on , and met with nothing human for four miles , at the end of which distance I reached Difficult Creek , flowing through a rocky ravine , and crossed by a military bridge of logs . Through the thick woods to the right , I heard the roar of the Potomac , and a finger-board indicated that I was opposite Great Falls . Three or four dead horses lay at the roadside beyond the stream , and I recalled the place as the scene of a recent cavalry encounter . A cartridge-box and a torn felt hat lay close to the carcasses : I knew that some soul had gone hence to its account . The road now kept to the left obliquely , and much of my ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about me , with seven miles of the journey yet to accomplish , and as , at eight o'clock , I turned from the turnpike into a lonesome by-road , full of ruts , pools , and quicksands , a feeling of delicious uneasiness for the first time possessed me . Some owls hooted in the depth of the woods , and wild pigs , darting across the road , went crashing into the bushes . The phosphorescent bark of a blasted tree glimmered on a neighboring knoll , and as I halted at a rivulet to water my beast , I saw a solitary star floating down the ripples . Directly I came upon a clearing where the moonlight shone through the rents of a crumbling dwelling , and from the far distance broke the faint howl of farm dogs . A sense of insecurity that I would not for worlds have resigned , now tingled , now chilled my blood . At last , climbing a stony hill , the skies lay beneath me reddening with the flame of camps and flaring and falling alternately , like the beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked entranced , and in a twinkling , a body of horsemen dashed past me and disappeared . A little beyond , the road grew so thick that I could see nothing of my way ; but trusting doubtfully to my horse , a deep challenge came directly from the thicket , and I saw the flash of a sabre , as I stammered a reply . Led to a cabin close at hand , my pass was examined by candle-light , and I learned that the nearest camp of the Reserves was only a mile farther on , and the regiment of which I was in quest about two miles distant . After another half hour , I reached Ord 's brigade , whose tents were pitched in a fine grove of oaks ; the men talking , singing , and shouting , around open air fires ; and a battery of brass Napoleons unlimbered in front , pointing significantly to the West and South . For a mile and a half I rode by the light of continuous camps , reaching at last the quarters of the  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine , with whom I had gone itemizing , scores of times . His regiment had arrived only the same afternoon , and their tents were not yet pitched . Their muskets were stacked along the roadside , and the men lay here and there wrapped in their blankets , and dozing around the fagots . The Colonel was asleep in a wagon , but roused up at the summons of his Adjutant , and greeting me warmly , directed the cook to prepare a supper of coffee and fried pork . Too hungry to feel the chafing of my sores and bruises , I fell to the oleaginous repast with my teeth and fingers , and eating ravenously , asked at last to be shown to my apartments . These consisted of a covered wagon , already occupied by four teamsters , and a blanket which had evidently been in close proximity to the hide of a horse . A man named " Coggle , " being nudged by the Colonel , and requested to take other quarters , asked dolorously if it was time to turn out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness of being kicked . When I asked for a pillow , the Colonel laughed , and I had an intuition that the man " Coggle " was looking at me in the darkness with intense disgust . The Colonel said that he had once put a man on double duty for placing his head on a snowball , and warned me satirically that such luxuries were preposterous in the field . He recommended me not to catch cold if I could help it , but said that people in camp commonly caught several colds at once , and added grimly that if I wished to be shaved in the morning , there was a man close by , who had ground a sabre down to the nice edge of a razor , and who could be made to accommodate me . There were cracks in the bottom of the wagon , through which the cold came like knives , and I was allotted a space four feet in length , by three feet in width . Being six feet in height , my relation to these Procrustean quarters was most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay my head on my arm . In a short time I experienced a sensation akin to that of being guillotined , and sitting bolt upright , found the teamsters in the soundest of Lethean conditions . As the man next to me snored very loudly , I adopted the brilliant idea of making a pillow of his thigh ; which answered my best expectations . I was aroused after a while , by what I thought to be the violent hands of this person , but which , to my great chagrin , proved to be S. , intent upon dividing my place with me . Resistance was useless . I submitted to martyrdom with due resignation , but half resolved to go home in the morning , and shun , for the future , the horrible romance of camps . CHAPTER III . A GENERAL UNDER THE MICROSCOPE . When I awoke at Colonel Taggert 's tent the morning afterward , I had verified the common experience of camps by " catching several colds at once , " and felt a general sensation of being cut off at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , states that he believed himself to be tied in knots , and that he should return afoot to Washington . Our horses looked no worse , for that would have been manifestly impossible . We were made the butts of much jesting at breakfast ; and S. said , in a spirit of atrocity , that camp wit was quite as bad as camp " wittles . " I bade him adieu at five o'clock A. M. , when he had secured passage to the city in a sutler 's wagon . Remounting my own fiery courser , I bade the Colonel a temporary farewell , and proceeded in the direction of Meade 's and Reynold 's brigades . The drum and fife were now beating reveille , and volunteers in various stages of undress were limping to roll-call . Some wore one shoe , and others appeared shivering in their linen . They stood ludicrously in rank , and a succession of short , dry coughs ran up and down the line , as if to indicate those who should escape the bullet for the lingering agonies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rising from the hollows and fens . Some signal corps officers were practising with flags in a ploughed field , and negro stewards were stirring about the cook fires . A few supply wagons that I passed the previous day were just creaking into camp , having travelled most of the night . I saw that the country was rude , but the farms were close , and the dwellings in many cases inhabited . The vicinity had previously been unoccupied by either army , and rapine had as yet appropriated only the fields for camps and the fences for fuel . I was directed to the headquarters of Major-General M'Call ,  --  a cluster of wall tents in the far corner of a grain-field , concealed from public view by a projecting point of woods . A Sibley tent stood close at hand , where a soldier in blue overcoat was reading signals through a telescope . I mistook the tent for the General 's , and riding up to the soldier was requested to stand out of the way . I moved to his rear , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then dismounted , and led my horse to a clump of trees a rod distant . " Do n't hitch there , " said the soldier ; " you block up the view . " A little ruffled at this manifest discourtesy , I asked the man to denote some point within a radius of a mile where I would not interfere with his operations . He said in reply , that it was not his business to denote hitching-stalls for anybody . I thought , in that case , that I should stay where I was , and he politely informed me that I might stay and be  --  jammed . I found afterward that this individual was troubled with a kind of insanity peculiar to all headquarters , arising out of an exaggerated idea of his own importance . I had the pleasure , a few minutes afterward , of hearing him ordered to feed my horse . A thickset , gray-haired man sat near by , undergoing the process of shaving by a very nervous negro . The thickset man was also exercising the privileges of his rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the more nervous the other became . I addressed myself mutually to master and man , in an inquiry as to the precise quarters of the General in command . The latter pointed to a wall tent contiguous , and was cursed by the thickset man for not minding his business . The thickset man remarked substantially , that he did n't know anything about it , and was at that moment cut by the negro , to my infinite delight . Before the wall tent in question stood a tall , broad-shouldered gentleman in shirt-sleeves and slippers , warming his back and hands at a fire . He was watching , through an aperture in the tent , the movements of a private who was cleaning his boots . I noticed that he wore a seal ring , and that he opened and shut his eyes very rapidly . He was , otherwise , a very respectable and dignified gentleman . " Is this General M'Call ? " said I , a little discomposed . The gentleman looked abstractedly into my eyes , opening and shutting his own several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last decided that he was General M'Call . " What is it ? " he said gravely , but without the slightest curiosity . " I have a letter for you , sir , I believe . " He put the letter behind his back , and went on warming his hands . Having winked several times again , apparently forgetting all about the matter , I ventured to add that the letter was merely introductory . He looked at it , mechanically . " Who opened it ? " he said . " Letters of introduction are not commonly sealed , General . " " Who are you ? " he asked , indifferently . I told him that the contents of the letter would explain my errand ; but he had , meantime , relapsed into abstractedness , and winked , and warmed his hands , for at least , five minutes . At the end of that time , he read the letter very deliberately , and said that he was glad to see me in camp . He intimated , that if I was not already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at headquarters . He stated , in relation to my correspondence , that all letters sent from the Reserve Corps , must , without any reservations , be submitted to him in person . I was obliged to promise compliance , but had gloomy forebodings that the General would occupy a fortnight in the examination of each letter . He invited me to breakfast , proposed to make me acquainted with his staff , and was , in all respects , a very grave , prudent , and affable soldier . I may say , incidentally , that I adopted the device of penning a couple of gossipy epistles , the length and folly of which , so irritated General M'Call , that he released me from the penalty of submitting my compositions for the future . I took up my permanent abode with quartermaster Kingwalt , a very prince of old soldiers , who had devoted much of a sturdy life to promoting the militia interests of the populous county of Chester . When the war-fever swept down his beautiful valley , and the drum called the young men from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he was both  --  took a musket at the sprightly age of sixty-five , and joined a Volunteer company . Neither ridicule nor entreaty could bend his purpose ; but the Secretary of War , hearing of the case , conferred a brigade quartermastership upon him . He threw off the infirmities of age , stepped as proudly as any youngster , and became , emphatically , the best quartermaster in the Division . He never delayed an advance with tardy teams , nor kept the General tentless , nor penned irregular requisitions , nor wasted the property of Government . The ague seized him , occasionally , and shook his grey hairs fearfully ; but he always recovered to ride his black stallion on long forages , and his great strength and bulk were the envy of all the young officers . He grasped my hand so heartily that I positively howled , and commanded a tall sergeant , rejoicing in the name of Clover , to take away my horse and split him up for kindling wood . " We must give him the blue roan , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great dejection of Fogg , a short stout youth , who was posting accounts . I was glad to see , however , that Fogg was not disposed to be angry , and when informed that a certain iron-gray nag was at his disposal , he was in a perfect glow of good humor . The other attaches were a German , whose name , as I caught it , seemed to be Skyhiski ; and a pleasant lad called Owen , whose disposition was so mild , that I wondered how he had adopted the bloody profession of arms . A black boy belonged to the establishment , remarkable , chiefly , for getting close to the heels of the black stallion , and being frequently kicked ; he was employed to feed and brush the said stallion , and the antipathy between them was intense . The above curious military combination , slept under a great tarpaulin canopy , originally used for covering commissary stores from the rain . Our meals were taken in the open air , and prepared by Skyhiski ; but there was a second tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed his clerk duties , daily . When I had relieved my Pegasus of his saddle , and penned some paragraphs for a future letter , I strolled down the road with the old gentleman , who insisted upon showing me Hunter 's mill , a storm-beaten structure , that looked like a great barn . The mill-race had been drained by some soldiers for the purpose of securing the fish contained in it , and the mill-wheel was quite dry and motionless . Difficult Creek ran impetuously across the road below , as if anxious to be put to some use again ; and the miller 's house adjoining , was now used as a hospital , for Lieutenant-Colonel Kane , and some inferior officers . It was a favorite design of the Quartermaster 's to scrape the mill-stone , repair the race , and put the great breast-wheel to work . One could see that the soldier had not entirely obliterated the miller , and as he related , with a glowing face , the plans that he had proposed to recuperate the tottering structure , and make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such peaceful ambitions should have ever been overruled by the call to arms . While we stood at the mill window , watching the long stretches of white tents and speculating upon the results of war , we saw several men running across the road toward a hill-top cottage , where General Meade made his quarters . A small group was collected at the cottage , reconnoitring something through their telescopes . As I hastened in that direction , I heard confused voices , thus : " No , it is n't ! " " It is ! " " Can you make out his shoulder-bar ? " " What is the color of his coat ? " " Gray ! " " No , it 's butternut ! " " Has he a musket ! " " Yes , he is levelling it ! " At this the group scattered in every direction . " Pshaw ! " said one , " we are out of range ; besides , it is a telescope that he has . By  --   --  , it is a Rebel , reconnoitring our camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one man wondered how he had passed the picket . Another suggested that he might be accompanied by a troop , and a third convulsed the circle by declaring that there were six other Rebels visible in a woods to the left . Mr. Fogg had meantime come up and proffered me a field-glass , through which I certainly made out a person in gray , standing in the middle of the road just at the ridge of a hill . When I dropped my glass I saw him distinctly with the naked eye . He was probably a mile distant , and his gray vesture was little relieved by the blue haze of the forest . " He is going , " exclaimed a private , excitedly ; " where 's the man that was to try a lead on him ? " Several started impulsively for their pieces , and some officers called for their horses . " There go his knees ! " " His body is behind the hill ! " " Now his head  --   --  " " Crack ! crack ! crack ! " spluttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many rockets darted a score of horsemen through the creek and up the steep . Directly a faint hurrah pealed from the camp nearest the mill . It passed to the next camp and the next ; for all were now earnestly watching ; and finally a medley of cheers shook the air and the ear . Thousands of brave men were shouting the requiem of one paltry life . The rash fool had bought with his temerity a bullet in the brain . When I saw him  --  dusty and still bleeding  --  he was beset by a full regiment of idlers , to whom death had neither awe nor respect . They talked of the delicate shot , as connoisseurs in the art of murder ,  --  and two men dug him a grave on the green before the mill , wherein he was tossed like a dog or a vulture , to be lulled , let us hope , by the music of the grinding , when grain shall ripen once more . I had an opportunity , after dinner , to inspect the camp of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose efficiency as skirmishers has been adverted to by all chroniclers of the civil war . They wore the common blue blouse and breeches , but were distinguished by squirrel tails fastened to their caps . They were reputed to be the best marksmen in the service , and were generally allowed , in action , to take their own positions and fire at will . Crawling through thick woods , or trailing serpent-like through the tangled grass , these mountaineers were for a time the terror of the Confederates ; but when their mode of fighting had been understood , their adversaries improved upon it to such a degree that at the date of this writing there is scarcely a Corporal 's guard of the original Bucktail regiment remaining . Slaughtered on the field , perishing in prison , disabled or paroled , they have lost both their prestige and their strength . I remarked among these worthies a partiality for fisticuffs , and a dislike for the manual of arms . They drilled badly , and were reported to be adepts at thieving and unlicensed foraging . The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  favorites with Captain Kingwalt  --  congregated under the tarpaulin , after supper-hour , and when a long-necked bottle had been emptied and replenished , there were many quaint stories related and curious individualities revealed . I dropped asleep while the hilarity was at its height , and Fogg covered me with a thick blanket as I lay . The enemy might have come upon us in the darkness ; but if death were half so sound as my slumber afield , I should have bid it welcome . CHAPTER IV . A FORAGING ADVENTURE . There was a newsboy named " Charley , " who slept at Captain Kingwalt 's every second night , and who returned my beast to his owner in Washington . The aphorism that a Yankee can do anything , was exemplified by this lad ; for he worked my snail into a gallop . He was born in Chelsea , Massachusetts , and appeared to have taken to speculation at the age when most children are learning A B C. He was now in his fourteenth year , owned two horses , and employed another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon daily sales of four hundred journals were about thirty-two dollars . He had five hundred dollars in bank , and was debating with Captain Kingwalt the propriety of founding an army express and general agency . Such a self-reliant , swaggering , far-sighted , and impertinent boy I never knew . He was a favorite with the Captain 's black-boy , and upon thorough terms of equality with the Commanding General . His papers cost him in Washington a cent and a half each , and he sold them in camp for ten cents each . I have not the slightest doubt that I shall hear of him again as the proprietor of an overland mail , or the patron and capitalist of Greenland emigration . I passed the second and third days quietly in camp , writing a couple of letters , studying somewhat of fortification , and making flying visits to various officers . There was but one other Reporter with this division of the army . He represented a New York journal , and I could not but contrast his fine steed and equipments with the scanty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His saddle was a cushioned McClellan , with spangled breast-strap and plump saddle-bags , and his bridle was adorned with a bright curb bit and twilled reins . He wore a field-glass belted about his body , and was plentifully provided with money to purchase items of news , if they were at any time difficult to obtain . I resolved inwardly to seize the first opportunity of changing establishments , so that I might be placed upon as good a footing . My relations with camp , otherwise , were of the happiest character ; for the troops were State-people of mine , and , as reporters had not yet abused the privileges accorded them , my profession was held in some repute . I made the round of various " messes , " and soon adopted the current dissipations of the field ,  --  late hours , long stories , incessant smoking , and raw spirits . There were some restless minds about me , whose funds of anecdote and jest were apparently inexhaustible . I do not know that so many eccentric , adventurous , and fluent people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not excepting the Irish . The blue roan of which friend Fogg had been deprived , exhibited occasional evidences of a desire to break my neck . I was obliged to dispense with the spur in riding him , but he nevertheless dashed off at times , and put me into an agony of fear . On those occasions I managed to retain my seat , and gained thereby the reputation of being a very fine equestrian . As there were few civilians in camp , and as I wore a gray suit , and appeared to be in request at head-quarters , a rumor was developed and gained currency that I was attached to the Division in the capacity of a scout . When my horse became unmanageable , therefore , his speed was generally accelerated by the cheers of soldiers , and I became an object of curiosity in every quarter , to my infinite mortification and dread . The Captain was to set off on the fourth day , to purchase or seize some hay and grain that were stacked at neighboring farms . We prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason of Skyhiski being inebriated the night before , and thereby delaying the breakfast , and afterward the fact that the black stallion had laid open the black-boy 's leg . However , at a quarter past nine , the Captain , Sergeant Clover , Fogg , Owen , and myself , with six four-horse wagons , filed down the railroad track until we came to a bridge that some laborers were repairing , where we turned to the left through some soggy fields , and forded Difficult Creek . As there was no road to follow , we kept straight through a wood of young maples and chestnut-trees . Occasionally a trunk or projecting branch stopped the wagons , when the teamsters opened the way with their axes . After two hours of slow advance , we came to the end of the wood , and climbed a succession of hilly fields . From the summit of the last of these , a splendid sweep of farm country was revealed , dotted with quaint Virginia dwellings , stackyards , and negro-cabins , and divided by miles of tortuous worm-fence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I am afraid that he thought only of the abundant forage ; but my own grew hazy as I spoke of the peaceful people and the neglected fields . The plough had furrowed none of these acres , and some crows , that screamed gutturally from a neighboring ash-tree , seemed lean and pinched for lack of their plunder of corn . Many of the dwellings were guarded by soldiers ; but of the resident citizens only the women and the old men remained . I did not need to ask where the young men were exiled . The residue that prayed with their faces toward Richmond , told me the story with their eyes . There was , nevertheless , no melodramatic exhibition of feeling among the bereaved . I did not see any defiant postures , nor hear any melting apostrophies . Marius was not mouthing by the ruins of Carthage , nor even Rachel weeping for her Hebrew children . But there were on every hand manifestations of adherence to the Southern cause , except among a few males who feared unutterable things , and were disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome ; their face was indolent , their dress slovenly , and their manner embarrassed . They lopped off the beginnings and the ends of their sentences , generally commencing with a verb , as thus : " Told soldiers not to carr ' off the rye ; declared they would ; said they bound do jest what they pleased . Let ' em go ! " The Captain stopped at a spruce residence , approached by a long lane , and on knocking at the porch with his ponderous fist , a woman came timidly to the kitchen window . " Who 's thar ? " she said , after a moment . " Come out young woman , " said the Captain , soothingly ; " we do n't intend to murder or rob you , ma'am ! " There dropped from the doorsill into the yard , not one , but three young women , followed by a very deaf old man , who appeared to think that the Captain 's visit bore some reference to the hencoop . " I wish to buy for the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " some stacks of hay and corn fodder , that lie in one of your fields . " " The last hen was toted off this morning before breakfast , " said the old man ; " they took the turkeys yesterday , and I was obliged to kill the ducks or I should n't have had anything to eat . " Here Fogg so misdemeaned himself , as to laugh through his nose , and the man Clover appeared to be suddenly interested in something that lay in a mulberry-tree opposite . " I am provided with money to pay liberally for your produce , and you can not do better than to let me take the stacks : leaving you , of course , enough for your own horses and cattle . " Here the old man pricked up his ears , and said that he had n't heard of any recent battle ; for his part , he had never been a politician ; but thought that both parties were a little wrong ; and wished that peace would return : for he was a very old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks ' property alone . How far his garrulity might have betrayed him , could be conjectured only by one of the girls taking his hand and leading him submissively into the house . The eldest daughter said that the Captain might take the stacks at his own valuation , but trusted to his honor as a soldier , and as he seemed , a gentleman , to deal justly by them . There could be no crop harvested for a twelvemonth , and beggary looked them in the face . I have never beheld anything more chivalrously gallant , than the sturdy old quartermaster 's attitude . He blended in tone and face the politeness of a diplomat and the gentleness of a father . They asked him to return to the house , with his officers , when he had loaded the wagons ; for dinner was being prepared , and they hoped that Virginians could be hospitable , even to their enemies . As to the hay and fodder , none need be left ; for the Confederates had seized their horses some months before , and driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I so admired the queer gables and great brick ovens of the house , that I resolved to tie my horse , and rest under the crooked porch . The eldest young lady had taken me to be a prisoner , and was greatly astonished that the Quartermaster permitted me to go at large . She asked me to have a chair in the parlor , but when I made my appearance there , the two younger sisters fled precipitately . The old man was shaking his head sadly by the fireplace . Some logs burned on the andirons with a red flame . The furniture consisted of a mahogany sideboard , table , and chairs ,  --  ponderous in pattern ; and a series of family portraits , in a sprawling style of art , smirked and postured on the wall . The floor was bare , but shone by reason of repeated scrubbing , and the black mantel-piece was a fine specimen of colonial carving in the staunchest of walnut-wood . Directly the two younger girls  --  though the youngest must have been twenty years of age  --  came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They sat a little distance apart , and occasionally nodded or signalled like school children . " Wish you would stop , Bell ! " said one of these misses ,  --  whose flaxen hair was plastered across her eyebrows , and who was very tall and slender . " See if I do n't tell on you , " said the other ,  --  a dark miss with roguish eyes and fat , plump figure , and curls that shook ever so merrily about her shoulders . " Declar ' I never said so , if he asks me ; declar ' I will . " " Tell on you ,  --  you see ! Wo n't he be jealous ? How he will car ' on ! " I made out that these young ladies were intent upon publishing their obligations to certain sweethearts of theirs , who , as it afterward seemed , were in the army at Manassas Junction . I said to the curly-haired miss , that she was endangering the life of her enamored ; for it would become an object with all the anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man roused up here , and remarked that his health certainly was declining ; but he hoped to survive a while longer for the sake of his children ; that he was no politician , and always said that the negroes were very ungrateful people . He caught his daughter 's eye finally , and cowered stupidly , nodding at the fire . I remarked to the eldest young woman ,  --  called Prissy ( Priscilla ) by her sister ,  --  that the country hereabout was pleasantly wooded . She said , in substance , that every part of Virginia was beautiful , and that she did not wish to survive the disgrace of the old commonwealth . " Become right down hateful since Yankees invaded it ! " exclaimed Miss Bell . " Some Yankee 's handsome sister , " said Miss Bessie , the proprietor of the curls , " think some Yankees puffick gentlemen ! " " Oh , you traitor ! " said the other ,  --  " wish Henry heard you say that ! " Miss Bell intimated that she should take the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her good judgment . Priscilla now begged to be excused for a moment , as , since the flight of the negro property , the care of the table had devolved mainly upon her . A single aged servant , too feeble or too faithful to decamp , still attended to the menial functions , and two mulatto children remained to relieve them of light labor . She was a dignified , matronly young lady , and , as one of the sisters informed me , plighted to a Major in the Confederate service . The others chattered flippantly for an hour , and said that the old place was dreadfully lonesome of late . Miss Bell was sure she should die if another winter , similar to the last , occurred . She loved company , and had always found it so lively in Loudon before ; whereas she had positively been but twice to a neighbor 's for a twelvemonth , and had quite forgotten the road to the mill . She said , finally , that , rather than undergo another such isolation , she would become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether wedded to the idea of her lover 's . " Would n't she tell Henry ? and should n't she write to Jeems ? and oh , Bessie , you would not dare to repeat that before him . " In short , I was at first amused , and afterwards annoyed , by this young lady , whereas the roguish-eyed miss improved greatly upon acquaintance . After a while , Captain Kingwalt came in , trailing his spurs over the floor , and leaving sunshine in his wake . There was something galvanic in his gentleness , and infectious in his merriment . He told them at dinner of his own daughters on the Brandywine , and invented stories of Fogg 's courtships , till that young gentleman first blushed , and afterward dropped his plate . Our meal was a frugal one , consisting mainly of the ducks referred to , some vegetables , corn-bread , and coffee made of wasted rye . There were neither sugar , spices , nor tea , on the premises , and the salt before us was the last in the dwelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt , and Fogg volunteered to bring the same to the house , whereat the Captain teased him till he left the table . At this time , a little boy , who was ostensibly a waiter , cried : " Miss Prissy , soldiers is climbin ' in de hog-pen . " " I knew we should lose the last living thing on the property , " said this young lady , much distressed . The Captain went to the door , and found three strolling Bucktails looking covetously at the swine . They were a little discomposed at his appearance , and edged off suspiciously . " Halt ! " said the old man in his great voice , " where are you men going ? " " Just makin ' reconnoissance , " said one of the freebooters ; " s'pose a feller has a right to walk around , hai n't he ? " " Not unless he has a pass , " said the Quartermaster ; " have you written permission to leave camp ? " " Left'nant s'posed we might . Do n't know as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regiment . " " It is my business , as an officer of the United States , to see that no soldier strays from camp unauthorizedly , or depredates upon private property . I will take your names , and report you , first for straggling , secondly for insolence ! " " Put to it , Bill ! " said the speaker of the foragers ; " run , Bob ! go it hearties ! " And they took to their heels , cleared a pair of fences , and were lost behind some outbuildings . The Captain could be harsh as well as generous , and was about mounting his horse impulsively , to overtake and punish the fugitives , when Priscilla begged him to refrain , as an enforcement of discipline on his part might bring insult upon her helpless household . I availed myself of a pause in the Captain 's wrath , to ask Miss Priscilla if she would allow me to lodge in the dwelling . Five nights ' experience in camp had somewhat reduced my enthusiasm , and I already wearied of the damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bivouac . The young lady assented willingly , as she stated that the presence of a young man would both amuse and protect the family . For several nights she had not slept , and had imagined footsteps on the porch and the drawing of window-bolts . There was a bed , formerly occupied by her brother , that I might take , but must depend upon rather laggard attendance . I had the satisfaction , therefore , of seeing the Captain and retinue mount their horses , and wave me a temporary good by . Poor Fogg looked back so often and so seriously that I expected to see him fall from the saddle . The young ladies were much impressed with the Captain 's manliness , and Miss Bell wondered how such a puffick gentleman could reconcile himself to the Yankee cause . She had felt a desire to speak to him upon that point as she was sure he was of fine stock , and entirely averse to the invasion of such territory as that of dear old Virginia . There was something in his manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nameless for the present ; but the " nameless " was , of course , young , handsome , and so brave . I ruthlessly dissipated her theory of the Captain 's origin , by stating that he was of humble German descent , so far as I knew , and had probably never beheld Virginia till preceded by the bayonets of his neighbors . After tea Miss Bessie produced a pitcher of rare cider , that came from a certain mysterious quarter of the cellar . A chessboard was forthcoming at a later hour , when we amused ourselves with a couple of games , facetiously dubbing our chessman Federals and Confederates . Miss Bell , meanwhile , betook herself to a diary , wherein she minutely related the incidents and sentiments of successive days . The quantity of words underscored in the same autobiography would have speedily exhausted the case of italics , if the printer had obtained it . I was so beguiled by these patriarchal people , that I several times asked myself if the circumstances were real . Was I in a hostile country , surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this evening portions of an historic era , and the ground about me to be commemorated by bloodshed ? Was this , in fact , revolution , and were these simple country girls and their lovers revolutionists ? The logs burned cheerily upon the hearth , and the ancestral portraits glowered contemplatively from the walls . Miss Prissy looked dreamily into the fire , and the old man snored wheezily in a corner . A gray cat purred in Miss Bell 's lap , and Miss Bessie was writing some nonsense in my note-book . A sharp knock fell upon the door , and something that sounded like the butt of a musket shook the porch without . The girls turned pale , and I think that Miss Bessie seized my arm and clung to it . I think also , that Miss Bell attempted to take the other arm , to which I demurred . " Those brutal soldiers again ! " said Priscilla , faintly . " I think one of the andirons has fallen down , darter ! " said the old man , rousing up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sure shall die if it 's a man . " I opened the door after a little pause , when a couple of rough privates in uniform confronted me . " We 're two guards that General Meade sent to protect the house and property , " said the tallest of these men ; " might a feller come in and warm his feet ! " I understood at once that the Quartermaster had obtained these persons ; and the other man coming forward , said  --  " I fetched some coffee over , and a bag o ' salt , with Corporal Fogg 's compliments . " They deposited their muskets in a corner , and balanced their boots on the fender . Nothing was said for a time . " Did you lose yer poultry ? " said the tall man , at length . " All , " said Miss Priscilla . " Fellers loves poultry ! " said the man , smacking his lips . " Did you lose yer sheep ? " said the same man , after a little silence . " The Bucktails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mill , " said Miss Priscilla . " Them Bucktails great fellers , " said the tall man ; " them Bucktails awful on sheep : they loves ' em so ! " He relapsed again for a few minutes , when he continued : " You do n't like fellers to bag yer poultry and sheep , do you ? " Miss Priscilla replied that it was both dishonest and cruel . Miss Bell intimated that none but Yankees would do it . " P'raps not , " said the tall soldier , drily ; " did you ever grub on fat pork , Miss ? No ? Did you ever gnaw yer hard tack after a spell o ' sickness , and a ten-hour march ? No ? P'raps you might like a streak o ' mutton arterwards ! P'raps you might take a notion for a couple o ' chickens or so ! No ? How 's that , Ike ? What do you think , pardner ? ( to me ) I ai n't over and above cruel , mum . I do n't think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , gosh hang it , I think I would bag a chicken any day ! I say that above board . Hey , Ike ? " When the tall man and his inferior satellite had warmed their boots till they smoked , they rose , recovered their muskets , and bowed themselves into the yard . Soon afterward I bade the young ladies good night , and repaired to my room . The tall man and his associate were pacing up and down the grass-plot , and they looked very cold and comfortless , I thought . I should have liked to obtain for them a draught of cider , but prudently abstained ; for every man in the army would thereby become cognizant of its existence . So I placed my head once more upon a soft pillow , and pitied the chilled soldiers who slept upon the turf . I thought of Miss Bessie with her roguish eyes , and wondered what themes were now engrossing her . I asked myself if this was the romance of war , and if it would bear relating to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the wheezy gentleman down-stairs . In fine , I was a little sentimental , somewhat reflective , and very drowsy . So , after a while , processions of freebooting soldiers , foraging Quartermasters , deaf gentlemen , Fogg 's regiment , and multitudes of ghosts from Manassas , drifted by in my dreams . And , in the end , Miss Bessie 's long curls brushed into my eyes , and I found the morning , ruddy as her cheeks , blushing at the window . CHAPTER V. WHAT A MARCH IS IN FACT . I found at breakfast , that Miss Bessie had been placed beside me , and I so far forgot myself as to forget all other persons at the table . Miss Priscilla asked to be helped to the corn-bread , and I deposited a quantity of the same upon Miss Bessie 's plate . Miss Bell asked if I did not love dear old Virginia , and I replied to Miss Bessie that it had lately become very attractive , and that , in fact , I was decidedly rebellious in my sympathy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man darkly mooted as " Henry , " and hoped that he would be disfigured  --  not killed  --  at the earliest engagement . The deaf old gentleman bristled up here and asked who had been killed at the recent engagement . There was a man named Jeems Lee ,  --  a distant connection of the Lightfoots ,  --  not the Hampshire Lightfoots , but the Fauquier Lightfoots ,  --  who had distinctly appeared to the old gentleman for several nights , robed in black , and carrying a coffin under his arm . Since I had mentioned his name , he recalled the circumstance , and hoped that Jeems Lightfoot had not disgraced his ancestry . Nevertheless , the deaf gentleman was not to be understood as expressing any opinion upon the merits of the war . For his part he thought both sides a little wrong , and the crops were really in a dreadful state . The negroes were very ungrateful people and property should be held sacred by all belligerents . At this point he caught Miss Priscilla 's eye , and was transfixed with conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Bessie 's feet ,  --  very pretty feet they were !  --  which expressive but not very refined method of correspondence caused her to blush to the eyes . Miss Bell , noticing the same , was determined to tell ' Henry ' at once , and I hoped in my heart that she would set out for Manassas to further that purpose . The door opened here , and the rubicund visage of Mr. Fogg appeared like the head of the Medusa . He said that ' Captain ' had ordered the blue roan to be saddled and brought over to me , but I knew that this was a cunning device on his part , to revisit the dwelling . Miss Bell , somehow caught the idea that Fogg was enamored of her , and the poor fellow was subjected to a volley of tender innuendos and languishing glances , that by turn mortified and enraged him . I bade the good people adieu at eight o'clock , promising to return for dinner at five ; and Miss Bessie accompanied me to the lane , where I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasp of the hand . One of her rings had somehow adhered to my finger , which Fogg remarked with a bilious expression of countenance . I had no sooner got astride of the blue roan than he darted off like the wind , and subjected me to great terror , alternating to chagrin , when I turned back and beheld all the young ladies waving their handkerchiefs . They evidently thought me an unrivalled equestrian . I rode to a picket post two miles from the mill , passing over the spot where the Confederate soldier had fallen . The picket consisted of two companies or one hundred and sixty men . Half of them were sitting around a fire concealed in the woods , and the rest were scattered along the edges of a piece of close timber . I climbed a lookout-tree by means of cross-strips nailed to the trunk , and beheld from the summit a long succession of hazy hills , valleys , and forests , with the Blue Ridge Mountains bounding the distance , like some mighty monster , enclosing the world in its coils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Lieutenant obligingly pointed out to me the curling smoke of their pickets , a few miles away . The cleft of Manassas was plainly visible , and I traced the line of the Gap Railway to its junction with the Orange and Alexandria road , below Bull Run . For aught that I knew , some concealed observer might now be watching me from the pine-tops on the nearest knoll . Some rifleman might be running his practised eye down the deadly groove , to topple me from my perch , and send me crashing through the boughs . The uncertainty , the hazard , the novelty of my position had at this time an indescribable charm : but subsequent exposures dissipated the romance and taught me the folly of such adventures . The afternoon went dryly by : for a drizzling rain fell at noon ; but at four o'clock I saddled the blue roan and went to ride with Fogg . We retraced the road to Colonel T  --   --  s , and crossing a boggy brook , turned up the hills and passed toward the Potomac . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrations indicated keen perception and clever comprehension . He so amused me on this particular occasion that I quite forgot my engagement for dinner , and unwittingly strolled beyond the farthest brigade . Suddenly , we heard a bugle-call from the picket-post before us , and , at the same moment , the drums beat from the camp behind . Our horses pricked up their ears and Fogg stared inquiringly . As we turned back we heard approaching hoofs and the blue roan exhibited intentions of running away . I pulled his rein in vain . He would neither be soothed nor commanded . A whole company of cavalry closed up with him at length , and the sabres clattered in their scabbards as they galloped toward camp at the top of their speed . With a spring that almost shook me from the saddle and drove the stirrups flying from my feet , the blue roan dashed the dust into the eyes of Fogg , and led the race . Not the wild yager on his gait to perdition , rode so fearfully . Trees , bogs , huts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nag rose to my nostrils and at every leap I seemed vaulting among the spheres . I speak thus flippantly now , of what was then the agony of death . I grasped the pommel of my saddle , mechanically winding the lines about my wrist , and clung with the tenacity of sin clutching the world . Some soldiers looked wonderingly from the wayside , but did not heed my shriek of " stop him , for God 's sake ! " A ditch crossed the lane ,  --  deep and wide ,  --  and I felt that my moment had come : with a spring that seemed to break thew and sinew , the blue roan cleared it , pitching upon his knees , but recovered directly and darted onward again . I knew that I should fall headlong now , to be trampled by the fierce horsemen behind , but retained my grasp though my heart was choking me . The camps were in confusion as I swept past them . A sharp clearness of sense and thought enabled me to note distinctly the minutest occurrences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying knapsacks , drummer-boys beating music that I had whistled in many a ramble ,  --  field-officers shouting orders from their saddles , and cannon limbered up as if ready to move ,  --  tents taken down and teams waiting to be loaded ; all the evidences of an advance , that I alas should never witness , lying bruised and mangled by the roadside . A cheer saluted me as I passed some of Meade 's regiments . " It is the scout that fetched the orders for an advance ! " said several , and one man remarked that " that feller was the most reckless rider he had ever beheld . " The crisis came at length : a wagon had stopped the way ; my horse in turning it , stepped upon a stake , and slipping rolled heavily upon his side , tossing me like an acrobat , over his head , but without further injury than a terrible nervous shock and a rent in my pantaloons . I employed a small boy to lead the blue roan to Captain Kingwalt 's quarters , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the fields . General McCall responded to my salute ; he rode in the advance . The Quartermaster 's party was loading the tents and utensils . The rain fell smartly as dusk deepened into night , and the brush tents now deserted by the soldiers , were set on fire . Being composed of dry combustible material , they burned rapidly and with an intense flame . The fields in every direction were revealed , swarming with men , horses , batteries , and wagons . Some of the regiments began the march in silence ; others sang familiar ballads as they moved in column . A few , riotously disposed , shrieked , whistled , and cheered . The standards were folded ; the drums did not mark time ; the orders were few and short . The cannoneers sat moodily upon the caissons , and the cavalry-men walked their horses sedately . Although fifteen thousand men comprised the whole corps , each of its three brigades would have seemed as numerous to a novice . The teams of each brigade closed up the rear , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside its own wagons . When the troops were fairly under way , and the brush burning along from continuous miles of road , the effect was grand beyond all that I had witnessed . The country people gathered in fright at the cottage doors , and the farm-dogs bayed dismally at the unwonted scene . I refused to ride the blue roan again , but transferred my saddle to a team horse that appeared to be given to a sort of equine somnambulism , and once or twice attempted to lie down by the roadside . At nine o'clock I set out with Fogg , who slipped a flask of spirits into my haversack . Following the tardy movement of the teams , we turned our faces toward Washington . I was soon wet to the skin , and my saddle cushion was soaking with water . The streams crossing the road were swollen with rain , and the great team wheels clogged on the slimy banks . We were sometimes delayed a half hour by a single wagon , the storm beating pitilessly in our faces the while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fence rails in the vicinity , and some of the more indurated sat round the fagots and gamed with cards . Cold , taciturn , miserable , I thought of the quiet farm , house , the ruddy hearth-place , and the smoking supper . I wondered if the roguish eyes were not a little sad , and the trim feet a little restless , the chessmen somewhat stupid , and the good old house a trifle lonesome . Alas ! the intimacy so pleasantly commenced , was never to be renewed . With the thousand and one airy palaces that youth builds and time annihilates , my first romance of war towered to the stars in a day , and crumbled to earth in a night . At two o'clock in the morning we halted at Metropolitan Mills , on the Alexandria and Leesburg turnpike . A bridge had been destroyed below , and the creek was so swollen that neither artillery nor cavalry could ford it . The meadows were submerged and the rain still descended in torrents . The chilled troops made bonfires of some new panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some pigs , that betrayed their whereabouts by inoportune whines and grunts , were speedily confiscated , slaughtered , and spitted . We erected our tarpaulin in a ploughed field , and Fogg laid some sharp rails upon the ground to make us a dry bed . Skyhiski fried a quantity of fresh beef , and boiled some coffee ; but while we ate heartily , theorizing as to the destination of the corps , the poor Captain was terribly shaken by his ague . I woke in the morning with inflamed throat , rheumatic limbs , and every indication of chills and fever . Fogg whispered to me at breakfast that two men of Reynold 's brigade had died during the night , from fatigue and exposure . He advised me to push forward to Washington and await the arrival of the division , as , unused to the hardships of a march , I might , after another day 's experience , become dangerously ill . I set out at five o'clock , resolving to ford the creek , resume the turnpike , and reach Long Bridge at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse at every step sank to the fetlocks , I travelled along the brink of the stream till I finally reached a place that seemed to be shallow . Bracing myself firmly in the saddle , I urged my unwilling horse into the waters , and emerged half drowned on the other side . It happened , however , that I had crossed only a branch of the creek and gained an island . The main channel was yet to be attempted , and I saw that it was deep , broad , and violent . I followed the margin despairingly for a half-mile , when I came to a log footbridge , where I dismounted and swam my horse through the turbulent waters . I had now so far diverged from the turnpike that I was at a loss to recover it , but straying forlornly through the woods , struck a wagon track at last , and pursued it hopefully , until , to my confusion , it resolved itself to two tracks , that went in contrary directions . My horse preferred taking to the left , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felled trees , beyond which the traces did not go . Returning , weak and bewildered , I adopted the discarded route , which led me to a worm-fence at the edge of the woods . A house lay some distance off , but a wheat-field intervened , and I might bring the vengeance of the proprietor upon me by invading his domain . There was no choice , however ; so I removed the rails , and rode directly across the wheat to some negro quarters , a little removed from the mansion . They were deserted , all save one , where a black boy was singing some negro hymns in an uproarious manner . The words , as I made them out , were these :  --  " Stephen came a runnin ' , His Marster fur to see ; But Gabriel says he is not yar ' ; He gone to Calvary ! O ,  --  O ,  --  Stephen , Stephen , Fur to see ; Stephen , Stephen , get along up Calvary ! " I learned from this person two mortifying facts ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my journey , and that the morrow was Sunday . War , alas ! knows no Sabbaths , and the negro said , apologetically  --  " I was a seyin ' some ole hymns , young Mars'r . Sence dis yer war we do n't have no more meetin 's , and a body mos ' forgits his pra'rs . Dere hai n't been no church in all Fairfax , sah , fur nigh six months . " Washington was nineteen miles distant , and another creek was to be forded before gaining the turnpike . The negro sauntered down the lane , and opened the gate for me . " You jes keep from de creek , take de mill road , and enqua ' as ye get furder up , " said he ; " it 's mighty easy , sah , an ' you ca n't miss de way . " I missed the way at once , however , by confounding the mill road with the mill lane , and a shaggy dog that lay in a wagon shed pursued me about a mile . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nothing human was to be seen in any direction . I came to a crumbling negro cabin after two plodding hours , and , seeing a figure flit by the window , called aloud for information . Nobody replied , and when , dismounting , I looked into the den , it was , to my confusion , vacant . The soil , hereabout , was of a sterile red clay , spotted with scrub cedars . Country more bleak and desolate I have never known , and when , at noon , the rain ceased , a keen wind blew dismally across the barriers . I reached a turnpike at length , and , turning , as I thought , toward Alexandria , goaded my horse into a canter . An hour 's ride brought me to a wretched hamlet , whose designation I inquired of a cadaverous old woman  --  " Drainesville , " said she . " Then I am not upon the Alexandria turnpike ? " " No . You 're sot for Leesburg . This is the Georgetown and Chain Bridge road . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed Chain Bridge at five o'clock , and halted at Kirkwood 's at seven . After dinner , falling in with the manager of the Washington Sunday morning Chronicle , I penned , at his request , a few lines relative to the movements of the Reserves ; and , learning in the morning that they had arrived at Alexandria , set out on horseback for that city . Many hamlets and towns have been destroyed during the war . But , of all that in some form survive , Alexandria has most suffered . It has been in the uninterrupted possession of the Federals for twenty-two months , and has become essentially a military city . Its streets , its docks , its warehouses , its dwellings , and its suburbs , have been absorbed to the thousand uses of war . I was challenged thrice on the Long Bridge , and five times on the road , before reaching the city . I rode under the shadows of five earthworks , and saw lines of white tents sweeping to the horizon . Gayly caparisoned officers passed me , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops , ambulances , and batteries , sped along the line of railway , toward the rendezvous at Alexandria . A wagoner , looking forlornly at his splintered wheels ; a slovenly guard , watching some bales of hay ; a sombre negro , dozing upon his mule ; a slatternly Irish woman gossiping with a sergeant at her cottage door ; a sutler in his " dear-born , " running his keen eye down the limbs of my beast ; a spruce civilian riding for curiosity ; a gray-haired gentleman , in a threadbare suit , going to camp on foot , to say good by to his boy ,  --  these were some of the personages that I remarked , and each was a study , a sermon , and a story . The Potomac , below me , was dotted with steamers and shipping . The bluffs above were trodden bare , and a line of dismal marsh bordered some stagnant pools that blistered at their bases . At points along the river-shore , troops were embarking on board steamers ; transports were taking in tons of baggage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water-line with locomotive engines and burden carriages ; there , a brig , shipping artillery horses by a steam derrick , that lifted them bodily from the shore and deposited them in the hold of the vessel . Steamers , from whose spacious saloons the tourist and the bride have watched the picturesque margin of the Hudson , were now black with clusters of rollicking volunteers , who climbed into the yards , and pitched headlong from the wheel-houses . The " grand movement , " for which the people had waited so long , and which McClellan had promised so often , was at length to be made . The Army of the Potomac was to be transferred to Fortress Monroe , at the foot of the Chesapeake , and to advance by the peninsula of the James and the York , upon the city of Richmond . I rode through Washington Street , the seat of some ancient residences , and found it lined with freshly arrived troops . The grave-slabs in a fine old churchyard were strewn with weary cavalry-men , and they lay in some side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with idle house-girls ; some courtesans flaunted in furs and ostrich feathers , through a group of coarse engineers ; some sergeants of artillery , in red trimmings , and caps gilded with cannon , were reining their horses to leer at some ladies , who were taking the air in their gardens ; and at a wide place in the street , a Provost-Major was manoeuvring some companies , to the sound of the drum and fife . There was much drunkenness , among both soldiers and civilians ; and the people of Alexandria were , in many cases , crushed and demoralized by reason of their troubles . One man of this sort led me to a sawmill , now run by Government , and pointed to the implements . " I bought ' em and earned ' em , " he said . " My labor and enterprise set ' em there ; and while my mill and machinery are ruined to fill the pockets o ' Federal sharpers , I go drunk , ragged , and poor about the streets o ' my native town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get to her . I wish to h  --   --  l I was dead . " Further inquiry developed the facts that my acquaintance had been a thriving builder , who had dotted all Northeastern Virginia with evidences of his handicraft . At the commencement of the war , he took certain contracts from the Confederate government , for the construction of barracks at Richmond and Manassas Junction ; returning inopportunely to Alexandria , he was arrested , and kept some time in Capitol-Hill prison ; he had not taken the oath of allegiance , consequently , he could obtain no recompense for the loss of his mill property . Domestic misfortunes , happening at the same time , so embittered his days that he resorted to dissipation . Alexandria is filled with like ruined people ; they walk as strangers through their ancient streets , and their property is no longer theirs to possess , but has passed into the hands of the dominant nationalists . My informant pointed out the residences of many leading citizens : some were now hospitals , others armories and arsenals ; others offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few people that remained upon their properties , obtained partial immunity , by courting the acquaintance of Federal officers , and , in many cases , extending the hospitalities of their homes to the invaders . I do not know that any Federal functionary was accused of tyranny , or wantonness , but these things ensued , as the natural results of civil war ; and one 's sympathies were everywhere enlisted for the poor , the exiled , and the bereaved . My dinner at the City Hotel was scant and badly prepared . I gave a negro lad who waited upon me a few cents , but a burly negro carver , who seemed to be his father , boxed the boy 's ears and put the coppers into his pocket . The proprietor of the place had voluntarily taken the oath of allegiance , and had made more money since the date of Federal occupation than during his whole life previously . He said to me , curtly , that if by any chance the Confederates should reoccupy Alexandria , he could very well afford to relinquish his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests by a retired way to the drinking-rooms . Here , with the gas burning at a taper point , cobblers , cocktails , and juleps were mixed stealthily and swallowed in the darkness . The bar was like a mint to the proprietor ; he only feared discovery and prohibition . It would not accord with the chaste pages of this narrative to tell how some of the noblest residences in Alexandria had been desecrated to licentious purposes ; nor how , by night , the parlors of cosey homes flamed with riot and orgie . I stayed but a little time , having written an indiscreet paragraph in the Washington Chronicle , for which I was pursued by the War Department , and the management of my paper , lacking heart , I went home in a pet . CHAPTER VI . DOWN THE CHESAPEAKE . Disappointed in the unlucky termination of my adventures afield , I now looked ambitiously toward New York . As London stands to the provinces , so stands the empire city to America . Its journals circulate by hundreds of thousands ; its means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of every young American 's aspiration , and the New Bohemia for the restless , the brilliant , and the industrious . It seemed a great way off when I first beheld it , but I did not therefore despair . Small matters of news that I gathered in my modest city , obtained space in the columns of the great metropolitan journal , the  --   --  . After a time I was delegated to travel in search of special incidents , and finally , when the noted Tennessee Unionist , " Parson " Brownlow , journeyed eastward , I joined his suite , and accompanied him to New York . The dream of many months now came to be realized . A correspondent on the  --   --  ' s staff had been derelict , and I was appointed to his division . His horse , saddle , field-glasses , blankets , and pistols were to be transferred , and I was to proceed without delay to Fortress Monroe , to keep with the advancing columns of McClellan . At six in the morning I embarked ; at eleven I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my friends ; at three o'clock I dismounted at Baltimore , and at five was gliding down the Patapsco , under the shadows of Fort Federal Hill , and the white walls of Fort McHenry . The latter defence is renowned for its gallant resistance to a British fleet in 1813 , and the American national anthem , " The Star-Spangled Banner , " was written to commemorate that bombardment . Fort Carroll , a massive structure of hewn stone , with arched bomb-proof and three tiers of mounted ordnance , its smooth walls washed by the waves , and its unfinished floors still ringing with the trowel and the adze ,  --  lies some miles below , at a narrow passage in the stream . Below , the shores diverge , and at dusk we were fairly in the Chesapeake , under steam and sail , speeding due southward . The Adelaide was one of a series of boats making daily trips between Baltimore and Old Point . Fourteen hours were required to accomplish the passage , and we were not to arrive till seven o'clock next morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but many passengers were obliged to sleep upon sofas or the cabin floor . These boats monopolized the civil traffic between the North and the army , although they were reputed to be owned and managed by Secessionists . None were allowed to embark unless provided with Federal passes ; but there were , nevertheless , three or four hundred people on board . About one fourth of these were officers and soldiers ; one half sutlers , traders , contractors , newsmen , and idle civilians , anxious to witness a battle , or stroll over the fields of Big Bethel , Lee 's Mills , Yorktown , Gloucester , Williamsburg , or West Point ; the rest were females on missions of mercy , on visits to sons , brothers , and husbands , and on the way to their homes at Norfolk , Suffolk , or Hampton . Some of these were citizens of Richmond , who believed that the Federals would occupy the city in a few days , and enable them to resume their professions and homes . The lower decks were occupied by negroes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that littered the hold and steerage , I noticed scores of box coffins for the removal of corpses from the field to the North . There were quantities of spirits , consigned mainly to Quartermasters , but evidently the property of certain Shylocks , who watched the barrels greedily . An embalmer was also on board , with his ghostly implements . He was a sallow man , shabbily attired , and appeared to look at all the passengers as so many subjects for the development of his art . He was called " Doctor " by his admirers , and conversed in the blandest manner of the triumphs of his system . " There are certain pretenders , " he said , " who are at this moment imposing upon the Government . I regret that it is necessary to repeat it , but the fact exists that the Government is the prey of harpies . And in the art of which I am an humble disciple ,  --  that of injecting , commonly called embalming ,  --  the frauds are most deplorable . There was Major Montague ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject that any Professor would have beautifully preserved ,  --  a subject that one esteems it a favor to obtain ,  --  a subject that I in particular would have been proud to receive ! But what were the circumstances ? I do assure you that a person named Wigwart ,  --  who I have since ascertained to be a veterinary butcher ; in plain language , a doctor of horses and asses ,  --  imposed upon the relatives of the deceased , obtained the body , and absolutely ruined it !  --  absolutely mangled it ! I may say , shamefully disfigured it ! He was a man , sir , six feet two ,  --  about your height , I think ! ( to a bystander . ) About your weight , also ! Indeed quite like you ! And allow me to say that , if you should fall into my hands , I would leave your friends no cause for offence ! ( Here the bystander trembled perceptibly , and I thought that the doctor was about to take his life . ) Well ! I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the process , narrated with horrible circumstantiality . A fluid holding in solution pounded glass and certain chemicals , was , by the doctor 's " system , " injected into the bloodvessels , and the subject at the same time bled at the neck . The body thus became hard and stony , and would retain its form for years . He had , by his account , experimented for a lifetime , and said that little " Willie , " the son of President Lincoln , had been so preserved that his fond parents must have enjoyed his decease . It seemed to me that the late lamented practitioners , Messrs . Burke and Hare , were likely to fade into insignificance , beside this new light of science . I went upon deck for some moments , and marked the beating of the waves ; the glitter of sea-lights pulsing on the ripples ; the sweep of belated gulls through the creaking rigging ; the dark hull of a passing vessel with a grinning topmast lantern ; the vigilant pilot , whose eyes glared like a fiend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the panting screw threw against the cabin windows ; the flap of fishes caught in the threads of moonlight ; the depths over which one bent , peering half wistfully , half abstractedly , almost crazily , till he longed to drop into their coolness , and let the volumes of billow roll musically above him . A woman approached me , as I stood against the great anchor , thus absorbed . She had a pale , thin face , and was scantily clothed , and spoke with a distrustful , timorous voice :  --  " You do n't know the name of the surgeon-general , do you sir ! " " At Washington , ma'am ? " " No , sir ; at Old Point . " I offered to inquire of the Captain : but she stopped me , agitatedly . " It 's of no consequence , " she said ,  --  " that is , it is of great consequence to me ; but perhaps it would be best to wait . " I answered , as obligingly as I could , that any service on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , sir , " she said , after a pause , " I am going to Williamsburg , to  --  find  --  the  --  the body  --  of my  --  boy . " Here her speech was broken , and she put a thin , white hand tremulously to her eyes . I thought that any person in the Federal service would willingly assist her , and said so . " He was not a Federal soldier , sir . He was a Confederate ! " This considerably altered the chances of success , and I was obliged to undeceive her somewhat . " I am sure it was not my fault , " she continued , " that he joined the Rebellion . You do n't think they 'll refuse to let me take his bones to Baltimore , do you , sir ? He was my oldest boy , and his brother , my second son , was killed at Ball 's Bluff : He was in the Federal service . I hardly think they will refuse me the poor favor of laying them in the same grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the remoteness of the field , and of the expense attending the recovery of any remains , particularly those of the enemy , that , left hastily behind in retreat , were commonly buried in trenches without headboard or record . She said , sadly , that she had very little money , and that she could barely afford the journey to the Fortress and return . But she esteemed her means well invested if her object could be attained . " They were both brave boys , sir ; but I could never get them to agree politically . William was a Northerner by education , and took up with the New England views , and James was in business at Richmond when the war commenced . So he joined the Southern army . It 's a sad thing to know that one 's children died enemies , is n't it ? And what troubles me more than all , sir , is that James was at Ball 's Bluff where his brother fell . It makes me shudder to think , sometimes , that his might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor creature here was painful to behold . I spoke soothingly and encouragingly , but with a presentiment that she must be disappointed . While I was speaking the supper-bell rang , and I proposed to get her a seat at the table . " No , thank you , " she replied , " I shall take no meals on the vessel ; I must travel economically , and have prepared some lunch that will serve me . Good by , sir ! " Poor mothers looking for dead sons ! God help them ! I have met them often since ; but the figure of that pale , frail creature flitting about the open deck ,  --  alone , hungry , very poor ,  --  troubles me still , as I write . I found , afterward , that she had denied herself a state-room , and intended to sleep in a saloon chair . I persuaded her to accept my berth , but a German , who occupied the same apartment , was unwilling to relinquish his bed , and I had the power only to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at the signal to assemble the men rushed to the tables like as many beasts of prey . A captain opposite me bolted a whole mackerel in a twinkling , and spread the half-pound of butter that was to serve the entire vicinity upon a single slice of bread . A sutler beside me reached his fork across my neck , and plucked a young chicken bodily , which he ate , to the great disgust of some others who were eyeing it . The waiter advanced with some steak , but before he reached the table , a couple of Zouaves dragged it from the tray , and laughed brutally at their success . The motion of the vessel caused a general unsteadiness , and it was absolutely dangerous to move one 's coffee to his lips . The inveterate hate with which corporations are regarded in America was here evidenced by a general desire to empty the ship 's larder . " Eat all you can , " said a soldier , ferociously ,  --  " fare 's amazin ' high . Must make it out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , " on a railroad or a steamboat . Cause why ? You must eat out your passage , you know ! " Among the passengers were a young officer and his bride . They had been married only a few days , and she had obtained permission to accompany him to Old Point . Very pretty , she seemed , in her travelling hat and flowing robes ; and he wore a handsome new uniform with prodigious shoulder-bars . There was a piano in the saloon , where another young lady of the party performed during the evening , and the bride and groom accompanied her with a song . It was the popular Federal parody of " Gay and Happy : " " Then let the South fling aloft what it will ,  - -  We are for the Union still ! For the Union ! For the Union ! We are for the Union still ! " The bride and groom sang alternate stanzas , and the concourse of soldiers , civilians , and females swelled the chorus . The reserve being thus broken , the young officer sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have called up the mermaids . Dancing ensued , and a soldier volunteered a hornpipe . A young man with an astonishing compass of lungs repeated something from Shakespeare , and the night passed by gleefully and reputably . One could hardly realize , in the cheerful eyes and active figures of the dance , the sad uncertainties of the time . Youth trips lightest , somehow , on the brink of the grave . The hilarities of the evening so influenced the German quartered with me , that he sang snatches of foreign ballads during most of the night , and obliged me , at last , to call the steward and insist upon his good behavior . In the gray of the morning I ventured on deck , and , following the silvery line of beach , made out the shipping at anchor in Hampton Roads . The Minnesota flag-ship lay across the horizon , and after a time I remarked the low walls and black derricks of the Rip Raps . The white tents at Hampton were then revealed , and finally I distinguished Fortress Monroe , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floating the Federal flag . As we rounded to off the quay , I studied with intense interest the scene of so many historic events . Sewall 's Point lay to the south , a stretch of woody beach , around whose western tip the dreaded Merrimac had so often moved slowly to the encounter . The spars of the Congress and the Cumberland still floated along the strand , but , like them , the invulnerable monster had become the prey of the waves . The guns of the Rip Raps and the terrible broadsides of the Federal gunboats , had swept the Confederates from Sewall 's Point ,  --  their flag and battery were gone ,  --  and farther seaward , at Willoughby Spit , some figures upon the beach marked the route of the victorious Federals to the city of Norfolk . The mouth of the James and the York were visible from the deck , and long lines of shipping stretched from each to the Fortress . The quay itself was like the pool in the Thames , a mass of spars , smoke-stacks , ensigns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famous Monitor appeared close into shore , and near at hand rose the thick body of the Galena . Long boats and flat boats went hither and thither across the blue waves : the grim ports of the men of war were open and the guns frowned darkly from their coverts ; the seamen were gathering for muster on the flagship , and drums beat from the barracks on shore ; the Lincoln gun , a fearful piece of ordnance , rose like the Sphynx from the Fortress sands , and the sodded parapet , the winding stone walls , the tops of the brick quarters within the Fort , were some of the features of a strangely animated scene , that has yet to be perpetuated upon canvas , and made historic . At eight o'clock the passengers were allowed to land , and a provost guard marched them to the Hygeia House ,  --  of old a watering-place hotel ,  --  where , by groups , they were ushered into a small room , and the oath of allegiance administered to them . The young officer who officiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad grin upon his face , and the passengers were required to assent by word and by gesture . Among those who took the oath in this way , was a very old sailor , who had been in the Federal service for the better part of his life , and whose five sons were now in the army . He called " Amen " very loudly and fervently , and there was some perceptible disposition on the part of other ardent patriots , to celebrate the occasion with three cheers . The quartermaster , stationed at the Fortress gave me a pass to go by steamer up the York to White House , and as there were three hours to elapse before departure , I strolled about the place with our agent . In times of peace , Old Point was simply a stone fortification , and one of the strongest of its kind in the world . Many years and many millions of dollars were required to build it , but it was , in general , feebly garrisoned , and was , altogether , a stupid , tedious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty and fashion of Virginia resorted to its hotel . A few cottages had grown up around it , tenanted only in " the season ; " and a little way off , on the mainland , stood the pretty village of Hampton . By a strange oversight , the South failed to seize Fortress Monroe at the beginning of the Rebellion ; the Federals soon made it the basis for their armies and a leading naval station . The battle of Big Bethel was one of the first occurrences in the vicinity . Then the dwellings of Hampton were burned and its people exiled . In rapid succession followed the naval battles in the Roads , the siege and surrender of Yorktown , the flight of the Confederates up the Peninsula to Richmond , and finally the battles of Williamsburg , and West Point , and the capture of Norfolk . These things had already transpired ; it was now the month of May ; and the victorious army , following up its vantages , had pursued the fugitives by land and water to " White House , " at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was my lot to go , and witness the turning-point of their fortunes , and their subsequent calamity and repulse . I found Old Point a weary place of resort , even in the busy era of civil war . The bar at the Hygeia House was beset with thirsty and idle people , who swore instinctively , and drank raw spirits passionately . The quantity of shell , ball , ordnance , camp equipage , and war munitions of every description piled around the fort , was marvellously great . It seemed to me that Xerxes , the first Napoleon , or the greediest of conquerors , ancient or modern , would have beheld with amazement the gigantic preparations at command of the Federal Government . Energy and enterprise displayed their implements of death on every hand . One was startled at the prodigal outlay of means , and the reckless summoning of men . I looked at the starred and striped ensign that flaunted above the Fort , and thought of Madame Roland 's appeal to the statue by the guillotine . The settlers were numbered by regiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shanties " of rough plank , and most of them were the owners of sloops , or schooners , for the transportation of freight from New York , Philadelphia , or Baltimore , to their depots at Old Point . Some possessed a dozen wagons , that plied regularly between these stores and camps . The traffic was not confined to men ; for women and children kept pace with the army , trading in every possible article of necessity or luxury . For these  --  disciples of the dime and the dollar  --  war had no terrors . They took their muck-rakes , like the man in Bunyan , and gathered the almighty coppers , from the pestilential camp and the reeking battle-field . CHAPTER VII . ON TO RICHMOND . Yorktown lies twenty-one miles northwestward from Old Point , and thither I turned my face at noon , resolving to delay my journey to " White House , " till next day morning . Crossing an estuary of the bay upon a narrow causeway , I passed Hampton ,  --  half burned , half desolate ,  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene of the battle of June 11 , 1861 . A small earthwork marks the site of Magruder 's field-pieces , and hard by the slain were buried . The spot was noteworthy to me , since Lieutenant Greble , a fellow alumnus , had perished here , and likewise , Theodore Winthrop , the gifted author of " Cecil Dreeme " and " John Brent . " The latter did not live to know his exaltation . That morning never came whereon he " woke , and found himself famous . " The road ran parallel with the deserted defences of the Confederates for some distance . The country was flat and full of swamps , but marked at intervals by relics of camps . The farm-houses were untenanted , the fences laid flat or destroyed , the fields strewn with discarded clothing , arms , and utensils . By and by , we entered the outer line of Federal parallels , and wound among lunettes , cremailleres , redoubts , and rifle-pits . Marks of shell and ball were frequent , in furrows and holes , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fifteen miles henceforward , had been touched by the shovel and the pick . My companion suggested that as much digging , concentred upon one point , would have taken the Federals to China . The sappers and miners had made their stealthy trenches , rod by rod , each morning appearing closer to their adversaries , and finally , completed their work , at less than a hundred yards from the Confederate defences . Three minutes would have sufficed from the final position , to hurl columns upon the opposing outworks , and sweep them with the bayonet . Ten days only had elapsed since the evacuation ( May 4 ) , and the siege guns still remained in some of the batteries . McClellan worshipped great ordnance , and some of his columbiads , that were mounted in the water battery , yawned cavernously through their embrasures , and might have furnished sleeping accommodations to the gunners . A few mortars stood in position by the river side , and there were Parrott , Griffin , and Dahlgren pieces in the shore batteries . However numerous and powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in either respect , to those relinquished by the revolutionists . Miniature mountain ranges they seemed , deeply ditched , and revetted with sods , fascines , hurdles , gabions or sand bags . Along the York riverside there were water batteries of surpassing beauty , that seemed , at a little distance , successions of gentle terraces . Their pieces were likewise of enormous calibre , and their number almost incredible . The advanced line of fortifications , sketched from the mouth of Warwick creek , on the South , to a point fifteen miles distant on the York : one hundred and forty guns were planted along this chain of defences ; but there were two other concentric lines , mounting , each , one hundred and twenty , and two hundred and forty guns . The remote series consisted of six forts of massive size and height , fronted by swamps and flooded meadows , with frequent creeks and ravines interposing ; sharp fraise and abattis planted against scarp and slope , pointed cruelly eastward . There were two water batteries , of six and four thirty-two columbiads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red clay bluff , was encircled by a series of immense rifled and smooth-bore pieces , including a powerful pivot-gun , that one of McClellan 's shells struck during the first day 's bombardment , and split it into fragments . At Gloucester Point , across the York river , the great guns of the Merrimac were planted , it is said , and a fleet of fire-rafts and torpedo-ships were moored in the stream . By all accounts , there could have been no less than five hundred guns behind the Confederate entrenchments , the greater portion , of course , field-pieces , and , as the defending army was composed of one hundred thousand men , we must add that number of small arms to the list of ordnance . If we compute the Federals at so high a figure ,  --  and they could scarcely have had less than a hundred thousand men afield ,  --  we must increase the enormous amount of their field , siege , and small ordnance , by the naval guns of the fleet , that stood anchored in the bay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand muskets were assembled in and around Yorktown during this memorable siege . The mind shudders to see the terrible deductions of these statistics . The monster , who wished that the world had but one neck , that he might sever it , would have gloated at such realization ! How many days or hours would have here sufficed to annihilate all the races of men ? Happily , the world was spared the spectacle of these deadly mouths at once aflame . Beautiful but awful must have been the scene , and the earth must have staggered with the shock . One might almost have imagined that man , in his ambition , had shut his God in heaven , and besieged him there . While the fortifications defending it amazed me , the village of Yorktown disappointed me . I marvelled that so paltry a settlement should have been twice made historic . Here , in the year 1783 , Lord Cornwallis surrendered his starving command to the American colonists and their French allies . But the entrenchments of that earlier day had been almost obliterated by these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his sword , was trodden bare , and dotted with ditches and ramparts ; while a small monument , that marked the event , had been hacked to fragments by the Southerners , and carried away piecemeal . Yet , strange to say , relics of the first bombardment had just been discovered , and , among them , a gold-hilted sword . I visited , in the evening , the late quarters of General Hill , a small white house with green shutters , and also the famous " Nelson House , " a roomy mansion where , of old , Cornwallis slept , and where , a few days past , Jefferson Davis and General Lee had held with Magruder , and his associates , a council of war . It had been also used for hospital purposes , but some negroes were now the only occupants . The Confederates left behind them seventy spiked and shattered cannon , some powder , and a few splintered wagons ; but in all material respects , their evacuation was thorough and creditable . Some deserters took the first tidings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national flag within the fortifications , in the gray of the morning of the 4th of May . Many negroes also escaped the vigilance of their taskmasters , and remained to welcome the victors . The fine works of Yorktown are monuments to negro labor , for they were the hewers and the diggers . Every slave-owner in Eastern Virginia was obliged to send one half of his male servants between the ages of sixteen and fifty to the Confederate camps , and they were organized into gangs and set to work . In some cases they were put to military service and made excellent sharpshooters . The last gun discharged from the town was said to have been fired by a negro . I slept on board a barge at the wharf that evening , and my dreams ran upon a thousand themes . To every American this was hallowed ground . It had been celebrated by the pencil of Trumbull , the pen of Franklin , and the eloquence of Jefferson . Scarce eighty years had elapsed since those great minds established a fraternal government ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children 's shame . Discord had stolen upon their councils and blood had profaned their shrine . I visited next day a bomb-proof postern , or subterranean passage , connecting the citadel with the outworks , and loitered about the fortifications till noon , when I took passage on the mail steamer , which left the Fortress at eleven o'clock , and reached White House at dusk the same evening . The whole river as I ascended was filled with merchant and naval craft . They made a continuous line from Old Point to the mouth of York River , and the masts and spars environing Yorktown and Gloucester , reminded one of a scene on the Mersey or the Clyde . At West Point , there was an array of shipping scarcely less formidable , and the windings of the interminably crooked Pamunkey were marked for leagues by sails , smoke-stacks , and masts . The landings and wharves were besieged by flat-boats and sloops , and Zouaves were hoisting forage and commissary stores up the red bluffs at every turn of our vessel . The Pamunkey was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up along its borders of wheat-fields and meadows , with Virginia farm-houses and negro quarters on the hilltops . Some of the houses on the river banks appeared to be tenanted by white people , but the majority had a haunted , desolate appearance , the only signs of life being strolling soldiers , who thrust their legs through the second story windows , or contemplated the river from the chimney-tops , and groups of negroes who sunned themselves on the piazza , or rushed to the margin to gaze and grin at the passing steamers . There were occasional residences not unworthy of old manorial and baronial times , and these were attended at a little distance by negro quarters of logs , arranged in rows , and provided with mud chimneys built against their gables . Few of the Northern navigable rivers were so picturesque and varied . We passed two Confederate gunboats , that had been half completed , and burned on the stocks . Their charred elbows and ribs , stared out , like the remains of some extinct monsters ; a little delay might have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the rivers and the seas . West Point was simply a tongue , or spit of land , dividing the Mattapony from the Pamunkey river at their junction ; a few houses were built upon the shallow , and some wharves , half demolished , marked the terminus of the York and Richmond railroad . A paltry water-battery was the sole defence . Below Cumberland ( a collection of huts and a wharf ) , a number of schooners had been sunk across the river , and , with the aid of an island in the middle , these constituted a rather rigid blockade . The steamboat passed through , steering carefully , but some sailing vessels that followed required to be towed between the narrow apertures . The tops only of the sunken masts could be discerned above the surface , and much time and labor must have been required to place the boats in line and sink them . Vessels were counted by scores above and below this blockade , and at Cumberland the masts were like a forest ; clusters of pontoons were here anchored in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the light-draught Federal gunboats moored in the stream . It was growing dark as we rounded to at " White House ; " the camp fires of the grand army lit up the sky , and edged the tree-boughs on the margin with ribands of silver . Some drums beat in the distance ; sentries paced the strand ; the hum of men , and the lowing of commissary cattle , were borne towards us confusedly ; soldiers were bathing in the river ; team-horses were drinking at the brink ; a throng of motley people were crowding about the landing to receive the papers and mails . I had at last arrived at the seat of war , and my ambition to chronicle battles and bloodshed was about to be gratified . At first , I was troubled to make my way ; the tents had just been pitched ; none knew the location of divisions other than their own , and it was now so dark that I did not care to venture far . After a vain attempt to find some flat-boats where there were lodgings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head-quarters , and , undergoing repeated snubbings from pert members of staff , fell in at length , with a very tall , spare , and angular young officer , who spoke broken English , and who heard my inquiries , courteously ; he stepped into General Marcy 's tent , but the Chief of Staff did not know the direction of Smith 's division ; he then repaired to Gen. Van Vleet , the chief Quartermaster , but with ill success . A party of officers were smoking under a " fly , " and some of these called to him , thus  --  " Captain ! Duke ! De Chartres ! What do you wish ? " It was , then , the Orleans Prince who had befriended me , and I had the good fortune to hear that the division , of which I was in search , lay a half mile up the river . I never spoke to the Bourbon afterward , but saw him often ; and that he was as chivalrous as he was kind , all testimony proved . A private escorted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced me to General Hancock . I was at once invited to mess with the General 's staff , and in the course of an hour felt perfectly at home . Hancock was one of the handsomest officers in the army ; he had served in the Mexican war , and was subsequently a Captain in the Quartermaster 's department . But the Rebellion placed stars in many shoulder-bars , and few were more worthily designated than this young Pennsylvanian . His first laurels were gained at Williamsburg ; but the story of a celebrated charge that won him the day 's applause , and McClellan 's encomium of the " Superb Hancock , " was altogether fictitious . The musket , not the bayonet , gave him the victory . I may doubt , in this place , that any extensive bayonet charge has been known during the war . Some have gone so far as to deny that the bayonet has ever been used at all . Hancock 's regiments were the 5th Wisconsin , 49th Pennsylvanian , 43d New York , and 6th Maine . They represented widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position where I could so eligibly study men , habits , and warfare . During the evening I fell in with the Colonel of each of these regiments , and from the conversation that ensued , I gleaned a fair idea of them all . The Wisconsin regiment was from a new and ambitious State of the Northwest . The men were rough-mannered , great-hearted farmers , wood-choppers , and tradesmen . They had all the impulsiveness of the Yankee , with less selfishness , and quite as much bravery . The Colonel was named Cobb , and he had held some leading offices in Wisconsin . A part of his life had been adventurously spent , and he had participated in the Mexican war . He was an ardent Republican in politics , and had been Speaker of a branch of the State Legislature . He was an attorney in a small county town when the war commenced , and his name had been broached for the Governorship . In person he was small , lithe , and capable of enduring great fatigue . His hair was a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not respect appearances , and his sword , as I saw , was antique and quite different in shape from the regulation weapon . He had penetrating gray eyes , and his manners were generally reserved . One had not to regard him twice to see that he was both cautious and resolute . He was too ambitious to be frank , and too passionate not to be brave . In the formula of learning he was not always correct ; but few were of quicker perception or more practical and philosophic . He might not , in an emergency , be nicely scrupulous as to means , but he never wavered in respect to objects . His will was the written law to his regiment , and I believed his executive abilities superior to those of any officer in the brigade , not excepting the General 's . The New York regiment was commanded by a young officer named Vinton . He was not more than thirty-five years of age , and was a graduate of the United States Military Academy . Passionately devoted to engineering , he withdrew from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the study of his art . Returning homeward by way of the West Indies , he visited Honduras , and projected a filibustering expedition to its shores from the States . While perfecting the design , the Rebellion commenced , and his old patron , General Scott , secured him the colonelcy of a volunteer regiment . He still cherished his scheme of " Colonization , " and half of his men were promised to accompany him . Personally , Colonel Vinton was straight , dark , and handsome . He was courteous , affable , and brave ,  --  but wedded to his peculiar views , and , as I thought , a thorough " Young American . " The Maine regiment was fathered by Colonel Burnham , a staunch old yeoman and soldier , who has since been made a General . His probity and good-nature were adjuncts of his valor , and his men were of the better class of New Englanders . The fourth regiment fell into the hands of a lawyer from Lewistown , Pennsylvania . He had been also in the Mexican war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanitary regulations of his camps . He had wells dug at every stoppage , and his tents were generally fenced and canopied with cedar arbors . General Hancock 's staff was composed of a number of young men , most of whom had been called from civil life . His brigade constituted one of three commanded by General Smith . Four batteries were annexed to the division so formed ; the entire number of muskets was perhaps eight thousand . The Chief of Artillery was a Captain Ayres , whose battery saved the three months ' army at Bull Run . It so happened that he came into the General 's during the evening , and recited the particulars of a gunboat excursion , thirty miles up the Pamunkey , wherein he had landed his men , and burned a quantity of grain , some warehouses , and shipping . I pencilled the facts at once , made up my letter , and mailed it early in the morning . CHAPTER VIII . RUSTICS IN REBELLION . At White House , I met some of the mixed Indians and negroes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream . One of these ferried me over , and the people received me obsequiously , touching their straw hats , and saying , " Sar , at your service ! " They were all anxious to hear something of the war , and asked , solicitously , if they were to be protected . Some of them had been to Richmond the previous day , and gave me some unimportant items happening in the city . I found that they had Richmond papers of that date , and purchased them for a few cents . They knew little or nothing of their own history , and had preserved no traditions of their tribe . There was , however , I understood , a very old woman extant , named " Mag , " of great repute at medicines , pow-wows , and divination . I expressed a desire to speak with her , and was conducted to a log-house , more ricketty and ruined than any of the others . About fifty half-breeds followed me in respectful curiosity , and they formed a semicircle around the cabin . The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stump of clay pipe . " Yaw 's one o ' dem Nawden soldiers , Aunt Mag ! " said my conductor . " He wants to talk wid ye . " " Sot down , honey , " said the old woman , producing a wooden stool ; " is you a Yankee , honey ? Does you want you fauchun told by de ole ' oman ? " I perceived that the daughter of the Delawares smelt strongly of fire-water , and the fumes of her calumet were most unwholesome . She was greatly disappointed that I did not require her prophetic services , and said , appealingly  --  " Why , sar , all de gen'elmen an ' ladies from Richmond has dere fauchuns told . I tells ' em true . All my fauchuns comes out true . Ai n't dat so , chillen ? " A low murmur of assent ran round the group , and I was obviously losing caste in the settlement . " Here is a dime , " said I , " that I will give you , to tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victorious in the next battle ? Will Richmond surrender within a week ? Shall I take my cigar at the Spotswood on Sunday fortnight ? " " I'se been a lookin ' into dat , " she said , cunningly ; " I'se had dreams on dat ar ' . Le'um see how de armies stand ! " She brought from the house a cup of painted earthenware containing sediments of coffee . I saw her crafty white eyes look up to mine as she muttered some jargon , and pretended to read the arrangement of the grains . " Honey , " she said , " gi ' me de money , and let de ole ' oman dream on it once mo ' ! It ai n't quite clar ' yit , young massar . Tank you , honey ! Tank you ! Let de old ' oman dream ! Let de ole ' oman dream ! " She disappeared into the house , chuckling and chattering , and the sons of the forest , loitering awhile , dispersed in various directions . As I followed my conductor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boughs to give us exit , the glare of the camp-fires broke all at once upon us . The ship-lights quivered on the water ; the figures of men moved to and fro before the fagots ; the stars peeped timorously from the vault ; the woods and steep banks were blackly shadowed in the river . Here was I , among the aborigines ; and as my dusky acquaintance sent his canoe skimming across the ripples , I thought how inexplicable were the decrees of Time and the justice of God . Two races united in these people , and both of them we had wronged . From the one we had taken lands ; from the other liberties . Two centuries had now elapsed . But the little remnant of the African and the American were to look from their Island Home upon the clash of our armies and the murder of our braves . By the 19th of May the skirts of the grand army had been gathered up , and on the 20th the march to Richmond was resumed . The troops moved along two main roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meadow Bridges , and the left to the railroad and Bottom Bridges . My division formed the right centre , and although the Chickahominy fords were but eighteen miles distant , we did not reach them for three days . On the first night we encamped at Tunstalls , a railroad-station on Black Creek ; on the second at New Cold Harbor , a little country tavern , kept by a cripple ; and on the night of the third day at Hogan 's farm , on the north hills of the Chickahominy . The railroad was opened to Despatch Station at the same time , but the right and centre were still compelled to " team " their supplies from White House . In the new position , the army extended ten miles along the Chickahominy hills ; and while the engineers were driving pile , tressel , pontoon , and corduroy bridges , the cavalry was scouring the country , on both flanks , far and wide . The advance was full of incident , and I learned to keep as far in front as possible , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many odd personages were revealed to me at the farm-houses on the way , and I studied , with curious interest , the native Virginian character . They appeared to be compounds of the cavalier and the boor . There was no old gentleman who owned a thousand barren acres , spotted with scrub timber ; who lived in a weather-beaten barn , with a multiplicity of porch and a quantity of chimney ; whose means bore no proportion to his pride , and neither to his indolence ,  --  that did not talk of his ancestry , proffer his hospitality , and defy me to an argument . I was a civilian ,  --  they had no hostility to me ,  --  but the blue-coats of the soldiers seared their eyeballs . In some cases their daughters remained upon the property ; but the sons and the negroes always fled ,  --  though in contrary directions . The old men used to peep through the windows at the passing columns ; and as their gates were wrenched from the hinges , their rails used to pry wagons out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shaft , and their barns invaded by greasy agrarians , they walked to and fro , half-weakly , half-wrathfully , but with a pluck , fortitude , and devotion that wrung my respect . Some aged negro women commonly remained , but these were rather incumbrances than aids , and they used the family meal to cook bread for the troops . An old , toothless , grinning African stood at every lane and gate , selling buttermilk and corn-cakes . Poor mortal , sinful old women ! They had worked for nothing through their three-score and ten , but avarice glared from their shrivelled pupils , and their last but greatest delight lay in the coppers and the dimes . One would have thought that they had outlived the greed of gold ; but wages deferred make the dying miserly . The lords of the manors were troubled to know the number of our troops . For several days the columns passed with their interminable teams , batteries , and adjuncts , and the old gentlemen were loth to compute us at less than several millions . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brigade ; " I declar ' to gracious , there ai n't no less than ten thousand in them ! " " Tousands an ' tousands ! " said a wondering negro at his elbow . " I wonda if dey 'll take Richmond dis yer day ? " Many of them hung white flags at their gate-posts , implying neutrality ; but nobody displayed the Federal colors . If there were any covert sympathizers with the purposes of the army , they remembered the vengeance of the neighbors and made no demonstrations . There was a prodigious number of stragglers from the Federal lines , as these were the bane of the country people . They sauntered along by twos and threes , rambling into all the fields and green-apple orchards , intruding their noses into old cabins , prying into smoke-houses , and cellars , looking at the stock in the stables , and peeping on tiptoe into the windows of dwellings . These stragglers were true exponents of Yankee character ,  --  always wanting to know ,  --  averse to discipline , eccentric in their orbits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measure of " to hum . " " Look here , Bill , I say ! " said one , with a great grin on his face ; " did you ever , neow ! I swan ! they call that a plough down in these parts . " " Devilishest people I ever see ! " said Bill , " stick their meetin ' - houses square in the woods ! Build their chimneys first and move the houses up to ' em ! All the houses breakin ' out in perspiration of porch ! All their machinery with Noah in the ark ! Pump the soil dry ! Go to sleep a milkin ' a keow ! Depend entirely on Providence and the nigger ! " There was a mill on the New Bridge road , ten miles from White House , with a tidy farm-house , stacks , and cabins adjoining . The road crossed the mill-race by a log bridge , and a spreading pond or dam lay to the left ,  --  the water black as ink , the shore sandy , and the stream disappearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with several small children , occupied the dwelling , and there remained , besides , her fat sister-in-law and four or five faithful negroes . I begged the favor of a meal and bed in the place one night , and shall not forget the hospitable table with its steaming biscuit ; the chubby baby , perched upon his high stool ; the talkative elderly woman , who took snuff at the fireplace ; the contented black-girl , who played the Hebe ; and above all , the trim , plump , pretty hostess , with her brown eyes and hair , her dignity and her fondness , sitting at the head of the board . When she poured the bright coffee into the capacious bowl , she revealed the neatest of hands and arms , and her dialect was softer and more musical than that of most Southerners . In short , I fell almost in love with her ; though she might have been a younger playmate of my mother 's , and though she was the wife of a Quartermaster in a Virginia regiment . For , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afield ; and the contact of rough soldiers , gives him a partiality for females . It must have required some courage to remain upon the farm ; but she hoped thereby to save the property from spoliation . I played a game of whist with the sister-in-law , arguing all the while ; and at nine o'clock the servant produced some hard cider , shellbarks , and apples . We drank a cheery toast : " an early peace and old fellowship ! "  --  to which the wife added a sentiment of " always welcome , " and the baby laughed at her knee . How brightly glowed the fire ! I wanted to linger for a week , a month , a year ,  --  as I do now , thinking it all over ,  --  and when I strolled to the porch ,  --  hearing the pigeons cooing at the barn ; the water streaming down the dam ; the melancholy monotony of the pine boughs ;  --  there only lacked the humming mill-wheel , and the strong grip of the miller 's hand , to fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was a time of war , when dreams are rudely broken , and mine could not last . The next day some great wheels beat down the bridge , and the teams clogged the road for miles ; the waiting teamsters saw the miller 's sheep , and the geese , chickens , and pigs , rashly exposed themselves in the barnyard ; these were killed and eaten , the mill stripped of flour and meal , and the garden despoiled of its vegetables . A quartermaster 's horse foundered , and he demanded the miller 's , giving therefor a receipt , but specifying upon the same the owner 's relation to the Rebellion ; and , to crown all , a group of stragglers , butchered the cows , and heaped the beef in their wagons to feed their regimental friends . When I presented myself , late in the afternoon , the yard and porches were filled with soldiers ; the wife sat within , her head thrown upon the window , her bright hair unbound , and her eyes red with weeping . The baby had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the fire ; the black girl cowered in a corner . " There is not bread in the house for my children , " she said ; " but I did not think they could make me shed a tear . " If there were Spartan women , as the story-books say , I wonder if their blood died with them ! I hardly think so . If I learned anything from my quiet study of this and subsequent campaigns , it was the heartlessness of war . War brutalizes ! The most pitiful become pitiless afield , and those who are not callous , must do cruel duties . If the quartermaster had not seized the horses , he would have been accountable for his conduct ; had he failed to state the miller 's disloyalty in the receipt , he would have been punished . The men were thieves and brutes , to take the meal and meat ; but they were perhaps hungry and weary , and sick of camp food ; on the whole , I became a devotee of the George Fox faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , in crises . Besides , the optimist might have seen much to admire . Individual merits were developed around me ; I saw shop-keepers and mechanics in the ranks , and they looked to be better men . Here were triumphs of engineering ; there perfections of applied ingenuity . I saw how the weakest natures girt themselves for great resolves , and how fortitude outstripped itself . It is a noble thing to put by the fear of death . It was a grand spectacle , this civil soldiery of both sections , supporting their principles , ambitions , or whatever instigated them , with their bodies ; and their bones , lie where they will , must be severed , when the plough-share some day heaves them to the ploughman . One morning a friend asked me to go upon a scout . " Where are your companies ? " said I. " There are four behind , and we shall be joined by six at Old Cold Harbor . " I saw , in the rear , filing through a belt of woods , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you command ? " said I again . " No ! the Major has charge of the scout , and his orders are secret . " I wheeled beside him , as the cavalry closed up , waved my hand to Plumley , and the girls , and went forward to the rendezvous , about six miles distant . The remaining companies of the regiment were here drawn up , watering their nags . The Major was a thick , sunburnt man , with grizzled beard , and as he saw us rounding a corner of hilly road , his voice rang out  --  " Attention ! Prepare to mount ! " Every rider sprang to his nag ; every nag walked instinctively to his place ; every horseman made fast his girths , strapped his blankets tightly , and lay his hands upon bridle-rein and pommel . " Attention ! Mount ! " The riders sprang to their seats ; the bugles blew a lively strain ; the horses pricked up their ears ; and the long array moved briskly forward , with the Captain , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined in a moment by two pieces of flying artillery , and five fresh companies of cavalry . In a moment more we were underway again , galloping due northward , and , as I surmised , toward Hanover Court House . If any branch of the military service is feverish , adventurous , and exciting , it is that of the cavalry . One 's heart beats as fast as the hoof-falls ; there is no music like the winding of the bugle , and no monotone so full of meaning as the clink of sabres rising and falling with the dashing pace . Horse and rider become one ,  --  a new race of Centaurs ,  --  and the charge , the stroke , the crack of carbines , are so quick , vehement , and dramatic , that we seem to be watching the joust of tournaments or following fierce Saladins and Crusaders again . We had ridden two hours at a fair canter , when we came to a small stream that crossed the road obliquely , and gurgled away through a sandy valley into the deepnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here diverged , running parallel with the creek , and the Major held up his sword as a signal to halt ; at the same moment the bugle blew a quick , shrill note . " There are hoof-marks here ! " grunted the Major ,  --  " five of ' em . The Dutchman has gone into the thicket . Hulloo ! " he added , precipitately  --  " there go the carbines ! " I heard , clearly , two explosions in rapid succession ; then a general discharge , as of several persons firing at once , and at last , five continuous reports , fainter , but more regular , and like the several emptyings of a revolver . I had scarcely time to note these things , and the effect produced upon the troop , when strange noises came from the woods to the right : the floundering of steeds , the cries and curses of men , and the ringing of steel striking steel . Directly the boughs crackled , the leaves quivered , and a horse and rider plunged into the road , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his face and clothing were torn with briars and branches . He was at first riding fairly upon our troops , when he beheld the uniform and standards , and with a sharp oath flung up his sword and hands . " I surrender ! " he said ; " I give in ! Do n't shoot ! " The scores of carbines that were levelled upon him at once dropped to their rests at the saddles ; but some unseen avenger had not heeded the shriek ; a ball whistled from the woods , and the man fell from his cushion like a stone . In another instant , the German sergeant bounded through the gap , holding his sabre aloft in his right hand ; but the left hung stiff and shattered at his side , and his face was deathly white . He glared an instant at the dead man by the roadside , leered grimly , and called aloud  --  " Come on , Major ! Dis vay ! Dere are a squad of dem ahead ! " The bugle at once sounded a charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Forward ! " I reined aside , intuitively , and the column dashed hotly past me . With a glance at the heap of mortality littering the way , I spurred my nag sharply , and followed hard behind . The riderless horse seemed to catch the fever of the moment , and closed up with me , leaving his master the solitary tenant of the dell . For perhaps three miles we galloped like the wind , and my brave little traveller overtook the hindmost of the troop , and retained the position . Thrice there were discharges ahead ; I caught glimpses of the Major , the Captain , and the wolfish sergeant , far in the advance ; and once saw , through the cloud of dust that beset them , the pursued and their individual pursuers , turning the top of a hill . But for the most part , I saw nothing ; I felt all the intense , consuming , burning ardor of the time and the event . I thought that my hand clutched a sabre , and despised myself that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held some invisible enemy by the throat . In a word , the bloodiness of the chase was upon me . I realized the fierce infatuation of matching life with life , and standing arbiter upon my fellow 's body and soul . It seemed but a moment , when we halted , red and panting , in the paltry Court House village of Hanover ; the field-pieces hurled a few shells at the escaping Confederates , and the men were ordered to dismount . It seemed that a Confederate picket had been occupying the village , and the creek memorized by the skirmish was an outpost merely . Two of the man Otto 's party had been slain in the woods , where also lay as many Southerners . Hanover Court House is renowned as the birthplace of Patrick Henry , the colonial orator , called by Byron the " forest Demosthenes . " In a little tavern , opposite the old Court House building , he began his humble career as a measurer of gills to convivials , and in the Court House ,  --  a small stone edifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first exhibitions of his matchless eloquence . Not far away , on a by-road , the more modern but not less famous orator , Henry Clay , was born . The region adjacent to his father 's was called the " Slashes of Hanover , " and thence came his appellation of the " Mill Boy of the Slashes . " I had often longed to visit these shrines ; but never dreamed that the booming of cannon would announce me . The soldiers broke into both the tavern and court-house , and splintered some chairs in the former to obtain relics of Henry . I secured Richmond newspapers of the same morning , and also some items of intelligence . With these I decided to repair at once to White House , and formed the rash determination of taking the direct or Pamunkey road , which I had never travelled , and which might be beset by Confederates . The distance to White House , by this course , was only twenty miles ; whereas it was nearly as far to head-quarters ; and I believed that my horse had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four o'clock ; but I thought to ride six miles an hour while daylight lasted , and , by good luck , get to the depot at nine . The Major said that it was foolhardiness ; the Captain bantered me to go . I turned my back upon both , and bade them good by . CHAPTER IX . PUT UNDER ARREST . While daylight remained , I had little reason to repent my wayward resolve . The Pamunkey lay to my left , and the residences between it and the road were of a better order than others that I had seen . This part of the country had not been overrun , and the wheat and young corn were waving in the river-breeze . I saw few negroes , but the porches were frequently occupied by women and white men , who looked wonderingly toward me . There were some hoof-marks in the clay , and traces of a broad tire that I thought belonged to a gun-carriage . The hills of King William County were but a little way off , and through the wood that darkened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then appeared . I came to a shabby settlement called New Castle , at six o'clock , where an evil-looking man walked out from a frame-house , and inquired the meaning of the firing at Hanover . I explained hurriedly , as some of his neighbors meantime gathered around me . They asked if I was not a soldier in the Yankee army , and as I rode away , followed me suspiciously with their eyes and wagged their heads . To end the matter I spurred my pony and soon galloped out of sight . Henceforward I met only stern , surprised glances , and seemed to read " murder " in the faces of the inhabitants . A wide creek crossed the road about five miles further on , where I stopped to water my horse . The shades of night were gathering now ; there was no moon ; and for the first time I realized the loneliness of my position . Hitherto , adventure had laughed down fear ; hereafter my mind was to be darkened like the gloaming , and peopled with ghastly shadows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the toppled corpse of the slain cavalry-man on the scout , somehow haunted me . I heard his hoof-falls chiming with my own , and imagined , with a cold thrill , that his steed was still following me ; then , his white rigid face and uplifted arms menaced my way ; and , at last , the ruffianly form of his slayer pursued him along the wood . They glided like shadows over the foliage , and flashed across the surfaces of pools and rivulets . I heard their steel ringing in the underbrush , and they flitted around me , pursuing and retreating , till my brain began to whirl with the motion . Suddenly my horse stumbled , and I reined him to a halt . The cold drops were standing on my forehead . I found my knees a-quiver and my breathing convulsive . With an expletive upon my unmanliness , I touched the nag with my heel , and whistled encouragingly . Poor pony ! Fifty miles of almost uninterrupted travel had broken his spirit . He leaped into his accustomed pace : but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were pools , ruts , and boughs across the way , with here and there stretches of slippery corduroy ; but the thick blackness concealed these , and I expected momentarily to be thrown from the saddle . By and by he dropped from a canter into a rock ; from a rock to an amble ; then into a walk , and finally to a slow painful limp . I dismounted and took him perplexedly by the bit . A light shone from the window of a dwelling across some open fields to the left , and I thought of repairing thither ; but some deep-mouthed dogs began to bay directly , and then the lamp went out . A tiny stream sang at the roadside , flowing toward some deeper tributary ; lighting a cigar , I made out , by its fitful illuminings , to wash the limbs of the jaded nag . Then I led him for an hour , till my own limbs were weary , troubled all the time by weird imaginings , doubts , and regrets . When I resumed the saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ventured after a time to incite him to a trot , and was going nicely forward , when a deep voice , that almost took my breath , called from the gloom  --  " Who comes there ? Halt , or I fire ! Guard , turn out ! " Directly the road was full of men , and a bull's-eye lantern flashed upon my face . A group of foot-soldiery , with drawn pistols and sabres , gathered around me , and I heard the neigh of steeds from some imperceptible vicinity . " Who is it , Sergeant ? " said one . " Is there but one of ' em ? " said another . " Cuss him ! " said a third ; " I was takin ' a bully snooze . " " Who are yeou ? " said the Sergeant , sternly ; " what are yeou deouin ' aout at this hour o ' the night ? Are yeou a rebbil ? " " No ! " I answered , greatly relieved ; " I am a newspaper correspondent of Smith 's division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken over to a place in the woods , where some fagots were smouldering , and , stirring them to a blaze , the Sergeant read the document and pronounced it right . " Yeou hai n't got no business , nevertheless , to be roamin ' araound outside o ' picket ; but seein ' as it 's yeou , I reckon yeou may trot along ! " I offered to exchange my information for a biscuit and a drop of coffee , for I was wellnigh worn out ; while one of the privates produced a canteen more wholesome than cleanly , another gave me a lump of fat pork and a piece of corn bread . They gathered sleepily about me , while I told of the scout , and the Sergeant said that my individual ride was " game enough , but nothin ' but darn nonsense . " Then they fed my horse with a trifle of oats , and after awhile I climbed , stiff and bruised , to the saddle again , and bade them good night . I knew now that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pamunkey , and an hour later I came in sight of the ship-lights at White House , and heard the steaming of tugs and draught-boats , going and coming by night . I hitched my horse to a tree , pilfered some hay and fodder from two or three nags tied adjacent , and picked my way across a gangway , several barge-decks , and a floating landing , to the mail steamer that lay outside . Her deck and cabin were filled with people , stretched lengthwise and crosswise , tangled , grouped , and snoring , but all apparently fast asleep . I coolly took a blanket from a man that looked as though he did not need it , and wrapped myself cosily under a bench in a corner . The cabin light flared dimly , half irradiating the forms below , and the boat heaved a little on the river-swells . The night was cold , the floor hard , and I almost dead with fatigue . But what of that ! I felt the newspapers in my breast pocket , and knew that the mail could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news-gatherer 's sleep ! I think he earned it . It was very pleasant , at dawn , to receive the congratulations of our agent , with whom I breakfasted , and to whom I consigned a hastily written letter and all the Richmond papers of the preceding day . He was a shrewd , sanguine , middle-aged man , of large experience and good standing in our establishment . He was sent through the South at the beginning of the Rebellion , and introduced into all public bodies and social circles , that he might fathom the designs of Secession , and comprehend its spirit . Afterward he accompanied the Hatteras and Port Royal expeditions , and witnessed those celebrated bombardments . Such a thorough individual abnegation I never knew . He was a part of the establishment , body and soul . He agreed with its politics , adhered to all its policies , defended it , upheld it , revered it . The Federal Government was , to his eye , merely an adjunct of the paper . Battles and sieges were simply occurrences for its columns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give it obituaries . The whole world was to him a Reporter 's district , and all human mutations plain matters of news . I hardly think that any city , other than New York , contains such characters . The journals there are full of fever , and the profession of journalism is a disease . He cashed me a draft for a hundred dollars , and I filled my saddle-bags with smoking-tobacco , spirits , a meerschaum pipe , packages of sardines , a box of cigars , and some cheap publications . Then we adjourned to the quay , where the steamer was taking in mails , freight and passengers . The papers were in his side-pocket , and he was about to commit them to a steward for transmission to Fortress Monroe , when my name was called from the strand by a young mounted officer , connected with one of the staffs of my division . I thought that he wished to exchange salutations or make some inquiries , and tripped to his side . " General McClellan wants those newspapers that you obtained at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfixed me . I could not speak for a moment . Finally , I stammered that they were out of my possession . " Then , sir , I arrest you , by order of General McClellan . Get your horse ! " " Stop ! " said I , agitatedly , "  --  it may not be too late . I can recover them yet . Here is our agent ,  --  I gave them to him . " I turned , at the word , to the landing where he stood a moment before . To my dismay , he had disappeared . " This is some frivolous pretext to escape , " said the Lieutenant ; " you correspondents are slippery fellows , but I shall take care that you do not play any pranks with me . The General is irritated already , and if you prevaricate relative to those papers he may make a signal example of you . " I begged to be allowed to look for  --   --  ; but he answered cunningly , that I had better mount and ride on . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existency of the agent and his probable connection with the journals . Pale , flurried , excited , I started to discover him , the Lieutenant following me closely meantime . We entered every booth and tent , went from craft to craft , sought among the thick clusters of people , and even at the Commissary 's and Quartermaster 's pounds , that lay some distance up the railroad . " I am sorry for you , old fellow , " said the Lieutenant , " but your accomplice has probably escaped . It 's very sneaking of him , as it makes it harder for you ; but I have no authority to deal with him , though I shall take care to report his conduct at head-quarters . " I found that the Lieutenant was greatly gratified with the duty entrusted to him . He had been at the cavalry quarters on the return of the scouting party , and had overheard the Major muttering something as to McClellan 's displeasure at receiving no Richmond journals . The Major had added that one of the correspondents took them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this young and aspiring satellite had blurted out that he knew me , and could doubtless overtake me at the mail-boat in the morning . The Commanding General authorised him to arrest me with the papers , and report at head-quarters . This was then a journey to recommend him to authority , and it involved no personal danger . I was not so intimidated that I failed to see how the Lieutenant would lose his gayest feather by failing to recover the journals , and I dexterously insinuated that it would be well to recommence the search . This time we were successful . The shrewd , sanguine , middle-aged man was coolly contemplating the river from an outside barge , concealed from the shore by piled boxes of ammunition . He was reading a phonetic pamphlet , and appeared to take his apprehension as a pleasant morning call . I caught one meaning glance , however , that satisfied me how clearly he understood the case . " Ha ! Townsend , " said he , smilingly , " back already ? I thought we had lost you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I am under arrest , my boy , " said I , " and you will much aggravate General McClellan , if you do not consign those Richmond journals to his deputy here . " " Under arrest ? You surprise me ! I am sorry , Lieutenant that you have had so fatiguing a ride , but the fact is , those papers have gone down the river . If the General is not in a great hurry , he will see their columns reproduced by us in a few days . " " How did they go ? " said the Lieutenant , with an oath , " if by the mail-boat I will have General Van Vliet despatch a tug to overhaul her . " " I am very sorry again , " said the bland civilian , smoothing his hands : " but they went by the South America at a much earlier hour . " I looked appealingly to him ; the satellite stared down the river perplexedly , but suddenly his eye fell upon something that absorbed it ; and he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  sir , you are lying to me . There is the South America moored to a barge , and her steam is not up ! " " Those words are utterly uncalled for , " said the agent ,  --  " but you can not irritate me , my dear sir ! I know that youth is hot ,  --  particularly military youth yet inexperienced ; and therefore I pardon you . I made a mistake . It was not the South America , it was  --  it was  --  upon my word I can not recall the name ! " " You do not mean to ! " thundered the young Ajax , to whose vanity ,  --   --  ' s speech had been gall ; " my powers are discretionary : I arrest you in the name of General McClellan . " " Indeed ! Be sure you understand your orders ! It is n't probable that such a fiery blade is allowed much discretionary margin . The General himself would not assume such airs . Why do n't you shoot me ? It might contribute to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object . I know General McClellan very well . He is a personal friend of mine . " His manner was so self-possessed , his tone so cutting , that the young man of fustian  --  whose name was Kenty  --  fingered his sword hilt , and foamed at the lips . " March on , " said he ,  --  " I will report this insolence word for word . " He motioned us to the quay ; we preceded him . The sanguine gentleman keeping up a running fire of malevolent sarcasm . " Stop ! " said he quietly , as we reached his tent ,  --  " I have not sent them at all . They are here . And you have made all this exhibition of yourself for nothing . I am the better soldier , you see . You are a drummer-boy , not an officer . Take off your shoulder-bars , and go to school again . " He disappeared a minute , returned with two journals , and looking at me , meaningly , turned to their titles . " Let me see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Examiner , May 28 , Richmond Enquirer , May 22 . There ! You have them ! Go in peace ! Give my respects to General McClellan ! Townsend , old fellow , you have done your full duty . Do n't let this young person frighten you . Good by . " He gave me his hand , with a sinister glance , and left something in my palm when his own was withdrawn . I examined it hastily when I girt up my saddle . It said : " Your budget got off safe , old fellow . " He had given Kenty some old journals that were of no value to anybody . When we were mounted and about to start , the Lieutenant looked witheringly upon his persecutor  --  " Allow me to say , sir , " he exclaimed , " that you are the most unblushing liar I ever knew . " " Thank you , kindly , " said  --   --  , taking off his hat , " you do me honor ! " Our route was silent and weary enough . The young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's deception , boasted for some time that he had attained his purposes . As I could not undeceive him , I held my tongue ; but feared that when this trick should be made manifest , the vengeance would fall on me alone . I heartily wished the unlucky papers at the bottom of the sea . To gratify an adventurous whim , and obtain a day 's popularity at New York , I had exposed my life , crippled my nag , and was now to be disgraced and punished . What might or might not befall me , I gloomily debated . The least penalty would be expulsion from the army ; but imprisonment till the close of the war , was a favorite amusement with the War Office . How my newspaper connection would be embarrassed was a more grievous inquiry . It stung me to think that I had blundered twice on the very threshold of my career . Was I not acquiring a reputation for rashness that would hinder all future promotion and cast me from the courts of the press . Here the iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I loved Bohemia ! This roving commission , these vagabond habits , this life in the open air among the armies , the white tents , the cannon , and the drums , they were my elysium , my heart ! But to be driven away , as one who had broken his trust , forfeited favor and confidence , and that too on the eve of grand events , was something that would embitter my existence . We passed the familiar objects that I had so often buoyantly beheld ,  --  deserted encampments , cross-roads , rills , farm-houses , fields , and at last came to Daker 's . I called out to them , and explained my woful circumstances with rueful conciseness . It was growing dark when we came to general headquarters , two miles beyond Gaines 's Mill . The tents were scattered over the surface of a hill , and most of them were illumined by candles . The Lieutenant gave our horses to an orderly , and led the way through two outer circles of wall-tents , between which and the inner circle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A staff officer took in our names , and directly returned with the reply of " Pass in ! " We were now in the sacred enclosure , secured by flaming swords . Four tents stood in a row , allotted respectively to the Chief of Staff , the Adjutant-General , the telegraph operators , and the select staff officers . Just behind them , embowered by a covering of cedar boughs , stood the tent of General McClellan . Close by , from an open plot or area of ground , towered a pine trunk , floating the national flag . Lights burned in three of the tents : low voices , as of subdued conversation , were heard from the first . A little flutter of my heart , a drawing aside of canvas , two steps , an uncovering , and a bow ,  --  I stood at my tribunal ! A couple of candles were placed upon a table , whereat sat a fine specimen of man , with kindly features , dark , grayish , flowing hair , and slight marks of years upon his full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen , whose success had taught him sedentary convivialities . A fuming cigar lay before him ; some empty champagne bottles sat upon a pine desk ; tumblers and a decanter rested upon a camp-stool ; a bucket , filled with water and a great block of ice , was visible under the table . Five other gentlemen , each with a star in his shoulder-bar , were dispersed upon chairs and along a camp bedside . The tall , angular , dignified gentleman with compressed lips and a " character " nose , was General Barry , Chief of Artillery . The lithe , severe , gristly , sanguine person , whose eyes flashed even in repose , was General Stoneman , Chief of Cavalry . The large , sleepy-eyed , lymphatic , elderly man , clad in dark , civil gray , whose ears turned up habitually as from deafness , was Prince de Joinville , brother to Louis Philippe , King of France . The little man with red hair and beard , who moved quickly and who spoke sharply , was Seth Williams , Adjutant-General . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and white , straight hair , was General Van Vliet , Quartermaster-General . And the man at the table , was General Marcy , father-in-law to McClellan , and Executive officer of the army . Maps , papers , books , and luggage lay around the room ; all the gentlemen were smoking and wine sparkled in most of the glasses . Some swords were lying upon the floor , a pair of spurs glistened by the bed , and three of the officers had their feet in the air . " What is it you wish , Lieutenant ? " said General Marcy , gravely . The boor in uniform at my side , related his errand and order , gave the particulars of my arrest , declaimed against our agent , and submitted the journals . He told his story stammeringly , and I heard one of the officers in the background mutter contemptuously when he had finished . " Were you aware of the order prohibiting correspondents from keeping with the advance ? " said the General , looking up . " I had not been notified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week . " " You knew that you had no business upon scouts , forages , or reconnoissances ; why did you go ? " " I went by invitation . " " Who invited you ? " " I would prefer not to state , since it would do him an injury . " Here the voices in the background muttered , as I thought , applaudingly . Gaining confidence as I proceeded , I spoke more boldly  --  " I am sure I regret that I have disobeyed any order of General McClellan 's ; but there can nothing occur in the rear of an army . Obedience , in this case , would be indolence and incompetence ; for only the reliable would stay behind and the reckless go ahead . If I am accredited here as a correspondent , I must keep up with the events . And the rivalries of our tribe , General , are so many , that the best of us sometimes forget what is right for what is expedient . I hope that General McClellan will pass by this offence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieutenant , and whistled for an orderly . " I do n't think that you meant to offend General McClellan , " he said , " but he wishes you to be detained . Give me your pass . Orderly , take this gentleman to General Porter , and tell him to treat him kindly . Good night . " When we got outside of the tent , I slipped a silver half-dollar into the orderly 's hand , and asked him if he understood the General 's final remark . He said , in reply , that I was directed to be treated with courtesy , kindness , and care , and asked me , in conclusion , if there were any adjectives that might intensify the recommendation . When we came to General Porter , the Provost-Marshal , however , he pooh-poohed the qualifications , and said that his business was merely to put me under surveillance . This unamiable man ordered me to be taken to Major Willard , the deputy Provost , whose tent we found after a long search . The Major was absent , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his table , and with these I at once engaged in conversation . I knew that if I was to be spared an immersion in the common guardhouse , with drunkards , deserters , and prisoners of war , I must win the favor of these men . I gave them the story of my arrest , spoke lightly of the offence and jestingly of the punishment , and , in fact , so improved my cause that , when the Major appeared , and the Sergeant consigned me to his custody , one of the young officers took him aside , and , I am sure , said some good words in my favor . The Major was a bronzed , indurated gentleman , scrupulously attired , and courteously stern . He looked at me twice or thrice , to my confusion ; for I was dusty , wan , and running over with perspiration . His first remark had , naturally , reference to the lavatory , and , so far as my face and hair were concerned , I was soon rejuvenated . I found on my return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of steaming coffee placed for me , and I ate with a full heart though pleading covertly the while . When I had done , and the tent became deserted by all save him and me , he said , simply  --  " What am I to do with you , Mr. Townsend ? " " Treat me as a gentleman , I hope , Major . " " We have but one place of confinement , " said he , " the guardhouse ; but I am loth to send you there . Light your pipe , and I will think the matter over . " He took a turn in front , consulted with some of his associates , and directly returning , said that I was to be quartered in his office-tent , adjoining . A horror being thus lifted from my mind , I heard with sincere interest many revelations of his military career . He had been a common soldier in the Mexican war , and had fought his way , step by step , to repeated commissions . He had garrisoned Fort Yuma , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of the war was tendered a volunteer brigade , which he modestly declined . His tastes were refined , and a warm fancy , approaching poetry , enhanced his personal reminiscences . His face softened , his eyes grew milder , his large , commanding mouth relaxed ,  --  he was young again , living his adventures over . We talked thus till almost midnight , when two regulars appeared in front ,  --  stiff , ramrodish figures , that came to a jerking " present , " tapped their caps with two fingers , and said , explosively ; " Sergeant of Guard , Number Five ! " The Major rose , gave me his hand , and said that I would find a candle in my tent , with waterproof and blankets on the ground . I was to give myself no concern about the nag , and might , if I chose , sit for an hour to write , but must , on no account , attempt to leave the canvas , for the guard would instantly shoot me down . The guard in question had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and both were appendages of their muskets . He was not probably a sentient being , certainly not a conversational one . He knew the length of a stride , and the manual of bayonet exercise , but was , during his natural life , a blind idolater of a deity , called " Orders . " The said " Orders , " for the present evening , were walking , not talking , and he was dumb to all conciliatory words . He took a position at one end of my tent , and his double at the other end . They carried their muskets at " support arms , " and paced up and down , measuredly , like two cloaked and solemn ghosts . I wrapped myself in the damp blankets , and slept through the bangs of four or five court-martials and several executions . At three o'clock , they changed ramrods ,  --  the old doppel-gangers going away , and two new ones fulfilling their functions . CHAPTER X. AFTER THE VICTORY . The two ramrods were still pacing to and fro , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked very misty and moist , as if they were impalpables that were shortly to evaporate . The Major poked his head between the flaps at eight o'clock , and said that breakfast was ready ; but the ramrod nearest me kept vigilantly alongside , and I thought he had been invited also . The other ramrod guarded the empty tent , and I think that he believed me a doppel-ganger likewise . I wondered what was to be done with me , as the hours slipped rapidly by . The guards were relieved again at ten o'clock , and Quartermaster 's men commenced to take down the tents . Camps were to be moved , and I inquired solicitously if I was to be moved also . The Major replied that prisoners were commonly made to walk along the road , escorted by horsemen , and I imagined , with dread , the companionship of negroes , estrays , ragged Confederates , and such folk , while the whole army should witness my degradation . Finally , all the tents were lifted and packed in wagons , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the teamster looked wistfully , and the implacable sentinels walked to and fro . A rumor became current among the private soldiers , that I was the nephew of the southern General Lee , whose wife had been meantime captured at Hanover Court House . Curious groups sauntered around me , and talked behind their hands . One man was overheard to say that I had fought desperately , and covered myself with glory , and another thought that I favored my uncle somewhat , and might succeed to his military virtues . " I guess I 'll take that cheer , if you ai n't got no objection , " said the teamster , and he slung it into the wagon . What to do now troubled me materially ; but one of the soldiers brought a piece of rail , and I " squatted " lugubriously on the turf . " If you ever get to Richmond , " said I , " you shall be considerately treated . " ( Profound sensation . ) " Thankee ! " replied the man , touching his cap ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Captain . " Here the Major was seen approaching , a humorous smile playing about his eyes . " You are discharged , " said he ; " General Marcy will return your pass , and perhaps your papers . " I wrung his hand with indescribable relief , and he sent the " ramrod " on guard , to saddle my horse . In a few minutes , I was mounted again , much to the surprise of the observers of young Lee , and directly I stood before the kindly Chief of Staff . At my request , he wrote a note to the division commander , specifying my good behavior , and restoring to me all privileges and immunities . He said nothing whatever as to the mistake in the papers , and told me that , on special occasions , I might keep with advances , by procuring an extraordinary pass at head-quarters . In short , my arrest conduced greatly to my efficiency . I invariably carried my Richmond despatches to General Marcy , thereafter , and , if there was information of a legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My own brigade lay at Dr. Gaines 's house , during this time , and we did not lack for excitement . Just behind the house lay several batteries of rifled guns , and these threw shells at hourly intervals , at certain Confederate batteries across the river . The distance was two miles or less ; but the firing was generally wretched . Crowds of soldiers gathered around , to watch the practice , and they threw up their hats applaudingly at successful hits . Occasionally a great round shot would bound up the hill , and a boy , one day , seeing one of these spent balls rolling along the ground , put out his foot to stop it , but shattered his leg so dreadfully that it had to be amputated . Dr. Gaines was a rich , aristocratic , and indolent old Virginian , whose stables , summerhouses , orchards , and negro-quarters were the finest in their district . The shooting so annoyed him that he used to resort to the cellar ; several shots passed through his roof , and one of the chimneys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , and as his stables were turned into hospitals , these were all hauled into his lawn , where their obsolete trimmings and queer shape constantly amused the soldiers . About this time I became acquainted with some officers of the 5th Maine regiment , and by permission , accompanied them to Mechanicsville . I was here , on the afternoon of Thursday , May 27 , when the battle of Hanover Court House was fought . We heard the rapid growl of guns , and continuous volleys of musketry , though the place was fourteen miles distant . At evening , a report was current that the Federals had gained a great victory , and captured seven hundred prisoners . The truth of this was established next morning ; for detachments of prisoners were from time to time brought in , and the ambulances came to camp , laden with the wounded . I took this opportunity of observing the Confederate soldiers , as they lay at the Provost quarters , in a roped pen , perhaps one hundred rods square . It was evening , as I hitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the receptacle for the unfortunates . Sentries enclosed the pen , walking to-and-fro with loaded muskets ; a throng of officers and soldiers had assembled to gratify their curiosity ; and new detachments of captives came in hourly , encircled by sabremen , the Southerners being disarmed and on foot . The scene within the area was ludicrously moving . It reminded me of the witch-scene in Macbeth , or pictures of brigands or Bohemian gypsies at rendezvous , not less than five hundred men , in motley , ragged costumes , with long hair , and lean , wild , haggard faces , were gathered in groups or in pairs , around some fagot fires . In the growing darkness their expressions were imperfectly visible ; but I could see that most of them were weary , and hungry , and all were depressed and ashamed . Some were wrapped in blankets of rag-carpet , and others wore shoes of rough , untanned hide . Others were without either shoes or jackets , and their heads were bound with red handkerchiefs . Some appeared in red shirts ; some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patches of cloth ; and a few wore the soiled garments of citizen gentlemen ; but the mass adhered to homespun suits of gray , or " butternut , " and the coarse blue kersey common to slaves . In places I caught glimpses of red Zouave breeches and leggings ; blue Federal caps , Federal buttons , or Federal blouses ; these were the spoils of anterior battles , and had been stripped from the slain . Most of the captives were of the appearances denominated " scraggy " or " knotty . " They were brown , brawny , and wiry , and their countenances were intense , fierce , and animal . They came from North Carolina , the poorest and least enterprising Southern State , and ignorance , with its attendant virtues , were the common facial manifestations . Some lay on the bare ground , fast asleep ; others chatted nervously as if doubtful of their future treatment ; a few were boisterous , and anxious to beg tobacco or coffee from idle Federals ; the rest  --  and they comprehended the greater number  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity with scorn , and spite with imprecations . A child  --  not more than four years of age , I think  --  sat sleeping in a corner upon an older comrade 's lap . A gray-bearded pard was staunching a gash in his cheek with the tail of his coat . A fine-looking young fellow sat with his face in his hands , as if his heart were far off , and he wished to shut out this bitter scene . In a corner , lying morosely apart , were a Major , three Captains , and three Lieutenants ,  --  young athletic fellows , dressed in rich gray cassimere , trimmed with black , and wearing soft black hats adorned with black ostrich-feathers . Their spurs were strapped upon elegantly fitting boots , and they looked as far above the needy , seedy privates , as lords above their vassals . After a time , couples and squads of the prisoners were marched off to cut and carry some firewood , and water , for the use of their pen , and then each Confederate received coffee , pork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own meals , but some were so hungry that they gnawed the raw pork , like beasts of prey . Those who were not provided with blankets , shivered through the night , though the rain was falling , and the succession of choking coughs that ran through the ranks , told how ill they could afford the exposure . Major Willard had charge of these men , and he sent a young officer to get me admittance to the pen , that I might speak with them . " Good evening , Major , " I said , to the ranking Confederate officer , and extended my hand . He shook it , embarrassedly , and ran me over with his eye , as if to learn my avocation . " Can I obtain any facts from you , " I continued , " as to the battle of Hanover ? " " Fuh what puhpose ? " he said , in his strong southern dialect . " For publication , sir . " He sat up at once , and said that he should be happy to tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I asked him , therefore , the Confederate Commandant at Hanover , the number of brigades , regiments , and batteries engaged , the disposition of forces , the character of the battle , and the losses , so far as he knew , upon his own side . Much of this he revealed , but unguardedly let out other matters , that direct inquiry could not have discovered . I took notes of the legitimate passages , trusting to memory for the rest ; and think that I possessed his whole stock of information , in the course of an hour 's manoeuvring . It seemed that General Branch , formerly a member of the Federal congress , had been sent with some thousands of Carolina troops across the upper Chickahominy , to see if it would not be possible to turn the Federal right , and cut off one of its brigades ; but a stronger Federal reconnoissance had gone northward the day before , and discovering Branch 's camp-fires , sent , during the night , for reinforcements . In the end , the " North State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and seven hundred of their number captured . The Federals lost a large number of men killed , and the wounded upon both sides , were numerous . The Confederate Major was of the class referred to in polite American parlance , as a " blatherskite . " He boasted after the manner of his fellow-citizens from the county of " Bunkum , " but nevertheless feared and trembled , to the manifest disgust of one of the young Captains . " Majuh ! " said this young man , " what you doin ' thah ! That fellow 's makin ' notes of all your slack ; keep your tongue ! aftah awhile you 'll tell the nombah of the foces ! Do n't you s'pose he 'll prent it all ? " The Major had , in fact , been telling me how many regiments the " old Nawth State , suh , " had furnished to the " suhvice , " and I had the names of some thirty colonels , in order . The young Captain gave me a sketch of General Branch , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina valor . " We have lost mo ' men , " said he , " than any otha ' Commonwealth ; but these Vuhginians , whose soil , by  --   --  ! suh , we defend suh ! Yes , suh ! whose soil we defend ; these Vuhginians , stigmatize us as cowads ! We , suh ! yes suh , we , that nevah wanted to leave the Union ,  --  we cowads ! Look at ou ' blood , suh , ou ' blood ! That 's it , by  --   --  ! look at that ! shed on every field of the ole Dominion ,  --  killed , muhdud , captued , crippled ! We cowads ! I want you prent that ! " I was able to give each of the officers a drop of whiskey from my flask , and I never saw men drink so thirstily . Their hands and lips trembled as they took it , and their eyes shone like lunacy , as the hot drops sank to the cold vitals , and pricked the frozen blood . Mingling with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that appeared to be in great doubt as to the causes and ends of the war . They were very much in the political condition of a short , thick , sententious man , in blue drilling breeches , who said  --  " Damn the country ! What 's to be done with us ? " One person said that he enlisted for the honor of his family , that " fit in the American Revolution ; " and another came out to " hev a squint et the fightin ' . " Several were northern and foreign lads , that were working on Carolina railroads , and could not leave the section , and some labored under the impression that they were to have a " slice " of land and a " nigger , " in the event of Southern independence . A few comprehended the spirit of the contest , and took up arms from principle ; a few , also , declared their enmity to " Yankee institutions , " and had seized the occasion to " polish them off , " and " give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " dull in our deestreeks , an ' the niggers was runnin ' away , so I thought I'ud jine the foces . " The great mass said , that they never contemplated " this box , " or " this fix , " or " these suckemstances , " and all wanted the war to close , that they might return to their families . Indeed , my romantic ideas of rebellion were ruthlessly profaned and dissipated . I knew that there was much selfishness , peculation , and " Hessianism " in the Federal lines , but I had imagined a lofty patriotism , a dignified purpose , and an inflexible love of personal liberty among the Confederates . Yet here were men who knew little of the principles for which they staked their lives ;  --  who enlisted from the commonest motives of convenience , whim , pelf , adventure , and foray ; and who repented , after their first misfortune , with the salt rheum in their eyes . I think that all " great uprisings " resolve to this complexion . With due reverence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stooped from greatness to littleness . I must confess that certain admissions in my revolutionary textbook are much clearer , now that I have followed a campaign . And if , as I had proposed , I could have witnessed the further fortunes of the illustrious Garibaldi , I think that some of his compatriots would have been found equally inconsistent . Let no man believe that the noblest cause is fought out alone by the unerring motives of duty and devotion . The masses are never so constant . They can not appreciate an abstraction , however divine . Any of the gentlemen in question would have preferred their biscuit and fat pork before the political enfranchisement of the whole world ! I rode across the fields to the Hogan , Curtis , and Gaines mansions ; for some of the wounded had meantime been deposited in each of them . All the cow-houses , wagon-sheds , hay-barracks , hen-coops , negro cabins , and barns were turned into hospitals . The floors were littered with " corn-shucks " and fodder ; and the maimed , gashed , and dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood at windows , relating incidents of the battle ; but at the doors sentries stood with crossed muskets , to keep out idlers and gossips . The mention of my vocation was an " open sesame , " and I went unrestrained , into all the largest hospitals . In the first of these an amputation was being performed , and at the door lay a little heap of human fingers , feet , legs , and arms . I shall not soon forget the bare-armed surgeons , with bloody instruments , that leaned over the rigid and insensible figure , while the comrades of the subject looked horrifiedly at the scene . The grating of the murderous saw drove me into the open air , but in the second hospital which I visited , a wounded man had just expired , and I encountered his body at the threshold . Within , the sickening smell of mortality was almost insupportable , but by degrees I became accustomed to it . The lanterns hanging around the room streamed fitfully upon the red eyes , and half-naked figures . All were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is that you , doctor ? " Men with their arms in slings went restlessly up and down , smarting with fever . Those who were wounded in the lower extremities , body , or head , lay upon their backs , tossing even in sleep . They listened peevishly to the wind whistling through the chinks of the barn . They followed one with their rolling eyes . They turned away from the lantern , for it seemed to sear them . Soldiers sat by the severely wounded , laving their sores with water . In many wounds the balls still remained , and the discolored flesh was swollen unnaturally . There were some who had been shot in the bowels , and now and then they were frightfully convulsed , breaking into shrieks and shouts . Some of them iterated a single word , as , " doctor , " or " help , " or " God , " or " oh ! " commencing with a loud spasmodic cry , and continuing the same word till it died away in cadence . The act of calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lethargic , moving their fingers and lips mechanically , but never more to open their eyes upon the light ; they were already going through the valley and the shadow . I think , still , with a shudder , of the faces of those who were told mercifully that they could not live . The unutterable agony ; the plea for somebody on whom to call ; the longing eyes that poured out prayers ; the looking on mortal as if its resources were infinite ; the fearful looking to the immortal as if it were so far off , so implacable , that the dying appeal would be in vain ; the open lips , through which one could almost look at the quaking heart below ; the ghastliness of brow and tangled hair ; the closing pangs ; the awful quietus . I thought of Parrhasius , in the poem , as I looked at these things :  --  " Gods ! Could I but paint a dying groan  --   --  . " And how the keen eye of West would have turned from the reeking cockpit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Restored , to this old barn , peopled with horrors . I rambled in and out , learning to look at death , studying the manifestations of pain ,  --  quivering and sickening at times , but plying my avocation , and jotting the names for my column of mortalities . At eleven o'clock there was music along the high-road , and a general rushing from camps . The victorious regiments were returning from Hanover , under escort , and all the bands were pealing national airs . As they turned down the fields towards their old encampments , the several brigades stood under arms to welcome them , and the cheers were many and vigorous . But the solemn ambulances still followed after , and the red flag of the hospitals flaunted bloodily in the blue midnight . Both the prisoners and the wounded were removed between midnight and morning to White House , and as I had despatches to forward by the mail-boat , I rode down in an ambulance , that contained six wounded men besides . The wounded were to be consigned to hospital boats , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to be placed in a transport , under guard , and conveyed to Fort Delaware , near Philadelphia . Ambulances , it may be said , incidentally , are either two-wheeled or four-wheeled . Two-wheeled ambulances are commonly called " hop , step , and jumps . " They are so constructed that the forepart is either very high or very low , and may be both at intervals . The wounded occupants may be compelled to ride for hours in these carriages , with their heels elevated above their heads , and may finally be shaken out , or have their bones broken by the terrible jolting . The four-wheeled ambulances are built in shelves , or compartments , but the wounded are in danger of being smothered in them . It was in one of these latter that I rode , sitting with the driver . We had four horses , but were thrice " swamped " on the road , and had to take out the wounded men once , till we could start the wheels . Two of these men were wounded in the face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other having a fragment of his jaw knocked out . A third had received a ball among the thews and muscles behind his knee , and his whole body appeared to be paralyzed . Two were wounded in the shoulders , and the sixth was shot in the breast , and was believed to be injured inwardly , as he spat blood , and suffered almost the pain of death . The ride with these men , over twenty miles of hilly , woody country , was like one of Dante 's excursions into the Shades . In the awful stillness of the dark pines , their screams frightened the hooting owls , and the whirring insects in the leaves and tree-tops quieted their songs . They heard the gurgle of the rills , and called aloud for water to quench their insatiate thirst . One of them sang a shrill , fierce , fiendish ballad , in an interval of relief , but plunged , at a sudden relapse , in prayers and curses . We heard them groaning to themselves , as we sat in front , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind . These were the outward manifestations ; but what chords trembled and smarted within , we could only guess . What regrets for good resolves unfulfilled , and remorse for years misspent , made hideous these sore and panting hearts ? The moonlight pierced through the thick foliage of the wood , and streamed into our faces , like invitations to a better life . But the crippled and bleeding could not see or feel it ,  --  buried in the shelves of the ambulance . CHAPTER XI . BALLOON BATTLES . Some days ago , as I was sitting in Central Park , under a tree no bigger than Jonah 's gourd , broiling nicely brown , and seasoning the process by reading what the lesser weeklies said about me , I saw at the Park gate a great phantasm , like a distended sausage , swaying to and fro as if striving to burst , and directly the horrible thing blew upwards , spilling all the stuffing from the case . I saw in a moment that the apparition was a balloon , and that the aeronaut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel came , so close to the ground that I could hear the silk crackle and the ropes creak , till , directly , a man leaned over the side and shouted  --  " Is that you , Townsend ? " " Hallo , Lowe ! " " I want you to get on your feet and be spry about it : we have a literary party here , and wish you to write it up . I 'll let one bag of ballast go , as we touch the grass , and you must leap in simultaneously . Thump ! " Here the car collided with the ground , and in another instant , I found quantities of dirt spilled down my back , and two or three people lying beneath me . The world slid away , and the clouds opened to receive me . Lowe was opening a bottle of Heidsick , and three or four gentlemen with heads sick were unclosing the petals of their lips to get the afternoon dew . These were the various critics and fugitive writers of the weekly and daily press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the side of the car , but smothered their invective at my advent , as if I were so much pearl-ash . It was just seven o'clock , and the Park lay like a veined and mottled blood-stone in the red sunset . The city wilted to the littleness of a rare mosaic pin , its glittering point parting the blue scarf of the bay , and the white bosom of the ocean swelling afar , all draped with purple clouds like golden hair , in which the entangled gems were the sails of the white ships . I said this aloud , and all the party drew their lead pencils . They forgot the occasion in my eloquence , and wanted to report me . Just here , I drew a field-glass from the aeronaut , and reconnoitred the streets of the city . To my dismay there was nobody visible on Broadway but gentlemen . I called everybody 's attention to the fact , and it was accounted for on the supposition that the late bank forgeries and defalcations , growing out of the extravagance of womankind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nunneries . We observed , however , close by every gentleman , something that resembled a black dog with his tail curled over his back . " Stuff ! " said one , " they 're hay wagons . " " No ! " cried Lowe , " they 're nothing of the sort ; they are waterfalls , and the ladies are , of course , invisible under them . " We accepted the explanation , and thought the trip very melancholy . No landscape is complete without a woman . Very soon we struck the great polar current , and passed Harlem river ; the foliage of the trees , by some strange anomaly , began to ascend towards us , but Lowe caught two or three of the supposed leaves , and they proved to be greenbacks . There was at once a tremendous sensation in the car ; we knew that we were on the track of Ketchum and his carpet-bag of bank-notes . " Is there any reward out ? " cried Lowe . " Not yet ! " " Then we wo n't pursue him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hudson shone through the trees , and before dusk we swept across Lake Mahopec . I heard a voice singing to the dip of oars , and had to be held down by five men to restrain an involuntary impulse to quit my company . " Townsend , " said Lowe , " have you the copy of that matter you printed about me in England ? This is the time to call you to account for it . We are two or three miles above terra firma , and I might like to drop you for a parachute . " I felt Lowe 's muscle , and knew myself secure . Then I unrolled the pages , which I fortunately carried with me , and told him the following news about himself :  --  The aeronaut of the Army of the Potomac was Mr. S. T. C. Lowe ; he had made seven thousand ascensions , and his army companion was invariably either an artist , a correspondent , or a telegrapher . A minute insulated wire reached from the car to headquarters , and McClellan was thus informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes they remained aloft for hours , making observations with powerful glasses , and once or twice the enemy tested their distance with shell . On the 13th of April , the Confederates sent up a balloon , the first they had employed , at which Lowe was infinitely amused . He said that it had neither shape nor buoyancy , and predicted that it would burst or fall apart after a week . It certainly occurred that , after a few fitful appearances , the stranger was seen no more , till , on the 28th of June , it floated , like a thing of omen , over the spires of Richmond . At that time the Federals were in full retreat , and all the acres were covered with their dead . On the 11th of April , at five o'clock , an event at once amusing and thrilling occurred at our quarters . The commander-in-chief had appointed his personal and confidential friend , General Fitz John Porter , to conduct the siege of Yorktown . Porter was a polite , soldierly gentleman , and a native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army since early manhood . He fought gallantly in the Mexican war , being thrice promoted and once seriously wounded , and he was now forty years of age ,  --  handsome , enthusiastic , ambitious , and popular . He made frequent ascensions with Lowe , and learned to go aloft alone . One day he ascended thrice , and finally seemed as cosily at home in the firmament as upon the solid earth . It is needless to say that he grew careless , and on this particular morning leaped into the car and demanded the cables to be let out with all speed . I saw with some surprise that the flurried assistants were sending up the great straining canvas with a single rope attached . The enormous bag was only partially inflated , and the loose folds opened and shut with a crack like that of a musket . Noisily , fitfully , the yellow mass rose into the sky , the basket rocking like a leather in the zephyr ; and just as I turned aside to speak to a comrade , a sound came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something striking me across the face laid me flat upon the ground . Half blind and stunned , I staggered to my feet , but the air seemed full of cries and curses . Opening my eyes ruefully , I saw all faces turned upwards , and when I looked above ,  --  the balloon was adrift . The treacherous cable , rotted with vitriol , had snapped in twain ; one fragment had been the cause of my downfall , and the other trailed , like a great entrail , from the receding car , where Fitz John Porter was bounding upward upon a Pegasus that he could neither check nor direct . The whole army was agitated by the unwonted occurrence . From battery No. 1 , on the brink of the York , to the mouth of Warwick river , every soldier and officer was absorbed . Far within the Confederate lines the confusion extended . We heard the enemy 's alarm-guns , and directly the signal flags were waving up and down our front . The General appeared directly over the edge of the car . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could not comprehend . " O  --  pen  --  the  --  valve ! " called Lowe , in his shrill tones ; " climb  --  to  --  the  --  netting  --  and  --  reach  --  the  --  valve  --  rope . " " The valve !  --  the valve ! " repeated a multitude of tongues , and all gazed with thrilling interest at the retreating hulk that still kept straight upward , swerving neither to the east nor the west . It was a weird spectacle ,  --  that frail , fading oval , gliding against the sky , floating in the serene azure , the little vessel swinging silently beneath , and a hundred thousand martial men watching the loss of their brother in arms , but powerless to relieve or recover him . Had Fitz John Porter been drifting down the rapids of Niagara , he could not have been so far from human assistance . But we saw him directly , no bigger than a child 's toy , clambering up the netting and reaching for the cord . " He ca n't do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blows the valve-rope to and fro , and only a spry , cool-headed fellow can catch it . " We saw the General descend , and appearing again over the edge of the basket , he seemed to be motioning to the breathless hordes below , the story of his failure . Then he dropped out of sight , and when we next saw him , he was reconnoitring the Confederate works through a long black spy-glass . A great laugh went up and down the lines as this cool procedure was observed , and then a cheer of applause ran from group to group . For a moment it was doubtful that the balloon would float in either direction ; it seemed to falter , like an irresolute being , and moved reluctantly southeastward , towards Fortress Monroe . A huzza , half uttered , quivered on every lip . All eyes glistened , and some were dim with tears of joy . But the wayward canvas now turned due westward , and was blown rapidly toward the Confederate works . Its course was fitfully direct , and the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious of the opportunity , were struggling for the possession of the daring navigator . The south wind held mastery for awhile , and the balloon passed the Federal front amid a howl of despair from the soldiery . It kept right on , over sharpshooters , rifle-pits , and outworks , and finally passed , as if to deliver up its freight , directly over the heights of Yorktown . The cool courage , either of heroism or despair , had seized upon Fitz John Porter . He turned his black glass upon the ramparts and masked cannon below , upon the remote camps , upon the beleaguered town , upon the guns of Gloucester Point , and upon distant Norfolk . Had he been reconnoitring from a secure perch at the tip of the moon , he could not have been more vigilant , and the Confederates probably thought this some Yankee device to peer into their sanctuary in despite of ball or shell . None of their great guns could be brought to bear upon the balloon ; but there were some discharges of musketry that appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both armies in solemn silence were gazing aloft , while the imperturbable mariner continued to spy out the land . The sun was now rising behind us , and roseate rays struggled up to the zenith , like the arcs made by showery bombs . They threw a hazy atmosphere upon the balloon , and the light shone through the network like the sun through the ribs of the skeleton ship in the Ancient Mariner . Then , as all looked agape , the air-craft " plunged , and tacked , and veered , " and drifted rapidly toward the Federal lines again . The allelujah that now went up shook the spheres , and when he had regained our camp limits , the General was seen clambering up again to clutch the valve-rope . This time he was successful , and the balloon fell like a stone , so that all hearts once more leaped up , and the cheers were hushed . Cavalry rode pell-mell from several directions , to reach the place of descent , and the General 's personal staff galloped past me like the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the throng of soldiery with due haste , and came up to the horsemen in a few minutes . The balloon had struck a canvas tent with great violence , felling it as by a bolt , and the General , unharmed , had disentangled himself from innumerable folds of oiled canvas , and was now the cynosure of an immense group of people . While the officers shook his hands , the rabble bawled their satisfaction in hurrahs , and a band of music marching up directly , the throng on foot and horse gave him a vociferous escort to his quarters . Five miles east of Richmond , in the middle of May , we found the balloon already partially inflated , resting behind a ploughed hill that formed one of a ridge or chain of hills , bordering the Chickahominy . The stream was only a half-mile distant , but the balloon was sheltered from observation by reason of its position in the hollow . Heretofore the ascensions had been made from remote places , for there was good reason to believe that batteries lined the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowe intended to make an ascent whereby he could look into Richmond , count the forts encircling it , and note the number and position of the camps that intervened . The balloon was named the " Constitution , " and looked like a semi-distended boa-constrictor , as it flapped with a jerking sound , and shook its oiled and painted folds . It was anchored to the ground by stout ropes affixed to stakes , and also by sand-bags which hooked to its netting . The basket lay alongside ; the generators were contained in blue wooden wagons , marked " U. S. ; " and the gas was fed to the balloon through rubber and metallic pipes . A tent or two , a quantity of vitriol in green and wicker carboys , some horses and transportation teams , and several men that assisted the inflation , were the only objects to be remarked . As some time was to transpire before the arrangements were completed , I resorted to one of the tents and took a comfortable nap . The " Professor " aroused me at three o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emitting a hollow sound , as of escaping gas . The basket was made fast directly , the telescopes tossed into place ; the Professor climbed to the side , holding by the network ; and I coiled up in a rope at the bottom . " Stand by your cables , " he said , and the bags of ballast were at once cut away . Twelve men took each a rope in hand , and played out slowly , letting us glide gently upward . The earth seemed to be falling away , and we poised motionless in the blue ether . The tree-tops sank downward , the hills dropped noiselessly through space , and directly the Chickahominy was visible beyond us , winding like a ribbon of silver through the ridgy landscape . Far and wide stretched the Federal camps . We saw faces turned upwards gazing at our ascent , and heard clearly , as in a vacuum , the voices of soldiers . At every second the prospect widened , the belt of horizon enlarged , remote farmhouses came in view ; the earth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and streaked with pictures of roads , fields , fences , and streams . As we climbed higher , the river seemed directly beneath us , the farms on the opposite bank were plainly discernible , and Richmond lay only a little way off , enthroned on its many hills , with the James stretching white and sinuous from its feet to the horizon . We could see the streets , the suburbs , the bridges , the outlaying roads , nay , the moving masses of people . The Capitol sat white and colossal on Shockoe Hill , the dingy buildings of the Tredegar works blackened the river-side above , the hovels of rockets clustered at the hither limits , and one by one we made out familiar hotels , public edifices , and vicinities . The fortifications were revealed in part only , for they took the hue of the soil , and blended with it ; but many camps were plainly discernible , and by means of the glasses we separated tent from tent , and hut from hut . The Confederates were seen running to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their numbers , but we knew the location of their camp-fires by the smoke that curled toward us . A panorama so beautiful would have been rare at any time , but this was thrice interesting from its past and coming associations . Across those plains the hordes at our feet were either to advance victoriously , or be driven eastward with dusty banners and dripping hands . Those white farm-houses were to be receptacles for the groaning and the mangled ; thousands were to be received beneath the turf of those pasture fields ; and no rod of ground on any side , should not , sooner or later , smoke with the blood of the slain . " Guess I got ' em now , jest where I want ' em , " said Lowe , with a gratified laugh ; " jest keep still as you mind to , and squint your eye through my glass , while I make a sketch of the roads and the country . Hold hard there , and anchor fast ! " he screamed to the people below . Then he fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and escaping nothing that could contribute to the completeness of his jotting . We had been but a few minutes thus poised , when close below , from the edge of a timber stretch , puffed a volume of white smoke . A second afterward , the air quivered with the peal of a cannon . A third , and we heard the splitting shriek of a shell , that passed a little to our left , but in exact range , and burst beyond us in the ploughed field , heaving up the clay as it exploded . " Ha ! " said Lowe , " they have got us foul ! Haul in the cables  --  quick ! " he shouted , in a fierce tone . At the same instant , the puff , the report , and the shriek were repeated ; but this time the shell burst to our right in mid-air , and scattered fragments around and below us . " Another shot will do our business , " said Lowe , between his teeth ; " it is n't a mile , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the whizzing shock . I closed my eyes , and held my breath hard . The explosion was so close , that the pieces of shell seemed driven across my face , and my ears quivered with the sound . I looked at Lowe , to see if he was struck . He had sprung to his feet , and clutched the cordage frantically . " Are you pulling in there , you men ? " he bellowed , with a loud imprecation . " Puff ! bang ! whiz-z-z-z ! splutter ! " broke a third shell , and my heart was wedged in my throat . I saw at a glimpse the whole bright landscape again . I hoard the voices of soldiers below , and saw them running across fields , fences , and ditches , to reach our anchorage . I saw some drummer-boys digging in the field beneath for one of the buried shells . I saw the waving of signal flags , the commotion through the camps ,  --  officers galloping their horses , teamsters whipping their mules , regiments turning out , drums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of all , the site of the battery that alarmed us , and , by a strange sharpness of sight and sense , believed that I saw the gunners swabbing , ramming , and aiming the pieces . " Puff ! bang ! whiz-z-z-z ! splutter ! crash ! " " Puff ! bang ! whiz-z-z-z ! splutter ! crash ! " " My God ! " said Lowe , hissing the words slowly and terribly , " they have opened upon us from another battery ! " The scene seemed to dissolve . A cold dew broke from my forehead . I grew blind and deaf . I had fainted . " Pitch some water in his face , " said somebody . " He ai n't used to it . Hallo ! there he comes to . " I staggered to my feet . There must have been a thousand men about us . They were looking curiously at the aeronaut and me . The balloon lay fuming and struggling on the clods . " Three cheers for the Union bal-loon ! " called a little fellow at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoorooar ! hoorooar ! " " Tiger-r-r  --  yah ! whoop ! " CHAPTER XII . SEVEN PINES AND FAIROAKS . Returning from White House on Saturday , May 29 , I heard the cannon of " Seven Pines . " The roar of artillery came faintly upon the ear in the dells and woods , but in the open stretches of country , or from cleared hill-tops , I could hear also the volleys of musketry . It was the battle sound that assured me of bloody work ; for the musket , as I had learned by experience , was the only certain signification of battle . It is seldom brought into requisition but at close quarters , when results are intended ; whereas , cannon may peal for a fortnight , and involve no other destruction than that of shell and powder . I do not think that any throb of my heart was unattended by some volley or discharge . Dull , hoarse , uninterrupted , the whole afternoon was shaken by the sound . It was with a shudder that I thought how every peal announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way , stood in their side yards , anxiously listening . Riders or teamsters coming from the field , were beset with inquiries ; but in the main they knew nothing . As I stopped at Daker 's for dinner , the concussion of the battle rattled our plates , and the girls entirely lost their appetites , so that Glumley , who listened and speculated , observed that the baby face was losing all the lines of art , and was quite flat and faded in color . Resuming our way , we encountered a sallow , shabby person , driving a covered wagon , who recognized me at once . It was the " Doctor " who had lightened the journey down the Chesapeake , by a discourse upon embalming . He pointed toward the field with a long bony finger , and called aloud , with a smirk upon his face  --  " I have the apparatus here , you see . They will need me out yonder , you know . There 's opportunity there for the development of the ' system . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farm , till late in the day . The firing had almost entirely ceased , but occasional discharges still broke the repose of evening , and at night signal rockets hissed and showered in every direction . Next day the contest recommenced ; but although not farther in a direct line , than seven miles , from our encampment , I could not cross the Chickahominy , and was compelled to lie in my tent all day . These two battles were offered by the Confederates , in the hope of capturing that portion of the Federal army that lay upon the Richmond side of the river . Some days previously , McClellan had ordered Keyes 's corps , consisting of perhaps twelve thousand men , to cross Bottom Bridge , eight miles down the Chickahominy , and occupy an advanced position on the York River railroad , six miles east of Richmond . Keyes 's two divisions , commanded by Generals Couch and Casey , were thus encamped in a belt of woods remote from the body of the army , and little more than a mile from the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridge , several miles in their rear , and the three finest corps in the army were separated from them by a broad , rapid river , which could be crossed at two places only . The troops of Keyes were mainly inexperienced , undisciplined volunteers from the Middle States . When their adversaries advanced , therefore , in force , on the twenty-ninth instant , they made a fitful , irregular resistance , and at evening retired in panic and disorder . The victorious enemy followed them so closely , that many of the Federals were slain in their tents . During that night , the Chickahominy , swollen by rains , overflowed its banks , and swept away the bridges . The beaten and disorganized relic of the fight of " Seven Pines , " was thus completely isolated , and apparently to be annihilated at daybreak . But during the night , twenty thousand fresh men of Sumner 's corps , forded the river , carrying their artillery , piece by piece across , and at dawn they assumed the offensive , seconded by the encouraged columns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night the Federals reoccupied their old ground at Fairoaks , and the Confederates retired , leaving their dead and wounded on the field . They lost , among their prisoners , General Pettigrew , of South Carolina , who was severely wounded , and with whom I talked as he lay in bed at Gaines 's Mansion . He appeared to be a chivalrous , gossipy old gentleman , and said that he was the last South Carolinian to stand by the Union . On the succeeding day , Monday , June 2 , I rode to " Grape-Vine Bridge , " and attempted to force my horse through the swamp and stream ; but the drowned mules that momentarily floated down the current , admonished me of the folly of the hazard . The bridge itself was a swimming mass of poles and logs , that yielded with every pressure ; yet I saw many wounded men , who waded through the water , or stepped lightly from log to log , and so gained the shore , wet from head to foot . Long lines of supply teams and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bordering the river ; but so narrow were the corduroy approaches to the bridge , and so fathomless the swamp on either hand , that they could neither go forward , nor return . The straggling troops brought the unwelcome intelligence , that their comrades on the other side were starving , as they had crossed with a single ration of food , and had long ago eaten their last morsels . While I was standing close by the bridge , General McClellan , and staff , rode through the swamp , and attempted to make the passage . The " young Napoleon , " urged his horse upon the floating timber , and at once sank over neck and saddle . His staff dashed after him , floundering in the same way ; and when they had splashed and shouted , till I believed them all drowned , they turned and came to shore , dripping and discomfited . There was another Napoleon , who , I am informed , slid down the Alps into Italy ; the present descendant did not slide so far , and he shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked with some surprise , that he was growing obese ; whereas , the active labors of the campaign had reduced the dimensions of most of the Generals . I secured my horse , and placed a drummer-boy beside him , to prevent abduction or mistake ; then stripping from top to toe , and holding my garments above my head , I essayed the difficult passage ; as a commencement , I dropped my watch , but the guard-hook caught in a log and held it fast . Afterward , I slipped from the smooth butt of a tree , and thoroughly soused myself and clothing ; a lumber-man from Maine , beheld my ill luck , and kindly took my burden to the other side . An estuary of the Chickahominy again intervened , but a rough scow floated upon it , which the Captain of Engineers sent for me , with a soldier to man the oars . I neglected to " trim boat , " I am sorry to add , although admonished to that effect repeatedly by the mariner ; and we swamped in four feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the antediluvian eras , when I came to land , finally , and might have been taken for a slimy Iguanodon . I sacrificed some of my under clothing to the process of cleansing and drying , and so started with soaking boots , and a deficiency of dress , in the direction of Savage 's . Passing the " bottom , " or swamp-land , I ascended a hill , and following a lane , stopped after a half hour at a frame-mansion , unpainted , with some barns and negro-quarters contiguous , and a fine grove of young oaks , shading the porch . An elderly gentleman sat in the porch , sipping a julep , with his feet upon the railing , and conversing with a stout , ruddy officer , of decidedly Milesian physiognomy . When I approached , the latter hurriedly placed a chair between himself and me , and said , with a stare  --  " Bloodanowns ! And where have ye been ? Among the hogs , I think ? " I assured him that I did not intend to come to close quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part to contaminate him . The old gentleman called for " William , " a tall , consumptive servant , whose walk reminded me of a stubborn convict 's , in the treadmill , and ordered him to scrape me , which was done , accordingly , with a case-knife . The young officer proposed to dip me in the well and wring me well out , but I demurred , mainly on the ground that some time would be so consumed , and that my horse was waiting on the other side . He at once said that he would send for it , and called " Pat , " a civilian servant , in military blue , who was nursing a negro baby with an eye , it seemed , to obtain favor with the mother . The willingness of the man surprised me , but he said that it was a short cut of four miles to the railroad bridge , which had been repaired and floored , and that he could readily recover the animal and return at three o'clock . My benefactor , the officer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my face , and said , without parley  --  " You 're a reporter , on the  --   --  " He said further , that he had been Coroner 's Surgeon in New York for many years , and had learned to know the representatives of newspapers , one from the other , by generic manner and appearance . Three correspondents rode by at the time , neither of whom he knew personally , but designated them promptly , with their precise connections . In short , we became familiar directly , and he told me that his name was O'Gamlon , Quartermaster of Meagher 's Irish brigade , Sumner 's corps . He was established with the elderly gentleman ,  --  whose name was Michie ,  --  and had two horses in the stable , at hand . He proposed to send me to the field , with a note of introduction to the General , and another to Colonel Baker , of the New York 88th ( Irish ) , who could show me the lines and relics of battle , and give me the lists of killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , and arrayed myself in a fatigue officer 's suit , with clean underclothing , after which , descending , I climbed into his saddle , and dashed off , with a mettlesome , dapper pony . The railroad track was about a mile from the house , and the whole country , hereabout , was sappy , dank , and almost barren . Scrub pines covered much of the soil , and the cleared fields were dotted with charred stumps . The houses were small and rude ; the wild pigs ran like deer through the bushes and across my path ; vultures sailed by hundreds between me and the sky ; the lane was slippery and wound about slimy pools ; the tree-tops , in many places , were splintered by ball and shell . I crossed the railroad , cut by a high bridge , and saw below the depot , at Savage 's , now the head-quarters of General Heintzelman . Above , in full view , were the commands at Peach Orchard and Fairoaks , and to the south , a few furlongs distant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railway , toward the field of Seven Pines . The latter site , was simply the junction of the turnpike with a roundabout way to Richmond , called the " Nine Mile Road , " and Fairoaks was the junction of the diverging road with the railroad . Toward the latter I proceeded , and soon came to the Irish brigade , located on both sides of the way , at Peach Orchard . They occupied the site of the most desperate fighting . A small farm hollowed in the swampy thicket and wood , was here divided by the track , and a little farm-house , with a barn , granary , and a couple of cabins , lay on the left side . In a hut to the right General Thomas Francis Meagher made his head-quarters , and a little beyond , in the edges of the swamp timber , lay his four regiments , under arms . A guard admonished me , in curt , lithe speech , that my horse must come no further ; for the brigade held the advance post , and I was even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An Irish boy volunteered to hold the rein , while I paid my respects to the Commander . I encountered him on the threshold of the hut , and he welcomed me in the richest and most musical of brogues . Large , corpulent , and powerful of body ; plump and ruddy  --  or as some would say , bloated  --  of face ; with resolute mouth and heavy animal jaws ; expressive nose , and piercing blue-eyes ; brown hair , mustache , and eyebrows ; a fair forehead , and short sinewy neck , a man of apparently thirty years of age , stood in the doorway , smoking a cigar , and trotting his sword fretfully in the scabbard . He wore the regulation blue cap , but trimmed plentifully with gold lace , and his sleeves were slashed in the same manner . A star glistened in his oblong shoulder-bar ; a delicate gold cord seamed his breeches from his Hessian boots to his red tasselled sword-sash ; a seal-ring shone from the hand with which he grasped his gauntlets , and his spurs were set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved his temperament to an intense sanguine . He was fitfully impulsive , as all his movements attested , and liable to fluctuations of peevishness , melancholy , and enthusiasm . This was " Meagher of the Sword , " the stripling who made issue with the renowned O'Connell , and divided his applauses ; the " revolutionist , " who had outlived exile to become the darling of the " Young Ireland " populace in his adopted country ; the partisan , whose fierce , impassioned oratory had wheeled his factious element of the Democracy into the war cause ; and the soldier , whose gallant bearing at Bull Run had won him a brigadiership . He was , to my mind , a realization of the Knight of Gwynne , or any of the rash , impolitic , poetic personages in Lever and Griffin . Ambitious without a name ; an adventurer without a definite cause ; an orator without policy ; a General without caution or experience , he had led the Irish brigade through the hottest battles , and associated them with the most brilliant episodes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hibernian . The emerald green standard entwined with the red , white , and blue ; the gilt eagles on the flag-poles held the Shamrock sprig in their beaks ; the soldiers lounging on guard , had " 69 " or " 88 " the numbers of their regiments , stamped on a green hat-band ; the brogue of every county from Down to Wexford fell upon the ear ; one might have supposed that the " year ' 98 " had been revived , and that these brawny Celts were again afield against their Saxon countrymen . The class of lads upon the staff of Meagher , was an odd contrast to the mass of staff officers in the " Grand Army . " Fox-hunters they all seemed to me , and there was one , who wore a long , twisted , pomatumed moustache , who talked of steeple chases , all the while , and wanted to have " a healthy dash " of some kind . A class of Irish exquisites , they appeared to be ,  --  good for a fight , a card-party , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sober requirements of Yankee warfare . When anything absurd , forlorn , or desperate was to be attempted , the Irish brigade was called upon . But , ordinarily , they were regarded , as a party of mad fellows , more ornamental than useful , and entirely too clannish and factious to be entrusted with power . Meagher himself seemed to be less erratic than his subordinates ; for he had married a New York lady , and had learned , by observation , the superiority of the pelfish , plodding native before his own fitful , impracticable race . His address was infatuating : but there was a certain airiness , indicative of vanity , that revealed his great characteristic . He loved applause , and to obtain it had frittered away his fine abilities , upon petty , splendid , momentary triumphs . He was generous to folly , and , I have no doubt , maintained his whole staff . When I requested to be shown the field , and its relics , Meagher said , in his musical brogue , that I need only look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " the Irish brigade charged across this field , and fell upon their faces in the railway cutting below . A regiment of Alabamians lay in the timber beyond , with other Southerners in their rear , and on both flanks . They thought that we were charging bayonets , and reserved their fire till we should approach within butchering distance . On the contrary , I ordered the boys to lie down , and load and fire at will . In the end , sir , we cut them to pieces , and five hundred of them were left along the swamp fence , that you see . There is n't fifty killed and wounded in the whole Irish brigade . " A young staff officer took me over the field . We visited first the cottage and barns across the road , and found the house occupied by some thirty wounded Federals . They lay in their blankets upon the floors ,  --  pale , helpless , hollow-eyed , making low moans at every breath . Two or three were feverishly sleeping , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneasily and moved their hands to and fro . By the flatness of the covering at the extremities , I could see that several had only stumps of legs . They had lost the sweet enjoyment of walking afield , and were but fragments of men , to limp forever through a painful life . Such wrecks of power I never beheld . Broad , brawny , buoyant , a few hours ago , the loss of blood , and the nervous shock , attendant upon amputation , has wellnigh drained them to the last drop . Their faces were as white as the tidy ceiling ; they were whining like babies ; and only their rolling eyes distinguished them from mutilated corpses . Some seemed quite broken in spirit , and one , who could speak , observing my pitiful glances toward his severed thigh , drew up his mouth and chin , and wept as if with the loss of comeliness all his ambitions were frustrated . A few attendants were brushing off the insects with boughs of cedar , laving the sores , or administering cooling draughts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded , but in a corner clustered the terrified farmer and his family , vainly attempting to turn their eyes from the horrible spectacle . The farmer 's wife had a baby at her breast , and its little blue eyes were straying over the room , half wonderingly , half delightedly . I thought , with a shudder , of babyhood thus surrounded , and how , in the long future , its first recollections of existence should be of booming guns and dying soldiers ! The cow-shed contained seven corpses , scarcely yet cold , lying upon their backs , in a row , and fast losing all resemblance to man . The farthest removed , seemed to be a diminutive boy , and I thought if he had a mother , that she might sometime like to speak with me . When I took their names , I thought what terrible agencies I was fulfilling . Beyond my record , falsely spelled , perhaps , they would have no history . And people call such deaths glorious ! Upon a pile of lumber and some heaps of fence-rails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mainly Federals , with bandaged arms and faces , and torn clothing . There was one , shot in the foot , who howled at every effort to remove his boot ; the blood leaked from a rent in the side , and at last , the leather was cut , piecemeal from the flesh . These ate voraciously , though in pain and fear ; for a little soup and meat was being doled out to them . The most horrible of all these scenes  --  which I have described perhaps too circumstantially  --  was presented in the stable or barn , on the premises , where a bare dingy floor  --  the planks of which tilted and shook , as one made his way over them  --  was strewn with suffering people . Just at the entrance sat a boy , totally blind , both eyes having been torn out by a minnie-ball , and the entire bridge of the nose shot away . He crouched against the gable , in darkness and agony , tremulously fingering his knees . Near at hand , sat another , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but singular to relate , he still lived , though lunatic , and evidently beyond hope . Death had drawn blue and yellow circles beneath his eyes , and he muttered incomprehensibly , wagging his head . Two men , perfectly naked , lay in the middle of the place , wounded in bowels and loins ; and at a niche in the weather-boarding , where some pale light peeped in , four mutilated wretches were gaming with cards . I was now led a little way down the railroad , to see the Confederates . The rain began to fall at this time , and the poor fellows shut their eyes to avoid the pelting of the drops . There was no shelter for them within a mile , and the mud absolutely reached half way up their bodies . Nearly one third had suffered amputation above the knee . There were about thirty at this spot , and I was told that they were being taken to Meadow Station on hand cars . As soon as the locomotive could pass the Chickahominy , they would be removed to White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats . Some of them were fine , athletic , and youthful , and I was directed to one who had been married only three days before . " Doctor , " said one , feebly , " I feel very cold : do you think that this is death ? It seems to be creeping to my heart . I have no feeling , in my feet , and my thighs are numb . " A Federal soldier came along with a bucket of soup , and proceeded to fill the canteens and plates . He appeared to be a relative of Mark Tapley , and possessed much of that estimable person 's jollity  --  " Come , pardner , " he said , " drink yer sup ! now , old boy , this'ill warm ye ; sock it down and ye 'll see yer sweetheart soon . You dead , Ally-bammy ? Go way , now . You 'll live a hundred years , you will . That 's wot you 'll do . Wo n't he , lad ? What ? Not any ? Get out ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hev another shot at me the week a'ter that . You know you will ! Oh ! you Rebil ! You , with the butternut trousers ! Say ! Wake up and take some o ' this . Hello ! lad , pardner . Wake up ! " He stirred him gently with his foot ; he bent down to touch his face . A grimness came over his merriment . The man was stiff and dumb . Colonel Baker , commanding the 88th New York , was a tall , martial Irishman , who opened his heart and bottle at the same welcome , and took me into the woods , where some of the slain still remained . He had slept not longer than an hour , continuously , for seventy hours , and during the past night had been called up by eight alarums . His men lay in the dark thickets , without fires or blankets , as they had crossed the Chickahominy in light marching order . " Many a lad , " said he , " will escape the bullet for a lingering consumption . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we came to a trodden place beneath the pines , where a scalp lay in the leaves , and the imprint of a body was plainly visible . The bayonet scabbard lay at one side , the canteen at the other . We saw no corpses , however , as fatigue parties had been burying the slain , and the whole wood was dotted with heaps of clay , where the dead slept below in the oozy trenches . Quantities of cartridges were scattered here and there , dropped by the retreating Confederates . Some of the cartridge-pouches that I examined were completely filled , showing that their possessors had not fired a single round ; others had but one cartridge missing . There were fragments of clothing , hair , blankets , murderous bowie and dirk knives , spurs , flasks , caps , and plumes , dropped all the way through the thicket , and the trees on every hand were riddled with balls . I came upon a squirrel , unwittingly shot during the fight . Not those alone who make the war must feel the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just completed their work , and the men were throwing the last clods upon the remains . They had dug pits of not more than two feet depth , and dragged the bodies heedlessly to the edges , whence they were toppled down and scantily covered . Much of the interring had been done by night , and the flare of lanterns upon the discolored faces and dead eyes must have been hideously effective . The grave-diggers , however , were practical personages , and had probably little care for dramatic effects . They leaned upon their spades , when the rites were finished , and a large , dry person , who appeared to be privileged upon all occasions , said , grinningly  --  " Colonel , your honor , them boys ' ill niver stand forninst the Irish brigade again . If they 'd ha ' known it was us , sur , begorra ! they ' ud ha ' brought coffins wid ' em . " " No , niver ! " " They got their ticket for soup ! " " We kivered them , fait ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do ye belave , Colonel , " said the dry person , again , " that thim ribals 'll lave us a chance to catch them . Be me sowl ! I 'm jist wishin to war-rum me hands wid rifle practice . " The others echoed loudly , that they were anxious to be ordered up , and some said that " Little Mac 'll give ' em his big whack now . " The presence of death seemed to have added no fear of death to these people . Having tasted blood , they now thirsted for it , and I asked myself , forebodingly , if a return to civil life would find them less ferocious . I dined with Colonel Owen of the 69th Pennsylvania ( Irish ) volunteers . He had been a Philadelphia lawyer , and was , by all odds , the most consistent and intelligent soldier in the brigade . He had been also a schoolmaster for many years , but appeared to be in his element at the head of a regiment , and was generally admitted to be an efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduates ; for at this time the arrogance of the regular officers , and the pride of the volunteers , had embittered each against the other . His theory of military education was , the establishment of State institutions , and the reorganization of citizenship upon a strict militia basis . After dinner , I rode to " Seven Pines , " and examined some of the rifle pits used during the engagement . A portion of this ground only had been retaken , and I was warned to keep under cover ; for sharpshooters lay close by , in the underbrush . A visit to the graves of some Federal soldiers completed the inspection . Some of the regiments had interred their dead in trenches ; but the New Englanders were all buried separately , and smooth slabs were driven at the heads of the mounds , whereon were inscribed the names and ages of the deceased . Some of the graves were freshly sodded , and enclosed by rails and logs . They evidenced the orderly , religious habits of the sons of the Puritans ; for , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am inclined to think that the Yankee is the best manifestation of Northern character . He loves his home , at least , and he reveres his deceased comrades . When I returned to Michie 's , at six o'clock , the man " Pat , " with a glowing face , came out to the gate . " That 's a splendid baste of yours , sur , " he said ,  --  " and sich a boi to gallop . " " My horse does n't generally gallop , " I returned , doubtfully . When I passed to the barn in the rear , I found to my astonishment , a sorrel stallion , magnificently accoutred . He thrust his foot at me savagely , as I stood behind him , and neighed till he frightened the spiders . " Pat , " said I , wrathfully , " you have stolen some Colonel 's nag , and I shall be hanged for the theft . " " Fait , sur , " said Pat , " my ligs was gone intirely , wid long walkin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . " CHAPTER XIII . STUART 'S RAID . The old Chickahominy bridges were soon repaired , and the whole of Franklin 's corps crossed to the south side . McClellan moved his head-quarters to Dr. Trent 's farm , a half-mile from Michie 's , and the latter gentleman 's fields and lawn were made white with tents . Among others , the Chief of Cavalry , Stoneman , pitched his canopy under the young oaks , and the whole reserve artillery was parked in the woods , close to the house . The engineer brigade encamped in the adjacent peach-orchard and corn-field , and the wheat was trampled by battery and team-horses . Smith 's division now occupied the hills on the south side of the Chickahominy , and the Federal line stretched southeastward , through Fairoaks , to White Oak Swamp , seven miles away . Porter 's corps still lay between Mechanicsville and New Bridge , on the north bank of the river , and my old acquaintances , the Pennsylvania Reserves , had joined the army , and now formed its extreme right wing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment : for the right was thus four miles , and the left fourteen miles , from Richmond . The four corps at once commenced to entrench , and from Smith 's redoubt on the river bluffs , to Casey 's entrenched hill at White Oak , a continuous line of moderately strong earthworks extended . But Porter and the Reserves were not entrenched at all , and only a few horsemen were picketed across the long reach of country from Meadow Bridge to Hanover Court House . Both flanks , in fact , were open , and the left was a day 's march from the right . We were , meantime , drawing our supplies from White House , twenty miles in the rear ; there were no railroad guards along the entire line , and about five companies protected the grand depot . Two gunboats lay in the river , however , and as the teams still went to and fro , a second depot was established at a place called Putney 's or " Garlic , " five miles above White House . I went often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over this exposed and lonely route . My horse had been , meantime , returned to the Provost Quarters , and the rightful owner had obtained his stallion in exchange . I rode the said stallion but once , when he proceeded to walk sideways , and several times rivalled the renowned Pegasus in his aerial flights . The man named " Pat " essayed to show his paces one day , but the stallion took him straight into Stoneman 's wall-tent , and that officer shook the Irishman blind . My little bob-tailed brownie was thrice endeared to me by our separation ; but I warned the man " Pat " to keep clear of him thereafter . The man " Pat " was a very eccentric person , who slept on the porch at Michie 's , and used to wake up the house in the small hours , with the story that somebody was taking the chickens and the horses . He was the most impulsive person that I ever knew , and when I entrusted despatches to him once , he put them on the hospital boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the close of the campaign . Michie 's soon became a correspondents ' rendezvous , and we have had at one time , at dinner , twelve representatives of five journals . The Hon. Henry J. Raymond , Ex-Lieutenant Governor of New York , and proprietor of the Times newspaper , was one of our family for several weeks . He had been a New Hampshire lad , and , strolling to New York , took to journalism at the age of nineteen years . His industry and probity obtained him both means and credit , and , also , what few young journalists obtain , social position . He was the founder of Harper 's Magazine , one of the most successful serials in America , and many English authors are indebted to him for a trans-Atlantic recognition of their works . He edited an American edition of Jane Eyre before it had attracted attention in England , and conducted the Courier and Enquirer with great success for many years . The Times is now the most reputable of the great New York dailies , and Mr. Raymond has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained , amidst his social and political successes , a predilection for " Bohemia , " and became an indefatigable correspondent . I rode out with him sometimes , and heard , with interest , his accounts of the Italian war , whither he also went in furtherance of journalism . Among our quill cavalry-men was a fat gentleman from Philadelphia , who had great fear of death , and who used to " tear " to White House , if the man " Pat " shot a duck in the garden . He was a hearty , humorous person , however , and an adept at searching for news . O'Ganlon rode with me several times to White House , and we have crossed the railroad bridge together , a hundred feet in the air , when the planks were slippery , the sides sloping , and the way so narrow that two horses could not pass abreast . He was a true Irishman , and leaped barricades and ditches without regard to his neck . He had , also , a partiality for by-roads that led through swamps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daker 's and an old Mill at Grapevine Bridge . The long arms of oaks and beech trees reached across it , and young Absalom might have been ensnared by the locks at every rod therein . Through this devious and dangerous way , O'Ganlon used to dash , whooping , guiding his horse with marvellous dexterity , and bantering me to follow . I so far forgot myself generally , as to behave quite as irrationally , and once returned to Michie 's with a bump above my right eye , that rivalled my head in size . At other times I rode alone , and my favorite route was an unfrequented lane called the " Quaker Road , " that extended from Despatch Station , on the line of rail , to Daker 's , on the New Bridge Road . Much of this way was shut in by thick woods and dreary pine barrens ; but the road was hard and light , and a few quiet farms lay by the roadside . There was a mill , also , three miles from Daker 's , where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , near by , I used to frighten the squirrels , so that they started up by pairs and families ; I have chased them in this way a full mile , and they seemed to know me after a time . We used to be on the best of terms , and they would , at length , stand their ground saucily , and chatter , the one with the other , flourishing their bushy appendages , like so many straggling " Bucktails . " When I turned from the beaten road , where the ruts were like a ditch and parapet , and dead horses blackened the fields ; where teams went creaking day and night , and squads of sabremen drove pale , barefooted prisoners to and fro like swine or cattle , the silence and solitude of this by-lane were beautiful as sleep . Many of the old people living in this direction had not seen even a soldier or a sutler , save some mounted scouts that vanished in clouds of dust ; but they had listened with awe to the music of cannon , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fighting . If fate has ordained me to survive the Rebellion , I shall some day revisit these localities ; they are stamped legibly upon my mind , and I know almost every old couple in New Kent or Hanover counties . I have lunched at all the little springs on the road , and eaten corn-bread and bacon at most of the cabins . I have swam the Pamunkey at dozens of places , and when my finances were low , and my nag hungry , have organized myself into a company of foragers , and broken into the good people 's granaries . I do not know any position that admitted of as much adventure and variety . There was always enough danger to make my journeys precariously pleasant , and , when wearied of the saddle , my friends at Daker 's and Michie 's had a savory julep and a comfortable bed always prepared . I had more liberty than General McClellan , and a great deal more comfort . Mrs. Michie was a warm-hearted , impulsive Virginia lady , with almost New England industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bountiful table . Her coffee was bubbling with rich cream , and her " yellow pone " was overrunning with butter . A cleanly black girl shook a fly-brush over our shoulders as we ate , and the curious custom was maintained of sending a julep to our bedrooms before we rose in the mornings . Our hostess was too hospitable to be a bitter partisan , and during five weeks of tenure at her residence , we never held an hour 's controversy . She had troubles , but she endured them patiently . She saw , one by one , articles of property sacrificed or stolen ; she heard the servants speaking impudently ; and her daughters and son were in a remote part of the State . The young man was a Confederate Surgeon at Lynchburg , and the young ladies had taken refuge in Rockbridge County . The latter were , from all accounts , pretty and intelligent , and one day , as I examined some parcels of books in the parlors , I found a volume of amateur poems that some laboring bard had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine old Virginia gentleman , who remembered Thomas Jefferson well , as he had been reared in that great statesman 's village , Charlottesville . He told me many anecdotes of Patrick Henry , John Randolph , and other distinguished patriots . I wrote in one of the absent daughter 's albums the following lines :  --  Alas ! for the pleasant peace we knew , In the happy summers of long ago , When the rivers were bright , and the skies were blue , By the homes of Henrico : We dreamed of wars that were far away , And read , as in fable , of blood that ran , Where the James and Chickahominy stray , Through the groves of Powhattan . ' T is a dream come true ; for the afternoons Blow bugles of war , by our fields of grain , And the sabres clink , as the dark dragoons Come galloping up the lane ; The pigeons have flown from the eves and tiles , The oat-blades have grown to blades of steel , And the Huns swarm down the leafy aisles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian fisher 's nets , Where flows Pamunkey toward the sea , And blood runs red in the rivulets , That babbled and brawled in glee ; The corpses are strewn in Fairoak glades , The hoarse guns thunder from Drury 's Ridge , The fishes that played in the cove , deep shades , Are frightened from Bottom Bridge . I would that the year were blotted away , And the strawberry grew in the hedge again ; That the scythe might swing in the tangled hay , And the squirrel romp in the glen ; The walnut sprinkle the clover slopes , Where graze the sheep and the spotted steer ; And the winter restore the golden hopes , That were trampled in a year . On Friday , June 13 , I made one of my customary trips to White House , in the company of O'Ganlon . The latter individual , in the course of a " healthy dash " that he made down the railroad ties ,  --  whereby two shoes shied from his mare 's hoofs ,  --  reined into a quicksand that threatened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summit Station , and I , obligingly , rode back three miles to recover it . We dined at Daker 's , where Glumley sat beside the baby-face , pursuant to his art-duties , and the plump , red-cheeked miss sat beside me . O'Ganlon was entertained by the talkative daughter , who drove him quite mad ; so that , when we resumed our horses , he insisted upon a second " healthy dash , " and disappeared through a strip of woods . I followed , rationally , and had come to a blacksmith 's shop , at the corner of a diverging road , when I was made aware of some startling occurrence in my rear . A mounted officer dashed past me , shouting some unintelligible tidings , and he was followed in quick succession by a dozen cavalry-men , who rode as if the foul fiend was at their heels . Then came a teamster , bare-backed , whose rent harness trailed in the road , and directly some wagons that were halted before the blacksmith 's , wheeled smartly , and rattled off towards White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I said to one of these lunatics , hurriedly . " The Rebels are behind ! " he screamed , with white lips , and vanished . I thought that it might be as well to take some other road , and so struck off , at a dapper pace , in the direction of the new landing at Putney 's or " Garlic . " At the same instant I heard the crack of carbines behind , and they had a magical influence upon my speed . I rode along a stretch of chestnut and oak wood , attached to the famous Webb estate , and when I came to a rill that passed by a little bridge , under the way , turned up its sandy bed and buried myself in the under-brush . A few breathless moments only had intervened , when the roadway seemed shaken by a hundred hoofs . The imperceptible horsemen yelled like a war-party of Camanches , and when they had passed , the carbines rang ahead , as if some bloody work was being done at every rod . I remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaches added to my mystery and fear , I sallied forth , and kept the route to Putney 's , with ears erect and expectant pulses . I had gone but a quarter of a mile , when I discerned , through the gathering gloom , a black , misshapen object , standing in the middle of the road . As it seemed motionless , I ventured closer , when the thing resolved to a sutler 's wagon , charred and broken , and still smoking from the incendiaries ' torch . Further on , more of these burned wagons littered the way , and in one place two slain horses marked the roadside . When I emerged upon the Hanover road , sounds of shrieks and shot issued from the landing at " Garlic , " and , in a moment , flames rose from the woody shores and reddened the evening . I knew by the gliding blaze that vessels had been fired and set adrift , and from my place could see the devouring element climbing rope and shroud . In a twinkling , a second light appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawned upon me that the cars and houses at Tunstall 's Station had been burned . By the fitful illumination , I rode tremulously to the old head-quarters at Black Creek , and as I conjectured , the depot and train were luridly consuming . The vicinity was marked by wrecked sutler 's stores , the embers of wagons , and toppled steeds . Below Black Creek the ruin did not extend : but when I came to White House the greatest confusion existed . Sutlers were taking down their booths , transports were slipping their cables , steamers moving down the stream . Stuart had made the circuit of the Grand Army to show Lee where the infantry could follow . CHAPTER XIV . FEVER DREAMS IN WAR . A subtle enemy had of late joined the Confederate cause against the invaders . He was known as Pestilence , and his footsteps were so soft that neither scout nor picket could bar his entrance . His paths were subterranean ,  --  through the tepid swamp water , the shallow graves of the dead ; and aerial ,  --  through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fen . His victims were not pierced , or crushed , or mangled , but their deaths were not less terrible , because more lingering . They seemed to wither and shrivel away ; their eyes became at first very bright , and afterward lustreless ; their skins grew hard and sallow ; their lips faded to a dry whiteness ; all the fluids of the body were consumed ; and they crumbled to corruption before life had fairly gone from them . This visitation has been , by common consent , dubbed " the Chickahominy fever , " and some have called it the typhus fever . The troops called it the " camp fever , " and it was frequently aggravated by affections of the bowels and throat . The number of persons that died with it was fabulous . Some have gone so far as to say that the army could have better afforded the slaughter of twenty thousand men , than the delay on the Chickahominy . The embalmers were now enjoying their millennium , and a steam coffin manufactory was erected at White House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of pine boxes . I had , occasion , in one of my visits to the depot , to repair to the tent of one of the embalmers . He was a sedate , grave person , and when I saw him , standing over the nude , hard corpse , he reminded me of the implacable vulture , looking into the eyes of Prometheus . His battery and tube were pulsing , like one 's heart and lungs , and the subject was being drained at the neck . I compared the discolored body with the figure of Ianthe , as revealed in Queen Mab , but failed to see the beautifulness of death . " If you could only make him breathe , Professor , " said an officer standing by . The dry skin of the embalmer broke into chalky dimples , and he grinned very much as a corpse might do :  --  " Ah ! " he said , " then there would be money made . " To hear these embalmers converse with each other was like listening to the witch sayings in Macbeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchman named Sonca , or something of that kind , and all these worthies professed to have purchased his " system . " They told grisly anecdotes of " operations , " and experimented with chemicals , and congratulated each other upon the fever . They would , I think , have piled the whole earth with catacombs of stony corpses , and we should have no more green graves , but keep our dead with us as household ornaments . The negroes did not suffer with the fever , although their quarters were close and filthy . Their Elysium had come ; there was no more work . They slept and danced and grinned , and these three actions made up the sum of their existence . Such people to increase and multiply I never beheld . There were scores of new babies every day ; they appeared to be born by twins and triplets ; they learned to walk in twenty-four hours ; and their mothers were strong and hearty in less time . Such soulless , lost , degraded men and women did nowhere else exist . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they did no great wrongs ,  --  thieving , quarrelling , deceiving ,  --  but they failed to do any rights , and their worship was animal , and almost profane . They sang incongruous mixtures of hymns and field songs :  --  " Oh ! bruddern , watch an ' pray , watch an ' pray ! De harvest am a ripenin ' our Lord an ' Marser say ! Oh ! ho ! yo ! dat ole coon , de serpent , ho ! oh ! Watch an ' pray ! " I have heard them sing such medleys with tears in their eyes , apparently fervid and rapt . A very gray old man would lead off , keeping time to the words with his head and hands ; the mass joining in at intervals , and raising a screaming alleluja . Directly they would all rise , link hands , and proceed to dance the accompaniment . The motion would be slow at first , and the method of singing maintained ; after a time they would move more rapidly , shouting the lines together ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toss up their arms , leap , fall , groan , and , seemingly , lose consciousness . Their prayers were earnest and vehement , but often degenerated to mere howls and noises . Some of both sexes had grand voices , that rang like bugles , and the very impropriety of their music made it fascinating . It used to seem to me that any of the great composers might have borrowed advantageously some of those original negro airs . In many cases , their owners came within the lines , registered their allegiance , and recovered the negroes . These were often veritable Shylocks , that claimed their pounds of flesh , with unblushing reference to the law . The poor Africs went back cowed and tearful , and it is probable that they were afterward sent to the far South , that terrible terra incognita to a border slave . Among the houses to which I resorted was that of a Mr. Hill , one mile from White House . He had a thousand acres of land and a valuable fishery on the Pamunkey . The latter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . He had fished and farmed with negroes ; but these had leagued to run away , and he sent them across the river to a second farm that he owned in King William County . It was at Hill 's house that the widow Custis was visiting when young Washington reined at the gate , on his road to Williamsburg . With reverent feelings I used to regard the old place , and Hill frequently stole away from his formidable military household , to talk with me on the front porch . Perhaps in the same moonlights , with the river shimmering at their feet , and the grapevine shadowing the creaky corners ,  --  their voices softened , their chairs drawn very close , their hands touching with a thrill ,  --  the young soldier and his affianced had made their courtship . I sometimes sat breathless , thinking that their figures had come back , and that I heard them whispering . Hill was a Virginian ,  --  large , hospitable , severe , proud ,  --  and once I ventured to speak upon the policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the " institution . " He said , with the swaggering manner of his class , that slavery was a " domestic " institution , and that therefore no political law could reach it . I insinuated , quietly , that no political law should therefore sustain it , and took exception to the idea that what was domestic was therefore without the province of legislation . When I exampled polygamy , Hill became passionate , and asked if I was an abolitionist . I opined that I was not , and he so far relented as to say that slavery was sanctioned by divine and human laws ; that it was ultimately to be embraced by all white nationalities , and that the Caucasian was certain , in the end , to subjugate and possess every other race . He pointed , with some shrewdness , to the condition of the Chinese in California and Australia , and epitomized the gradual enslaving of the Mongol and Malay in various quarters of the world . " As to our treatment of niggers , " he said , curtly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that respect . I whip my niggers when they want it ! If they are saucy , or careless , or lazy , I have ' em flogged . About twice a year every nigger has to be punished . If they ai n't roped over twice a year , they take on airs and want to be gentlemen . A nigger is bound by no sentiment of duty or affection . You must keep him in trim by fear . " Among the victims of the swamp fever , were Major Larrabee , and Lieutenant-Colonel Emory , of the Fifth Wisconsin regiment ; I had been indebted to them for many a meal and draught of spirits . I had talked with each of them , when the camps were darkened and the soldiery asleep . Larrabee was a soldier by nature ,  --  adventurous , energetic , intrepid , aggressive . He had been a country Judge in Wisconsin , and afterwards a member of Congress . When the war commenced , he enlisted as a common soldier , but public sentiment forced the State Government to make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimpassioned gentleman ,  --  too modest to be eminent , too scrupulous to be ambitious . The men were opposites , but both capital companions , and they were seized with the fever about the same time . The Major was removed to White House , and I visited him one day in the hospital quarters . Surgeon General Watson , hospital commandant , took me through the quarters ; there was quite a town of sick men ; they lay in wall-tents  --  about twenty in a tent ,  --  and there were daily deaths ; those that caught the fever , were afterwards unfit for duty , as they took relapses on resuming the field . The tents were pitched in a damp cornfield ; for the Federals so reverenced their national shrines , that they forbade White House and lawn to be used for hospital purposes . Under the best circumstances , a field hospital is a comfortless place ; but here the sun shone like a furnace upon the tents , and the rains drowned out the inmates . If a man can possibly avoid it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be called a " skulker , " or a " shyster , " that desires to escape the impending battle . Twenty hot , feverish , tossing men , confined in a small tent , like an oven , and exposed to contumely and bad food , should get a wholesome horror of war and glory . So far as I could observe and learn , the authorities at White House carried high heads , and covetous hands . In brief , they lived like princes , and behaved like knaves . There was one  --  whose conduct has never been investigated  --  who furnished one of the deserted mansions near by , and brought a lady from the North to keep it in order . He drove a span that rivalled anything in Broadway , and his wines were luscious . His establishment reminded me of that of Napoleon III . in the late Italian war , and yet , this man was receiving merely a Colonel 's pay . My impression is that everybody at White House robbed the Government , and in the end , to cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity of stores , and squared their accounts thus : " Burned on the Pamunkey , June 28 , commissary , quartermaster 's , and hospital stores , one million dollars . " The time was now drawing to a close that I should pass amid the familiar scenes of this region . The good people at Daker 's were still kindly ; but having climbed into the great bed one night , I found my legs aching , my brain violently throbbing , my chest full of pain and my eyes weak . When I woke in the morning my lips were fevered , I could eat nothing , and when I reached my saddle , it seemed that I should faint . In a word , the Chickahominy fever had seized upon me . My ride to New Bridge was marked by great agony , and during much of the time I was quite blind . I turned off , at Gaines 's Mill , to rest at Captain Kingwalt 's ; but the old gentleman was in the grip of the ague , and I forebore to trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a cup of tea , which I could not drink , and Fogg made me lie on his " poncho . " It was like old times come back , to hear them all speak cheerfully , and the man Clover said that if there " war n't " a battle soon , he knew what he 'd do , he did ! he 'd go home , straight as a buck ! " Becoz , " said the man Clover , flourishing his hands , " I volunteered to fight . To fight , sir ! not to dig and drive team . Here we air , sir , stuck in the mud , burnin ' with fever , livin ' on hardtack . And thair 's Richmond ! Just thair ! You can chuck a stone at it , if you mind to . A'ter awhile them rebbils 'll pop out , and fix us . Why ai n't we led up , sa-a-y ? " The man Clover represented common sentiment among the troops at this time ; but I told him that in all probability he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so far correct , that when I met the man Clover on the James River , a week afterward , he said , with a rueful countenance  --  " Sa-a-a-y ! It never rains but it pours , does it ? " As I rode from the camp of the Pennsylvania Reserves , at noon , on the 21st of June , I seemed to feel a gloomy premonition of the calamities that were shortly to fall upon the " Army of the Potomac . " I passed in front of Hogan house ; through the wood above the mill ; along Gaines 's Lane , between his mansion and his barn ; across a creek , tributary to the Chickahominy ; and up the ploughed hills by a military road , toward Grapevine Bridge . Lieutenant-Colonel Heath , of the Fifth Maine Regiment , was riding with me , and we stopped at the tip of an elevated field to look back upon the scene . I was very sick and weary , and I lay my head upon the mane of my nag , while Heath threw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure ; we both gazed earnestly . The river lay in the hollow or ravine to the left , and a few farm-houses sat among the trees on the hill-tops beyond . A battery was planted at each house , and we could see the lines of red-clay parapets marking the sites . From the roof of one of the houses floated a speck of canvas ,  --  the revolutionary flag . A horseman or two moved shadow-like across a slope of yellow grain . Before and back the woods belted the landscape , and some pickets of both sides paced the river brink : they did not fire upon each other . Our side of the Chickahominy was not less peaceful . A couple of batteries lay below us , in the meadows ; but the horses were dozing in the harness , and the gunners , standing bolt upright at the breech , seemed parts of their pieces ; the teamsters lay grouped in the long grass . Immediately in front , Gaines 's Mansion and outhouses spotted a hillside , and we could note beyond a few white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old mill crouched between a medley of wavy fields and woods , to our right , and just at our feet a tiny rill divided Gaines 's Mill from our own . Behind us , over the wilderness of swamp and bog-timber , rose Smith 's redoubt , with the Federal flag flaunting from the rampart . " Townsend , " said Heath , as he swept the whole country with his keen eye , " do you know that we are standing upon historic ground ? " He had been a poet and an orator , and he seemed to feel the solemnity of the place . " It may become historic to-morrow , " I replied . " It is so to-day , " he said , earnestly ; " not from battle as yet ; that may or may not happen ; but in the pause before the storm there is something grand ; and this is the pause . " He took his soft beaver in his hand , and his short red hair stood pugnaciously back from his fine forehead . " The men that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place ; young McClellan , and bluff , bull-headed Franklin ; the one-armed devil , Kearney , and handsome Joe Hooker ; gray , gristly Heintzelman ; white-bearded , insane Sumner ; Stuart , Lee , Johnston , the Hills  --   --  " " Why not , " said I , laughingly , " Eric the red ,  --  the redoubtable Heath ! " " Why not ? " he said , with a flourish ; " Fate may have something in store for me , as well as for these . " I have thought , since , how terribly our light conversation found verification in fact . If I had said to Heath , that , at the very moment , Jefferson Davis and his Commander-in-chief were sitting in the dwelling opposite , reconnoitring and consulting ; that , even now , their telescopes were directed upon us ; that the effect of their counsel was to be manifest in less than a week ; that one of the bloodiest battles of modern times was to be fought beside and around us ; that six days of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my friend and comrade was standing upon the same clods which would be reddened , at his next coming , with his heart 's blood ; and that the trenches were to yawn beneath his hoofs , to swallow himself and his steed ,  --  if I had foretold these things as they were to occur , I wonder if the " pause before the storm " would have been less awful , and our ride campward less sedate . Poor Heath ! Gallant New Englander ! he called at my bedside , the sixth day following , as I lay full of pain , fear , and fever , and after he bade me good by , I heard his horse 's hoofs ringing down the lane . Ten minutes afterward he was shot through the head . When I reached Michie 's , at three o'clock , I had to be helped from the saddle , and the fever was raging in my whole body before nightfall . My hands were flushed , my face hot , but my feet were quite cold , and I was seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Mrs. Michie made me a bowl of scorching tea , and one of the black-girls bathed my limbs in boiling water . The fever dreams came to me that night , in snatches of burning sleep , and toward morning I lay restlessly awake , moving from side to side , famishing for drink , but rejecting it , when they brought it to my lips . The next day , my kind hostess gave me some nourishing soup , but after a vain effort to partake of it , I was compelled to put it aside . O'Ganlon procured some pickled fruit and vegetables from a sutler , which I ate voraciously , quaffing the vinegar like wine . Some of my regimental friends heard of my illness , and they sent me quiet luxuries , which gladdened me , though I did not eat . During the day I had some moments of ease , when I tried to read . There was a copy of Wordsworth 's poems in the house , and I used to repeat stanzas from " Peter Bell , " till they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain , and continued to scan and jangle far into the nights . Some of these fever-dreams were like delusions in delirium : peopled with monsters , that grinned and growled . Little black globules used to leer from corners , and after a time they began to revolve toward me , increasing as they came , and at length rolling like mountains of surge . I frequently woke with a scream , and found my body in profuse perspiration . There were fiery snakes , also , that , at first , moved slowly around me , and I followed them with red and terrified eyes . After awhile they flashed in circles of lightning , and hissed showers of sparks , until I became quite crazed with fear . The most horrible apparitions used to come to my bedside , and if I dropped to sleep with any thought half formed or half developed , the odd half of that thought became impregnated , somehow , and straightway loomed up a goblin , or a giant , or a grotesque something , that proceeded to torture me , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amid all these ghastly things , there came beautiful glimpses of form , scene , and sensation , that straightway changed to horrors . I remember , for example , that I was gliding down a stream , where the boughs overhead were as shady as the waters , and there were holy eyes that seemed to cool my fever ; but suddenly the stream became choked with corpses , that entangled their dead limbs with mine , until I strangled and called aloud ,  --  waking up O'Ganlon and some reporters who proposed to give me morphine , that I might not alarm the house . How the poor soldiers fared , in the hot hospitals , I shudder to think ; but a more merciful decree spared my life , and kind treatment met me at every hand . Otherwise , I believe , I should not be alive to-day to write this story ; for the fever had seized me in its severest form , and I had almost tutored myself to look upon my end , far from my home and on the very eve of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to White House , and started thither one day , to obtain a berth for me upon a Sanitary steamer . The next day an ambulance came to the door . I tried to sit up in bed , and succeeded ; I feebly robed myself and staggered to the stairs . I crawled , rather than walked , to the hall below ; but when I took a chair , and felt the cool ! Boom ! Boom ! " pealed some cannon at the moment , and all the windows shook with the concussion . Directly we heard volleys of musketry , and then the camps were astir . Horses went hither and thither ; signal flags flashed to-and-fro ; a battery of the Reserve Artillery dashed down the lane . I felt my strength coming back with the excitement ; I even smiled feebly as the guns thundered past . " Take away your ambulance , old fellow , " I said , " I sha n't go home till I see a battle . " CHAPTER XV . TWO DAYS OF BATTLE . The Confederates had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his delay they had gathered the whole of their available strength from remote Tennessee , from the Mississippi , and from the coast , until , confident and powerful , they crossed Meadow Bridge on the 26th of June , 1862 , and drove in our right wing at Mechanicsville . The reserves of Gen. McCall were stationed here ; they made a wavering resistance ,  --  wherein four companies of Bucktails were captured bodily ,  --  and fell back at nightfall upon Porter 's Corps , at Gaines 's Mill . Fitz John Porter commanded the brigades of Gens . Sykes and Morrell ,  --  the former made up solely of regulars . He appeared to have been ignorant of the strength of the attacking party , and he telegraphed to McClellan , early on Thursday evening , that he required no reinforcements , and that he could hold his ground . The next morning he was attacked in front and flank ; Stewart 's cavalry fell on his right , and turned it at Old Church . He formed at noon in new line of battle , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coal Harbor ; but stubbornly persisted in the belief that he could not be beaten . By three o'clock he had been driven back two miles , and all his energies were unavailing to recover a foot of ground . He hurled lancers and cavalry upon the masses of Jackson and the Hills , but the butternut infantry formed impenetrable squares , hemmed in with rods of steel , and as the horsemen galloped around them , searching for previous points , they were swept from their saddles with volleys of musketry . He directed the terrible fire of his artillery upon them , but though the gray footmen fell in heaps , they steadily advanced , closing up the gaps , and their lines were like long stretches of blaze and ball . Their fire never slackened nor abated . They loaded and moved forward , column on column , like so many immortals that could not be vanquished . The scene from the balloon , as Lowe informed me , was awful beyond all comparison ,  --  of puffing shells and shrieking shrapnel , with volleys that shattered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , artillery , and horse turned the Federal right from time to time , and to preserve their order of battle the whole line fell back toward Grapevine Bridge . At five o'clock Slocum 's Division of volunteers crossed the creek from the south side , and made a desperate dash upon the solid columns of the Confederates . At the same time Toombs 's Georgia Brigade charged Smith 's redoubt from the south side , and there was a probability of the whole of both armies engaging before dark . My fever of body had so much relinquished to my fever of mind , that at three o'clock I called for my horse , and determined to cross the bridge , that I might witness the battle . It was with difficulty that I could make my way along the narrow corduroy , for hundreds of wounded were limping from the field to the safe side , and ammunition wagons were passing the other way , driven by reckless drivers who should have been blown up momentarily . Before I had reached the north side of the creek , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge . A few carried muskets , but I saw several wantonly throw their pieces into the flood , and as the mass were unarmed , I inferred that they had made similar dispositions . Fear , anguish , cowardice , despair , disgust , were the predominant expressions of the upturned faces . The gaunt trees , towering from the current , cast a solemn shadow upon the moving throng , and as the evening dimness was falling around them , it almost seemed that they were engulfed in some cataract . I reined my horse close to the side of a team , that I might not be borne backward by the crowd ; but some of the lawless fugitives seized him by the bridle , and others attempted to pull me from the saddle . " Gi ' up that hoss ! " said one , " what business you got wi ' a hoss ? " " That 's my critter , and I am in for a ride ; so you get off ! " said another . I spurred my pony vigorously with the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridle under the chin . The thick column parted left and right , and though a howl of hate pursued me , I kept straight to the bank , cleared the swamp , and took the military route parallel with the creek , toward the nearest eminence . At every step of the way I met wounded persons . A horseman rode past me , leaning over his pommel , with blood streaming from his mouth and hanging in gouts from his saturated beard . The day had been intensely hot and black boys were besetting the wounded with buckets of cool lemonade . It was a common occurrence for the couples that carried the wounded on stretchers to stop on the way , purchase a glass of the beverage , and drink it . Sometimes the blankets on the stretchers were closely folded , and then I knew that the man within was dead . A little fellow , who used his sword for a cane , stopped me on the road , and said  --  " See yer ! This is the ball that jes ' fell out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lump of lead as big as my thumb , and pointed to a rent in his pantaloons , whence the drops rolled down his boots . " I would n't part with that for suthin ' handsome , " he said ; " it 'll be nice to hev to hum . " As I cantered away he shouted after me  --  " Be sure you spell my name right ! it 's Smith , with an ' E '  --  S-M-I-T-H-E . " In one place I met five drunken men escorting a wounded sergeant ; the latter had been shot in the jaw , and when he attempted to speak , the blood choked his articulation . " You let go him , pardner , " said one of the staggering brutes , " he 's not your sergeant . Go ' way ! " " Now , sergeant , " said the other , idiotically , " I 'll see you all right , sergeant . Come , Bill , fetch him over to the corn-crib and we 'll give him a drink . " Here the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrath , knocked them both down . All this time the enemy 's cannon were booming close at hand . I came to an officer of rank , whose shoulder-emblem I could not distinguish , riding upon a limping field-horse . Four men held him to his seat , and a fifth led the animal . The officer was evidently wounded , though he did not seem to be bleeding , and the dust of battle had settled upon his blanched , stiffening face , like grave-mould upon a corpse . He was swaying in the saddle , and his hair  --  for he was bare-headed  --  shook across his white eyeballs . He reminded me of the famous Cid , whose body was sent forth to scare the Saracens . A mile or more from Grapevine Bridge , on a hill-top , lay a frame farm-house , with cherry trees encircling it , and along the declivity of the hill were some cabins , corn-sheds , and corn-bins . The house was now a Surgeon 's headquarters , and the wounded lay in the yard and lane , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I caught a glimpse through the door , of the butchers and their victims ; some curious people were peeping through the windows at the operation . As the processions of freshly wounded went by , the poor fellows , lying on their backs , looked mutely at me , and their great eyes smote my heart . Something has been written in the course of the war upon straggling from the ranks , during battle . But I have seen nothing that conveys an adequate idea of the number of cowards and idlers that so stroll off . In this instance , I met squads , companies , almost regiments of them . Some came boldly along the road ; others skulked in woods , and made long detours to escape detection ; a few were composedly playing cards , or heating their coffee , or discussing the order and consequences of the fight . The rolling drums , the constant clatter of file and volley-firing ,  --  nothing could remind them of the requirements of the time and their own infamy . Their appreciation of duty and honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor patriotism could force them back ; but when the columns of mounted provosts charged upon them , they sullenly resumed their muskets and returned to the field . At the foot of the hill to which I have referred the ammunition wagons lay in long lines , with the horses ' heads turned from the fight . A little beyond stood the ambulances ; and between both sets of vehicles , fatigue-parties were going and returning to and from the field . At the top of the next hill sat many of the Federal batteries , and I was admonished by the shriek of shells that passed over my head and burst far behind me , that I was again to look upon carnage and share the perils of the soldier . The question at once occurred to me : Can I stand fire ? Having for some months penned daily paragraphs relative to death , courage , and victory , I was surprised to find that those words were now unusually significant . " Death " was a syllable to me before ; it was a whole dictionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week ago ; it was rarer than genius to-day . " Victory " was the first word in the lexicon of youth yesterday noon ; " discretion " and " safety " were at present of infinitely more consequence . I resolved , notwithstanding these qualms , to venture to the hill-top : but at every step flitting projectiles took my breath . The music of the battle-field , I have often thought , should be introduced in opera . Not the drum , the bugle , or the fife , though these are thrilling , after their fashion ; but the music of modern ordnance and projectile , the beautiful whistle of the minie-ball , the howl of shell that makes unearthly havoc with the air , the whiz-z-z of solid shot , the chirp of bullets , the scream of grape and canister , the yell of immense conical cylinders , that fall like redhot stoves and spout burning coals . All these passed over , beside , beneath , before , behind me . I seemed to be an invulnerable something at whom some cunning juggler was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to strike him . I rode like one with his life in his hand , and , so far as I remember , seemed to think of nothing . No fear , per se ; no regret ; no adventure ; only expectancy . It was the expectancy of a shot , a choking , a loud cry , a stiffening , a dead , dull tumble , a quiver , and  --  blindness . But with this was mingled a sort of enjoyment , like that of the daring gamester , who has played his soul and is waiting for the decision of the cards . I felt all his suspense , more than his hope ; and withal , there was excitement in the play . Now a whistling ball seemed to pass just under my ear , and before I commenced to congratulate myself upon the escape , a shell , with a showery and revolving fuse , appeared to take the top off my head . Then my heart expanded and contracted , and somehow I found myself conning rhymes . At each clipping ball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of coldness and paleness rose to the very roots of my hair , and was then replaced by a hot flush . I caught myself laughing , syllabically , and shrugging my shoulders , fitfully . Once , the rhyme that came to my lips  --  for I am sure there was no mind in the iteration  --  was the simple nursery prayer  --  " Now I lay me down to sleep , " I continued to say " down to sleep , " " down to sleep , " " down to sleep , " till I discovered myself , when I ceased . Then a shell , apparently just in range , dashed toward me , and the words spasmodically leaped up : " Now 's your time . This is your billet . " With the same insane pertinacity I continued to repeat " Now 's your time , now 's your time , " and " billet , billet , billet , " till at last I came up to the nearest battery , where I could look over the crest of the hill ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volcano , or down the fabled abyss into hell , the whole grand horror of a battle burst upon my sight . For a moment I could neither feel nor think . I scarcely beheld , or beholding did not understand or perceive . Only the roar of guns , the blaze that flashed along a zigzag line and was straightway smothered in smoke , the creek lying glassily beneath me , the gathering twilight , and the brownish blue of woods ! I only knew that some thousands of fiends , were playing with fire and tossing brands at heaven ,  --  that some pleasant slopes , dells , and highlands were lit as if the conflagration of universes had commenced . There is a passage of Holy Writ that comes to my mind as I write , which explains the sensation of the time better than I can do :  --  " He opened the bottomless pit ; and there arose a smoke out of the pit , as the smoke of a great furnace ; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoke locusts upon the earth. "  --  Revelation , ix . 2 , 3 . In a few moments , when I was able to compose myself , the veil of cloud blew away or dissolved , and I could see fragments of the long columns of infantry . Then from the far end of the lines puffed smoke , and from man to man the puff ran down each line , enveloping the columns again , so that they were alternately visible and invisible . At points between the masses of infantry lay field-pieces , throbbing with rapid deliveries , and emitting volumes of white steam . Now and then the firing slackened for a short time , when I could remark the Federal line , fringed with bayonets , stretching from the low meadow on the left , up the slope , over the ridge , up and down the crest , until its right disappeared in the gloaming of wood and distance . Standards flapped here and there above the column , and I knew , from the fact that the line became momentarily more distinct , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a battery would dash a hundred yards forward , unlimber , and fire a score of times , and directly would return two hundred yards and blaze again . I saw a regiment of lancers gather at the foot of a protecting swell of field ; the bugle rang thrice , the red pennons went upward like so many song birds , the mass turned the crest and disappeared , then the whole artillery belched and bellowed . In twenty minutes a broken , straggling , feeble group of horsemen returned ; the red pennons still fluttered , but I knew that they were redder for the blood that dyed them . Finally , the Federal infantry fell back to the foot of the hill on which I stood ; all the batteries were clustering around me , and suddenly a column of men shot up from the long sweep of the abandoned hill , with batteries on the left and right . Their muskets were turned towards us , a crash and a whiff of smoke swept from flank to flank , and the air around me rained buck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now occurred in rapid succession were so thrilling and absorbing that my solicitude was lost in their grandeur . I sat like one dumb , with my soul in my eyes and my ears stunned , watching the terrible column of Confederates . Each party was now straining every energy ,  --  the one for victory , the other against annihilation . The darkness was closing in , and neither cared to prolong the contest after night . The Confederates , therefore , aimed to finish their success with the rout or capture of the Federals , and the Federals aimed to maintain their ground till nightfall . The musketry was close , accurate , and uninterrupted . Every second was marked by a discharge ,  --  the one firing , the other replying promptly . No attempt was now made to remove the wounded ; the coolness of the fight had gone by , and we witnessed only its fury . The stragglers seemed to appreciate the desperate emergency , and came voluntarily back to relieve their comrades . The cavalry was massed , and collected for another grand charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they precipitated themselves upon the columns : the musketry ceased for the time , and shrieks , steel strokes , the crack of carbines and revolvers succeeded . Shattered , humiliated , sullen , the horse wheeled and returned . Then the guns thundered again , and by the blaze of the pieces , the clods and turf were revealed , fitfully strewn with men and horses . The vicinity of my position now exhibited traces of the battle . A caisson burst close by , and I heard the howl of dying wretches , as the fires flashed like meteors . A solid shot struck a field-carriage not thirty yards from my feet , and one of the flying splinters spitted a gunner as if he had been pierced by an arrow . An artillery-man was standing with folded arms so near that I could have reached to touch him ; a whistle and a thumping shock and he fell beneath my nag 's head . I wonder , as I calmly recall these episodes now , how I escaped the death that played about me , chilled me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are fixing bayonets for a charge . My God ! See them come down the hill . " In the gathering darkness , through the thick smoke , I saw or seemed to see the interminable column roll steadily downward . I fancied that I beheld great gaps cut in their ranks though closing solidly up , like the imperishable Gorgon . I may have heard some of this next day , and so confounded the testimonies of eye and ear . But I knew that there was a charge , and that the drivers were ordered to stand by their saddles , to run off the guns at any moment . The descent and bottom below me , were now all ablaze , and directly above the din of cannon , rifle , and pistol , I heard a great cheer , as of some salvation achieved . " The Rebels are repulsed ! We have saved the guns ! " A cheer greeted this announcement from the battery-men around me . They reloaded , rammed , swabbed , and fired , with naked arms , and drops of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood motionless , quivering not half so much as the pieces . The gristly officers held to their match-strings , smothering the excitement of the time . All at once there was a running hither and thither , a pause in the thunder , a quick consultation  --  " ' Sdeath ! They have flanked us again . " In an instant I seemed overwhelmed with men . For a moment I thought the enemy had surrounded us . " It 's all up , " said one ; " I shall cross the river . " I wheeled my horse , fell in with the stream of fugitives , and was borne swiftly through field and lane and trampled fence to the swampy margin of the Chickahominy . At every step the shell fell in and among the fugitives , adding to their panic . I saw officers who had forgotten their regiments or had been deserted by them , wending with the mass . The wounded fell and were trodden upon . Personal exhibitions of valor and determination there were ; but the main body had lost heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge , there was confusion and altercation ahead . The people were borne back upon me . Curses and threats ensued . " It is the Provost-guard , " said a fugitive , " driving back the boys . " " Go back ! " called a voice ahead . " I 'll blow you to h  --  ll , if you do n't go back ! Not a man shall cross the bridge without orders ! " The stragglers were variously affected by this intelligence . Some cursed and threatened ; some of the wounded blubbered as they leaned languidly upon the shoulders of their comrades . Others stoically threw themselves on the ground and tried to sleep . One man called aloud that the " boys " were stronger than the Provosts , and that , therefore , the " boys " ought to " go in and win . " " Where 's the man that wants to mutiny ? " said the voice ahead ; " let me see him ! " The man slipped away ; for the Provost officer spoke as though he meant all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called others . " Three cheers for the Union . " The wounded and well threw up their hats together , and made a sickly hurrah . The grim officer relented , and he shouted stentoriously that he would take the responsibility of passing the wounded . These gathered themselves up and pushed through the throng ; but many skulkers plead injuries , and so escaped . When I attempted to follow , on horseback , hands were laid upon me and I was refused exit . In that hour of terror and sadness , there were yet jests and loud laughter . However keenly I felt these things , I had learned that modesty amounted to little in the army ; so I pushed my nag steadily forward and scattered the camp vernacular , in the shape of imprecations , left and right . " Colonel , " I called to the officer in command , as the line of bayonets edged me in , " may I pass out ? I am a civilian ! " " No ! " said the Colonel , wrathfully . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I want to get away . " " Pass out ! " I followed the winding of the woods to Woodbury 's Bridge ,  --  the next above Grapevine Bridge . The approaches were clogged with wagons and field-pieces , and I understood that some panic-stricken people had pulled up some of the timbers to prevent a fancied pursuit . Along the sides of the bridge many of the wounded were washing their wounds in the water , and the cries of the teamsters echoed weirdly through the trees that grew in the river . At nine o'clock , we got under way ,  --  horsemen , batteries , ambulances , ammunition teams , infantry , and finally some great siege 32s. that had been hauled from Gaines 's House . One of these pieces broke down the timbers again , and my impression is that it was cast into the current . When we emerged from the swamp timber , the hills before us were found brilliantly illuminated with burning camps . I made toward head-quarters , in one of Trent 's fields ; but all the tents save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagons stretched southward until they were lost in the shadows . The tent of General McClellan alone remained , and beneath an arbor of pine boughs , close at hand , he sat , with his Corps Commanders and Aides , holding a council of war . A ruddy fire lit up the historical group , and I thought at the time , as I have said a hundred times since , that the consultation might be selected for a grand national painting . The crisis , the hour , the adjuncts , the renowned participants , peculiarly fit it for pictorial commemoration . The young commander sat in a chair , in full uniform , uncovered . Heintzelman was kneeling upon a fagot , earnestly speaking . De Joinville sat apart , by the fire , examining a map . Fitz John Porter was standing back of McClellan , leaning upon his chair . Keyes , Franklin , and Sumner , were listening attentively . Some sentries paced to and fro , to keep out vulgar curiosity . Suddenly , there was a nodding of heads , as of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and galloped off toward Michie 's . As I reined at Michie 's porch , at ten o'clock , the bridges behind me were blown up , with a flare that seemed a blazing of the Northern Lights . The family were sitting upon the porch , and Mrs. Michie was greatly alarmed with the idea that a battle would be fought round her house next day . O'Ganlon , of Meagher 's staff , had taken the fever , and sent anxiously for me , to compare our symptoms . I bade the good people adieu before I went to bed , and gave the man " Pat " a dollar to stand by my horse while I slept , and to awake me at any disturbance , that I might be ready to scamper . The man " Pat , " I am bound to say , woke me up thrice by the exclamation of  --  " Sure , yer honor , there 's  --  well  --  to pay in the yard ! I think ye and the Doctor had better ride off . " On each of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonesome , and wanted somebody to speak to . What a sleep was mine that night ! I forgot my fever . But another and a hotter fever burned my temples ,  --  the fearful excitement of the time ! Whither were we to go , cut off from the York , beaten before Richmond ,  --  perhaps even now surrounded ,  --  and to be butchered to-morrow , till the clouds should rain blood ? Were we to retreat one hundred miles down the hostile Peninsula ,  --  a battle at every rod , a grave at every footstep ? Then I remembered the wounded heaped at Gaines 's Mill , and how they were groaning without remedy , ebbing at every pulse , counting the flashing drops , calling for water , for mercy , for death . So I found heart ; for I was not buried yet . And somehow I felt that fate was to take me , as the great poet took Dante , through other and greater horrors . CHAPTER XVI . M'CLELLAN 'S RETREAT . The scene presented in Michie 's lawn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and characteristic of the calamity of war . The well was beset by crowds of wounded men , perishing of thirst , who made frantic efforts to reach the bucket , but were borne back by the stronger desperadoes . The kitchen was swarming with hungry soldiers who begged corn-bread and half-cooked dough from the negroes . The shady side-yard was dotted with pale , bruised , and bleeding people , who slept out their weariness upon the damp grass , forgetful , for the moment , of their sores . Ambulances poured through the lane , in solemn procession , and now and then , couples of privates bore by some wounded officer , upon a canvas " stretcher . " The lane proving too narrow , at length , for the passing vehicles , the gate-posts and fence were torn up , and finally , the soldiers made a footway of the hall of the dwelling . The retreat had been in progress all night , as I had heard the wagons through my open windows . By daylight the whole army was acquainted with the facts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , relinquish the North bank of the river , and retire precipitately to the shores of the James . A rumor  --  indignantly denied , but as often repeated  --  prevailed among the teamsters , surgeons , and drivers , that the wounded were to be left in the enemy 's hands . It shortly transpired that we were already cut off from the Pamunkey . A train had departed for White House at dawn , and had delivered its cargo of mortality safely ; but a second train , attempting the passage , at seven o'clock had been fired into , and compelled to return . A tremendous explosion , and a shaft of white smoke that flashed to the zenith , informed us , soon afterward , that the railroad bridge had been blown up . About the same time , the roar of artillery recommenced in front , and regiments that had not slept for twenty hours , were hurried past us , to take position at the entrenchments . A universal fear now found expression , and helpless people asked of each other , with pale lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the James ? " It was doubtful , at this time , that any one knew the route to that river . A few members of the signal corps had adventured thither to open communication with the gunboats , and a small cavalry party of Casey 's division had made a foray to New Market and Charles City Court House . But it was rumored that Wise 's brigade of Confederates was now posted at Malvern Hills , closing up the avenue of escape , and that the whole right wing of the Confederate army was pushing toward Charles City . Malvern Hills , the nearest point that could be gained , was about twenty miles distant , and Harrison 's Landing  --  presumed to be our final destination  --  was thirty miles away . To retreat over this distance , encumbered with baggage , the wounded and the sick , was discarded as involving pursuit , and certain calamity . Cavalry might fall upon us at every turning , since the greater portion of our own horse had been scouting between White House and Hanover , when the bridges were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At eight o'clock  --  weak with fever and scarcely able to keep in the saddle  --  I joined Mr. Anderson of the Herald , and rode toward the front , that I might discover the whereabouts of the new engagement . Winding through a cart-track in Michie 's Woods , we came upon fully one third of the whole army , or the remnant of all that portion engaged at Gaines 's Mill ;  --  the Reserves , Porter 's Corps , Slocum 's division , and Meagher 's brigade ,  --  perhaps thirty-thousand men . They covered the whole of Tent 's farm , and were drawn up in line , heavily equipped , with their colors in position , field officers dismounted , and detachments from each regiment preparing hot coffee at certain fires . A very few wagons  --  and these containing only ammunition  --  stood harnessed beside each regiment . In many cases the men lay or knelt upon the ground . Such hot , hungry , weary wretches , I never beheld . During the whole night long they had been crossing the Chickahominy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snatches upon the bare clay . Travelling from place to place , I saw the surviving heroes of the defeat : Meagher looking very yellow and prosaic ; Slocum ,  --  small , indomitable , active ; Newton ,  --  a little gray , a trifle proud , very mercurial , and curiously enough , a Virginian ; Meade ,  --  lithe , spectacled , sanguine ; and finally General McCall , as grave , kindly odd and absent , as I had found him four months before . The latter worthy was one of the first of the Federal Generals to visit Richmond . He was taken prisoner the second day afterward , and the half of his command was slain or disabled . I went to and fro , obtaining the names of killed , wounded and missing , with incidents of the battle as well as its general plan . These I scrawled upon bits of newspaper , upon envelopes , upon the lining of my hat , and finally upon my shirt wristbands . I was literally filled with notes before noon , and if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name would have been extremely difficult . I should have had more titles than some of the Chinese princes ; some parts of me would have been found fatally wounded , and others italicized for gallant behavior . Indeed , I should have been shot in every part , taken prisoner at every place , killed outright in every skirmish , and marvellously saved through every peril . My tombstone would have been some hundreds of muster-rolls and my obituary a fortune to a newspaper . I recollect , with some amusement , the credit that each regiment took upon itself for distinguished behavior . There were few Colonels that did not claim all the honors . I fell in with a New Jersey brigade , that had been decimated of nearly half its quota , and a spruce young Major attempted to convey an idea of the battle to me . He said , in brief , that the New Jersey brigade , composed mainly of himself and his regiment , and some few organizations of little consequence ,  --  although numbering ten thousand odd soldiers ,  --  had received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The said " Rebels " appeared to make up one fourth part of the population of the globe . There was no end to them . They seemed to be several miles deep , longer and more crooked than the Pamunkey , and stood with their rear against Richmond , so that they could n't fall back , even if they wanted to . In vain did the New Jersey brigade and his regiment attack them with ball and bayonet . How the " Rebels " ever withstood the celebrated charge of his regiment was altogether inexplicable . In the language of the Major ,  --  " the New Jersey brigade ,  --  and my regiment ,  --  fit , and fit , and fit , and give ' em ' get out ! ' But sir , may I be  --   --  , well there ( expression inadequate ) , we could n't budge ' em . No , sir ! ( very violently , ) not budge ' em , sir ! I told the boys to walk at ' em with cold steel . Says I : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' under heaven ! ' Well , sir , at ' em we went ,  --  me and the boys . There ai n't been no sich charge in the whole war ! Not in the whole war , sir ! ( intensely fervid ; ) leave it to any impartial observer if there has been ! We went up the hill , square in the face of all their artillery , musketry , cavalry , sharpshooters , riflemen ,  --  everything , sir ! Everything ! ( energetically . ) One o ' my men overheard the Rebel General say , as we came up : says he ,  --  ' that 's the gamest thing I ever see . ' Well ! we butchered ' em frightful . We must a killed a thousand or two of ' em , do n't you think so , Adjutant ? But , sir ,  --  it was all in vain . No go , sir ! no , sir , no go ! ( impressively . ) And the New Jersey brigade and my regiment fell back , inch by inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Is that so , boys ? " The " boys , " who had meantime gathered around , exclaimed loudly , that it was " true as preachin , " and the Major added , in an undertone that his name was spelled * * * . " But where were Porter 's columns ? " said I , " and the Pennsylvania Reserves ? " " I did n't see ' em , " said the Major : " I do n't think they was there . If they had a been , why wa' n't they on hand to save my regiment , and the New Jersey brigade ? " It would be wrong to infer from these vauntings , that the Federals did not fight bravely and endure defeat unshrinkingly . On the contrary , I have never read of higher exemplifications of personal and moral courage , than I witnessed during this memorable retreat . And the young Major 's boasting did not a whit reduce my estimate of his efficiency . For in America , swaggering does not necessarily indicate cowardice . I knew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wordier than Gratiano , and who exaggerated like Falstaff . But he was a lion in action , and at Lee 's Mills and Williamsburg his battery was handled with consummate skill . From Trent 's farm the roadway led by a strip of corduroy , through sloppy , swampy woods , to an open place , beyond a brook , where Smith 's division lay . The firing had almost entirely ceased , and we heard loud cheers running up and down the lines , as we again ventured within cannon range . On this spot , for the second time , the Federals had won a decided success . And in so far as a cosmopolitan could feel elated , I was proud , for a moment , of the valor of my division . The victors had given me meals and a bed , and they had fed my pony when both of us were hungry . But the sight of the prisoners and the collected dead , saddened me somewhat . These two engagements have received the name of the First and Second battles of Golding 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia brigade to carry the redoubt and breastworks of General Smith . Toombs was a civilian , and formerly a senator from Georgia . He had no military ability , and his troops were driven back with great slaughter , both on Friday and Saturday . Among the prisoners taken was Colonel Lamar of ( I think ) the 7th Georgia regiment . He passed me , in a litter , wounded , as I rode toward the redoubt . Lamar was a beautiful man , shaped like a woman , and his hair was long , glossy , and wavy with ringlets . He was a tiger , in his love of blood , and in character self-willed and vehement . He was of that remarkable class of Southern men , of which the noted " Filibuster " Walker was the great exponent . I think I may call him an apostle of slavery . He believed it to be the destiny of our pale race to subdue all the dusky tribes of the earth , and to evangelize , with the sword , the whole Western continent , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called disciples of " manifest destiny . " He threw his whole heart into the war ; but when I saw him , bloodless , panting , quivering , I thought how little the wrath of man availed against the justice of God . From Smith 's on the right , I kept along a military road , in the woods , to Sedgwick 's and Richardson 's divisions , at Fairoaks . Richardson was subsequently slain , at the second battle of Bull Run . He was called " Fighting Dick , " and on this particular morning was talking composedly to his wife , as she was about to climb to the saddle . His tent had been taken down , and soldiers were placing his furniture in a wagon . A greater contrast I never remarked , than the ungainly , awkward , and rough General , with his slight , trim , pretty companion . She had come to visit him and had remained until commanded to retire . I fancied , though I was separated some distance , that the little woman wept , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with frequent gestures of good-hap , till she disappeared behind the woods . I do not know that such prosaic old soldiers are influenced by the blandishments of love ; but " Fighting Dick " never wooed death so recklessly as in the succeeding engagements of New Market and Malvern Hills . From Seven Pines to the right of Richardson 's head-quarters , ran a line of alternate breastwork , redoubt , and stockade . The best of these redoubts was held by Captain Petit , with a New York Volunteer battery . I had often talked with Petit , for he embodied , as well as any man in the army , the martial qualifications of a volunteer . He despised order . Nobody cared less for dress and dirt . I have seen him , sitting in a hole that he hollowed with his hands , tossing pebbles and dust over his head , like another Job . He had profound contempt for any man and any system that was not " American . " I remember asking him , one day , the meaning of the gold lace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Means run like shell ! " said Petit , covering me with dirt . " Do n't the Irish make the best soldiers ? " I ventured . " No ! " said Petit , raining pebbles , " I had rather have one American than ten Irishmen . " The fighting of Petit was contrary to all rule ; but I think that he was a splendid artillery-man . He generally mounted the rampart , shook his fist at the enemy , flung up his hat , jumped down , sighted the guns himself , threw shells with wonderful accuracy , screamed at the gunners , mounted the rampart again , halloed , and , in short , managed to do more execution , make more noise , attract more attention and throw more dirt than anybody in the army . His redoubt was small , but beautifully constructed , and the parapet was heaped with double rows of sandbags . It mounted rifled field-pieces , and , at most times , the gunners were lying under the pieces , asleep . Not any of the entrenched posts among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trees had been felled in front to give the cannon play , but behind and on each side belts of dense , dwarf timber covered the boggy soil . To the left of Petit , on the old field of Seven Pines , lay the divisions of Hooker and Kearney , and thither I journeyed , after leaving the redoubtable volunteer . Hooker was a New Englander , reputed to be the handsomest man in the army . He fought bravely in the Mexican war , and afterwards retired to San Francisco , where he passed a Bohemian existence at the Union Club House . He disliked McClellan , was beloved by his men , and was generally known as " Old Joe . " He has been one of the most successful Federal leaders , and seems to hold a charmed life . In all probability he will become Commander-in-chief of one of the grand armies . Kearney has passed away since the date of which I speak . He was known as the " one-armed Devil , " and was , by odds , the best educated of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he departed from all tactics , when hotly afield . His personal energy and courage have given him renown , and he loved to lead forlorn hopes , or head storming-parties , or ride upon desperate adventures . He was rich from childhood , and spent much of his life in Europe . For a part of this time he served as a cavalry-man with the French , in Algiers . In private life he was equally reckless , but his tastes were scholarly , and he was generous to a fault . Both Kearney and Hooker were kind to the reporters , and I owe the dead man many a favor . General Daniel Sickles commanded a brigade in this corps . To the left , and in the rear of Heintzelman 's corps , lay the divisions of Casey and Couch , that had relapsed into silence since their disgrace at Seven Pines . General Casey was a thin-haired old gentleman , too gracious to be a soldier , although I believe that he is still in the service . His division comprised the extreme left of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bog called " White Oak Swamp . " It was the purpose of McClellan to place this swamp between him and the enemy , and defend its passage till his baggage and siege artillery had obtained the shelter of the gunboats , on the shores of the James . I rode along this whole line , to renew my impressions of the position , and found that sharp skirmishing was going on at every point . When I returned to Savage 's , where McClellan 's headquarters had temporarily been pitched , I found the last of the wagons creaking across the track , and filing slowly southward . The wounded lay in the out-houses , in the trains of cars , beside the hedge , and in shade of the trees about the dwelling . A little back , beside a wood , lay Lowe 's balloon traps , and the infantry " guard , " and cavalry " escort " of the Commander-in-chief were encamped close to the new provost quarters , in a field beyond the orchard . An ambulance passed me , as I rode into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men with bloody feet , crouched in the trail . From the roof of Savage 's house floated the red hospital flag . Savage himself was a quiet Virginia farmer , and a magistrate . His name is now coupled with a grand battle . I felt very hungry , at four o'clock , but my weak stomach revolted at coarse soldier fare , and I determined to ride back to Michie 's . I was counselled to beware ; but having learned little discretion afield , I cantered off , through a trampled tillage of wheat , and an interminable woods . In a half hour I rode into the familiar yard ; but the place was so ruined that I hardly recognized it . Not a panel of fence remained : the lawn was a great pool of slime ; the windlass had been wrenched from the well ; a few gashed and expiring soldiers lay motionless beneath the oaks , the fields were littered with the remains of camps , and the old dwelling stood like a haunted thing upon a blighted plain . The idlers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was silence ,  --  and in the little front porch sat Mrs. Michie , weeping ; the old gentleman stared at the desolation with a working face , and two small yellow lads lay dolorously upon the steps . They all seemed to brighten up as I appeared at the gate , and when I staggered from my horse , both of them took my hands . I think that tears came into all our eyes at once , and the little Ethiops fairly bellowed . " My friends , " I said , falteringly , " I see how you have suffered , and sympathize with you , from my heart . " " Our beautiful property is ruined , " said Mrs. Michie , welling up . " Yer 's five years of labor ,  --  my children 's heritage ,  --  the home of our old age ,  --  look at it ! " The old gentleman stood up gravely , and cast his eyes mournfully around . " I have nobody to accuse , " he said ; " my grief is too deep for any hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls say when they come back ? " was the mother 's next sob ; " they loved the place : do you think they will know it ? " I did not know how to reply . They retained my hands , and for a moment none of us spoke . " Do n't think , Mr. Townsend , " said the chivalrous old gentleman again , " that we like you less because some of your country people have stripped us . Mother , where is the gruel you made for him ? " The good lady , expecting my return , had prepared some nourishing chicken soup , and directly she produced it . I think she took heart when I ate so plentifully , and we all spoke hopefully again . Their kindness so touched me , that as the evening came quietly about us , lengthening the shadows , and I knew that I must depart , I took both their hands again , doubtful what to say . " My friends ,  --  may I say , almost my parents ? for you have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , you will be with your children again . Richmond will be open to you . You may freely go and come . Be comforted by these assurances . And when the war is over ,  --  God speed the time !  --  we may see each other under happier auspices . " " Good by ! " said Mr. Michie ; " if I have a house at that time , you shall be welcome . " " Good by , " said Mrs. Michie ; " tell your mother that a strange lady in Virginia took good care of you when you were sick . " I waved a final adieu , vaulted down the lane , and the wood gathered its solemn darkness about me . When I emerged upon Savage 's fields , a succession of terrible explosions shook the night , and then the flames flared up , at points along the railroad . They were blowing up the locomotives and burning the cars . At the same hour , though I could not see it , White House was wrapped in fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared from the shores of the Pamunkey . I tossed through another night of fever , in the captain 's tent of the Sturgis Rifles ,  --  McClellan 's body guard . And somehow , again , I dreamed fitfully of the unburied corpses on the field of Gaines 's Mill . CHAPTER XVII . A BATTLE SUNDAY . In the dim of the morning of our Lord 's Sabbath , the twenty-ninth of June , 1862 , I sat in my saddle at Savage 's . The gloom was very cheerless . A feeling of hopeless vagabondism oppressed me . I remembered the Disinherited Knight , the Wandering Jew , Robinson Crusoe , and other poor errants in the wide world , and wondered if any of them ever looked so ruefully as I , when the last wagon of the Grand Army disappeared through the shadow . The tent had been taken down at midnight . I had been dozing in the saddle , with parched lips and throbbing temples , waiting for my comrade . Head-quarters had been intending to move , without doing it , for four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay with the Commanding General , as the Commanding General kept out of danger , and also kept in provisions . I was sick and petulant , and finally quarrelled with my friend . He told me , quietly , that I would regret my harshness when I should be well again . I set off for White Oak , but repented at " Burnt Chimneys , " and turned back . In the misty dawn I saw the maimed still lying on the ground , wrapped in relics of blankets , and in one of the outhouses a grim embalmer stood amid a family of nude corpses . He dealt with the bodies of high officers only ; for , said he  --  " I used to be glad to prepare private soldiers . They were wuth a five dollar bill apiece . But , Lord bless you , a Colonel pays a hundred , and a Brigadier-General two hundred . There 's lots of them now , and I have cut the acquaintance of everything below a Major . I might , " he added , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must pay a Major 's price . I insist upon that ! Such windfalls do n't come every day . There wo n't be another such killing for a century . " A few horsemen of the escort loitered around head-quarters . All the tents but one had been removed , and the staff crouched sleepily upon the refuse straw . The rain began to drizzle at this time , and I unbuckled a blanket to wrap about my shoulders . Several people were lying upon dry places , here and there , and espying some planks a little remote , I tied my horse to a peach-tree , and stretched myself languidly upon my back . The bridal couch or the throne were never so soft as those knotty planks , and the drops that fell upon my forehead seemed to cool my fever . I had passed into a sort of cognizant sleep when a harsh , loud , cruel voice awakened me , and I seemed to see a great Polyphemus , stretching his hands into the clouds , and gaping like an earthquake . " Boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , near at hand , " boy , what are you standing there for ? What in  --   --  do you want ? " " Nothing ! " " Take it , and go ,  --   --   --   --  you ! Take it , and go ! " I peeped timorously from my place , and recognized the Provost-General of the Grand Army . He had been sleeping upon a camp chest , and did not appear to be refreshed thereby . " I feel sulky as  --   --  ! " he said to an officer adjoining ; " I feel  --   - -  bad- humored ! Orderly ! " " General ! " " Whose horses are these ? " " I do n't know , General ! " " Cut every  --   --   --   --  one of ' em loose . Wake up these  --   --   --   --  loafers with the point of your sabre ! Every  --   --   --   --  one of ' em ! That 's what I call  --   --   --   --  boldness ! " He strutted off like the great Bomba or the Czar , and I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position . With a last look at Savage 's white house , the abandoned wretches in the lawn , the blood-red hospital flag , the torn track and smouldering cars , I turned my face southward , crossed some bare plains , that had once been fields , and at eight o'clock passed down the Williamsburg road , toward Bottom Bridge . The original roadway was now a bottomless stretch of sand , full of stranded wheels , dead horses , shreds of blankets , discarded haversacks , and mounds of spilled crackers . Other routes for wagons had been opened across fields , over bluffs , around pits and bogs , and through thickets and woods . The whole country was crossed with deeply-rutted roads , as if some immense city had been lifted away , and only its interminably sinuous streets remained . Near Burnt Chimneys , a creek crossing the road made a ravine , and here I overtook the hindmost of the wagons . They had been stalled in the gorge , and a provost guard was hurrying the laggard teamsters . The creek was muddy beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burnt Chimneys , " a few dumb witnesses that pointed to heaven . A mile or two further , I came to some of the retreating regiments , and also to five of the siege thirty-twos with which Richmond was to have been bombarded . The main army still lay back at their entrenchments to cover the retreat , and at ten o'clock I heard the roar of field guns ; the pursuit had commenced , and the Confederates were pouring over the ramparts at Fairoaks . I did not go back ; battles were of no consequence to me . I wanted some breakfast . If I could only obtain a cup of warm coffee and a fragment of meat , I thought that I might recover strength . But nothing could be obtained anywhere , for money or charity . The soldiers that I passed looked worn and hungry , for their predecessors had swept the country like herds of locusts ; but one cheerful fellow , whom I addressed , produced a lump of fat pork that I tried to eat , but made a signal failure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it remains to this moment . None cared to be hospitable to correspondents at this despondent hour , and a horrible idea of starvation took possession of my mind . A mile from White Oak Swamp , some distance back of the road , lay the Engineer Brigade . They were now on the eve of breaking camp , and when I reached Colonel McCloud Murphy 's , his chests were packed , and all his provisions had gone ahead . He gave me , however , a couple of hard crackers and a draught of whiskey and quinine , whereby I rallied for a moment . At General Woodbury 's I observed a middle-aged lady , making her toilet by a looking-glass hung against the tent-pole . She seemed as careful of her personal appearance , in this trying time , as if she had been at some luxurious court . There were several women on the retreat , and though the guns thundered steadily behind , they were never flurried , but could have received company , or accepted offers of marriage , with the utmost complacency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that no personal danger would have disturbed her while she heightened her roses ; and she would have tied up her back hair in defiance of shell or grape . At Casey 's ancient head-quarters , on the bluff facing White Oak Swamp , I found five correspondents . We fraternized immediately , and they all pooh-poohed the battle , as such an old story that it would be absurd to ride back to the field . We knew , however , that it was occurring at Peach Orchard , on a part of the old ground at Fairoaks . These gentlemen were in rather despondent moods , and there was one who opined that we were all to be made prisoners of war . In his own expressive way of putting it , we were to be " gobbled up . " This person was stout and inclined to panting and perspiration . He wore glasses upon a most pugnacious nose , and his large , round head was covered with short , bristly , jetty hair . " I promised my wife , " said this person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home after the Burnside business . The Burnside job was very nearly enough for me . In fact I should have quite starved on the Burnside job , if I had n't took the fever . And the fever kept me so busy that I forgot how hungry I was . So I lived over that . " At this point he took off his glasses and wiped his face ; the water was running down his cheeks like a miniature cataract , and his great neck seemed to emit jets of perspiration . " Well , " he continued , " the Burnside job was n't enough for me ; I must come out again . I must follow the young Napoleon . And the young Napoleon has made a pretty mess of it . I never expect to get home any more ; I know I shall be gobbled up ! " A youngish , oldish , oddish fellow , whom they called " Pop , " here told Mr. Cindrey to keep his pulse up and take a drink . A tall , large person , in semi-quaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run to seed , said , with a flourish , that these battles were nothing to Shiloh . He was attached to the provincial press , and had been with the army of the West until recently . Without any exception , he was the " fussiest , " most impertinent , most disagreeable man that I ever knew . He always made a hero of himself in his reports , and if I remember rightly , their headings ran after this fashion :  --  " Tremendous Battle at ROANOKE ! The Correspondent of THE BLUNDERBUSS hoists the NATIONAL FLAG above the REBEL RAMPARTS ! ! ! " or again  --  " Grand Victory at SHILOH ! Mr. Twaddle , our Special Correspondent , TAKEN PRISONER ! ! ! He ESCAPES ! ! ! He is FIRED UPON ! ! ! He wriggles through FOUR SWAMPS and SEVEN HOSTILE CAMPS ! He is AGAIN CAPTURED ! He STRANGLES the sentry ! He drinks the Rebel Commander , Philpot , BLIND ! Philpot gives him THE PASSWORD ! !  --  Philpot compliments the Blunderbuss.  --  OUR Correspondent gains the Gunboats ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOOTS ! Remarks , etc . , ETC. , ETC ! ! ! " This man was anxious to regulate not only his own newspaper , but he aspired to control the entire press . And his self adulation was incessant . He rung all the changes upon Shiloh . Every remark suggested some incident of Shiloh . He was a thorough Shilohite , and I regretted in my heart that the " Rebels " had not shut him away at Shiloh , that he might have enjoyed it to the end of his days . The man " Pop " produced some apple whiskey , and we repaired to a spring , at the foot of the hill , where the man " Pop " mixed a cold punch , and we drank in rotation . I do n't think that Cindrey enjoyed his draught , for it filtered through his neck as if he had sprung a leak there ; but the man Twaddle might have taken a tun , and , as the man " Pop " said , the effect would have been that of " pouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own reporters , that I , being sick , should be the first of the staff to go to New York . The man " Pop " said jocosely , that I might be allowed to die in the bosom of my family . The others gave me their notes and lists , but none could give me what I most needed ,  --  a morsel of food . At eleven o'clock our little party crossed White Oak Creek . There was a corduroy bridge upon which the teams travelled , and a log bridge of perilous unsteadiness for foot passengers . But the soldiers were fording the stream in great numbers , and I plunged my horse into the current so that he spattered a group of fellows , and one of them lunged at me with a bayonet . Beyond the creek and swamp , on the hillsides , baggage wagons and batteries were parked in immense numbers . The troops were taking positions along the edge of the bottom , to oppose incursions of the enemy , when they attempted pursuit , and I was told that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross Roads , where , it was thought , the Confederates would march out from Richmond to offer battle . The roadway , beyond the swamp , was densely massed with horse , foot , cannon , and teams . The latter still kept toward the James , but the nags suffered greatly from lack of corn . Only indispensable material had been hauled from the Chickahominy , and the soldiers who fought the ensuing protracted battles were exhausted from hunger . Everything had an uncomfortable , transient , expectant appearance , and the feeble people that limped toward the ultima thule looked fagged and wretched . There were some with balls in the groin , thigh , leg , or ankle , that made the whole journey , dropping blood at every step . They were afraid to lie down , as the wounded limbs might then grow rigid and stop their progress . While I pitied these maimed persons , I held the sick in greater sympathy . The troubles of the one were local ; the others were pained in every bone . Bullets are fearful tenants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staggering folk , that reeled along the roadside , were literally out of their minds . They muttered and talked incoherently , and shouted ribald songs till my blood curdled to see them . At the first house on the right of the road , a half-mile past the Creek , I noticed many idle soldiers climbing the white palings , to watch something that lay in the yard . A gray-haired man was expiring , under the coolness of a spreading tree , and he was even now in the closing pangs . A comrade at his side bathed his brow with cool water , but I saw that he would shortly be with Lazarus or Dives . His hands were stretched stiffly by his sides , his feet were rigidly extended , and death was hardening into his bleached face . The white eyeballs glared sightlessly upward : he was looking into the other world . The heat at this time was so intolerable that our party , in lieu of any other place of resort , resolved to go to the woods . The sun set in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every pore . I was afraid , momentarily , of sunstroke , and my horse was bathed in foam . Some companies of cavalry were sheltered in the edges of the woods , and , having secured our nags , we penetrated the depths , and spread out our blankets that we might lie down . But no breath of air stirred the foliage . The " hot and copper sky " found counterpart in the burning earth , and innumerable flies and insects fastened their fangs in our flesh . Cindrey was upon the rack , and it seemed to me that he possessed a sort of capillary perspiration , for the drops stood at tips of each separate bristle . He appeared to be passing from the solid to the fluid state , and I said , ungenerously , that the existing temperature was his liquifying point . " Then , " said the man " Pop , " with a youngish , oldish smile , " we may as well liquor up . " " I do n't drink ! " said Twaddle , with a flourish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstained . But I am willing to admit , in respect to heat , that Shiloh is nowhere at present . And , therefore , I drink with a protest . " " No man can drink from my bottle , with a protest , " said " Pop . " " It is n't regular , and implies coercion . Now I do n't coerce anybody , particularly you . " " Oh ! " said Twaddle , drinking like a fish , or , as " Pop " remarked , enough to float a gunboat ; " oh ! we often chaffed each other at Shiloh . " " If you persist in reminding me of Shiloh , " blurted Cindrey , " you 'll be the ruin of me ,  --  you and the heat and the flies . You 'll have me dissolving into a dew . " Here he wiped his forehead , and killed a large blue fly , that was probing his ear . We all resolved to go to sleep , and Twaddle said that he slept like a top , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him , youngishly , to be kind enough to capture no redoubts while we slumbered , and not to raise the national flag over any ramparts for fifteen minutes . Then he grinned oldishly , and commenced to snore , with his flask in his bosom . I am certain that nobody ever felt a tithe of the pain , hunger , heat , and weariness , which agonized me , when I awoke from a half-hour 's sweltering nap . My clothing was soaking with water ; I was almost blind ; somebody seemed to be sawing a section out of my head ; my throat was hot and crackling ; my stomach knew all the pangs of emptiness ; I had scarcely strength to motion away the pertinacious insects . A soldier gave me a trifle of boiling water from his canteen ; but I gasped for air ; we were living in a vacuum . Sahara could not have been so fierce and burning . Two of us started off to find a spring . We made our way from shade to shade , expiring at every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill , on the brink of the swamp , discovered a rill of tepid water , that evaporated before it had trickled a hundred yards . If a sleek and venomous water-snake  --  for there were thousands of them hereabout  --  had coiled in the channel , I would still have sucked the draught , bending down as I did . Then I bethought me of my pony . He had neither been fed nor watered for twenty hours , and I hastened to obtain him from his place along the woodside . To my terror , he was gone . Forgetful of my weakness , I passed rapidly , hither and thither , inquiring of cavalry-men , and entertaining suspicions of every person in the vicinity . Finally , I espied him in charge of a rough , thievish sabreman , who affected not to see me . I went up to the animal , and pulled the reins from his shoulder , to discover the brand mark ,  --  " U. S. " As I surmised , he had not been branded , and I turned indignantly upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this horse ? " " Quartermaster ! " said the man , guiltily . " No sir ! He belongs to me . Take off that cavalry-saddle , and find mine , immediately . " " Not if the court knows itself , " said the man  --  " and it thinks it do ! " " Then , " said I , white with rage , " I shall report you at once , for theft . " " You may , if you want to , " replied the man , carelessly . I struck off at once for the new Provost Quarters , at a farm-house , close by . The possible failure to regain my animal , filled me with rueful thoughts . How was I , so dismounted , to reach the distant river ? I should die , or starve , on the way . I thought I should faint , when I came to the end of the first field , and leaned , tremblingly , against a tree . I caught myself sobbing , directly , like a girl , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own breezy bedroom , soft paintings , and pleasant books . These themes tortured me with a consciousness of my folly . I had forsaken them for the wickednesses of this unhappy campaign . And my body was to blacken by the road-side ,  --  the sable birds of prey were to be my mourners . But , looking through my tears , a moving something passed between me and the sky . A brownish bay pony , trailing a fence-rail by his halter , and browsing upon patches of oats . I whistled thrice and the faithful animal trotted to my feet , and extended his great nose to be rubbed . I believe that this horse was the only living thing in the army that sympathized with me . He knew that I was sick , and I thought once , that , like the great dogs of Saint Bernard , he was about to get upon his knees , that I might the more readily climb upon his back . He did , however , stand quietly , while I mounted , and I gave him a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the soldier , wrongfully accused , eyeing me from his haunt beneath the trees . I at once rode over to him , and apologized for my mistake . " Never mind , " said the man , complacently . " You was all right . I might a done the same thing . Fact is , " he added , " I did hook this hoss , but I knew you wa n't the party . " During the rest of the day I travelled disconsolately , up and down the road , winding in and out of the lines of teams . I was assured that it would be impossible to get to the James till next day , as no portion of that army had yet advanced so far . The moody minutes of that afternoon made the longest part of my life , while the cannon at Peach Orchard and Savage 's , roared and growled incessantly . Toward the close of the day I fell in with Captain Hill , of the New York Saratoga regiment , who gave me the outline of the fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by means of a balloon , of home manufacture ,  --  the first they had been able to employ during the entire war . They appeared at our entrenchments on Sunday morning , and finding them deserted , commenced an irregular pursuit , whereby , they received terrible volleys of musketry from ambuscaded regiments , and retired , in disorder , to the ramparts . This was the battle of " Peach Orchard , " and was disastrous to the Southerners . In the afternoon , they again essayed to advance , but more cautiously . The Federals , meantime , lay in order of battle upon Savage 's , Dudley 's , and Crouch 's farms , their right resting on the Chickahominy , their centre on the railroad , and their left beyond the Williamsburg turnpike . For a time , an artillery contest ensued , and the hospitals at Savage 's , where the wounded lay , were thrice fired upon . The Confederates finally penetrated the dense woods that belted this country , and the battle , at nightfall , became fervid and sanguinary . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered by artillery , at midnight . The woods were set on fire , in the darkness , and conflagration painted fiery terrors on the sky . The dead , littered all the fields and woods . The retreating army had marked its route with corpses . This was the battle of " Savage 's , " and neither party has called it a victory . During the rest of the night the weary fugitives were crossing White Oak Creek and Swamp . Toward daybreak , the last battery had accomplished the passage ; the bridge was destroyed ; and preparations were made to dispute the pursuit in the morning . I noted these particulars and added to my lists of dead and captured . At dusk I was about to sleep , supperless , upon the bare ground , when my patron , Colonel Murphy , again came in sight , and invited me to occupy a shelter-tent , on the brow of the hill at White Oak . To my great joy , he was able to offer me some stewed beef , bread and butter , and hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my naked fingers , and rending it like a beast . The regiment of Colonel Murphy was composed of laborers , and artificers of every possible description . There were blacksmiths , moulders , masons , carpenters , boat-builders , joiners , miners , machinists , riggers , and rope-makers . They could have bridged the Mississippi , rebuilt the Tredegar works , finished the Tower of Babel , drained the Chesapeake , constructed the Great Eastern , paved Broadway , replaced the Grand Trunk railroad , or tunnelled the Straits of Dover . I have often thought that the real greatness of the Northern army lay in its ingenuity and industry , not in its military qualifications . Our conversation turned upon these matters , as we sat before the Colonel 's tent in the evening , and a Chaplain represented the feelings of the North in this manner : " We must whip them . We have got more money , more men , more ships , more ingenuity . They are bound to knuckle at last . If we have to lose man for man with them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wont give up the Union ,  --  not a piece of it big enough for a bird or a bee to cover ,  --  though we reduce these thirty millions one half , and leave only the women and children to inherit the land . " The heart of the army was now cast down , though a large portion of the soldiers did not know why we were falling back . I heard moody , despondent , accusing mutterings , around the camp-fires , and my own mind was full of grief and bitterness . It seemed that our old flag had descended to a degenerate people . It was not now , as formerly , a proud recollection that I was an American . If I survived the retreat , it would become my mission to herald the evil tidings through the length and breadth of the land . If I fainted in their pursuit , a loathsome prison , or a grave in the trenches , were to be my awards . When I lay down in a shelter-tent , rolling from side to side , I remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! How this din and slaughter contrasted with my dear old Lord 's days in the prayerful parsonage ! The chimes in the white spire , where the pigeons cooed in the hush of the singing , were changed to cannon peals ; and the boys that dozed in the " Amen corner , " were asleep forever in the trampled grain-fields . The good parson , whose clauses were not less truthful , because spoken through his nose , now blew the loud trumpet for the babes he had baptized , to join the Captains of fifties and thousands ; and while the feeble old women in the side pews made tremulous responses to the prayer for " thy soldiers fighting in thy cause , " the banners of the Republic were craped , dusty , and bloody , and the scattered regiments were resting upon their arms for the shock of the coming dawn . Thus I thought , tossing and talking through the long watches , and toward morning , when sleep brought fever-dreams , a monstrous something leered at me from the blackness , saying , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ! " CHAPTER XVIII . BY THE RIVERSIDE . A crash and a stunning shock , as of a falling sphere , aroused me at nine o'clock . A shell had burst in front of our tent , and the enemy 's artillery was thundering from Casey 's old hill , beyond the swamp . As I hastily drew on my boots ,  --  for I had not otherwise undressed ,  --  I had opportunity to remark one of those unaccountable panics which develop among civilian soldiers . The camps were plunged into disorder . As the shells dropped here and there , among the tents and teams , the wildest and most fearful deeds were enacted . Here a caisson blew up , tearing the horses to pieces , and whirling a cannoneer among the clouds . There an ammunition wagon exploded , and the air seemed to be filled with fragments of wood , iron , and flesh . A boy stood at one of the fires , combing out his matted hair ; suddenly his head flew off , spattering the brains , and the shell  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of woods , mutilating the trees . The effect upon the people around me was instantaneous and appalling . Some , that were partially dressed , took to their heels , hugging a medley of clothing . The teamsters climbed into the saddles , and shouted to their nags , whipping them the while . If the heavy wheels hesitated to revolve , they left horses and vehicles to their fate , taking themselves to the woods ; or , as in some cases , cut traces and harness , and galloped away like madmen . In a twinkling our camps were almost deserted , and the fields , woods , and roads were alive with fugitives , rushing , swearing , falling , and trampling , while the fierce bolts fell momentarily among them , making havoc at every rod . To join this flying , dying mass was my first impulse ; but after-thought reminded me that it would be better to remain . I must not leave my horse , for I could not walk the whole long way to the James , and the fever had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life remaining . I almost marvelled at my coolness ; since , in the fulness of strength and health , I should have been one of the first of the fugitives ; whereas , I now looked interestedly upon the exciting spectacle , and wished that it could be daguerreotyped . Before our artillery could be brought to play , the enemy , emboldened at his success , pushed a column of infantry down the hill , to cross the creek , and engage us on our camping-ground . For a time I believed that he would be successful , and in that event , confusion and ruin would have overtaken the Unionists . The gray and butternut lines appeared over the brow of the hill ,  --  they wound at double quick through the narrow defile ,  --  they poured a volley into our camps when half-way down , and under cover of the smoke they dashed forward impetuously , with a loud huzza . The artillery beyond them kept up a steady fire , raining shell , grape , and canister over their heads , and ploughing the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees , shattering the ambulances , tearing the tents to tatters , slaying the horses , butchering the men . Directly Captain Mott 's battery was brought to bear ; but before he could open fire , a solid shot struck one of his twelve-pounders , breaking the trunnion and splintering the wheels . In like manner one of his caissons blew up , and I do not think that he was able to make any practise whatever . A division of infantry was now marched forward , to engage the Confederates at the creek side ; but two of the regiments  --  and I think that one was the 20th New York  --  turned bodily , and could not be rallied . The moment was full of significance , and I beheld these failures with breathless suspense . In five minutes the pursuers would gain the creek , and in ten , drive our dismayed battalions , like chaff before the wind . I hurried to my horse , that I might be ready to escape . The shell and ball still made music around me . I buckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot upon the stirrup . But a cheer recalled me and a great clapping of hands , as at some clever performance in the amphitheatre . I looked again . A battery from our position across the road , had opened upon the Confederate infantry , as they reached the very brink of the swamp . For a moment the bayonets tossed wildly , the dense column staggered like a drunken man , the flags rose and fell , and then the line fell back disorderly . At that instant a body of Federal infantry , that I had not seen , appeared , as by invocation ; their steel fell flashingly , a column of smoke enveloped them , the hills and skies seemed to split asunder with the shock ,  --  and when I looked again , the road was strewn with the dying and dead ; the pass had been defended . As the batteries still continued to play , and as the prospect of uninterrupted battle during the day was not a whit abated , I decided to resume my saddle , and , if possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , as I had deciphered it , satisfied me that I must pass " New Market , " before I could rely upon my personal safety . New Market was a paltry cross-road 's hamlet , some miles ahead , but as near to Richmond as White Oak Creek . The probabilities were , that the Confederates would endeavor to intercept us at this point , and so attack us in flank and rear . As I did not witness either of these battles , though I heard the discharge of every musket , it may be as well to state , in brief , that June 30 was marked by the bloodiest of all the Richmond struggles , excepting , possibly , Gaines 's Mill . While the Southern artillery engaged Franklin 's corps , at White Oak Crossing , and their left made several unavailing attempts to ford the creek with infantry ,  --  their entire right and centre , marched out the Charles City Road , and gave impetuous battle at New Market . The accounts and the results indicate that the Federals won the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were parching with thirst , weak with hunger , and it might have been supposed that reverses had broken their spirit . On the contrary they did not fall back a rod , during the whole day , and at evening Heintzelman 's corps crowned their success by a grand charge , whereat the Confederates broke and were pursued three miles toward Richmond . The gunboats Galena and Aroostook , lying in the James at Turkey Bend , opened fire at three o'clock , and killed promiscuously , Federals and Confederates . But the Southern soldiers were superstitious as to gunboats , and they could not be made to approach within range of the Galena 's monstrous projectiles . I shall always recall my journey from White Oak to Harrison 's Bar , as marked by constantly increasing beauties of scenery , and terrors of event . At every hoof-fall I was leaving the low , boggy , sparsely settled Chickahominy region , for the high farm-lands of the James . The dwellings , as I progressed , became handsome ; the negro quarters were less like huts and cattle-sheds ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawns and lanes were lined with ancient shade-trees ; there were picturesque gates and lodges ; the fences were straight and whitewashed , there were orchards , heavy with crimson apples , where the pumpkins lay beneath , like globes of gold , in the rows of amber corn . Into this patriarchal and luxuriant country , the retreating army wound like a great devouring serpent . It was to me , the coming back of the beaten jetters through Midgards , or the repulse of the fallen angels from heaven , trampling down the river-sides of Eden . They rode their team-horses into the wavy wheat , and in some places , where the reapers had been at work , they dragged the sheaves from the stacks , and rested upon them . Hearing of the coming of the army , the proprietors had vainly endeavored to gather their crops , but the negroes would not work , and they had not modern implements , whereby to mow the grain rapidly . The profanation of those glorious stretches of corn and rye were to me some of the most melancholy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grain-fields used to ripple , when the fresh breezes blew up and down the furrows , and the hot suns of that almost tropical climate , had yielded each separate head till the whole landscape was like a bright cloud , or a golden sea . The tall , shapely stalks seemed to reach out imploringly , like sunny-haired virgins , waiting to be gathered into the arms of the farmer . They were the Sabine women , on the eve of the bridal , when the insatiate Romans tore them away and trampled them . The Indian corn was yet green , but so tall that the tasselled tops showed how cunningly the young ears were ripening . There were melons in the corn-rows , that a week would have developed , but the soldiers dashed them open and sucked the sweet water . They threw clubs at the hanging apples till the ground was littered with them , and the hogs came afield to gorge ; they slew the hogs and divided the fresh pork among themselves . As I saw , in one place , dozens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recalled their Frankish forefathers , swarming down the Apennines , upon Italy . The air was so sultry during a part of the day , that one was constantly athirst . But there was a belt of country , four miles or more in width , where there seemed to be neither rills nor wells . Happily , the roads were , in great part , enveloped in stately timber , and the shade was very grateful to men and horses . The wounded still kept with us , and many that were fevered . They did not complain with words ; but their red eyes and painful pace told all the story . If we came to rivulets , they used to lie upon their bellies , along the margins , with their heads in the flowing water . The nags were so stiff and hot , that , when they were reined into creeks , they refused to go forward , and my brown animal once dropped upon his knees , and quietly surveyed me , as I pitched upon my hands , floundering in the pool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon Pennsylvania grazing farms , where I stopped to drink . It lay up a lane , some distance from the road , and two enormous tulip poplar trees sheltered and half-concealed it . A tiny creek ran through the dairy , over cool granite slabs , and dozens of earthen milk-bowls lay in the water , with the mould of the cream brimming at the surface . A pewter drinking-mug hung to a peg at the side , and there were wooden spoons for skimming , straining pails , and great ladles of gourd and cocoanut . A cooler , tidier , trimmer dairy , I had not seen , and I stretched out my body upon the dry slabs , to drink from one of the milk-bowls . The cream was sweet , rich , and nourishing , and I was so absorbed directly , that I did not heed the footfalls of a tall , broad , vigorous man , who said in a quiet way , but with a deep , sonorous voice , and a decided Northern twang  --  " Friend , you might take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that bowl . " I begged his pardon hastily , and said that I supposed he was the proprietor . " I reckon that I must give over my ownership , while the army hangs around here , " said the man ; " but I must endure what I ca n't cure . " Here he smiled grimly , and reached down the pewter cup . Then he bent over a fresh bowl , and dexterously dipped the cup full of milk , without seeming to break the cream . " Drink that , " he said ; " and if there 's any better milk in these parts , I want to know the man . " He looked at me critically , while I emptied the vessel , and seemed to enjoy my heartiness . " If you had been smart enough to come this way , victorious , " added the man , straightforwardly , " instead of being out-generalled , whipped , and driven , I should enjoy the loss of my property a great deal more ! " There was an irresistible heartiness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved to bear the misfortunes of war bravely . " You are a Northern man ? " I said , inquiringly . " How do you know ? " " There are no such dairies in Virginia ; a Virginian never dipped a mug of milk after your fashion ; you have n't the Virginia inflection , and very weak Virginia principles . " The man laughed dryly , and filled himself a cup , which he drank sedately . " I reckon you are correct , " he said ; " pretty much correct , any way . I 'm a New Yorker , from the Mohawk Valley , and I have been showing these folks how they ca n't farm . If there 's anybody that farms better than I do , I want to know the man ! " He looked at the flowing water , the clean slabs and walls , the shining tins , and smacked his lips satisfactorily . I asked him if he farmed with negroes , and if the prejudices of the country affected either his social or industrial interests . He answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thrice tried the experiment of working with whites , but with ill success . " I would have kept ' em , " he added , in his great voice , closing a prodigious fist , " but the men would not stay . I could n't make the neighbors respect them . There was nobody for ' em to associate with . They were looked upon as niggers , and they got to feel it after a while . So I have had only niggers latterly ; but I get more work from them than any other man in these parts . If there 's anybody that gets more work out of niggers than I do , I want to know the man ! " There was a sort of hard , hearty defiance about him , typical of his severe , angular race , and I studied his large limbs and grim , full face with curious admiration . He told me that he hired his negro hands from the surrounding slave-owners , and that he gave them premiums upon excess of work , approximating to wages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perseverance , and sprightliness . " I do n't own a nigger , " he said , " not one ! But I do n't think a nigger 's much too good to be a slave . I wo n't be bothered with owning ' em . And I wo n't be conquered into ' the institution . ' I said , when I commenced , that I should not buy niggers , and I wo n't buy niggers , because I said so ! As to social disadvantages , every Northern man has ' em here . They called me an abolitionist ; and a fellow at the hotel in Richmond did so to my face . I knocked him into a heap , and nobody has meddled with me since . " " Of course , " he said , after a moment , " it wo n't do to inflame these people . These people are like my bulls , and you must n't shake a red stick at ' em . Besides , I 'm not a fanatic . I never was . My wife 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she likes . But , if there 's anybody in these parts that wants to interfere with me , I should like to know the man ! " The contemptuous tone in which he mentioned " these people " amused me infinitely , and I believed that his resolute , indomitable manner would have made him popular in any society . He was shrewd , withal , and walked beside me to his gate . When the regiments halted to rest , by the wayside , he invited the field officers to the dairy , and so obtained guards to rid him of depredators . He would have escaped very handsomely , but the hand of war was not always so merciful , and a part of the battle of Malvern Hills was fought upon his property . I have no doubt that he submitted unflinchingly , and sat more stolidly amid the wreck than old Marius in battered Carthage . Until two o'clock in the afternoon I rode leisurely southward , under a scorching sky , but still bearing up , though aflame with fever . The guns thundered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way , with hurrying teams , cavalry , cannon , and foot soldiers . I stopped , a while , by a white frame church ,  --  primly , squarely built ,  --  and read the inscriptions upon the tombs uninterestedly . Some of the soldiers had pried open the doors , and a wounded Zouave was delivering a mock sermon from the pulpit . Some of his comrades broke up the meeting by singing  --  " John Brown 's body lies a mouldering in the grave , " and then a Major ordered them out , and put a guard upon the building . The guard played cards upon the door sills . I was frequently obliged , by the crowded state of the roads , to turn aside into woods , fens , and fields , and so make precarious progress . Sometimes I strayed , unwittingly , a good way from the army , and recovered the route with difficulty . On one of these occasions , I was surprised by a person in civil dress , who seemed to shoot up out of the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I have ever known , and , at first , I thought that the arch fiend had appeared before me . The wood was very deep here , and there were no wayfarers but we two . It was quite still ; but now and then we heard the rumble of wagons , and the crack of teamster 's whips . The man in question wore dead black beard , and his eyebrows were of the same intense , lustreless hue . So were his eyes and his hair ; but the latter formed a circle or cowl around his head . He had a pale skin , his fingers , were long and bony , and he rode dexterously in and out , among the tree boles , with his hat in his hand . His horse was as black as himself , and , together , they made a half-brigandish , half-satanic appearance . I reined in sharply , when I saw this person , and he looked at me like the evil-eye , through his great owlish orbs . " Good day , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double G , " and when he opened his mouth , I saw that his teeth were very white . I saluted him gravely , and , not without a shudder , rode beside him . He proved to be a sort of Missionary , from the Evangelical religious denominations of the North , to inquire into the spiritual condition of the soldiers . Camps were full of such people , but I had not found any man who appeared to be less qualified for his vocation ; to have such a figure at one 's deathbed , would be like a foretaste of the great fiend . He had a fashion of working his scalp half way down to his eyes , as he spoke , and when he smiled ,  --  though he never laughed aloud ,  --  his eyelashes did not contract , as with most people , but rather expanded , till his eyeballs projected from his head . On such occasions , his white teeth were revealed like a row of fangs , and his leprous skin grew yet paler . " The army has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the course of his remarks , he had discovered that I was a correspondent , and at once turned the conversation into a politico-religious channel . " The form of godliness is gone , " said the man again in " double G. " " This is a calamitous fact ! I would it were not so ! I grieve to state it ! But inquiry into the fact , has satisfied me that the form of godliness does not exist . Ah ! " When the man said " Ah ! " I thought that my horse would run away , and really , the tone was like the deep conjuration in Hamlet : " swear-r-r-r ! " " For example , " said the man , who told me that his name was Dimpdin ,  --  " I made some remarks to the 1st New Jersey , on Sabbath week . The field officers directed the men to attend ; I opened divine service with a feeling hymn ; a very feeling hymn ! A long measure hymn . By Montgomery ! I commenced earnestly in prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short hour . What were the results ? The deplorable results ? There were men , sir , in that assembly , who went to sleep . To sleep ! " He must have gone a great way below " double G , " this time , and I did not see how he could get back . He drew his scalp quite down to the bridge of his nose , and , seeing that my horse pricked up his ears , timorously smiled like the idol of Baal . " There were men , sir , who did worse . Not simply failing to be hearers of the word ! But doers of evil ! Men who played cards during the service . Played cards ! Gambled ! Gambled ! And some ,  --  abandoned wretches !  --  who mocked me ! Lifted up their voices and mocked ! Mockers , gamblers , slumberers ! " I never heard anything so awful as the man Dimpdin 's voice , at the iteration of these three words . They seemed to come from the bowels of the earth , and rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told me that he was engaged upon a Memorial to the Evangelical Union , which should state the number of unconverted men in the ranks , and the number of castaways . He accredited the loss of the campaign to the prevailing wickedness , but was unwilling to admit that the Southern troops were more religious . His theory of reform , if I remember it , embraced the raising of Chaplains to the rank of Major , with proportionate pay and perquisites , the establishment of a military religious bureau , and a Chaplain-General with Aides . Each soldier , officer , teamster , and drummer-boy was to have a Testament in his knapsack , and services should be held on the eve of every battle , and at roll-call in the mornings . There was to be an inspection of Testaments as of muskets . For swearing , a certain sum should be subtracted from the soldier 's pay , and conferred upon the Chaplains . " In fact , " said Dimpdin , tragically ,  --  scalping himself meanwhile ,  --  " the church must be recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon favorably , we shall have such victories , in three months , as will sweep Rebellion into the grave . Yes ! Into the grave ! The grave ! " I was obliged to say , here , that my horse could not stand these sepulchral noises , and that my nerves , being shattered by the fever , were inadequate to bear the shock . So the man Dimpdin smiled , like a window-mummy , and contented himself with looking like Apollyon . We reached a rill directly , and he produced a wicker flask , with a Britannia drinking-case . " Young men love stimulating drinks , " said Dimpdin ,  --  " strong drinks ! alcoholic drinks ! Here is a portion of Monongahela ! old Monongahela ! We will refresh ourselves ! " He found a lemon , accidentally , in his saddle-bag , and contrived an informal punch , with wonderful dexterity . I took a draught modestly , and he emptied the rest , with an " Ah ! " that shook the woods . I wondered if the man Dimpdin would suggest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He left me , when we regained the road , to ride with a lithe , bronchial person , in white neckcloth and coat cut close at the collar . They looked like the fox and the fiend , in the fable , and I seemed to hear the man Dimpdin 's voice for three succeeding weeks . At three o'clock , I climbed a gentle hill ,  --  and I was now very weary and weak ,  --  and from the summit , looked upon the river James , flowing far off to the right , through woods , and bluffs , and grainfields , and reedy islands . At last , I had gained the haven . The bright waters below me seemed to cool my red , fiery eyes , and a sort of blessed blindness fell for a time upon me , so that , when I looked again my lashes were wet . The prospect was truly beautiful . Far to the west , standing out from the chalky bluffs , were scattered the white camps of Wise 's Confederate brigade . Beyond , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stately mansions , and some one showed me , rising faintly in the distance , " Drury 's Bluff , " the site of Fort Darling , where the gunboats were repulsed in the middle of May . Below , in the river , lay the Galena , and a little way astern , the Aroostook . Signal-men , with flags , were elevated upon the masts of each , and the gunners stood upon the decks , as waiting some emergency . The vessels had steam up , and seemed to be ready for action at any moment . This was Grand Turkey Bend , and the rising ground on which I stood , was known as " Malvern Hills . " A farm-house lay to my left , and repairing thither , I cast myself from the nag , and lay down in the shady yard , thankful that I had reached the haven , and only solicitous now to escape the further privations of McClellan 's Peninsular Campaign . CHAPTER XIX . THE HOSPITAL TRANSPORT . An earnest desire now took possession of me , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The scenes just transpired had been unparalleled in the war , and if , through me , the  --   --  should be the first to make them public , it would greatly redound to my credit . Perhaps no profession imparts an enthusiasm in any measure kindred to that of the American Newsgatherer . I was careless of the lost lives and imperilled interests , the suffering , the defeat : no emotions either of the patriot or the man influenced me . I only thought of the eclat of giving the story to the world , and nurtured an insane desire to make to Fortress Monroe , by some other than the common expedient . That this was a paltry ambition I know ; but I write what happened , and to the completion of my sketch of a correspondent , this is necessary to be said . I found Glumley at the old mansion referred to , and stealthily suggested to him the seizing of an open boat , whereby we might row down to the Fortress . He rejected it as impracticable , but was willing to hazard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would not do , and after a short time I continued my journey down the riverside , hopeful of finding some transport or Despatch boat . I was now in Charles City County , and the river below me was dotted with woodland islands . I soon got upon the main road to Harrison 's Point or Bar , and followed the stream of ambulances and supply teams for more than an hour . At last we reached a diverging lane , through which we passed to a landing , close to a fine dwelling , whose style of architecture I may denominate , the " Gothic run mad . " An old cider-press was falling into rottenness on the lawn ; four soldiers were guarding the well , that the mob might not exhaust its precious contents , and between some negro-huts and the brink of the bluff , stood a cluster of broad-armed trees , beneath whose shade the ambulance-drivers were depositing the wounded . I have made these chapters sufficiently hideous , without venturing to transcribe these new horrors . Suffice it to say that the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight of New Market , and were suffering the first agonies of their wounds . One hour before , they had felt all the lustiness of life and adventure . Now , they were whining like babes , and some had expired in the ambulances . The act of lifting them to the ground so irritated their wounds that they howled dismally , and yet were so exhausted that after lying upon the ground awhile , they quietly passed into sleep . Such are the hardening results of war , that some soldiers , who were unhurt , actually refused to give a trifle of river water from their canteens to their expiring comrades . At one time a brutal wrangle occurred at the well , and the guard was compelled to seek reinforcement , or the thirsty people would have massacred them . I was now momentarily adding to my notes of the battles , and the wounded men very readily gave me their names ; for they were anxious that the account of their misfortunes should reach their families , and I think also , that some martial vanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . A longboat came in from the Galena , after a time , and General McClellan , who had ridden down to the pier , was taken aboard . He looked to be very hot and anxious , and while he remained aboard the vessel , his staff dispersed themselves around the banks and talked over the issues of the contest . As the General receded from the strand , every sweep of the long oars was responded to from the hoarse cannon of the battle-field , and when he climbed upon deck , the steamer moved slowly up the narrow channel , and the signal-man in the foretop flourished his crossed flag sturdily . Directly , the Galena opened fire from her immense pieces of ordnance , and the roar was so great that the explosions of field-guns were fairly drowned . She fired altogether by the direction of the signals , as nothing could be seen of the battle-field from her decks . I ascertained afterward that she played havoc with our own columns as well as the enemy 's , but she brought hope to the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gunboat affrighted the Confederates , and they were assured , in this case , that the retreating invaders , had at length reached a haven . The Galena kept up a steady fire till nightfall , and the Federals , taking courage , drove their adversaries toward Richmond , at eve . Meanwhile the Commanding General 's escort and body-guard had encamped around us , and during the night the teams and much of the field cannon fell back . I obtained shelter and meals from Quartermaster Le Duke of Iowa , whose canvas was pitched a mile or more below , and as I tossed through the watches I heard the splashing of water in the river beneath , where the tired soldiers were washing away the powder of the battle . In the morning I retraced to head-quarters , and vainly endeavored to learn something as to the means of going down the river . Commanders are always anxious to grant correspondents passes after a victory ; but they wish to defer the unwelcome publication of a defeat . I was advised by Quartermaster-General Van Vliet , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I passed thither , the last day 's encounters  --  those of " Malvern Hills "  --  occurred . The scenes along the way were reiterations of terrors already described ,  --  creaking ambulances , staggering foot soldiers , profane wagoners , skulking officers and privates , officious Provost guards , defiles , pools and steeps packed with teams and cannon , wayside houses beset with begging , gossiping , or malicious soldiers , and wavy fields of wheat and rye thrown open to man and beast . I was amused at one point , to see some soldiers attack a beehive that they might seize the honey . But the insects fastened themselves upon some of the marauders , and after indescribable cursing and struggling , the bright nectar and comb were relinquished by the toilers , and the ravishers gorged upon sweetness . Harrison 's Bar is simply a long wharf , extending into the river , close by the famous mansion , where William Henry Harrison , a President of the United States , was born , and where , for two centuries , the scions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The house had now become a hospital , and the wounded were being conveyed to the pier , whence they were delivered over to some Sanitary steamers , for passage to Northern cities . I tied my horse to the spokes of a wagon-wheel , and asked a soldier to watch him , while I repaired to the quay . A half drunken officer was guarding the wharf with a squad of men , and he denied me admittance , at first , but when I had said something in adulation of his regiment  --  a trick common to correspondents  --  he passed me readily . The ocean steamer Daniel Webster was about being cast adrift when I stepped on board , and Colonel Ingalls , Quartermaster in charge , who freely gave me permission to take passage in her , advised me not to risk returning to shore . So , reluctantly , I resigned my pony , endeared to me by a hundred adventures , and directly I was floating down the James , with the white teams and the tattered groups of men , receding from me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Away ! praised be a merciful God ! away from the accursed din , and terror , and agony , of my second campaign ,  --  away forever from the Chickahominy . For awhile I sat meditatively in the bow of the boat , full of strange perplexities and thankfulness . I had escaped the bullet , and fever , and captivity , and a great success in my profession was about to be accorded to me , but there was much work yet to be done . The rough material I had for a grand account of the closing of the campaign ; but these fragmentary figures and notes must be wrought into narrative , and to avail myself of their full significance , I must lose no moment of application . I found that I was one of four correspondents on board , and we resolved to district the boat , each correspondent taking one fourth of the names of the sick and wounded . The spacious saloons , the clean deck , the stairways , the gangways , the hold , the halls ,  --  all were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds , they limped feverishly here and there ; some were crazed from sunstroke , or gashes ; and one man that I remember counted the rivets in the boilers over the whole hundred miles of the journey , while another ,  --  a teamster ,  --  whipped and cursed his horses as if he had mistaken the motion of the boat for that of his vehicle . The Daniel Webster was one of a series of transports supplied for the uses of the wounded by a national committee of private citizens . Her wood work was shining and glossy , her steel shone like mirrors , and she was cool as Paradise . Out of the smoke , and turmoil , and suffocation of battle these wretched men had emerged , to enjoy the blessedness , unappreciated before , of shelter , and free air and cleanliness . There was ice in abundance on board , and savory lemonade lay glassily around in great buckets . Women flitted from group to group with jellies , bonbons , cigars , and oranges , and the grateful eyes of the prostrate people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasts of all ages and degrees , who proffered themselves , at the beginning of the war , as stewardesses and nurses . From the fact that some of them were of masculine natures , or , in the vocabulary of the times , " strong-minded , " they were the recipients of many coarse jests , and imputations were made upon both their modesty and their virtue . But I would that any satirist had watched with me the good offices of these Florence Nightingales of the West , as they tripped upon merciful errands , like good angels , and left paths of sunshine behind them . The soldiers had seen none of their countrywomen for months , and they followed these ambassadors with looks half-idolatrous , half-downcast , as if consciously unworthy of so tender regard . " If I could jest die , now , " said one of the poor fellows to me , " with one prayer for my country , and one for that dear young lady ! " There was one of these daughters of the good Samaritan whose face was so full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and graceful , that it would have been no miracle had she transmuted herself to something divine . She was very handsome , and her features bore the imprint of that high enthusiasm which may have animated the maid of Arc . One of the more forward of the correspondents said to her , as she bore soothing delicacies to the invalids , that he missed the satisfaction of being wounded , at which she presented an orange and a cigar to each of us in turn . Among the females on board , I remarked one , very large , angular , and sanguine , who sat at a small table , dispensing luxuries with the manners of a despot and the charity of a child . She had a large vessel of boiling coffee , from which she drew spicy quantities at intervals ; and when the troops thronged around eagerly , she rebuked the more forward , and called up some emaciated , bashful fellows , giving them the preference . Every soldier who accepted coffee was obliged to take a religious tract , and she gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interesting . I ventured to ask this imperative person for a bottle of ink , and after some difficulty ,  --  arising out of a mistaken notion on her part that I was dangerously wounded ,  --  she vaulted over a chair , and disappeared into a state-room . When she returned , her arms were filled with a perfect wilderness of stationery , and having supplied each of us in turn , she addressed herself to me in the following sententious manner :  --  " See here ! You reporter ! ( There 's ink ! ) I want to be put in the newspapers ! Look at me ! Now ! Right straight ! ( Pens ? ) Here I am ; thirteen months at work ; been everywhere ; done good ; country ; church ; never noticed . Never !  --  Now ! I want to be put in newspapers . " At this point the Imperatress was called off by some soldiers , who presumed to draw coffee without her consent . She slapped one of them soundly , and at once overpowered him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a photograph , representing herself with a basket of fruit , and a quantity of good books . I took note of her name , but unfortunately lost the memorandum , and unless she has been honored by some more careful scribe , I fear that her labors are still unrecognized . During much of the trip , I wrote material parts of my report , copied portions of my lists , and managed before dusk , to get fairly underway with my narrative . From the deck of the steamer I beheld at five o'clock , what I had long wished to see ,  --  the famous island of Jamestown , celebrated in the early annals of the New World , as the home of John Smith , and of Nathaniel Bacon , and as the resort of the Indian Princess , Pocahontas . A single fragment of a tower , the remnant of the Colonial church , was the only ruin that I could see . At seven o'clock we dropped anchor in Hampton Roads , and a boat let down from the davits . Some of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I might not be pulled to shore ; but I swung down by a rope , and made havoc with their shins , so that they gained nothing ; the surf beat so vehemently against the pier at Old Point , that we were compelled to beach the boat , and I ran rapidly through the ordnance yard to the " Hygeia House , " where our agent boarded ; he had gone into the Fortress to pass the night , and when I attempted to follow him thither , a knot of anxious idlers , who knew that I had just returned from the battle-fields , attempted to detain me by sheer force . I dashed rapidly up the plank walk , reached the portal , and had just vaulted into the area , when the great gates swung to , and the tattoo beat ; at the same instant the sergeant of guard challenged me :  --  " Who comes there ? Stand fast ! Guard prime ! " A dozen bright musket-barrels were levelled upon me , and I heard the click of the cocks as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained , I was shown the Commandant 's room , and hastening in that direction , encountered Major Larrabee , my old patron of the fifth Wisconsin regiment . He took me to the barracks , where a German officer , commanding a battery , lodged , and the latter accommodated me with a camp bedstead . Here I related the incidents of the engagements , and before I concluded , the room was crowded with people . I think that I gave a sombre narration , and the hearts of those who heard me were cast down . Still , they lingered ; for the bloody story possessed a hideous fascination , and I was cross-examined so pertinaciously that my host finally arose , protesting that I needed rest , and turned the party out of the place . The old fever-dreams returned to me that night , and my brain spun round for hours before I could close my eyes . CHAPTER XX . ON FURLOUGH AWHILE . Counter winds and tides had so delayed the Adelaide , on which I departed for New York with my despatches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make connection with the early train for New York . The captain shook his head distrustfully when he had looked at his watch , and told me that he frequently failed to land his passengers in time . The bitterness of the doubt so troubled me , that I paced the decks , looking at the approaching city , and thinking that all my labor was to be disappointed in the end . I could not telegraph my narrative and lists , for Government controlled the wires ; and moreover , the Associated Press regulations forbade any newspaper to telegraph exclusive news from any point but Washington . I half resolved to hire a special locomotive , but it was doubtful that the railway authorities could procure one , at 60 short notice . Unless I overtook the eight o'clock A. M. train , I could not get to New York before two o'clock next morning ,  --  too late for the press . Besides , how did I know that some correspondent had not reached Washington , by way of one of the Potomac vessels , and so forestalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all our correspondents to publish the incidents and results of six days ' stupendous warfare ,  --  but escaping at the very moment of realization . The seconds were hours as we swept past Fort Carroll , rounded Fort McHenry , and swung toward our moorings , under Fort Federal Hill . " If we make a prompt landing , " said the Captain , " you may barely get the train . " I stood with my bundles of notes upon the high deck , and signalled a cab-driver . He caught the precious manuscript , and bolted for his cab . In another second he was ' dashing like a runaway up the pier , over the bridge , through Pratt Street , and  --  out of sight . Slowly the great hulk turned awkwardly about ; one turn of her paddles brought us close enough to fling a rope , a second drew her very near the shore ; the distance was fearful , but I braced myself for the leap . " Stand clear ! " I called to the score of hackmen . A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feet , rolled over upon my face , gathered myself to the arms of all the Jehus , and was carried off bodily by a man with a great knob on his forehead as big as the end of his whip-handle . " G'lang ! Who-o-o-oh ! Swis-s-s ! " I think that I promised that man everything under the sun to catch the train . I recollect that the knob on his forehead grew black and bulging as he lashed his horse . I found myself standing up in the cab , screaming like the driver . We were both insane , and the horse must have been of the breed of Pegasus , for I could feel the vehicle gyrating in the air . Now we turned a lamp-post , and the glass splintered somewhere ; a dog howled as we drove over his appendage ; a woman with a baby gave a short scream and disappeared into the earth ; a policeman gave chase , but we laughed him to scorn . Huzza ! Here we are ! The train stands puffing at the long platform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy to make the keers ? " " Did n't I projuce yer honor in good time , sur ? " I only know that I flung a greenback to the two ,  --  that I vainly besought the ticket agent to give me no change , but consign it to the first engineer who failed to make time ,  --  that I wrote on the back of my hat for four hours ,  --  that I devoured a chicken and as many eggs as she had laid in a lifetime , at Havre de Grace ,  --  that I leaped upon the platform at Broad and Prime streets , Philadelphia , at noon ,  --  that I plunged into a cab , and said , significantly  --  " New York Ferry ! " It chafed me to pass through the promenade street of my home-city , without a moment to spare for my family or friends . The cab-horse slipped in Chestnut Street , and I went over the rest of the route on foot , at a dog-trot pace , passing in various quarters for a sportsman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly aggravated between Amboy and Camden , by persons making inquiries for brothers , sons , and acquaintances . At last , when I attained the steamer , the Captain kindly shut me up in his office , and I went on with my narrative till my eyes were burning and my hands failed in their function . Kill von Kull and its picturesque shores went by ; we emerged into the beautiful bay , and winding among its buoys , harbor lights , and shipping , came to , at length , at the foot of Christopher Street . I repaired to the office at once , and wrote far into the night , refraining , finally , from sheer blindness and exhaustion , and dropped asleep in the carriage as I was taken toward the Metropolitan Hotel . The next day was Friday , July 4 , the anniversary of American Independence , and my version of the six-days ' battles caused universal gloom and grief . I had furnished five pages or forty columns of closely printed matter , and thousands of tremulous fingers were tracing out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wine and rehearsed for the hundredth time , the incidents of the retreat to a multitude of men . Cards and letters came to me by the gross , from bereaved countrymen , and I was obliged , finally , to add a postscript to my account , and a protest that I knew no more , and could answer no interrogatories . A bath , fresh clothing , and rich food so far improved my appearance in a few days , that I presented no other traces of sickness and travel than a sunburnt face , and a rheumatic walk . With restoration came a revival of old desires , appetites , and attachments . It required one additional campaign to sober me in these respects , and I was not a little relieved , to receive an order on the fourth day , to proceed to Washington , and attach myself to the " Army of Virginia " at the head of which Major-General John Pope had just been placed . After two quieter days ' enjoyment , in the Quaker City , I reported myself at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , owing to the tardiness of the new Commander . For two weeks or more , I loitered around Washington , and although the time passed monotonously , I saw many persons and events which have much to do with the history of the Rebellion . The story of " Washington During the War " has yet to be written in all its vividness of enterprise , devotion , and infamy . It has been , in periods of peace , a dull , dolorous town , of mammoth hotels , paltry dwellings , empty lots , prodigiously wide avenues , a fossil population , and a series of gigantic public buildings , which seemed dropped by accident into a fifth-rate backwoods settlement . During the sessions Washington was overrun with " Smartness " : Smart pages , smart messengers , smart cabmen , smart publicans , smart politicians , smart women , smart scoundrels ! Greatness became commonplace here , and Mr. Douglas might drink at Willard 's Bar , with none so poor to do him reverence , or General Winfield Scott strut like a colossus along " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs would give him the attention of only one eye . It was interesting , to notice how rapidly provincial eminence lost caste here . Slipkins , who was " Honorable " at home , and of whom his county newspaper said that " this distinguished fellow citizen of ours will be heard from , among the greatest of the free , "  --  Slipkins moved to and fro unnoticed , and voted with his party , and drank much brandy and water , and left no other record at the Capital than some unpaid bills , and perhaps an unacknowledged heir . A gaping rustic and his new bride , or a strolling foreigner , marvelling and making notes at every turn , might be observed in the Patent Office examining General Washington 's breeches , but these were at once called " greenies , " and people put out their tongues and winked at them . The Secretaries ' ladies gave parties now and then , attended by the folks who sold them horses , or carpets , or wines ; the President gave a " levee , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ogle his lady ; the Marine band ( in red coats ) , played twice a week in the Capital grounds , and Senators , Cyprians , Ethiops , and children rallied to enjoy ; a theatre or two played time-honored dramas with Thespian companies ; a couple of scholars lectured in the sombre Smithsonian Institution ; an intrigue and a duel filled some most doleful hiatus ; and a clerk absconded with half a million , or an Indian agent robbed the red men and fell back to the protection of his " party . " A very dismal , a very dirty , and a very Democratic settlement was the American Capital , till the war came . Even the war lost half its interest in Washington . A regiment marching down Broadway was something to see , but the same regiment in Pennsylvania Avenue looked mean and matter-of-fact . A General in the field , or riding uncovered through Boston or Baltimore , or even lounging at the bar of the Continental or the Astor House or the Tremont , was invested with an atmosphere half heroic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counted by pairs , and I used to sit at dinner with eight or a dozen of them in my eye . There was the new Commander-in-Chief , Halleck , a short , countryfied person , whose blue coat was either threadbare or dusty , or lacked some buttons , and who picked his teeth walking up and down the halls at Willard 's , and argued through a white , bilious eye and a huge mouth . There was General Mitchel , also , who has since passed away ,  --  a little , knotty gentleman , with stiff , gray , Jacksonian hair . And General Sturgis passed in and out perpetually , with impressive , individual Banks , or some less prominent person , all of them wearing the gold star upon their shoulders , and absolute masters of some thousands of souls . The town , in fact , was overrun with troops . Slovenly guards were planted on horseback at crossings , and now and then they dashed , as out of a profound sleep , to chase some galloping cavalier . Gin and Jews swarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers of rival regiments , but oftener of rival nationalities , pummelling each other in the highways , until they were marched off by the Provosts . The number of houses of ill-fame was very great , and I have been told that Generals and Lieutenants of the same organization often encountered and recognized each other in them . Contractors and " jobbers " used to besiege the offices of the Secretaries of War and Navy , and the venerable Welles ( who reminded me of Abraham in the lithographs ) , and the barnacled Stanton , seldom appeared in public . Simple-minded , straightforward A. Lincoln , and his ambitious , clever lady , were often seen of afternoons in their barouche ; the little old-fashioned Vice-President walked unconcernedly up and down ; and when some of the Richmond captives came home to the Capital , immense meetings were held , where patriotism bawled itself hoarse . A dining hour at Willard 's was often wondrously adapted for a historic picture , when accoutred officers , and their beautiful wives ,  --  or otherwise ,  --  sat at the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , while corks popped like so many Chinese crackers , and champagne bubbled up like blood . At night , the Provost Guard enacted the farce of coming by deputations to each public bar , which was at once closed , but reopened five minutes afterward . Congress water was in great demand for weak heads of mornings , and many a young lad , girt up for war , wasted his strength in dissipation here , so that he was worthless afield , and perhaps died in the hospital . The curse of civil war was apparent everywhere . One had but to turn his eye from the bare Heights of Arlington , where the soldiers of the Republic lay demoralized , to the fattening vultures who smoked and swore at the National , to see the true cause of the North 's shortcomings ,  --  its inherent and almost universal corruption . Human nature was here so depraved , that man lost faith in his kind . Death lurked behind ambuscades and fortifications over the river , but Sin , its mother , coquetted here , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Capital , as but little better than Sodom , though its danger had called forth thousands of great hearts to throb out , in its defence . For every stone in the Capitol building , a man has laid down his life . For every ripple on the Potomac , some equivalent of blood has been shed . I lodged for some time in Tenth Street , and took my meals at Willard 's . The legitimate expenses of living in this manner were fourteen dollars a week ; but one could board at Kirkwood 's or Brown 's for seven or eight dollars , very handsomely . A favorite place of excursion , near the city , was " Crystal Spring , " where some afternoon orgies were enacted , which should have made the sun go into eclipse . I repaired once to Mount Vernon , and looked dolorously at the tomb of the Pater Patris , and once to Annapolis , on the Chesapeake , which the war has elevated into a fine naval station . At length Pope 's forces were being massed along the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the " Piedmont " highlands . " Piedmont " is the name applied to the fine table-lands of Northern Virginia , and the ensuing campaign has received the designation of the " Piedmont Campaign . " Pope 's army proper was composed of three corps , commanded respectively by Generals Irvin McDowell , Franz Siegel , and Nathaniel P. Banks . But a portion of General McClellan 's peninsular army had meantime returned to the Potomac , and the corps of General Burnside was stationed at Fredericksburg , thirty miles or more below Pope 's head-quarters at Warrenton . I presented myself to General Pope on the 12th of July , at noon . His Washington quarters consisted of a quiet brick house , convenient to the War office , and the only tokens of its importance were some guards at the threshold , and a number of officers ' horses , saddled in the shade of some trees at the curb . The lower floor of the dwelling was appropriated to quartermasters ' and inspectors ' clerks , before whom a number of people were constantly presenting themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantities , idlers , relic-hunters , and adventurers in still greater ratio , and , last of all , citizens of Virginia , solicitous to return to their farms and families . The mass of these were rebuffed , as Pope had inaugurated his campaign with a show of severity , even threatening to drive all the non-combatants out of his lines , unless they took the Federal oath of allegiance . He gave me a pass willingly , and chatted pleasantly for a time . In person he was dark , martial , and handsome ,  --  inclined to obesity , richly garbed in civil cloth , and possessing a fiery black eye , with luxuriant beard and hair . He smoked incessantly , and talked imprudently . Had he commenced his career more modestly , his final discomfiture would not have been so galling ; but his vanity was apparent to the most shallow observer , and although he was brave , clever , and educated , he inspired distrust by his much promising and general love of gossip and story-telling . He had all of Mr. Lincoln 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their affinity ) , and none of that good old man 's unassuming common sense . The next morning , at seven o'clock , I embarked for Alexandria , and passed the better half of the forenoon in negotiating for a pony . At eleven o'clock , I took my seat in a bare , filthy car , and was soon whirled due southward , over the line of the Orange and Alexandria railroad . The country between Alexandria and Warrenton Junction , or , indeed , between Washington and Richmond , was not unlike those masterly descriptions of Gibbon , detailing the regions overrun by Hyder Ali . The towns stood like ruins in a vast desert , and one might write musing epitaphs at every wind-beaten dwelling , whence the wretched denizens had fled in cold and poverty to a doubtful hospitality in the far South . Fences there were none , nor any living animals save the braying hybrids which limped across the naked plains to eke out existence upon some secluded patches of grass . These had been discharged from the army , and they added rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great mournful eyes and shaggy heads glared from copses , and in places where they had lain down beside the track to expire . If we sometimes pity these dumb beasts as they drag loaded wains , or heavy omnibuses , or sub-soil ploughs , we may also bestow a tender sentiment upon the army mules . Flogged by teamsters , cursed by quartermasters , ridiculed by roaring regiments of soldiers , strained and spavined by fearful draughts , stalled in bogs and fainting upon hillsides ,  --  their bones will evidence the sites of armies , when the skeletons of men have crumbled and become reabsorbed . I have seen them die like martyrs , when the inquisitor , with his bloody lash , stood over them in the closing pangs , and their last tremulous howl has almost moved to tears . Some of the dwellings seemed to be occupied , but the tidiness of old times was gone . The women seemed sunburnt and hardened by toil . They looked from their thresholds upon the flying train , with their hair unbraided and their garters ungyved ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a son or brother who had not travelled to the wars . They must be now hewers of wood , and drawers of water , and the fingers whereon diamonds used to sparkle , must clench the axe and the hoe . At last we came to Bull Run , the dark and bloody ground where the first grand armies fought and fled , and again to be consecrated by a baptism of fire . The railway crossed the gorge upon a tall trestle bridge , and for some distance the track followed the windings of the stream . A black , deep , turgid current , flowing between gaunt hills , lined with cedar and beech , crossed here and there by a ford , and vanishing , above and below , in the windings of wood and rock ; while directly beyond , lie the wide plains of Manassas Junction , stretching in the far horizon , to the undulating boundary of the Blue Ridge . As the Junction remains to-day , the reader must imagine this splendid prospect , unbroken by fences , dwellings , or fields , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock of columns , with redoubts to the left and right , and fragments of stockades , dry rifle pits , unfinished or fallen breastworks , and , close in the foreground , a medley of log huts for the winter quartering of troops . The woods to the north mark the course of Bull Run ; a line of telegraph poles going westward points to Manassas Gap ; while the Junction proper is simply a point where two single track railways unite , and a few frame " shanties " or sheds stand contiguous . These are , for example , the " New York Head-quarters , " kept by a person with a hooked nose , who trades in cakes , lemonade , and ( probably ) whiskey , of the brand called " rotgut ; " or the " Union Stores , " where a person in semi-military dress deals in India-rubber overcoats , underclothing , and boots . As the train halts , lads and negroes propose to sell sandwiches to passengers , and soldiers ride up to take mail-bags and bundles for imperceptible camps . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horseman , visiting vestiges of the battle ; sidings beside the track are packed with freight cars , and a small mountain of pork barrels towers near by ; there are blackened remains of locomotives a little way off , but these have perhaps hauled regiments of Confederates to the Junction ; and over all  --  men , idlers , ruins , railway , huts , entrenchments  --  floats the star-spangled banner from the roof of a plank depot . The people in the train were rollicking and well-disposed , and black bottles circulated freely . I was invited to drink by many persons , but the beverage proffered was intolerably bad , and several convivials became stupidly drunk . A woman in search of her husband was one of the passengers , and those contiguous to her were as gentlemanly as they knew how to be . " A pretty woman , in war-time , " said a Captain , aside , to me , " is not to be sneezed at . " At " Catlett 's , " a station near Warrenton Junction , we narrowly escaped a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our train , women included , leaped down an embankment with marvellous agility . Here we switched off to the right , and at four o'clock dismounted at the pleasant village of Warrenton . CHAPTER XXI . CAMPAIGNING WITH GENERAL POPE . The court-house village of Fauquier County contained a population of twelve or fifteen hundred at the commencement of the war . Its people embraced the revolutionary cause at the outstart , and furnished some companies of foot to the Confederate service , as well as a mounted company known as the " Black Horse Cavalry . " The guns of Bull Run were heard here on the day of battle , and hundreds of the wounded came into town at nightfall . Thenceforward Warrenton became prominently identified with the struggle , and the churches and public buildings were transmuted to hospitals . After the Confederates retired from Manassas Junction , the vicinity of Warrenton was a sort of neutral ground . At one time the Southern cavalry would ride through the main street , and next day a body of mounted Federals would pounce upon the town , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the heart of the place . Some people were ruined by the war ; some made fortunes . The Mayor of the village was named Bragg , and he was a trader in horses , as well as a wagon-builder . There were two taverns , denominated respectively , the " Warrenton Inn , " and the " Warren Green Hotel . " I obtained a room at the former . A young man named Dashiell kept it . He was a fair-complexioned , clever , high-strung Virginian , and managed to obtain a great deal of paper money from both republics . It is an encomium in America , to say that a man " Can keep a hotel , " but what shall be said of the man who can keep a hotel in war-time ? I observed young Dashiell 's movements from day to day , and I am satisfied that his popularity arose from his fairness and frankness . He charged nine dollars a week for room , and " board , " of three meals , but could , with difficulty , obtain meat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in the house . The latter was a son of Mayor Bragg , and had been twice in the Confederate service . He was engaged both at Bull Run and at Fairfax Court House , and made no secret of his activity at either place . But he was treated considerately , though he vaunted intolerably . The " Inn " was a frame dwelling , with a first floor of stone , surrounded by a double portico . The first room ( entering from the street ) was the office , consisting of a bare floor , some creaking benches , some chairs with whittled and broken arms , a high desk , where accounts were kept , a row of bells , numbered , communicating with the rooms . Hand-bills were pinned to the walls , announcing that William Higgins was paying good prices for " likely " field hands , that Timothy Ingersoll 's stock of dry goods was the finest in Piedmont , that James Mason 's mulatto woman , named Rachel , had decamped on the night of Whitsuntide , and that one hundred dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of these bills were out of date , but some recent ones were exhibited to me calling for volunteers , labelled , " Ho ! for winter-quarters in Washington ; " " Sons of the South arise ! "  --  " Liberty , glory , and no Yankeedom ! " A bellcord hung against the " office " door , communicating with the stables , where a deaf hostler might not be rung up . In the back yard , suspended from a beam , and upright , hung a large bell , which called the boarders to meals . It commonly rung thrice , and I was told on inquiry , by the cook  --  " De fust bell , sah , is to prepah to prepah for de table ; dat bell , when de fust cook do n't miss it , is rung one hour befo ' mealtime . De second bell , sah , is to prepah for de table ; de last bell , to come to de table . " I should have been better pleased with the ceremony , if the food had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We used to clear the plates in a twinkling , and if a person asked twice for beef , or butter , he was stared at by the negroes , as if he had eaten an entire cow . I soon brought the head-waiter to terms by promising him a dollar a week for extra attendance , and could even get ice after a time , which was a luxury . There was a bar upon the premises , which opened stealthily , when there were liquors to be sold . Cider ( called champaigne ) could be purchased for three dollars a bottle , and whiskey came to hand occasionally . There were cigars in abundance , and I used to sit on the upper porch of evenings , puffing long after midnight , and watching the sentinels below . There was some female society in Warrenton , but the blue-coats engrossed it all . The young women were ardent partisans , but also very pretty ; and treason , somehow , heightened their beauty . Disloyalty is always pardonable in a woman , and these ladies appreciated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stopped their ears when the bands played national music ; but every evening they walked through the main street , arm in arm with dashing Lieutenants and Captains . Many flirtations ensued , and a great deal of gossip was elicited . In the end , some of the misses fell out among themselves , and hated each other more than the common enemy . I overheard a young lady talking in a low tone one evening , to a Captain in the Ninth New York regiment . " If you knew my brother , " she said , " I am sure you would not fire upon him . " As there were plain , square , prim porches to all the dwellings , the ladies commonly took positions therein of evenings , and a grand promenade commenced of all the young Federals in the town . The streets were pleasantly shaded , and a leafy coolness pervaded the days , though sometimes , of afternoons , the still heat was almost stifling . A jaunt after supper often took me far into the country , and the starlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a civilian was a distinguished honor now , and I enjoyed the staring of the citizens , who pondered as to my purposes and pursuits , as only villagers can do . There is a quiet pleasure in being a strange person in a country town , and so far from objecting to the inquisitiveness of the folk , I rather like it . One may be passing for a young duke , or tourist , or clergyman , or what not ? The Ninth New York ( militia ) regiment guarded Warrenton , and it was composed of clever , polite young fellows , who had taken to volunteering before there was any promise of war , and who turned out , pluckily , when the strife began . Perhaps public sentiment or pride of organization influenced them . They were all good-looking and tidy , and their dress-parades , held in the main street , were handsome affairs . I have never seen better disciplined columns , and the youthful faces of the soldiers , with the staid locality of the exhibition ,  --  young women , negroes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  seemed to contradict the bloody mission of the troops . The old men , referred to , were villagers of such long standing that had the Court of Saint James , or the Vatican , or the battle of Waterloo been moved into their country , they would have still been villagers to the last . They met beside the Warrenton Inn , under the shade of the trees , at eleven o'clock every morning , and borrowed the New York papers of the latest date . One individual , slightly bald , would read aloud , and the rest crouched or stood about him , making grunts and remarks at intervals . They did not wish to believe the Federal reports , but they must needs read , and as most of them had sons in the other army , their pulses were constantly tremulous with anxiety . I think that Pope 's resolve to transport these harmless old people beyond his lines was very barbarous , and the soldiers denounced it in similar terms . They spoke of Pope , as of some terrible despot , and wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had appointed a committee , and drafted a petition , asking his forbearance and charity . When these villagers found me out to be a Newspaper Correspondent , they regarded me with amusing interest , and marvelled what I would say of their town . A villager is very sensitive as to his place of residence , and these good people read the  --   --  daily , confounding me with all the paper ,  --  editorial , correspondence , and , I verily believe , advertisements . One of them wished me to board at his residence , and I was , after a time , invited out to dinner and tea frequently . The negroes remained in Warrenton , in great numbers , and held carnival of evenings when the bands played . " Contrabands " were coming daily into town , and idleness and vice soon characterized the mass of them . They were ignorant , degraded , animal beings , and many of them loved rum ; it was the last link that bound them to human kind . Servants could be hired for four dollars a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiftless " and unprofitable . The Provost-Marshal of the place was a Captain Hendrickson . His quarters were in the Court House building , and he kept a zealous eye upon sutlers and citizens . The former trespassed in the sales of liquors to soldiers , and the latter were accused of maintaining a contraband mail , and of conspiring to commit divers offences . There were a number of churches in the village , all of which served as hospitals , and in the quiet cemetery west of the town , two hundred slain soldiers were interred . A stake of white pine was driven at the head of each grave . Here lay some of the men who had helped to change the destinies of a continent . No public worship was held in the place . The Sundays were busy as other days : trains came and went , teams made dust in the streets , cavalry passed through the village , music arose from all the outlying camps ; parades and inspections were made , and all the preparations for killing men were relentlessly forwarded . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground adjoining the Warrenton Inn , was appropriated for a camp theatre . Candle footlights were arranged , and the stage was canopied with national flags . The citizens congregated , and the performers deferred to their prejudices by singing no Federal songs . Tho negroes climbed the trees to listen , and their gratified guffaws made the night quiver . The war lost half its bitterness at such times ; but I thought with a shudder of Stuart 's thundering horsemen , charging into the village , and closing the night 's mimicry with a horrible tragedy . Some of the dwellings about the place were elegant and spacious , but many of these were closed and the owners removed . Two newspapers had been published here of old , and while ransacking the office of one of them , I discovered that the type had been buried under the floor . The planks were speedily torn away , and the cases dragged to light . I obtained some curious relics , in the shape of " cuts " of recruiting officers , runaway negroes , etc. , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describing the first battle of Bull Run . For two weeks I had little to do , as the campaign had not yet fairly commenced , and I passed many hours every day reading . A young lawyer , in the Confederate service , had left an ample library behind him , and the books passed into the hands of every invader in the town . Pope finally arrived at Warrenton , and as the troops seemed to be rapidly concentrating , I judged it expedient to procure a horse at once , and canvassed the country with that object . By paying a quartermaster the Government price ( $130 ) , I could select a steed from the pound , but inspection satisfied me that a good saddle nag could not be obtained in this way . After much parleying with Hebrews and chaffing with country people , I heard that Mayor Bragg kept some fair animals , and when I stated my purpose at his house , he commenced the business after a fashion immemorial at the South , by producing some whiskey . When Mayor Bragg had asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pints of a hoss , " and what " figger in the way of price " would suit me , he told an erudite negro named " Jeems " to trot out the black colt . The black colt made his appearance by vaulting over a gate , and playfully shivering a panel of fence with his " off " hoof . Then he executed a flourish with his tail , leaped thrice in the air , and bit savagely at the man " Jeems . " When I asked Mayor Bragg if the black colt was sufficiently gentle to stand fire , he replied that he was gentle as a lamb and offered to put me astride him . I had no sooner taken my seat , however , than the black colt backed , neighed , flourished , and stood erect , and finally ran away . A second animal was produced , less mettlesome , but also black , finely strung , daintily hoofed , and as Mayor Bragg said , " just turned four year . " The price of this charger was one hundred and ninety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mayor Bragg proposed to take one hundred and seventy-five ; we compromised upon a hundred and fifty dollars , Major Bragg throwing in a halter , and by good luck I procured a saddle the same evening , so that I rode triumphantly through the streets of Warrenton , and fancied that all the citizens were admiring my new purchase . I was struck with the fact , that Mayor Bragg , though an ardent patriot , would accept of neither Confederate nor Virginia money ; he required payment for his animal , in Father Chase 's " greenbacks . " Mounted anew , I fell into my former active habits , and made two journeys , to Sperryville and Little Washington , in one direction , to Madison in another ; each place was probably twenty miles distant ; the latter was merely a cavalry outpost , where Generals Hatch and Bayard were stationed , and the former villages were the head-quarters , respectively , of General Banks and General Siegel . Madison was , at this time , a precarious place for a long tarrying . I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival , and at that time the place was thronged with cavalry and artillery-men . Next morning , when I aroused , not a blue-coat could be seen . They had fallen back in the darkness , and prudently abstaining from breakfast , I galloped northward , as if the whole Confederate army was at my heels . These old turnpike roads were now marked by daily chases and rencontres . A few Virginians , fleetly mounted , would provoke pursuit from a squad of Federals , and the latter would be led into ambuscades . A quaint incident happened in this manner , near Madison . Captain T. was chasing a party of Confederates one afternoon , when his company was suddenly fired upon from a wheatfield , parties rising up on both sides of the road , and discharging carbines through the fence rails . Three or four men , and as many horses were slain ; but the ambushing body was outnumbered , and several of its members killed . Among others , a young lieutenant took deliberate aim at Captain T. at the distance of twelve yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his carbine to surrender . The Captain had already drawn his revolver , and , amazed at the murderous purpose , he shot the assassin in the head , killing him instantly . Nobody blamed Captain T. , but he was said to be a humane person , and the affair preyed so continually upon his mind , that he committed suicide one night in camp . At Sperryville I saw and talked with Franz Siegel , the idol of the German Americans . He had been a lieutenant in his native country , but subsided , in St. Louis , to the rank of publican , keeping a beer saloon . When the war commenced , he was appointed to a colonelcy , in deference to the large German republican population of Missouri . His abilities were speedily manifested in a series of engagements which redeemed the Southern border , and he finally fought the terrible battle of Pea Ridge , Arkansas , which broke the spirit of the Confederates west of the Mississippi . The man who fought " mit Siegel " in those days , was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pays not'ing for your lager . " Siegel now commanded one of Pope 's corps . He was a diminutive person , but well-knit , emaciated by his active career , feverish and sanguine of face , and , as it appeared to me , consuming with energy and ambition . As a General he was prompt to decide and do , and his manner of dealing with Confederate property was severer than that of any American . He battered the splendid mansion hotel of White Sulphur Springs to the ground , for example , when somebody discharged a rifle from its window . He preferred to fight by retreating , and if pursued , generally unmasked his guns and made massacre with the scattered opponents . Another German commander was Blenker , whose corps of Germans might have belonged to the free bands of the Black forest . They were the most lawless men in the Federal service , and what they did not steal they destroyed . Such volunteers were mercenaries , in every sense of the word . I have been told that they slaughtered sheep and cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make a cleaner sweep of provisions . The Germans , as a rule , lacked the dash of the Irish troops and the tact of the Americans . They thought and fought in masses , had little individuality , and were thick-skulled ; but they were persevering and had their hearts in the cause . General Banks was a fine representative of the higher order of Yankee . Originally a machinist in a small manufacturing town near Boston , he educated himself , and was elected successively Legislator , Governor , Congressman , and General of volunteers . His personal graces were equalled by his energy , and his ability was considerable . He has been very successful in the field , and has conducted a retreat unparalleled in the war ; these things being always reckoned among American successes . The country hereabout was mountainous , healthy , and well adapted for campaigning . Streams and springs were numerous , and there were fine sites for camps . The deserted toll-houses along the way glowered mournfully through the rent windows , and I fancied them , sometimes , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ancient road that wind'st deserted , Through the level of the vale ,  - -  Sweeping toward the crowded market , Like a stream without a sail , Standing by thee , I look backward , And , as in the light of dreams , See the years descend and vanish , Like thy tented wains and teams .  --  T. B. READ . To provide myself with thorough equipment for Pope 's campaign , I returned to Washington , and purchased a patent camp-bed , which strapped to my saddle , saddle bags of large capacity , India-rubber blankets , and a full suit of waterproof cloth ,  --  hat , coat , genoullieres , and gauntlets . I had my horse newly shod , I drew upon my establishment for an ample sum of money , and , to properly inaugurate the campaign , I gave an entertainment in the parlor of the inn . Pipes , cold ham , a keg of beer , and a demijohn of whiskey comprised the attractions of the night . The guests were three Captains , two Adjutants , two Majors , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal officer . There was some jesting , and much laughing , considerable story-telling , and ( toward the small hours ) a great deal of singing . Much heroism was evolved ; all the guests were devoted to death and their country ; and there was one person who took off his coat to fight an imaginary something , but changed his mind , and dropped asleep directly . At length , a gallant Captain , to demonstrate his warlike propensities , fired a pistol through the front window ; and somebody blowing out the candles , the whole party retired to rest upon the floor . In this delightful way my third campaign commenced , and next evening I set off for the advance . CHAPTER XXII . ARMY MORALS . Some of General McDowell 's aides had invited me to pass a night with them at Warrenton Springs . Fully equipped , I joined Captain Ball , of Cincinnati , and we rode southward , over a hard , picturesque turnpike , under a clear moonlight . The distance was seven miles , and a part of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music of camps . Volunteers are fond of serenading their officers ; and this particular evening was the occasion of much merry-making , since a majority of the brass bands were to be mustered out of the service to-morrow . We could hear the roll of drums from imperceptible localities , and the sharp winding of bugles broke upon the silence like the trumpet of the Archangel . Stalwart shapes of horsemen galloped past us , and their hoofs made monotone behind , till the cadence died so gradually away that we did not know when the sound ceased and when the silence began . The streams had a talk to themselves , as they strolled away into the meadow , and an owl or two challenged us , calling up a corporal hawk . This latter fellow bantered and blustered , and finally we fell into an ambush of wild pigs , which charged across the road and plunged into the woods . There were despatch stations at intervals , where horses stood saddled , and the couriers waited for hoof-beats , to be ready to ride fleetly toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Arctic skies , where remote camps built conflagration ; and trudging wearily down the stony road , poor ragged , flying negroes , with their families and their worldly all , came and went  --  God help them !  --  and touched their hats so obsequiously that my heart was wrung , and I felt a nervous impulse to put them upon my steed and take their burdens upon my back . Little sable folk , asleep and ahungered , drawn to that barefoot woman 's breast ; and the tired boy , weeping as he held to his father 's hand ; and the father with the sweat of fatigue and doubt upon his forehead ,  --  children of Ishmael all ; war raging in the land , but God overhead ! These are the " wandering Jews " of our day , hated North and South , because they are poor and blind , and do no harm ; but out of their wrongs has arisen the abasement of their wrongers . Is there nothing over all ? We entered the beautiful lawn of the Springs ' hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take our horses . By the lamplight and moo//
