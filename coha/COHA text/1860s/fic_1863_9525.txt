SCENE II .  --  in 3 Chamber : Table , covered with bottles , jars and different vessels , labeled with different medicines , such as " Joy to the Afflicted , " " Use Helmbold 's Buchu , " " Brandreth 's Pills , " " Petroleum Ointment , " &c.; &c.; Gong suspended from the ceiling , within reach , tenor drum , bass drum trombone , contra bass , and large hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered seated in large arm-chair , crutches on each side of chair ; he has both legs bandaged , night-cap on his head , one arm in a sling , the other hand bandaged ; he is dressed in dressing-gown . Muggs Masticator Muggs Oh dear ! I feel that I am fading fast away ; I know I must be going , I 'm a very sick man ; I know it because I ca n't eat anything , and I ca n't sleep at all ; only day before yesterday I only swallowed half-a-dozen hard boiled eggs , eat two lobsters , a dozen hard clams , a pound of switzer cheese , and drank two quarts of buttermilk , and have n't slept a wink since ; I know my hour is coming fast , for I 've been fasting ever since ; I do all I can to promote health ; I read all the medical works I can get hold of ; Dr. James ' Almanac is my favorite work , and I try all their medicines , but they do n't do me any good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they do n't do me any good ; and though some of their medicines are very searching , yet they do n't do me any good . One of my physicians , Dr. Tucker , of Brooklyn , is an excellent doctor , and firm friend ; he said the cause of my disease was a want of iron in my blood , and though I 've taken regularly , six times a day , a two ounce paper of jump tacks in a quart of molasses , I ca n't see that I improve any ; they do n't do me any good ; in fact , a quarter of an hour afterward , I feel awful ; then my voice is growing weaker and weaker ; when I call aloud , I ca n't make any one hear me ; calls Jubil  --  Jubil  --  very loud and so I 'm obliged to use these instruments to summon my attendants ; I 'm so weak I can scarcely breathe , and my nerves are in such a weak state that the slightest noise drives me nearly crazy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a terrible noise . Oh dear ! I 've scarcely any strength left in my body , and I 'm reduced to that extreme weakness , that I could n't lift a feather . Jumps up , takes large chair , and with perfect ease carries it up the stage , then rings bell violently . There ! I feel it coming on again ; my blood is running the wrong way ; sometimes it 's in my head , then my heels are dead ; sometimes it 's in my feet , then my head is dead ; but at those times I feel a little encouraged , for I know there are other " dead heads " in the house besides myself ; now the tide is going down into my feet , and I shall be obliged to stand on my head all night long to let my blood run back into my head . Turns up against scene . Enter Jubilate . JubeJubilate Nectarine Coming , sir , coming ; I 'll be with you , sir , in the twinkling of a pig 's tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Golly , he 's vamosed ; s'posen I turn In-val-id , myself , and make a shoticary pop of my stomach ! Sits in chair , and sticks his feet upon the table . Let me see , I think I know the remedy best adapted to my complaint . Takes bottle labeled " Brandy " and drinks Ah ! that 's the medicine ! I believe that would cure a broken limb ; there ! I guess that will do till I get another chance , when the old man ai n't around . Turns , and sees the old man standing on his head . What 's that ? I declare if the old man is n't top-heavy ; how pale he looks about the feet ; his sole 's soul gone up , sure , this time , sure enough ; he 's heel 'd at last , and that 's an end of him till time shall wax no more ; that 's all awl I 've got to say . To the old man . Say , old man ! what you doing there ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; do n't you know you 'll swallow your chew of tobacco if you stand up that way ! Stoops down to his face as if to speak to him , when old man drops his legs down , striking Jube on the back ; they both roll over and over ; bus. ; they finally get up . Muggs Masticator Muggs Jubil , I feel that my last hour has come . Unwraps his hand . Do you know , Jubil , that this wart on my hand  --  I mean on my finger  --  gives me great uneasiness ? I do n't think there 's any danger now , Jubil , but there may be hereafter . Jube Jubilate Nectarine I guess , master , when you get to hereafter , you wo n't know wart hurt you . Muggs Masticator Muggs Oh ! Jubil ! I 'm a very sick man ; I stumped my toe the other day , and if I had n't have had on my heavy boots at the time , I might have broken my leg ; besides , I 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . I 'll tell you , Jubil ; you go and heat the poker red-hot ; I think I 'll run it down my throat four or five times , and see if it will do me any good . Oh Lord ! I 'm such an unfortunate creature ! Exit Jubil . I do everything I can think of to get well . Takes up bottle marked " Joy to the Afflicted . " This is the last bottle of this ; I 've taken over two hundred gross of this medicine , but it do n't do me any good ! It 's nothing but molasses and alum . No one does me any good ; I do n't think , at this rate , I can live more than a hundred years more ! Ah ! how brief is this life to the afflicted ! I have exhausted all the medical schools ; last week I tried Homeopathy , and the week before I tried Allopathy ; and the week before that , Hydropathy ! I was advised to try a hot bath , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me any good ! Then I tried cold water , and passed five days among the frogs at the bottom of a well , but it did n't do me any good ; but it seemed to give me a slight chill for four or five minutes ! Enter Jubil , with the poker . Jube Jubilate Nectarine Here you are , master ! Muggs Masticator Muggs Why , what 's this ? Jube Jubilate Nectarine The poke-him , master . Muggs Masticator Muggs Oh yes , Jubil ! I had forgotten all about it ! Give it to me . Takes wrong end of poker  --  bus . with poker . Why , I declare , Jubil , it 's quite warm ! Let me see , I will now excoriate my throat , and see if it will do me any good . Puts poker down his throat , but instantly withdraws it . Bless me , how it burns ! Oh Lord , Jubil ! give me something , quick ! give me something cold ! Jube Jubilate Nectarine Will you have some " ice cream " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Jube gets bottle brandy , offers it , then drinks it all himself . Give me the oil , quick , Jubil ! Jube takes demijohn marked " Croton Oil , " fills a tumbler ; gives it to Muggs  --  Muggs drinks part of the contents as Jubil drinks the brandy ; both place their glasses on the table , and look at each other ; inadvertently they exchange glasses  --  both drink . Bus . Muggs Masticator Muggs What was that you gave me ? Was it castor oil ? Jube takes up demijohn  --  looks at it  --  drops it suddenly . Jube Jubilate Nectarine Oh Lord ! I 'm a dead man ! " Croton Oil ! " Oh dear , I 'm a goner ! Bus . of crossing and re-crossing the stage kept up till Back matter The End .
