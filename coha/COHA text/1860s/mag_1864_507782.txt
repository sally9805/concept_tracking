txt THE SIEGE OF LOUISBURG . IT is well known that in the early history of this country the French claimed , by right of discovery , all the Canadas , from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the great lakes ; while England , on the same ground , claimed the entire conntry , extending from Nova Scotia to Georgia . France held also the Mississippi River , which she declared gave her a right to its tribntaries . Although the first attempt to connect this river with the lakes was foiled by the Chickasaws , who killed in battle or tortured to death the entire party who made it , a second proved successful . Still the route by the Mississippi to the head waters of the lakes was too circuitous to be of practical use to her Canadian provinces ; hence the possession of the Gulf of St. Lawrence became of paramount importance to her . Cape Breton , an island from thirty to tixty miles across , and separated from Nova Scotia only by a narrow channel , called Canso , stood sentinel on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty lea*ues distant , was its companion in keeping a perpetual guard over its entrance . But Cape Breton , so necessary to France if she wished to hold the navigation of the St. Lawrence , was only four hours ' sail from the great Fishing Banks , and in case of war ships nader the protection of fortifications erected there could easily destroy the English fisheries . It stood , moreover , right in the track of trading vessels passing between the Provinces and the mother country , and hence was of vital importance to England , as in case of war the commerce would at once be cut off . The result was that these places , or rather Cape Breton , was from the first settlement of the coilatry a bone of contention between the two Governments , and passed backward and forward , according to the chances and changes of war , until by the treaty of Utrecht , in 1713 , Cape Breton was ceded to France and Nova Scotia to Great Britain . France immediately commenced fortifying the former in the most formidable manner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gates and ditch and draw-bridge as in feudal times . The ramparts were of massive stone , a ad from thirty to thirty-six feet high . The walls were surrounded by a ditch eighty feet wide , and made a circuit two and a half miles in extent . These were strengthened with fortifications at every point where an enemy could approach . There was one portion , however , on the sea-side where there was no wall . A simple ditch with pickets protected this , as the water there was so shallow that no vessel could approach the shore . At the entrance of the harbor lay a little island , scarce a quarter of a mile across , on which the French erected a battery of thirty 28-pounders , which they called the Island Battery . The light-house stood on an eminence in the northeast part , and near it the magazine , and houses containinganval stores , etc . The town of Louisburg was regularly laid out in squares with broad streets . Around the west entrance where there was a draw-bridge , the French erected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate in its fire . At the bottom of the harbor stood the grand Royal Battery , frowning with its twenty-eight 42-pounders and two 18-pounders . France had been twenty-five years at a cost of $6,000,000 in building this almost invulnerable position , and it was still unfinished when war broke out in 1775 between her and England . France declared war March 15th , and England two weeks later . England hind but tw'o forts in Nova Scotia-one on the island of Causo in the mouth of the Strait , another on the Bay of Fundy , named Annapolis . The French at Louisburg , taking advantage of the two weeks ' interval between her declaration of war and that of her enemy , attacked Nova Scotia at once . Canso , wholly unprepared for such a movement , surrendered without attempting any resistance , and the garrison was captured . Governor Shirley , of Massachusetts , immediately sent reinforcements to the latter place , in time to save it from sharing the same fate . Soon after the formal declaration of war by England was received in the provinces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commotion , and the bustle of preparation was heard on every side . The French on one hand and the Indians on the other caused a great deal of alarm , and called forth the most vigorous efforts for self-protection . All through the autumn there was much talk in Boston among the colonists about the necessity of taking Louisburg if they wished to have navigation secure between them and the mother country . About this time an exchange of prisoners was made between the belligerents , and those at Louisbnrg returned to Boston . These gave such an account of the strength of the fortifications there that Governor Shirley , to whom the capture of this place had become a settled resolution and the absorbing idea of his life , decided that it ' could not be reduced by regular siege , but must be taken by surprise . Vaughan , of New Hampshire , was also busy in collecting all the information he could , and having ascertamed from some men who had been prisoners in Louisburg that in winter-time , on one side , // where no cannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , the snow drifted to a height nearly on a level with the wall , and was packed so hard and close by the fierce north winds that it would hear a man , conceived the original idea of taking Louisburg by snow , which would thus obviate the necessity of scaling-ladders . But there were many objections to this plan . Among others , it was not so easy to effect a landing in mid-winter on an ice-bound shore ; besides , snow-drifts were not always to be depended upon , and if they were not on hand at the right time and in the proper spot were not things that troops could create or shift from l ) lace to place as circumstances or the nature of the case might require . A thaw at a certain juncture would be particularly embarrassing . In the mean time Shirley wrote letters home asking that orders might be dispatched to Commodore Warren , commanding the fleet on the West India station , directing him to co-operate with the Colonies in the contemplated attack on Louisburg . He then called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , required the astounded members to take an oath of secrecy before be would lay before them his communication . They yielded to the unprecedented request , when the Governor revealed to them his purpose and plan of taking Louishurg . The secret , however , was too weighty for one of those to whom it was intrusted to bear alone . He became so filled with the solemnity and momentousness of the project that one day , in his family devotions , he burst forth with a fervent invocation that the blessing of Heaven might attend the enterprise . Whether the good old deacon thought that telling the Lord was no violation of trust or breach of confidence , or feeling that he must tell somebody , and the Lord was the safest one to confide it to , or whether it burst forth in the sudden overflow of his feelings , does not appear ; but the news soon spread like wild-fire that the deacon had prayed for the blessing of heaven on Governor Shirley 's project for taking Louisburg . The deacon was at once closely interrogated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was in session at the time , was thunder-struck and alarmed at the boldness of the undertaking , and immediately appointed a committee to investigate and report on the subject . The report was wholly and strongly against it . The Governor , though somewhat chagrined at this dead-lock with the Legislature , was determined not to be so easily driven from his favorite project , and be adroitly caused a petition asking a reconsideration of the question to be signed by the principal merchants in the city and Salem , and presented to the Legislature . This was referred to another committee , which reported in its favor . On this a very animated and stormy discussion arose in the House , which lasted for two days . It was plain that there was a majority against the scheme . But by one of those political tricks which we are apt to believe are the offspring of these degenerate days it was fir*ally carried by a majority of one . Several members who were known to be opposed to it absented themselves , whether necessarily or by persuasion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , however , and the question was pushed to a vote , and carried , as said before , by one majority . Although its opponents fought it stoutly , as soon as it was decided the greatest unanimity prevailed in carrying out the measure , while the people were wild with enthusiasm in its favor . Fishermen being thrown out of employ . ment by the war , were willing to enlist as soldiers ; while the abundant crops of the past year , and the unusually mild winter that kept the waters open and the Indians away , seemed to conspire together to favor the enterprise . It was thought that 4000 men , with such naval force as the Colonies could raise , would be sufficient . At all events they could retake Canso and capture merchantmen , if they failed in the attack on Louisburg . Circulars were at once sent to the different Colonies , and it was soon found that more volunteers would offer themselves than were needed . The chief difficulty was to find a man competent to command so large an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place as Louisburg ; for there was not a man in the Colonies who had ever witnessed a regular siege , or been in a pitched battle . The choice finally fell on Colonel William Pepperell , a wealthy merchant , heavily en gaged in the fisheries , and withal exceedingly popular among all classes . He at first hesitated to accept so great a trust , and asked the advice of the celebrated preacher Whitfield , who was then staying at his house . The minister told him that the prospect was not very flattering . All eyes would be upon him : and if he failed , the widows and orphans of those who fell in battle would upbraid him ; and if he succeeded , he would be the object of envy and jealousy . Still , if he would go with a single eye to God 's glory , and intent only on doing his duty , strength would be given him according to his necessities . He afterward , by request , furnished the following motto for the flag : " Nil desperandum Gliristo dece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious character to the enterprise , and many of Whitfield 's followers enlisted . The fact too that the French were Catholics , holding the hated religion of their persecutors , caused the people to look upon it as a holy crusade ; and it became an absorbing part of all religious services . From the pulpit , in the public prayermeetin* , and at the family altar , it called forth the most impassioned appeals to Heaven for its favor . Many chaplains volunteered to serve , one of whom carried a hatchet with which to demolish the images be expected to find in the French churches . Religious men from every part of the province wrote to Pepperell , bidding him God-speed . One Deacon John Gray , of Biddeford , wrote : " Oh that I could be with you and dear Parson Moody , to destroy the im // ages set up in the churches , and hear the true Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ preached in their place ! My wife , who is ill and confined to her hed , yet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sons should wait on you , though it is greatly to our damage one of them is already enlisted . " Pepperell , cheered hy the enthusiasm he witnessed on every side , threw himself heart and soul into the enterprise , and advanced ? 5000 out of his own fortune to pay the expenses . Courteous , frank , and of a hold and chivalrous spirit , he was just the man to command such a crowd of fishermen , mechanics , and laborers as he designed to pour around the impregnable walls of Louisburg . Governor Shirley thought that it would he well , out of compliment , and to enlist the vigorous co-operation of the Governor of New I-lampshire , to appear to wish that he was Commanderin-chief . So after Pepperell was appointed , he - knowing that the Governor was so afflicted with the gout as to he a cripple and unable to move ahout his house even unassisted-wrote him a polite note , saying that lie should have proposed to him to take charge of the expedition , only he knew his lameness would prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away his crutches , and replied that he was ready to go . This unexpected turn of affairs took Shirley quite aback , so he made an apology , and stated that any change in the command at that late hour would prove disastrous to the enterprise . To prevent the French at Louishurg from getting wind of what was preparing for them , no vessels were allowed to depart toward Nova Scotia ; and no proclamation to enlist soldiers was allowed to he copied . A hundred vessels were selected to carry the army , which numbered all told 4300 soldiers , and the siege trains , provisions , and munitions of war . Before their departure Shirley drew up an elahorate plan of attack , for he still resolved to take the place hy surprise . It required nearly a quarter of an hour to read over these explicit directions , and it is impossible to say how lung it would take to commit them to memory . Even if every thing ivent on as glibly as the Governor traced it out on paper , a commander would need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then or he would omit some part of the extensive programme . Prohably another such a military paper can not he found on record . The simultaneous arrival before the place of a hundred vessels ; the landing on a rocky shore , without regard to weather or surf ; the march of two or three miles through woods and swamps to the town ; the scaling of walls 36 feet high ; and taking one by one of those formidable batteries , he timed as accurately as one times a fast-trotting horse . Although it was in the stormy spring months the fleet of a hundred sail was to reach the point of rendezvous the same night despite of calms and gales . Thus the first part of the programme having failed to be performed the whole of course broke down . Some of the vessels sailed in the middle of March to cruise off the port of the place and capture French merchantmen on their way thither . Those carrying the M*ssachusetts troops left on the 24th of March and reached Canso the 1st of April . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were already there , and in a few days those of Connecticut followed . The departure of this force was a momentous event to Boston , and the deepest solemnity pervaded the population . A day of public fasting and prayer was appointed , and in some of the churches weekly prayer-meetings were established for the especial purpose of praying for the success of the expedition ; while every where earnest supplications were sent up that God would make the army victorious over those who had set up images in the laud to worship instead of the one true God . The expedition had started too early in the season ; for when they arrived at Cause they found the shores of Cape Breton fringed with heavy ice , through which it would be impossible to force the boats . They therefore employed the time in building a block-house to receive the sick and wounded , as well as for purposes of defense , and in making cartridges for the siege ; for all thoughts of taking it by surprise were now abandoned , and preparations were set on foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French and Indians , in which a few of the latter were taken prisoners , but the garrison remained quiet . On the 28th the ship Eltheem , of 40 guns , was seen standing toward the harbor . Her arrival was hailed with aeclamations , for she brought the welcome news that Warren 's fleet was close at hand . By none was this announcement received with greater pleasure than by Pepperell ; for Warren had decided a short time before the expedition sailed not to accompany it or assist in any way in the reduction of the place . This disheartening decision Pepperell kept from his troops lest it should discourage them ; hut it did not affect his purpose , for he at once resolved to proceed without him . Since the departure of the army , however , Warren had received orders from England to co-operate with Pepperell ; and he immediately hurried forward with his fleet . The vessel brought also a flattering letter from Shirley , in which lie promised reinforcements and provisions , and added that he had received a package from England containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his movements . - At length the sun and rain having melted the ice where it adhered to the shore , the ponderous masses drifted slowly out to sea , leaving the harbor clear . As soon as this was observed all was bustle and preparation on board the fleet . The French had discovered the vessels some time before , but supposed they were privateers lying in wait for merchantmen , never dreaming // that an attack was to be made on Louisburg . They deemed the place impregnable . Indeed it had been reported to the Home Government that women alone could defend it against any force the Colonies conid bring against it . They therefore took no precautions , and made no preparations . Pepperell embarked his troops on the evening of the 28th , intending to make a landing under cover of night . Bnt the wind died away , so that the transports did not reach Cabarus Bay till ei0ht o'clock in the morning-one of the little possible circumstances that Governor Shirley entirely overlooked in drawing up his plan . The surprise of the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw from the ramparts a bay white with countless vessels standing steadily on toward the town . At first they were paralyzed at the unexpected sight , and for a while did nothing , and seemed to think it must be a mere vision , which would vanish as suddenly as it had appeared . But when they saw boat after boat , crowded with men and glittering with bayonets , put off from the ships , they suddenly awoke from their delusion , and all the bells were set ringing , and the roll of the drum and shriek of the fife were heard within the walls , summoning the soldiers to arouse ; while the sullen thunder of cannon proclaimed to the alarmed inhabitants that the foe was at hand . The formidable appearance of this first warlike attempt on a large scale by the Colonies would not disgrace our country*at the present time . Those 100 transports , accompanied by the heavy men-of-war of Warren 's fleet , the vast crowd of boats pulling steadily to the shore , presented an appearance that might fill with anxiety the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all on one side ; it was several miles from the shore to Louisburg , and there was nothing but some scattered fishermen 's huts on shore , against which this imposing armament could apparently be directed . There were the woods and the desolate beach , but no fortress or army . The far-off booming cannon alone told that an enemy lay intrenched in that remote and uninhabited region . As the boats approached the shore strains of martial music were heard issuing from the woods ; and soon after a detachment of French troops , with drums beating and colors flying , appeared on the banks to dispute the landing . The leading boats pulled for a certain point , as if to land there ; and the troops immediately marched to the threatened spot . But this movement of the American commander was a feint to draw the*enemy thither . Having done this , he changed his course and pulled for a point two miles farther inland . Then commenced a race between the troops on land and the boats on the bay . The latter had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled to follow , more or less , the sinuosities of the shore , and make their way over irregular and broken ground , and through marshes which impeded their march . The boats out of shot pulled cheerily*on to the steady chant of the sailors and the inspiritiug yet defiant music of the bands ; while the roll of drums on shore-now faint , and now more distinct , as they advanced or receded from the sea - followed after . Though but few of these Provincial troops had ever been in battle , all were in the highest spirits , and laughed and shouted as if going to some festivity , instead of to the deadly encounter . Reaching their point of destination they shot their boats swiftly to the beach , and leaping ashore were soon in battle-array . The officers dressed the line , and seeing the French approaching determined not to wait to be attacked , but breaking into order of battle marched swiftly forward to meet the enemy . As they approached within shot the Provincials gave a loud hurrah and poured in a volley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and immediately wheeled and fled in disorder toward the garrison , leaving six killed and several wounded or taken prisoners . The Americans did not pursue them , as their first object was to secure the landing of the troops , cannon , stores , and provisions . The French seeing they were not followed , retraced their steps leisurely , setting fire to all the houses on their way ; so that a line of conflagrations marked their passage back , the smoke and flames of which , rolling and shooting heavenward , furnished a fitting prelude to the more terrific scenes that were soon to be enacted . The other boats now rapidly arrived loaded to the gunwales with troops , and by night half the army was landed . In the mean time the tents had been pitched , camp-fires lighted , and supper cooked . These mechanics , farmers , and citizens , bivouacked on the ground with the nonchalance and gayety of old soldiers , and the camp rang with their merry laughter and snatches of song . At length the hour of retiring came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the only moving objects that disturbed the repose of the scene were the sentinels as they trod their regular beats . The boats lay stretched in a long row upon the beach , a little further inland ; the tents shone white through the gloom ; while farther beyond stretched the dark belt of forest . Dim in the distance was seen the fleet riding lazily at anchor , and over all bent the tranquil sky luminous with stars . The sea on one side and the boundless wilderness on the other , inclosing this picturesque scene , gave to it a sweet and tranquil aspect rather than a warlike one . The morning bugle sounding the rdveill* suddenly transformed it into one of bustle and activity . After breakfast the work of disembarkation recommenced . , Provisions and cannon were both landed , and the latter placed so as to protect the camp in case of attack . By night nearly the whole army was under canvas . The third day the heavy siege guns were got on shore . This was a labor of more difficulty ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pep- // qwq his teeth , carried to the top of the flag-staff , and nailed it there , amidst the loud shouts and uproarious mirth of the soldiers . The French soon discovered the blunder they had committed , and endeavored to repair it hy sending four boats coutniuiug a hundred meu to retake the fort . Vaughan no soouer discovered them npproachin* than he ordered his little band to march to the shore . here he drew them up , and as soon as the enemy came within range opened his fire , upon them . The exposed beach on which he stood was within the range of the guns of the town , which were immediately turned upon him . The heavy shot came plowing up the sand around him , or rushed like a sudden gust of wind overhead ; but he never stirred , maintaining his exposed position and repelling every effort of the enemy to effect a landing . At length the sound of martial music came over the hill , and soon the reinforcements he had sent for appeared in view . These , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed forward . The French , perceiving this new force approach , pulled swiftly out of fire and returned to the garrison . They hardly knew what to think of their enemy . On the first landing they rushed to the fight with the fury and appalling shouts of madmen rather than of well-trained soldiers and instead of being content with the ordinary slaughter of volley-firing picked off their foes as they would squirrels from tree-tops . With such clamor and desperation did they close in conflict that the French gave them the name which the Mexicans a few years ago gave our troops , " Devils . " That frenzy and fury in battle has always been characteristic of American soldiers , and was only kept in abeyance in the Revolution by the constant effort to make our armies combat the English in their own formal , scientific way , which the latter understood so much better than we . The fiery , headlong charge of Arnold into the very sally-port of the enemy at Saratoga showed how native courage and enthusiasm , unshackled by mere tactics , could triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Christ our Leader , " increased their bewilderment ; for it seemed to proclaim that the colonists had come on a holy crusade against them as pagans and infidels . In their panic-stricken flight from the fort the night before the garrison did not stop to collect the live-stock which were roaming in herds over the fields . These the Americans caught and secured , thus adding materially to their stock of provisions . The loss of twentyeigl*t 42-pounders was a serious one to the enemy ; and when it was ascertained how foolishly they had been given up , the rage of the French was unbounded ; for the banner , flaunting so proudly from the flag-star proclaimed not only their defeat but their folly and cowardice . Immediately on the return of the boats they opened all the guns that could be made to bear on the battery . All day long it flamed and thundered there with a power apparently suffi cient to level that battery with the earth . The air was darkened with the round shot and shell that burst overhead or went tearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the guns had not been placed so as to command their own battery . They had always supposed it would be able to take care of itself . While this iron storm was hurtling overhead and around them the Americans were quietly drilling out the spiked cannon so as to return the fire . As fast as those 42-pounders were cleared they opened in response to the heavy guns of the garrison , and the ponderous shot fell with crushing weight upon the buildings of the town . The Royal Battery being thus captured and put in working order against the enemy , Pepperell next turned his attention to the Island Battery , whose formidable guns kept the men-of-war from approaching near enough to shell the town . In the mean time the greatest effort was made to get all his artillery across the marsh . The difficulty of the undertaking may he known from the fact that it took two weeks of unremitting exhausting toil before all the guns could be brought into camp ; but as fast as they arrived they were placed in battery and opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all erected in the night time , to avoid the shots of the enemy till they were completed . The first battery was built on Green Hill , which directly overlooked the town and was only three quarters of a mile distant from the northwest bastion . The fire from this tormented the garrison dreadfully , and with the Royal Battery would soon have reduced the place but for its marvelous strength . Indeed such was the impregnable character of the defenses that the place had been christened the " Little Gibraltar . " Soon after Pepperell planted another battery within half a mile of the walls , and on the 5th of May these two , with the Grand Battery , the guns of which had all been got in working condition , were in full play , and a hurricane of shot and shell smote the town . Houses tumbled in upon the frightened inhabitants who fled to the cellars for protection ; for the 42-pound shot fell with terrible force into the place , and the dull , heavy concussion , as they dropped on the roofs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When night came on the scene was terrifically sublime . Huge shells rose in graceful curves , and leaving long trains of fire as they descended , burst in mid air , or disappeared for a moment behind the walls , only to make a still greater illumination as they exploded . The Town and Island Batteries replied with all their guns , shedding a strange light far out to sea , and illumining the back-ground of forest and the white tents of the camp like a great conflagration . The Provincials had never seen war on such a grand scale before , yet they took to their work like veterans . Under cover of this terrific fire a third battery was erected within 700 yards of // the walls , making in all four batteries , which , concentrating their fire on the place , threw shot and shell with fearful rapidity and without cessation into the garrison . For two entire days this crushing fire was kept up , the shores trembling under the heavy explosions as though shaken by an earthquake . It then ceased , and Pepperell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surrender of the place . The latter curtly replied that when he did it would be at the cannon 's mouth . When this answer was received the signal was given to reopen the fire , and it recommenced fiercer than ever , and was kept np till dark . Pepperell then ordered a fascine battery to be erected within 250 yards of the west gate . The Proviiicials knew nothing of the regular scientific way of making approaches ; and when an engineer , by the name of Bastide , sent by the Governor to instruct them , arrived and began to talk about zigzags , epaulements , and parallels , they took it as a good joke , made merry at his expense , and went on in the old way . While this heavy cannonading was going on Pepperell made three attempts to storm the Island Battery , but high winds , making a heavy surf , or dense fogs , prevented him from embarking , and he finally abandoned it for the present . The night of the 13th was dark and stormy , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blockade and getting into the harbor . The fleet discovered her soon after she had passed and opened its fire . The Island Battery returned it , and under cover of its guns the brig dropped her anchor before the town . The garrison of the Royal Battery , seeing by the blaze of the guns which lighted up the whole harbor what was going on , brought out some cannon , and with red-hot shot endeavored to burn the brig . The fire of the Island Battery and the Town was immediately concentrated on them , which soon made the place so hot that they had to flee from their guns , leaving several of their number dead behind them . The town was alarmed , thinking a general assault was about to be made . This excitement had scarcely subsided when the port was illuminated by a fire-ship sent by the Commodore , which came driving shoreward before the fierce sea blast . The flames ran up the tall masts , and swayed like streamers in the gale , as she plunged boldly and like a fiery demon among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a tremendous explosion that shook the town , and again sent the frightened inhabitants into the streets . The walls in some places were damaged by it as well as the shipping in port . On the 15th the fascine battery was finished , and mounted with two 42-pounders and two 18-pounders . The next day thirty cannon were discovered below low-water mark , evidently left there by the French in order to mount new batteries . A regiment was sent to raise and mount them . The French observing the movement dispatched a party to thwart it , but they were driven back and the guns raised and mounted . On the night of the 18th the fascine battery was in.full play , and its effect was terrible . Planted at the short distance of only 250 yards from the gate , it sent the 42-shot . through and through the thick walls as if they had been pasteboard , leaving huge round holes where they passed . The damage would have been greater had the battery been farther off . Under this close and murderous fire the gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into fragments , and a part of the wall carried away . So close were the besiegers and besieged that conversation was frequently carried on . Once in the cessation of the firing it lasted nearly half an hour , and in the morning twilight they called to each other to come over and take breakfast or a glass of wine , followed , by a laugh at some witty retort or attempt to speak each other 's language . Such good feeling appeared to exist among them , that a mere listener might have taken them for two friendly camps instead of deadly foes seeking for each other 's blood . About this time the spirits of the army were very much exhilarated by the news that the French ship Vigilant , of 64 guns , had been captured while attempting to enter the port . The troops had been now a month or more under tents , and , unaccustomed to outdoor life , the exposures to which the cold spring months in these high latitudes subjected them began at length to tell on their health . Dysentery broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers that it soon looked like a hospital . The men began to grow impatient and distrustful . Warren also had got tired of riding quietly at anchor there for a month , and urged Pepperell to storm the Island Battery so that he could move up his ships . Things began to wear a gloomy aspect . Gunners were scarce , as many of those on whom they had relied had been killed or wounded . The services of most of the remainder in a short time were not wanted , for powder had become so scarce that a great portion of the batteries had to cease firing . Pepperell sent home for more , accounting for the scarcity by saying that the 42 's used it up very fast . Warren sent a proposal to Pepperell to attack the Island Battery , but the plan was arranged so as to put the entire command of land and sea forces under the former , which Pepperell was not inclined to permit . Besides , the proposition , if carried out , would oblige him to leave his camp but slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he objected . In the mean time the Commodore learned casually , from some remarks dropped by the prisoners taken with the Vigilant , that several war ships were expected daily from France . This did not serve to cool his impatience or furnish much comfort to Peppercli . Still , what could be done ? That little Gibraltar bore pounding like a rock ; and it seemed problematical if any amount of iron and shells could reduce it . Warren finally sent word to Pepperell that the Island Battery must be stormed so as to make way for his ships , or the place // would ncver be taken . The latter seeing with alarm how rapidly his army was diminishing by sickness , was willing to make the attempt , and called a council of war to take the subject into consideration . A spirited discussion followed , for the council was nearly equally divided . The frequent attempts already made were urged against it as hopeless , while repeated failures only discouraged the army . Pepperell , on the other hand , pointed to his sick army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French fleet , and urged the propriety and necessity of complying with the Commodore 's requcst . At length he carried his point by a small majority , and preparations were immediately set on foot to make the assault . The storming party was to embark after dark and pull quietly across to the island , and then with scaliug-ladders mount the ramparts and carry the battcry at the point of the bayonet . Captain Brooks , with four hundred men , was appointed to lead this desperate undertaking . Pepperell was unwilling to detail men for such a service , and called for volunteers . The brave fellows , eager to undertake any thing that would break up the monotony of the long siege and bring things to a crisis , volunteered almost to a man . The preparations were soon made  --  the boats drawn up in readiness , and the scaling-ladders placed in them . Bat as night approached Pepperell arew anxious ; for , independent of the hazardous , doubtful nature of the expedition under the most favorable circumstances , the wind had arisen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stormin* party when it should reach the island . He determined , however , that nothing but impossibilities should make him change his resolution ; so after dark the soldiers were marched down to the boats and embarked . Their comrades on shore saw them shove off and disappear in the gloom with no very pleasant forebodings ; for the extremely hazardous nature of the undertaking was understood by all . But the brave fellows who were departing felt no misgivings as the rowers in dead silence pulled steady and strong toward the island . Long before it loomed out of the datkness their ears were saluted by an ominous sound that grew louder and angrier every morrient . It was the roar of the surf as it fell in thunder on the shore . It boded no good to them , yet there was no halting or hesitation . But little was said , for each well knew the other 's thoughts and determination . Soon the white line of foam made by the breakers could be distinctly seen stretching along the beach . It was a sight that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these undaunted landsmen never wavered , but pressed straight on j*hat little fleet of boats carried as gallant a cre*v as ever pressed towar ( l the gates of death . But while they were approaching the line of foam , intent only on taking their boats safely through the VOL . XXVIII. - No. 1G5. -A A surf , the battery suddenly blazed up like a volcano in the darkness , and the next moment the iron storm came down smiting the boats and dashing the sea into spray around them . Knowing that balls fired in the darkness at those scattered and swiftly-advancing boats would do but little damage , the French loaded the guns with grape shot , or pieces of iron , which , scattering over the surface of the water , did fearful execution , and made it literally an iron storm . Their approach had in some way been discover* ed , and so , as soon as they came withIn range , the firing commenced . This unexpected reception , at the very moment when all their attention was occupied in getting safely through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which they now found themselves would test the nerves of the oldest troops . The thunder of the surf before them sending its spray into the air , blending with the thunder of the battery overhead sending an iron hurricane amidst their heavilyladen boats as they rose and fell on the combing breakers before they burst on the beach , combined to render their position appalling and desperate . These twofold perils presented too much terror for some of the boats , and they pulled back out of range . Yet the majority , with Brooks at their head , never flinched , hut kept on toward the shore . As they entered the rollers the boats were in imminent peril of being swamped . The surf broke over the sides , *vetting the muskets so that many of them became useless . Notwithstanding all these discouragements and the loss of part of his detachment , Captain Brooks , seeing the boats beached in safety , rapidly formed his men and gave the order to advance . The brave fellows rushed straight for the battery through a withering fire that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every effort to scale those formidable batteries was vain ; and after a heroic struggle of an hour Brooks gave the order to retreat , leaving 172 behind him killed , wounded , or taken prisoners . He reached his boats with only half his command , and hastily shoving them through the surf , pulled back under the enemys fire to camp . It was a sad report lie had to make as lie once more drew up the half of his battered detachment on shore . This serious disaster shed a gloom over the camp , and each one asked , What next was to he done ? The depression was augmented next morning when the town shook with cheers and shouts of exultation . As the echoes died away over the hills and through the woods they had an ominous sound , and seemed to the dispirited soldier like the knell of the army . During the next day Pepperell took a careful survey of his forces , and found that out of the army of 4300 with which he had landed only 210D remained fit for duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , captured , or were on the sick list ; while of the 2100 left 600 were absent in pursuit of a large body of French and // qwq ders , sent all the . oakum and moss he could collect to the ships , and scaling-ladders to the advanced batteries , and gathered brush in three huge piles on Green Hill for the signal . While all the preparations for a final assault was being made he redoubled his fire on the city . having got two more 42-pounders to bear on the Circular Battery , he made sad work with , while the fire from the Light-house , on the Island Battery , became so terrific that some of the gunners were compelled to run into the sea to escape it . In the mean time the fire from the close fascine batteries was so hot and heavy that the enemy could not stand to their gnus , and were forced to flee to places of shelter . In the midst of this tremendous cannonade Warren came on shore to see Pepperell . The troops were drawn up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence that in the coming battle they would not disgrace the flag under which they fought . Loud cheers rolled down the line , and every heart beat high for the onset . The Commodore then returned to his ship , and , t*t a given signal , his fleet of eleven men-of-war , of from forty to sixty guns each , moved majestically up and anchored in line before the town . The French Governor , Duchambon , to whom all these movements had been reported , saw that the final struggle was about to take place , and surveyed his condition and prospects with a sinking heart . He trembled when he saw the fire of the Island Battery , which was the key of the place , growing feebler every moment . His northeast battery was partly demolished . His circular battery was knocked to pieces , and the dismounted gnus lay scattered around ; the next gate was down , the wall near it gone , and the houses demolished ; while the fire from the close fascine batteries was so hot that nothing could stand before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above cover , so completely was the place enveloped in the fire of Pepperell 's batteries , while the whole town was a mass of ruins . Added to all this the garrison was worn down with the prolonged siege of forty-nine days and incessant fighting , and could not be expected to resist the imposing force now closing slowly and sternly around them . He saw that resistance was hopeless , and that in a short time the enemy would come with the strength of the inrolling tide of the sea and surge over his shattered walls , sweeping every thing before them ; and he reluctantly gave orders to send a flag of truce proposing a capitulation . Commands were immediately issued to cease firing , and a sudden silence followed the deafening uproar . The Light-house Battery , not knowing of the parley , alone kept up its fire on the Island Battery . The terms were soon agreed upon ; the place was to be given up , the garrison being allowed to march out with drums beating and colors flying , and depart unmolested for France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys of the place . The French were drawn up as on parade to receive the troops , and the conquered and the conquerors exchanged salutations . It was afterward reported that Warren claimed and took precedence , and himself received the surrender of the place , which engendered a bitter feeling in the colonists that lasted for a long time . The town presented a most lamentable nppearance , and it could not well be otherwise , for it had received in the last seven *veeks nine thousand cannon - balls , mostly of forty - two pounds weight , and six hundred b*omb-shells . It was a perfect wreck ; gaping , tottering walls , demolished buildings , and shattered gun-carriages , met the eye whichever way it turned . Only three houses in the whole town were left standing . The ruin was complete ; and it reflects great credit on the heroism of the garrison that it held out so long as it did under such discouraging state of the defenses . How much more pounding it would have stood had not a final combined assault been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wreck of the place and ruinous condition of the batteries , enough remained to make the officers stand aghast as they reflected on the inevitable result which would have followed an attempt to take the place by surprise . Had Shirley 's plan been adhered to , Louisburg would have been the grave of Pepperell and his brave army . There were 650 veteran troops , 1300 militiamen , and 2000 inhabitants-4130 in all-taken prisoners ; 76 cannon and mortars , together with monitions of war and provisions for six months , were the trophies of this glorious victory . Not a gun was fired except by the Provincial army . The plan originated in the Colonies , and was carried out by them at their own expense . The country has never achieved a triumph in which the obstacles to be overcome were so vastly disproportionate to its means as the taking of Louisburg by the New England colonies . As a decoy to French merchantmen the French flag was kept flying by which prizes valued at a million of dollars were beguiled into port and taken , one-half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captors . Pepperell immediately dispatched a messenger with the glad news to Boston , and then gave a banquet to the officers . Several chaplains were present , and a blessing of course would be expected . Old Parson Moody , uncle of Pepperell 's wife , was the senior chaplain , and they knew beforehand that the duty would devolve on him . But he was very long-winded in his exercises on all ordinary occasions , and his friends were fearful that on this extraordinary occasion he would make an almost endless prayer , which would disgust the guests . They wished to speak with him on the subject , but the parson was such a testy old fellow , and took such interference so savagely , that none dared to undertake the unwelcome task of advising him , and they finally concluded to let events take their course . But the old man , in his way , felt like the // very profane man , who , on a great provocation , when the boys gathered around to hear him swear , looked on his misfortune a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do the subject justice . " Parson Moody seemed to be in precisely this condition , for rising , he said , " Good Lord , we have so many things to thank thee for that time will be infinitely too short to do it ; we must therefore leave it for the work of eternity . Bless our food and fellowship upon this joyful occasion for the sake of Christ onr Lord . Amen . " None c6nld repress a smile at the novel reason given by the good old divine for his asking a short grace . Captain Bennet , the messenger whom Pepperch had dispatched with the news to Governor Shirley , reached Boston at one o'clock in the morning , July 3 . On his way to the Governor 's mansion he communicated his momentous message to Colonel Wendall , who commanded a company of militia , then on daty as watch . Employed to maintain the quiet of the town , he kept his excited soldiers from arousing the in habitants until four o'clock in the morning . He could wait no longer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drums to heat . The rapid and continuous roll roused up the frightened inhabitants , who rushed into the streets to inquire what was the matter . When they learned the cause of the alarm they rent the air with buzzes , and hastening to the churches set all the bells ringing . By five o'clock the whole city was abroad shonting like madmen . All business was suspended for that day . Each congratulated his neighbor , while with the shouts of the populace , ringing of bells , and salvos of artillery the day passed in the wildest excitement . The news spread to the neighboring towns , and all day long excited crowds kept streaming into Boston till the city was packed from limit to limit . At night there was a great display of fire-works , and the whole city was illuminated , while the ringing of bells and salvos of cannon swelled the enthusiasm . A huge bonfire was built in the common for the lower classes , where liquor was furnished free to all . A day of thanksgiving was set apart , and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Boston , was the excitement more intense among all classes . When the messenger arrived in New York the city was illuminated , and the same scene of excitement and enthusiasm was enacted . A grand dinner was given , and a huge bonfire kindled on the hatterv . Similar exhibitions were made in Philadelphia . Pepperell was overwhelmed with letters of congratulation from every quarter , and the most nnhonnded exultation reigned throughout the Colonies . An express was sent to London conveying the important tidings , and Captain Montague , the bearer of them , was presented by the Lords of Admiralty with $2500 . The Lords of Regency ordered the guns of the Tower and Park to be fired , and at night London and the adjacent towns were ablaze with illuminations and never did any great victory on the Continent fill England with more tumultuous rejoicings than this conquest of Louisburg by the Provincial troops . The heavens were reddened with bonfires kindled in every direction , and from highest to lowest one feeling of exultation filled every bosom . Warren was immediately promnoted , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibits the extravagant estimate put upon this conquest by the English Government more than this hestowment of a title on a provincial merchant ; for this was the first and the only distinction of the kind ever conferred on an inhabitant of the Colonies .
