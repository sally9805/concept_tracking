A Vindication of Secession and the South : being a IReview , in the Southern Presbyterian for April , 1861 , of Dr. Breckinridge 's Sermon , and of an Article written by him , in the Danville Quarterly IReview , for March , 1861 . By B. M. PALMER , ID . ID. , of New Orleans . Mn . JEFFERsON , writing from Paris , towards the close of 1787 , and just after a copy of the new Constitution had uses 6 b ge in reference to the reached him , the followino ' lano'ua insurrection of Shays : " God forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been one rebellion . That comes to one rebellion in a century and a half for each State . What country before ever existed a century and a half without a rebellion ? And what country can preserve its liberties , if its rulers are not warned , from time to time , that this people preserve the spirit of resistance ? Let them take arms . The remedy is , to set them right as to facts , pardon and pacify them . What signify a few lives lost in a century or two ? Should he not have said , " lost every twenty years ? " The tree of Liberty must be refreshed , from time to time , with the blood of patriots and tyrants . It is its natural manure . " These pious wishes for rebellion have not been fulfilled . The benign operation of that Constitution which Jefferson disliked , and which protects the States against this very evil , // has secured peace within the States , uubroken save by the whisky rebellion of 1794 , and the bloodless buzzing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as now appears , much graver danger arose from another quarter , from a conflict between the States and the government formed to protect them . A theory of the relations between the two , of which Jefferson was , in a sense , the originator , has been perfected since his time , and forming a partnership with a state of society and an institution peculiar to one section of the country , has ripened into the act of secession . There is no rebellion in this , it is contended ; there can be none ; no State can rebel against the United States . And this theory , which , in its germ , has been repudiated more than once , is now the living faith of the apparent majority in a large number of States united by common fears , passions , and interests . It is the source from which the leaders draw their arguments , whenever the controversy turns on political ethics . It has been extensively the doctrine which the young men of the South have learned at college , and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unsettling the country , should a necessity for such a step ever arrive . It has been , it would appear , the doctrine which clergymen have embraced , or to which they have been gradually coming , including even those who hold most rigidly that Adam made a covenant which his posterity could not nullify . " The Constitution , " they say , " was a league made between States as sovereign bodies , and thus has the nature of a treaty , rather than of an instrument of government . Infractions of the league place any of the individual members at entire liberty to withdraw from the confederacy . And the interpreting power , the settling of the question when sufficient reason exists for such an extreme step , pertains to each of the members which made the compact . " 1f in the exercise of the right of sovereignty , any one or more of the members choose to leave the federal league , there can be no wrong in such an act , which is a mere resumption of delegated authority , and of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the other members to the compact , is highly criminal . // The sad events which are going on in our COUNTRY  --  a word which even secessionists have to use- ( witness Dr. Thornwell 's Article in the Southern Presbyterian Review , entitled " The State of the Country ; " and the very first sentence of Dr. Palmer 's Review of Dr. Breckinridge ) - are the reductic ad ab8urdum to this theory , and have converted thousands . who had been half ensnared by it , to the old and sonnd doctrine . It is natural that much of the discussion in apology for the attitude of the unloyal States , and in condemnation of them , should turn on this point . The point has been fully discussed before , and , we may say , set at rest more than once ; but , as the divine origin of Christianity is subject to new debates in each generation , and the same arguments are presented in a new form , so is it with the nature of our government : each generation in our history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatjthe. framers of it understood it to be , at its formation . It is not novelty , but sound views , which are to be aimed at . The only novelty now , is that experiment is likely to testify , to all time , that a Constitution which mad factionists declare to be a rope of sand , is avenging its majesty , and showing that it has a solidity which will make the trial to break it , should it be successful or not , a costly one . Dr. Lieber , in the two Lectures on the Constitution , which we have placed at the head of this Article , asks whether " the Constitution is a pact , a contract , a political partnership of contracting parties , " or whether it is " a framework of government for a nnited country ,  --  a political organism of a people , with its own vitality and self-sufficing energy . " The answer is what might be expected from the sound sense , historical knowledge , and thorough comprehension of political subjects , which have given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own country , but throughout Europe . To the two lectures is appended a speech delivered in South Carolina , before a Convention of Union men , in 1851 , which treats , in a popular way , of the right and the policy of secession . From the discussion of the first of these points , we make a von . xix. 47 // short extract , regretting that we have no more space to give to Dr. Lieber 's pamphlet : " What is right for one State , must needs be right for all the others . As to Sonth Carolina , we can just barely imagine the possibility of her secession , owing to her situation near the border of the sea . But what would she have said a few years ago , or what , indeed , would she say now-I speak of South Carolina , less the secessionists-if a State of the interior , say Ohio , were to vindicate the presumed right of secession , and to declare that , being tired of a republican government , she prefers to establish a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimate , from that country where princes grow in abundance , and whence Greece , Belgium , and Portugal , have been furnished with ready-made royalties-what would we say ? We would simply say , this can not be and must not be . In forming the Union we have each given up some attributes , to receive , in turn , advantages of the last importance ; and we have , in consequence , so shaped and balanced all our systems that no member can withdraw without deranging and embarrassing all , and ultimately destroying the whole . ' pp. 42 , 43 . The Fast Day Sermon of Dr. Breckinridge has been for some time before the public , in the collection published by Messrs . IRndd &amp; Carlton . It is a strong , earnest production , passing rapidly over a great number of subjects , and therefore not doing full justice to any one of them-defending a certain kind of right of nullification , which is no nullification at all-attacking secession with heavy blows-dealing contemptuously with South Carolina , " that small community , " " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expounding the policy of the border States , especially of Kentucky . We are glad to see , that in a recent number of the Danville IReview , Dr. Breckinridge most heartily supports the present most righteous war . " The nation is fighting , " says he , " neither for vengeance nor for conquest , but for self-preservation , and , remotely , for the maintenance of its independence in the face of all other nations , and its future peace , security , and advancement in the glorious career now threatened to be cut short . " We hope that Kentucky will be guided by men of this stamp , at this crisis , and that he will live to do more good to the Union than his distinguished nephew has done hurt . Dr. Palmer thinks this Sermon of Dr. Breckinridge , and his subsequent Article in the Danville IReview , important // enough to be attacked in the iReview of the Presbyterian secessionists . The review is well written , but arrogant and superficial , after that style of treating adversaries which southern men know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We can imagine , " says he , " the smile stealing over the visage of some experienced statesman , at the temerity with which this exploded political heresy of a consolidated nationality , i. e. , of the Union being more than a league of States is revived ; and at the coolness with which the opposite theory is ignored , which , nevertheless , has generally prevailed through the history of American legislation to the present time . " For ourselves , we can hardly imagine , just at present , a smile stealing over the visages of southern statesmen , whose experiences must be somewhat unexpected and doleful . Nor could we readily have imagined , had we not known it before , the temerity with which a doctrine is ignored , which nearly all our greatest statesmen have supported from the formation of the Union downwards . Dr. Palmer here takes the attitude and borrows the flippancy of those foes of Christianity who treat it as about extinct in this nineteenth century . We shall pass nearly &amp;&amp;CCO pede over the first or apologetic part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specimens of excellent writing , justifies the attitude of South Carolina on the ground that " an imbecile and treacherous government , which could not be trusted on its own parole , " sanctioned Major Anderson 's transfer of his troops to Fort Sumter ; which justifies the seizure of the mint at New Orleans , and declares that " there has been more repose in the seven cotton States than in all the rest of the country beside . " It was a very good means to continue that repose to seduce Virginia into the war , and make her soil its theater . The second part of the review , in defending the right of secession , shows not only what is the opinion of the party whose cause Dr. Palmer advocates , but also the arguments by which he , one of their foremost divines , sustains the cause . " There is no dispute , " says line , " upon the fact that sovereignty , the ) u8 8unmmi imperii , resides in the people . But // the dispute is whether this sovereignty resides in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one undivided whole , or in the people as they were originally formed into Colonies , and afterwards into States , combining , together for purposes distinctly set forth in their instruments of Union . iDr . Breckinridge maintains the former thesis ; we defend the latter ; and in the whole controversy upon the legal right of secession , this is the cardo eau8ae. " p. 162 . In accordance with this view , he confesses his inability to understand the doctrine of a double sovereignty , ( p. 169 ) , and therefore denies that allegiance is due to any but the state government , " so that in seceding , there is no allegiance to be thrown off . " p. 165 . It will be observed that the advocates of secession lay the main stress on the question how the government originated , and on certain terms of vague abstract import , around which they fight as an Indian around a tree . When they come , however , to the Constitution itself , and the views of its framers and expounders , the part which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the instrument and history are against them . We can not enter into the question whether the Constitution was framed and set a going by a partnership of States , or by the American people , without first expressing our conviction that this is but a subordinate consideration , after all . The great question concerning the nature of any government must turn upon the powers given to that government , which are to be discovered from the instrument of government itself , and the practice under it . Before 1Th7 , Scotland was a kingdom separate from England , but under the same sovereign : the parliament of that country , until the union took place , might have decided that the son of James II should succeed his sister Anne , while the house of Hanover had a legal right to the throne of England . This , of course , would have separated the two countries entirely . But the act of union fused them so far , that they thenceforth formed one state , nuder one sovereign , with one parliament . Did anybody ever think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union , which merged its existence in the United // iKingdom , that it had any right to secede at pleasure ? The same is true of the union of Ireland with Great Britain , in 1800 . It is manifestly possible for sovereign and independent States to enter into relations more or less close , reaching from the one extreme of temporary alliance for certain special purposes , to the other , of perpetual , consolidated union . Accordingly , the political writers , while they take notice of the way in which States arise , make that no criterion of their nature . The question is , whether the result is a league , or a State ; and this depends not on the contracting parties , but on the form of the instrument by which they are united together . What , now , are the facts , touching the question who were the parties to the Constitution ? Whether these facts have any important bearing upon the right of secession , or not , they are deserving of notice , as enabling us to understand the origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 10th of May , 1775 , proceeded to exercise certain attributes of sovereignty , before any one of the colonies had separated itself by a revolutionary act from the mother country , and had become sovereign . It created a continental or national army , chose a commander-in-chief of the forces , created a currency by issuing bills of credit , authorized reprisals on the water against the ships and goods of inhabitants of Great Britain , organized a treasury and a post-office , and exercised control over the relations between the colonies and the Indians . In short , an imperfect kind of general government had arisen before the states began to exist as such , and not only was this true , but the tie which bound the colonies to Great Britain was severed by the Congress . Thus the creation of sovereignties , the passing out of the colonial into the state-life was an act not of each colony but of the united colonies in Congress assembled . Mr. Curtis , in his History of the Constitution , ( II , 39 , 40 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these local or state governments were not formed , until a union of the people of the different colonies for national purposes had already taken place , and until the national power had authorized and recommended their establishment , is of great import // ance in the Constitutional history of this country ; for it shows that no colony , acting separately for itself , dissolved its own allegiance to the British Crown , but that this allegiance was dissolved by the supreme authority of the people of all the colonies , acting through their general agent , the Congress , and not only declaring that the authority of Great Britain ought to be suppressed , but recommending that each colony should supplant that authority by a local government to be framed by and for the people of the colony itself . " 2 . The States , however , thus brought into being , regarded themselves as sovereign and independent , and in the course of time formed the Confederation , which both by the terms of the instrument giving its being , and by its attributes , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a State formed out of a league . Thus the articles are called articles of confederation and perpetual union . Each state retains its sovereignty , freedom , and independence , and every power not expressly delegated to the United States . ( Art . IT . ) The States enter into a league with one another , they send delegates , and have one vote each . The object of the confederation is chiefly to carry the States by united action through the war , although in addition to this a certain power is given to the Congress to determine in the last resort disputes between two or more States concerning boundary , jurisdiction , and the like . But the Confederacy had no legislative authority , no power of levying money , no executive or judicial offlcers ,  --  in short , had none , or next to none , of the functions of a State . 3 . ITuder this clumsy contrivance the States went through the war successfully , but began to fall to pieces when forced by no foreign enemy into union . The evils of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembling of the Convention which formed the present Constitution . When that body assembled , there were those among its members who feared a general government as likely to destroy the existence of the States , and there were others who would have annihilated the States by conferring on the national government extended and complete legislative powers . In the plan reported from the Committee of the whole to the Convention , June 13th , 1T87 , // one feature was to negative all laws passed by the several States " contravening in the opinion of the national legislature the articles of the Union . " Hamilton , the extreme unionist , would probably have gone much farther than this , even to the point of taking away from the States all legislative power . A middle course prevailed , that of establishing a national government , as it is repeatedly called in the report , and of continuing the States in the possession of certain powers not taken froni them by the general constitution . This Constitution begins with the words , " We , the people of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. , do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America . " What is meant by " we , the people of the United States , " which was substituted for " we , the people of New Hampshire , Massachusetts , " etc. , as the first draft of the Constitution had phrased it ? Pr . Palmer has an explanation which amounts to this : that " we , the people , " being declared to be the people of the United States , this title " embodies the history of the formation of the Union , as a Congressus of States , which , by aggregation , make one people . In proof of this , it is a title simply transferred from the old confederation , when no one denies that the States were separate and independent . " * In other words , if the instrument had begun with " we , the people , " only , or if some national term had been added , as America or Liberia , there might have been sonic show of " consolidation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " knock consolidation in the head and justify secession . Here is logic and statesmanship for you . A league of States can iiever become one State because they are called United States at the time of making the league , and it is convenient to retain the old name by which they had been known before . Does not IDr . Palmer know that the " people of the United States " means the people inhabiting the country so called ? Is lie not perfectly aware that there is a marked and intended * He does not mean the title of people of the United States , but that of United States . The people are not spoken of as having any share in forming the confederntion. // departure in the present Constitution from the terms of the old confederation , which styles itself a confederation between certain specified States , forming a firm league of friendship with each other , while the people of the United States are in no sense direct parties to the contract ? Is he not aware that this was so understood by the enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the great question of its adoption was before the country ? What said Patrick Henry , then averse to the proposed framework of government in the Virginia Convention ? " I have the highest veneration for those gentlemen , the framers of the Constitution ; but , Sir , give me leave to demand what right had they to say we , the People ? - Who authorized them to speak the language , we , the People , instead of we , the State8 ? States are the characteristics and the soul of a confederation . If the States be not the agents of this compact , it must be one great consolidated national government of the people of the States . " And what said Edmund Randolph in reply ? " The gentleman inquires why we assumed the language of we , the people ? I ask , why not ? The government is for the people ; and the misfortune was that the people had no agency in the government before . " And in a debate on the next day , Henry returned to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the States ? Have they made a proposal of a compact between the States ? If they had , this would be a confederation ; it is otherwise most clearly a consolidated government . The question turns , Sir , on that poor little thing ,  --  the expression , we , the people , instead of the States , of America . " * We may add , that when the question arose who should ratify the Constitution , the legislatures or the people , it was felt and distinctly expressed , as by Mr. Madison , cited by Mr. Curtis , ( II , 184 ) , that a system founded on the consent of the legislatures would be a treaty , while one sanctioned by the people would be a constitution . IDr . Palmer confesses his inability to understand the doctrine of a double sovereignty ; a sovereignty , as he forcibly puts it , // " which , while it is delegated to the general government is nevertheless supreme ; and a sovereignty , which , while it is retained by the States as a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There seems to be a great deal of haze created in some minds by this word sovereignty , whose vagueness and variety of meaning Dr. Lieber well sets forth in his first lecture . Two coordinate and equal sovereignties certainly can not exist , but no reason can be assigned why a particular State may not be sovereign in certain relations , and the general republic called the United States in another . Sovereignty , in the international sense , that is , the power of entering into political relations with foreign states , never pertained to any one of the colonies or to any one of the States . It wa* the independence of all the States together which England acknowledged in 1783 , and if any State should make a treaty with an external power at present , such an act would not only violate the Constitution , but be ground of complaint or even of war on the part of the Union . States , on compulsion or without it , may surrender a part of their sovereignty ; this is the case with l3elgiuni and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the peace of Europe , they have been put into the category of perpetual neutrals ; or , in other words , by which their power of making war ,  --  one of the highest attributes of sovereignty ,  --  has been abandoned forever , and yet , for all other purposes , they are sovereign States . In the same way the individual States of this Union are sovereign only in a qualified sense , within a certain territory ; and , indeed , the United States are a sovereign State only in a qualified , although a higher sense . * Neither can do everything which pertains to a supreme power . Will it be said that the sovereignty of the United States is delegated ? If in this word is implied a reserved power of withdrawing that portion of sovereignty which pertains to the United States , this is a mere begging of the question . We say this sovereignty came just as much from * Dr. Lieber remarks that the Swiss publicists speak of the sovereignty of Switzerland , and of the cantonal sovereignty of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegiance is unknown to them . Since 1848 , the Swiss government is like that of the United States ; before , it was a simple confederacy. // the people as that of the States came from them . No new consideration then is advanced here ; we only run back to the inquiry , who were the parties to the Constitution ? If Dr. Palmer and other secessionists are unable to understand the doctrine of a double sovereignty , it is because they affix a sense to the word which suits their purposes . But political science and constitutional history will not be put into the straitjacket of rigid abstract definitions . Much the same remarks are to be made on the assertion that allegiance is only due to the state government , so that in seceding there is no allegiance to the thrown off . Allegiance denotes the fact of being bound to another , or more specifically the fealty or obedience due by the liege-man ( homo ligatus ) to his liege-lord . In the feudal age a vassal might owe qualified allegiance to two suzerains for lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bound to obey the State so far as its attributes are expressed in constitutional law , and the United States , so far as the Constitution of the Union requires . Why is it that that Constitution , and the Constitutions of nearly all the States , require every officer of the state goveruments to be bound by oath or affirmation to support it , if no obligation to obedience and therefore to allegiance goes with this oath ? When it is said that the judges in every State are " bound thereby ; anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstandino " is there nothing here like allegiance to the United States ,  --  nay , is not an allegiance contemplated which in cases of collision renders it wrong for the state officers to obey state law ? When such a crime as treason is named and defined by the Constitution of the United States , is there not an absurdity in denying that allegiance is due towards the party against whom the treason can be committed ? I can be an enemy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not a traitor unless it is my sovereign , and I owe it fealty or allegiance . Will it be said that the people are not bound by this oath , but only the officers and magistrates ? But the oath is added to give greater solemnity to obligations which existed before . The private citizen is bound to obey state law , whether he has taken the oath to do so or // not , and so his obligations to the United States are to be deduced from his being a citizen of the United States . Or will it be said that allegiance is due to the United States only because , and while the true sovereign , the State , permits it ? Here , again , we come back to the old ground that the Constitntion is a league , and the argument has no independent validity . The state rights theory breaks down when we look at the condition of the new States which have grown up on the territory acquired by purchase , as from France or the Indians . Here are individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States alone , who are under its exclusive sovereignty , and are permitted by its authority to form a platform of government on the approbation , perhaps the conditional approbation , of which , they first become a body politic . They can not resume sovereignty , if they break away from the union , for they never had it until it was granted to them by the United States . They are the creation of law under the Constitution . They made no stipulation on their entrance that they should be allowed in certain contingencies to retire from the partnership . The United States , it is certain , would never at any time since the government was founded have consented to such a conditional accession . The only alternatives then are , return to the territorial character , or independence and separation , won by revolution . And it is equally fatal to this theory that the United States , by the Constitution , guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of government . 11 for instance , South Carolina should want an English prince for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be the obligation of the general government to crush the young monarchy at once , whether the people for the time wanted institutions other than republican or not . But by the doctrine of secession the State has only to retire and then set up a king , or if it will , set up a king and then retire , and nobody has a right to touch it . The guarantee then is perfectly unmeaning , unless it shall insist on remaining in the Union and being the victim of the guarantee . We claim to prohibit other nations from extending their institu // tions on our continent by the Monroe doctrine to which secessiou has given extensive support , but the Constitution , as interpreted by the secession theory , prevents ns from putting down any military or other despotism among the States of our own Union , where it would be tenfold more dangerous . But why go round in the treadmill of the arguments which relate to the parties to the Constitution , and not rather inqnire into the nature of that instrument itself ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in a mere partnership , may have a vast variety of relations to each other , the nature of which must , of course , be determined by the language of the contract . Some contracts of partnership may contain the liberty of retiring at pleasure ; others of retiring only by nnanimous consent . Some may allow each partner to judge whether his rights have been transgressed and to take his remedy ; others may take from each all such power and give it to a tribunal without or to arbitrators within the body . Some may concede , others may deny to the separate partners the right of admitting their sons , or to the whole body that of admitting new members . Partnerships may be as loose and temporary or as strict and enduring as possible . 11 then , you can not deduce the nature of a partnership from the notion , how much less can you dednce from the original sovereignty of coequal States what their rights are under a given constitution . The secessionists seem to practice a jugglery on themselves by the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallacy , " says iDr . Palmer , pervading Dr. Breckinridge 's entire arguments , " is the misconception that it is a consolidated popular government , instead of being a Congress of republics . " As if the government of the Union must be simply one or the other , and there could be no form lying between the two extremes which could be called in one aspect consolidated and in another a federal compact . Suppose them not consolidated , this does not involve the right of secession . Suppose them not mere federal compacts , this does not imply that the States have no substantive existence . It is surely rather a paltry exhibition of the statemanship which has governed a part of this country that these extremes should be regarded as // rigid molds into one or the other of which our institutions must be cast . What is this but a worship of empty forms , a setting up of abstractions and reducing of concrete existences to the laws of their lean nakedness . We must make it then our main inquiry , as with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the instrument of government denotes , what powers are imparted , and what withheld . Can the Union be called a State , is it a political unit , do we form a country , a nation , in any but a loose , popular sense ? The answer to this question must be found in an exposition of the instrument of government , and has been given by its great expounders almost uniformly in one direction . We must , of course , content ourselves with a very few considerations which show that the natjonal constitution has characteristics , which can appertain only to a State or political unit . 1 . It has all the organization of a State or sovereign unity , to wit , separate independent legislative and judicial powers , with an executive head chosen by the whole nation . The machinery of a State proves the existence of a State designed for separate action . We may add that this organization is armed with all necessary might . 2 . There are citizens of the United States , and the national legislature has exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may even be citizens of the United States who are not and never have been citizens of any State . Such are foreigners who have been naturalized while residing in a territory , such too , may be residents in the district of Columbia , and perhaps others . Citizen and State ( civis and civitas , organized community ) are correlative . The citizens of all the States are citizens of this broad , all-embracing State , but its privilege of citizenship runs beyond the state limits and is imparted to many others . 3 The United States have territory , lying outside of the territorial States , over which the national government exercises supreme and undivided political sway . // exercising not oniy authority but supreme authority , and that everywhere through the states , and over the territories . More than that it binds all state officers by oath to the observance of this supreme law . 5 . The Supreme Court of the United States , as a court of appeal , is supreme over all state courts , in certain specified cases , which include all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each particular State to its citizens , and of these citizens to one another . It thus brings States before its bar , and has a power of interpreting what the laws and constitution of the Union prescribe , which belongs to no other body . Both these high powers seem to imply a sovereignty which can be affirmed of no State within the Union , and a political organism watching over all the States . 6 . All foreign relations , the supreme functions of peace and war , the power to lay and collect taxes , the power in certain cases over the militia of each State as well as over the national army , belong to this government , and are generally regarded as high attributes of a State . 7 . The United States government comes into immediate contact not only with States , but also in manifold ways with individuals . This is the characteristic difference between a close and a loose union , and has often been noticed as forming a wide contrast between the action of our present system and that of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or political functions which we forbear to notice , the claim that the Constitution was a league made by the States , and the fact that no name in the singular number was devised for the union , and you have a contract which shows the amazing weakness of the secession theory . Nor is this theory weaker in the support which it can scrape together from opinion contemporaneous with or subsequent to the formation of the present constitution . It may be safely asserted that until South Carolina passed her nullifying ordinance in 1832 , no respectable authority for secession can be adduced , if this can be called respectable . // Dr. Palmer brings forward what is , perhaps , the strongest authority on that side in the following passage : " The longest argument must have an end . We advert , finally , to the notorious fact , that in the very act of ratifying this Constitution , three States asserted their sovereign right to resume the powers they had delegated . New York declared that the powers of government may he reassumed by the people whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further indicates what people she means , by speaking , in the same connection , of the residuary power and jurisdiction in the people of the State , not granted to the General Government . The delegates from Virginia declare and make known , in the name and in the behalf of the people of Virginia , that the powers granted under the Constitution , being derived from the people of the United States , may be resumed by them , whensoever the same shall be perverted to their injury and oppression . ' In like manner , Rhode Island protests against the remission of her right of resumption . And while the language is not so explicit as that of New York , the meaning is precisely the same ; for , as the original grantor of these powers was the people of the States , and not the collective people of the country at large , the former alone had the right to reassume . The other States made no such declarations . Indeed , as the right lay in the very nature and history of the federation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of superabundant caution . " With regard to Virginia , it is enough to say that the obvious meaning of the passage cited is that the people of the United States can do away with the general government , peaceably or by revolutionary force , whenever it becomes the instrument of oppression . It can not be supposed that the right of secession from the Union was reserved to Virginia in this clause , else why is it said that the powers derived from the people of the United States may be resumed by the same people . They are conceived of as acting not in separate portions but unitedly . As for the rest , the final action of the Virginia convention in ratifying the Constitution without previous conditions shows that the members accepted of it as a whole and forever , although many of them were desirous of amendments , some of which were afterwards adopted . We can not find the INew York resolution cited by Dr. Palmer in the first edition of Elliot 's Debates , which is the only one at hand ; but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Virginia , this vague and foolish resolution must have intended to assert the same right of the American people to break up the general government which Virginia had asserted // more than a fortnight before . But there are other particulars in the history of this Convention which show the state of opinion much more clearly . It is well known that there was a strong party in that body opposed to the Constitution , to which , together with Governor Clinton , the presiding officer , Yates and Lansing belonged , who had quitted Philadelphia in disgust , leaving only Hamilton to represent New York in the Constitutional Convention . So strong was the opposition from the anti-federalists , and so uncertain the majority , that Hamilton , in a kind of despair , debated with himself upon a compromise , by which the State of New York might reserve to itself the right to recede from the Union , if the amendments which the other party desired should not have been incorporated into the Constitution " within a certain number of years , perhaps five or seven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then sitting in the Congress of the Confederation at New York , and who replied as follows : " I am sorry that your situation obliges you to listen to propositions of the nature you describe . My opinion is , that a reservation of a right to withdraw , if amendments be not decided on , under the form of the Constitution within a certain time , is a conditional ratification ; that it does not make New York a member of the new union , and consequently that she could not be received on that plan . Compacts must be reciprocal-this principle would not in such case be preserved . The Constitution requires an adoption in toto and forever . It has been so adopted by the other States , including his own , Virginia . An adoption for a limited time would be as defective as an adoption of some of the articles only. *** This project was brought before the Convention on the 24th of July , by Mr. Lansing , whose motion was , " that there should be reserved to the State of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain number of years , unless the amendments proposed should be submitted to a general Convention . " This motion was negatived . Already a form of ratification had been proposed , containing the words " on eonclition // neverthele88 that , " which had been altered into " in full confidence that , " and so the ratification was carried through , not in the best shape indeed , but unconditionally . Do not these facts show that a right of secession was not one of those rights with which the American people entered into the Union . The IKentncky and Virginia resolutions are not referred to by Dr. Palmer , but they have some bearing on his case . They relate to the alien and sedition laws , those exceedingly odions measures of the dominant or federal party . The Virginia resolutions , of December , 1798 , protest against these laws as unconstitutional , and express the hope that the other States will coöperate with Virginia " in maintaining unimpaired the authorities , rights , and liberties reserved to the States respectively , or to the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madison to consist in " measures known to the Constitution , particularly the ordinary control of the people and legislatures of the States over the government of the United States ,  --  which control , as the event showed , was equal to the occasion . The tenor of the debates discloses no reference whatever to a constitutional right in an individual State to arrest by force the operation of a law of the United States. *** And yet the doctrine maintained by the advocates of these resolutions in regard to the concurrent interpreting power of the States , and of the Supreme Court , must , if we understand it , have brought the States into collision with the authorities of the Union . The resolutions of Kentucky on the same subject , passed in November , 1798 , and reaffirmed the next year , had for their basis a draft of resolutions prepared by Jefferson , which were thorough and violent enough to satisfy the most hotheaded partisan . Jefferson 's draft says that " every State has a natural right , in cases not within the compact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within their limits , " and that the legislature doubts not that " each State will take measures of its own for providing that neither these acts nor * Letter to Everett of August , 1830 , in Niles 's Register , vol. 43 , Supplement . von . XIX. 48 // any others of the General Government , not plainly nor intentionally authorized by the Constitution , shall be exercised within their respective territories . The actual Kentucky resolutions follow Mr. Jefferson 's draft , only taking out its eyeteeth ; and both would introduce into our public law the view of the Union as a mere compact , as well as the power of a State to interpret the Constitution for itself against the decision of the Supreme Court , while remaining in the Union . But it is remarkable that in neither of these intemperate productions , dictated by the highest party zeal , is the right of a State to secede from the Union at all contemplated , although the principles avowed , if they had been sustained by the nation and reduced to practice , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breaking up of the whole system . But New England and the Federalists must be pressed into the service of secession . " The passage of the embargo act , " says Dr. Palmer , " inflamed the New England States to the highest degree ; so that on the floor of Congress it was declared , they were repining qu. pining ? for a secession from the Union . " As if what was said in the heat of debate , by a member of Congress , were of course true , or the act could be justified , because they were pining to do it . We presume that men , before now , have been " pining " or itching at least , to give other men a flogging , but were deterred by the consideration that it was not right . Of the Hartford Convention , Dr. Palmer thus speaks : " In the Hartford Convention , at which five of the Eastern States were represented , the report which was adopted uses the following language : Whenever it shall appear that the causes are radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferable to an alliance by constraint among nominal friends , but real enemies , influenced by mutual hatred and jealousy , ' etc . Again : In cases of deliberate , dangerous and palpable infractions of the Constitution , affecting the sovereignty of a State and the liberties of the people , it is not only the right , but the duty , of such a State to interpose its authority for their protection , in the manner best calculated to secure that end . When emergencies occur which are beyond the reach of the judicial tribunals , or too pressing to admit of the delay incident to their forms , States , which have no common umpire , must be their own judges , and exeaute their own decisions . ' It is a little curious that these avowals of the right of secession should come from the very section which is most chargeable with begetting the present schism : and that the // very people now most ready to arm themselves for the coercion of the South could plead for an equitable and peaceful separation , so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hartford Convention springs not from their exposition of political doctrine , but from the insufficiency of the cause impelling them to a breach of compact , and from the want of patriotism which could meditate such a step when the country was in the midst of war with a foreign enemy . " He must be a perverse reasoner who can argue from the first of the passages quoted that any right was claimed for one or more of the States to separate from the rest by a one-sided act . What is said is that separation of the States is better than union , whenever the causes of our calamities arising out of such union are deep and permanent. * And no forcible separation in such an extremity , but one by equitable arrangement between the parts of the country , is thought of . So , too , the other citation contains nothing more than that a State may protect its citizens from unconstitutional acts of the General Government , or , as it is expressed in another passage of the same report , from acts " subjecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or impressments , not authorized by the Constitution of the United States . " What is there here implying that a State may go out of the Union when it pThases , or may even set up its interpretation of the Constitution above that of the Supreme Court ? Moreover , what was the Hartford Convention , and what did it recommend ? It was the creature of three States , constituted  --  to quote the language of the act passed in Connecticut- " for the purpose of devising and recommending such measures for the safety and welfare of these States as may consist with our obligations as members of the national Union . " So too the legislature of Rhode Island appointed delegates " to confer with delegates from other States , upon the best means of c&amp;Sperating for our mutual defense against the7enemy , " - Great Britain ,  --  " and upon the measures which it may be in the power of said States , consistently with their obligations , to adopt , to restore and secure to the people thereof their rights and privileges under the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // strain , Massachusetts , where the plan of the Convention originated , and which is supposed to be the most thorough going and radical of the New England States , contemplates nothing worse than a revision of the Constitution of the Union . The letter written to the executive officers of the other States speaks of devising means of security and defense , " not repugnant to their obligations as members of the Union ! " iLest jealousy of the objects of such a Convention should be awakened , the legislature is content , continues the letter , to repose " upon the known attachment of its constituents to the national Union , and to the rights and independence of the country . " With these professions both the report and secret journal of the Convention agree . In the report , besides certain proposed amendments to the Constitution of the United States , it is recommended to the legislatures of the States represented in the Convention , to protect their citizens from forcible drafts , conacriptions and impressments , not authorized by the Constitution of the Union , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of securing their undefended coasts against the British , and to make an immediate application to the General Governmentfor permission to assume the defense of their own territory , and to appropriate a portion of the taxes for this purpose . Such was the open action of the Convention : its secret journal contains no proposition which looks in the direction of disloyalty . And lest there should be thought to be a deeper secret , unrecorded on the pages of the secret journal , we have the evidence on oath , in a*suit at law in 1831 , of Roger IMI . Sherman , one of the members from Connecticut . " There was not , " says he , " a single motion , resolution , or subject of debate , but what appears in the printed journal or report . I believe I knew their proceedings perfectly , and that every measure , done or proposed* has been published to the world . " We have been thus particular in correcting the mistakes of Dr. Palmer in this matter , because we have no disposition to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the side of the harlot of secession . A wife left without means of support by a selfish husband , has uttered before now some illadvised words looking to the possibility of separation ; but a wife who shapes her theory of marriage with divorce in view , // who watches for long years until a convenient occasion for divorce arises , and who then breaks away without a bill or decree of Conrt , and marries another -- snch a wife " treacherously departeth " from her husband-she has the heart of a strumpet . We add in regard to this Convention , that the strong condemnation of it through the country proceeded not more from a feeling that New England was disloyal to the country in the midst of war , than from a real , although most baseless , suspicion , that this secret body had projected a withdrawal of the States represented in it from the Union . The Hartford Convention gave in fact the coup de grace to Federalism , and for the reason just assigned . Nothing could more clearly show the feeling entertained at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States to secede from the Union . That feeling was still more marked , when , in 1832 , South Carolina passed her ordinance of nullification , pronouncing certain tariff laws of the United States unconstitutional , null , and void ; prohibiting the enforcement of them by any public officer within the bounds of the State ; ordaining that no appeal should be taken in regard to the constitutionality of the ordinance from the Courts of the State to the Supreme Court of the Union ; requiring all State officers and even jurors impanneled in any cause in which the ordinance should be drawn in question to take the oath to observe it , and declaring any act of obstruction to the commerce of the State or of coercion , on the part of the National Congress or Executive , a ground for withdrawal from the Union . The ordinance was passed by a vote of one hundred and thirty-six to twentysix . The shadow of this baleful thing had been cast upon the country some years before , but the great argument in the case of Webster versus Hayne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now reserved for the most popular man in the country , above all at the South , by his vigorous measures , and his inculcation of sound political doctrine , to nullify nullification , so that it was rejected almost everywhere except in its birthplace . Let us be allowed to extract a passage or two from his proclamation relating to this ordinance . " I consider the power to annul a law of the United States , assumed by one State , incompatible // with the existence of the Union , contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution , unauthorized by its spirit , inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded . " " Is it possible that-even if there is no express provision giving supremacy to the Constitution and laws of the United States over the States-it can be conceived that an instrument , made for the purpose of forming a more perfect union ' than that of the Confederation , should be so constructed by the assembled wisdom of our country , as to substitute for that confederation a form of government dependent for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a State , or of a prevailing faction in a State ? " And again speaking of the right of secession , he says , " the right to secede is deduced from the nature of the Constitution , which , they say , is a compact between sovereign States who have preserved their whole sovereignty , and therefore are subject to no superior ; that because they made the compact they can break it , when , in their opinion , it has been departed from by the other States . " " But the terms used in the construction of the Constitution shows it to be a government in which the people of all the States collectively are represented . " " The Constitution of the United States , then forms a government , not a league , and whether it be formed by compact between the States , or in any other manner , its character is the same . Each State having expressly parted with so many powers , as to constitute , jointly with the other States , a single nation , can not from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not break a league , but destroys the unity of a nation . The States severally have not retained their entire sovereignty . How can that State be said to be sovereign and independent , whose citizens owe obedience to laws not made by it ? What shows conclusively that the States can not be said to have reserved an undivided sovereignty , is that they expressly ceded the right to punish treason . Treason is an offense against sovereignty , and sovereignty must reside with the power to punish it . " We have extracted these passages from a multitude of others equally apposite , to show that we ourselves have said nothing new . The doctrine from the first has been the same ; the foes , // only , of the Constitution , have uttered novelties . Secession is not a generation old since Jackson nearly strangled it at its birth . And yet Dr. Palmer has the ignorance or the impertinence to talk of Dr. Breckinridge 's reviving an exploded political heresy when he maintains nothing more than Jackson maintained , nothing more than has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , semper , ubique , except in that volcanic district , which , alas ! with the loss of political power of late , has spread its fires over the Union and bids fair to destroy the fair fabric of our fathers . We have confined ourselves to the theory of secession . Its practical absurdities , its baleful effects , we can not stop to consider ; nor is it necessary , for the country is alive to them ; every day is showing them . Why is it now , some one may ask , that the cowardly name of secession is used to cover up treasonable enterprises , instead of the strait-forward and honest one of revolution ? The answer is , that the theory is honestly embraced by many , and that , while the conduct and justifying motives of the leaders in the crime are revolutionary , many would have hung back from the same measures , when presented to them as the last resort of an aggrieved people , which they now defend as carrying out State rights . That the conduct in its essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights are newly invaded , but only a new party , destitute of the means of aggression , is come into power . But by whatever name called , and by whatever theory defended , the great question presented by the act of secession to the country is palpable . It is no other than whether anarchy shall reign over the land for years or even generations , or whether a lesson never to be forgotten shall be taught to this Union of States that it is an evil thing and a bitter to depart in passion or in pride from obedience to the Constitution . That Constitution , as we believe , is now interpreting and strengthening itself ; it is becoming sacred by martyrdoms and the baptism of the sword . May a good God uphold it by victories in the field , since we are brought to that sad necessity . May he rebuke and bring to an end " the noise of the seas , the noise of their waves , and the tumult of the people . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
