Is't true that Talbot 's with the curst besiegers ? LA HIRE . LA HIRE . That it is true sharpens my daily pang For the besieged , the steadfast Orleanese . ARMAGNAC . ARMAGNAC . La Hire , to you I speak as friend to friend : This King doth sorely try a proud allegiance : That mine will bear the strain I can not say . Allegiance voucheth vigor to command . Who would swear fealty to impotence ? Can vassal bend the knee to lifeless lord ? France bristles with perverse hostilities , Rebellions , feuds , invasions , sieges fierce ; The whole land quakes with war 's mad violations ; The whole , save him round whom , for whom , ' gainst whom This bloody evolution boils and flares ; And he lolls stagnant on a lazy couch . Did we not see it , who 'd believe ' t is so ? Had one reported that but yesterday , On riding through the forest in a storm , He 'd seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden tempest 's rage , All bending , shrieking , flying ' fore the wind , All save one oak , the tallest of the throng , And he stood motionless ' mid the loud whirl , No sign of writhing vigor in his limbs ,  --  I should have wondered first , and then exclaimed , That oak is dead , and doth usurp the room Which should resound with living roots and trunk . LA HIRE . LA HIRE . Par Dieu , my noble earl of Armagnac , You utter not your feeling only , nor Just yours and mine . All of our nobles here Suffer as you do ; nay , nor gentleman Nor man upon this sorely smitten soil , Who feels a Frenchman throb within his breast , But shames him for the royal apathy , This heart-paralysis of France 's power . Here comes Vendome , fresh from his Majesty . Enter Vendome . Well , Duke , what are our cheeks to blush for next ? VENDOME . VENDOME . Mine blush no more : they pale with anger now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no Talbots , Salisburys , Bedfords , Henrys ; There is no starving Orleans close besieged . The King  --  and who should know if he does not  --  Talks cheerful by the hour and names them not . Good God ! that our dear France should be so  --  Where is this martial damsel from Lorraine , The people whisper of so hopefully ? Naught but a woman can arouse this sluggard . Out of his weakness we may build a strength . LA HIRE . LA HIRE . This rumor from Lorraine is in fulfillment Of ancient prophecies ; and prophecies Themselves oft speed their own accomplishment . VENDOME . VENDOME . With such a helmsman , naught but miracle Can save us from being quickly overborne By hateful flood of English conquerors . Exeunt severally . SCENE II . On the edge of the forest of Domremy , near a fountain . THE MAID THE MAID ( reclining at first on a sofa ) . Divine ye must be , or ye would not speak Through loved seraphic figures clothed in light : Beings so beautiful come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye , yet , each hearing Thrills me with deeper awe . My life is changed . By your celestial tune I have been won Afar from this to live in the great thoughts You have awakened , and from year to year So nursed , they 've filled me with a mighty future . Joan , O Joan ! can it be ?  --  Ha ! there they are ! VOICE VOICE ( from above ) . Joan , chosen wast thou for thy aptness . Blest Above all maidens is thy peerless portion  --  To be the savior of thy country , wreckt But for thy pilotage . The time is come . Go to Sir Baudricourt at Vaucouleurs . He to the King will send thee , and the King Cohorts will marshal under thee , the siege To raise of Orleans . Thence thou'lt bring the King To Rheims , there to be crowned : and France is saved . The Maid falls prostrate on the ground . Enter the Maid 's Mother , not perceiving Joan . MOTHER . MOTHER . Poor Joan ! they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be . Mismatches we have too many , even where the will goes with them . Against the will , they 're of the Devil . But Joan will not yield ; and then her father storms , and we all bend before his rage , excepting Joan . In common things you 'd think she had no will , docile as is my wheel unto my hand . A strange dear child it is : where can she be ? Enter Joan 's Father , with her lover and the Curate . FATHER . FATHER . Where is Joan ? MOTHER . MOTHER . Ha ! there she is on the ground . Joan ! Joan ! The Maid raises herself on her knees . My dear child ! I feared thou had'st been struck by lightning . MAID . MAID . Mother , the sky is clear of clouds . A light , Brighter than lightning , streamed but now before me . FATHER FATHER ( coming forward ) . Again these foolish visions . Joan , thou wast always dutiful : now thou troublest thy father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogged ? Obey thy parents : we know best what is for thy good : we wish thee well married ; and here is Oliver , worthy of thee , and has some claim on thee . MAID MAID ( behind the smoke , with piercing cry ) . Dares he to say he has a claim on me ? OLIVER OLIVER ( coming forward ) . Is not my love a claim , a love as strong As ever warmed the breast of man for woman ? MAID . MAID . I told thee ' t was in vain : it could not be . FATHER . FATHER . I say , it shall be . What are we come to ? Shall green , unfurnished girls cry yea or nay against their parents ' plans ? Make thee ready to be wedded to Oliver . MAID . MAID . Father , it can not be : it must not be . FATHER . FATHER . Darest thou disobey thy father 's will ? MAID . MAID . I have two fathers : which shall I obey ? My earthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  CURATE . CURATE . Joan , that will not stead thee : Thy Heavenly Father speaks to thee through me . MAID . MAID . When thou'rt not by , can He not come to me ? Is his will reined by thee , or thine by Him ? CURATE . CURATE . How dost thou know if He does speak to thee ? MAID . MAID . By twice the craft I know when thou dost speak ; By outward , and by inward finer sense . The world , is't not by unseen power governed ? Power is nowhere but in the invisible . All else is only plastic instrument . FATHER . FATHER . Joan , thou hast lost thy wits . What know'st thou of these high things ? A senseless tingling in thy ears thou tak'st for angel voices . CURATE . CURATE . Leave her to me . I 'll find a happy hour To exorcise the Devil who now sits Master of spell bound fancy in her brain . FATHER . FATHER . Come , Oliver . She 'll recover under the Curate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . Exeunt Father , Curate , and Oliver . MOTHER . MOTHER . O Joan , my child , my dearest child , wherefore Art thou so rooted in thy willfulness ? MAID . MAID . Mother , I can not otherwise . The things I have been used to , grow unwonted to me . My life is other than it was : ' t is now In new , great thoughts , deeds greater , that so fill , So swell my being , myself I know no more . A higher self I am , the servitor Of angels . MOTHER . MOTHER . O my child , how canst thou know ? The Curate says , they are temptations , speech Feigned by the Devil , these thy saintly voices . MAID . MAID . Mother , how can he know ? He has not heard them . Heard them have I ; the heads , woven of light , Have seen , whence issue their profound commands . Limits , God-planted , are there to disguise . Uplifting thoughts the Devil never prompts , Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us love ourselves , our lustful wants ; He tells where hidden treasure may be dug , Or flatters us with sensual heritage . Our souls , dear mother , are not of the Devil : Mine meets these voices with an answering glow , Lifts it to them with liveliest , warmest trust . Within the best and deepest of my soul I feel , they come from God , are tuned to good . MOTHER . MOTHER . Thy looks , thy words , proclaim thee child no more : Thou'rt shot up to ripe woman in a day . Enter the Maid 's Uncle . UNCLE . UNCLE . What is't I hear ? They 'd wed thee ' gainst thy will ? MAID . MAID . Dear uncle , that they must not , can not do . But I 'm rejoiced you 're come . To Vaucouleurs I must at once . UNCLE . UNCLE . Again thou'st heard them speak ? MAID . MAID . Within an hour ; and hence I go to-day . And thou 'll go with me ? UNCLE . UNCLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to me through thee . In them I trust , because I 've faith in thee . MOTHER . MOTHER . Brother , The Curate says they 're from the Devil . UNCLE . UNCLE . Sister , Curates are not infallible . The promptings Of a sound heart , pure , innocent like hers , With heavenly will are more in unison , Than the dry hackneyed say of thousand curates . Most priestly words are too mechanical , Too emptied of the freer life , that they Should carry messages from the upper realms . Come , Joan ; ' t is two leagues hence to Little Bury , And I would be at home ere set of sun . MAID . MAID . Mother , O mother ! I must leave thee ; yea , I must ; must quit my home , my dear , dear home . These trees , this fountain , and my church ,  --  the church Which is another daily home to me ,  --  My flocks and meadows , and my happy comrades ,  --  All , all I leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trampled on by marching legions : Plainly as ere I heard thy tender voice , I hear the blows and cries of battling hosts : Now shouts of victory ; now silent joy ; Now shadows come : they pass away : again The clash of arms : now , what a jubilee . More shadows  --  more , and deeper  --  black , how black ! They fold me in ! There , there , they break again . O what a splendor ! what a glory ! Where , Where am I ?  --  Mother ! come , mother ! Exeunt ; the Maid , with an arm round her Mother 's neck . SCENE III . Vaucouleurs . Head-quarters of the Military Commander , Sir Baudricourt . Sir Baudricourt , two officers , and Sir Bertrand de Pousengis , a friend of Sir B. SIR BERTRAND . SIR BERTRAND . Captain , I fear to ask of news from Orleans . SIR BAUDRICOURT . SIR BAUDRICOURT . Deep hearts have they , those manful Orleanese , That from them they can still dip drops of hope . Beleaguered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They yield them not , but supplicate for aid , Which never comes . SIR BERTRAND . SIR BERTRAND . Whence can it come ? The King Has neither men nor means ; his chiefs rebellious , Allies faithless ; and as his enemies Grow hot , his friend of Burgundy grows cool . SIR BAUDRICOURT . SIR BAUDRICOURT . Shrewd Burgundy goes ever with the strongest ; And that might we be had our King a will . A thoughtful , earnest will creates its means ; Kindles the cold , quickens the slow , spurs all . Armed men start from the earth at hearted cry ; Obedience follows will with votive smiles , And allies troop to its side with eager trust . But indolence , though regal , hath no will ; And from its rotting couch of luxury Looseness crawls forth upon the hapless land , Where nothing holds together , naught is tight And practicable ; and the nation sways From side to side , like to a drunken man , Whose limbs can not obey a staggering mind . SIR BERTRAND . SIR BERTRAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was but vague and unregarded thin , Till wide despair hath fed it into plumpness : A prophecy of Merlin ,  --  that should spring From rich Lorraine a maid to save dear France . SIR BAUDRICOURT . SIR BAUDRICOURT . We must be near to drowning when we catch At mouldy straws . SIR BERTRAND . SIR BERTRAND . Good friend , this air we breathe Is the same air that ancient Merlin breathed , Fed by the earth and sun , same earth and sun That feed it now for us . Upon this air Not bodies only but our souls are kept , Inbreathing aye a subtler , wiser life Than that which arms our eye to conquer space . Hereby so is our being interfused With the divine , that from the Source of all Monitions come , that make some natures prescient . Enter an Attendant . ATTENDANT . ATTENDANT . Here is a peasant , sir , who begs to see you . SIR BAUDRICOURT . SIR BAUDRICOURT . Admit him . Enter the Maid 's Uncle . What 's your want ? UNCLE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl from Domremy , A pious , gentle child , hath , sir , a message She would herself deliver to your ear . SIR BAUDRICOURT . SIR BAUDRICOURT . Know you its purport , and from whom it is ? UNCLE . UNCLE . The girl , sir , talks and looks and bears herself Like one inspired . For several years , she says , She has heard voices , seen at times the forms Of th ' angels whence they issued . Yesterday They told her she 's to be her country 's savior  --  SIR BAUDRICOURT . SIR BAUDRICOURT . Sir Bertrand , here 's old Merlin 's Lorraine lady . SIR BERTRAND . SIR BERTRAND . Depend o n't , this is something more than strange . UNCLE . UNCLE . They ordered her to come at once to you ; They said that you would send her to the King , The King would give her men to raise the siege Of Orleans ; thence to Rheims , there to be crowned . SIR BERTRAND . SIR BERTRAND . What is the daily humor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-forgetfulness . So modest , all her doing is obedience , Now to her angel-voices , as before To father , mother , and the parish priest ; All ardent impulses so clean of self , Her hourly life seems but a supplement To other lives ; her office helpfulness . Pardon me , sir ; from the dear child I 've caught Some of the glow of rapture . SIR BERTRAND . SIR BERTRAND . Is she here In Vaucouleurs ? UNCLE . UNCLE . She is . ' T is not an hour I left her weeping , wringing of her hands , Because , she says , to-day , this very noon , The French are beaten in a fight near Orleans . SIR BERTRAND SIR BERTRAND ( taking out his tablets ) . The first , is't not , Sir Robert ? SIR BAUDRICOURT . SIR BAUDRICOURT . Aye , of April . Good man , take back your niece to Domremy . Hard work on bread and water is a cure , The surest she can have for her disease . Sometimes such cracks i'th ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's smart Works wonders . SIR BERTRAND . SIR BERTRAND . Come , bring me to this maid . Exeunt Sir Bertrand and Uncle . SCENE IV . Public Square at Orleans . Men , women , children , sad , haggard , poorly dressed , some ragged . At the corner of the stage , a bureau for giving out rations . Woman Woman ( with basket or kettle , to the man serving in the bureau ) . Is that all you can give me to-day ? I had but half allowance yesterday . Bureau . Bureau . Our stock is low , grows daily less and less , and no hope for more . Woman . Woman . My two boys , one sixteen , the other fourteen , are on the walls , doing the duty of men . 1st Citizen 1st Citizen ( to the bureau ) . Give her half of my share : such a mother must not starve . Woman . Woman . May God bless you and your children . ( The man of the bureau gives her more . ) This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enter a Soldier . 1st Citizen . 1st Citizen . What news bring'st thou ? Soldier . Soldier . Bad news : more English are coming . 1st Cit. 1st Cit . And no French ? Where is the King ? 2d Cit. 2d Cit . The King is no king : his seat is not the throne , but the lap of a mistress . 1st Cit. 1st Cit . If no succor comes , soon , we must starve or surrender . Young Woman Young Woman ( with infant in her arms , coming forward ) . Surrender ! Rather than that thy sweet rosy flesh shall shrink upon thy bones , and thou grow pale and cold , clinging to my milkless breast . Ha ! he smiles and looks to heaven . Thou shalt not die : thou shalt live , to fight for France . Soldier . Soldier . Strange rumors there are of a Maid who is to be the savior of Orleans . Young Woman . Young Woman . Who has seen her ? Whence comes she ? 1st Cit. 1st Cit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all who are on it have abandoned us . Enter a Citizen in haste . Citizen . Citizen . To the walls ! To the walls ! The enemy are advancing on the west . 1st Citizen . 1st Citizen . To arms ! to arms ! A moment since I was ripe for cold despair . The battling English rewarm my heart . Away with despondency ! Come , comrades ! We 'll woo the King with our courage . From the blood we sow to-day we shall reap succor next week . Succor must come ; it must . On , then , comrades , once more to the walls ! Beat back the enemy , and then over his head we will look jubilant from our ramparts far away upon France , and hope . Exit , followed by citizens shouting " To the walls ! to the walls ! " SCENE V. Vaucouleurs . Head-quarters of Sir Baudricourt . Sir Baudricourt and two officers . To them enter Sir Bertrand de Pousengis . SIR BERTRAND . SIR BERTRAND . Again I come , Sir Baudricourt , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SIR BAUDRICOURT . SIR BAUDRICOURT . What will it boot ? A question this of faith , Of naught but faith . A sheer impertinence Is she to one who ca n't believe in her . It irks me , friend , to hear her even named ; The sight of her would anger me , extort Rude speech , belike , such as a gentleman Forbids his tongue when speaking to a woman . SIR BERTRAND . SIR BERTRAND . When first she came she was , to fullest heads An insolence , to most a disbelief . Within a short two weeks she 's won them all ; Won them , not by performing miracles , But by the wonder of her daily life , So simple , pure , and freshly serviceable , It cleanses thought to see and hear and know her . Enter the MAID , suddenly . SIR BAUDRICOURT . SIR BAUDRICOURT . What ho ! my sentinels ! MAID . MAID . Nor sentinels , Nor your strong bent can stay me . Keys I bear To unlock your closest orders . SIR BAUDRICOURT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those false watchmen weak Have failed to do . The two officers approach to seize her . She waves them back , they pause . By Heaven ! I 'll break this charm . MAID . MAID . ' T is not a charm , Sir Baudricourt . Wherefor To me hath fallen this signal part I know not . It saddens me more than it cheers . Obey I must what is above me . So , yourself . You speak and act from what to you doth seem Pure self-impulsion ; but there is behind That impulse what is its far primal fount , A might unseen , which all your motions moves . Life , death , can you control them , you or I ? And yet they are controlled . Your instruments You choose : shall God not choose his own ? By men The world seems ruled : men are his instruments . The best , the freest human instruments Are they who on themselves think least , and burn The self to fuel flames shall light the way To fertile principles , deep truths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at myself , My speech . I know me not . This friendly ground Scarce do I feel its pressure on my sole . I seem to skim the earth , to tread on air , Borne lightly forward by a will not mine , Which you nor I nor any one can baffle . Enter in haste a booted , spattered courier , and gives a package to Sir Baudricourt , who hurriedly opens it . SIR BAUDRICOURT . SIR BAUDRICOURT . The King hath lost another battle . SIR BERTRAND . SIR BERTRAND . When ? SIR BAUDRICOURT . SIR BAUDRICOURT . At noon the first of April . What of that ? SIR BERTRAND . SIR BERTRAND . Have you forgotten how this maiden 's uncle , The day he came to beg an interview , Told she was weeping then for battle lost ? SIR BAUDRICOURT . SIR BAUDRICOURT . Aye , aye , I do remember ; and you set The date upon your tablets . What tell they ? SIR BERTRAND . SIR BERTRAND . Whate'er they tell is from my memory gone , But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their report . Takes out his tablets and gives them . SIR BAUDRICOURT SIR BAUDRICOURT ( reads ) . " At noon the first of April . " ' T is strange ! SIR BERTRAND . SIR BERTRAND . The air can carry messages Swifter than e'en a royal estafette . My friend , man 's fullest knowledge is as yet Small fraction fine of what there is to draw From the deep quarries of the universe , The happy harvestings of rich futurity . SIR BAUDRICOURT . SIR BAUDRICOURT . Further : the King bids me send him the maid . MAID . MAID . Send me at once . Dear Orleans is in tears . The ruthless English close their claws upon her . France is impatient to be saved . SIR BERTRAND . SIR BERTRAND . High maid , Myself and the good knight of Novelompont , Each with a trusty squire , we are to be Your escort and your guard . The way is long , And rough with dangers . MAID . MAID . Brave Sir Bertrand , thou Art one of those elected happiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , for the dangers of our coming journey , Give them no heed . They who commissioned me To this momentous work , hold in their hands Enough continuous pliant threads of life To steer us through this angry labyrinth . Let me be gone at once , Sir Baudricourt . Minutes weigh upon France like heaviest hours , So sleepless is the time with desolation . Exeunt . ACT II . SCENE I. The Royal Residence at Chinon . King Charles VII , the royal Dukes of Alenon and of Vendome , Count Dunois , bastard of Orleans , the Counts of Armagnac and of Gaucourt , La Hire , Bertrand de Pousengis . KING . KING . I know not , gentlemen , that I can put The purpose of this Council into words , And stay a smile from pertly wheeling them From dutiful intent of seriousness . The question is , shall we admit to-day , As active party to our consultation On plans of war and policy , a girl , That girl a peasantess , untutored , raw ; But still , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won the heart , Not solely of the ruder multitude , But sundry of the wisest men and women . ALENON . ALENON . My Liege , for one , were I disposed to smile , The guardian Angels of our France ( if they Have not upflown to Heaven , deserting us , Wrath-lifted at our mad self-immolation ) , They , if they hover near , would with a blow , Aye , with a blow from their invisible hands , Smash on my lips such smile ,  --  a smile sardonic , While prostrate France gasps forth ensanguined groans . My Liege , lest something come to save us soon , We 're lost , and must flee toward our southern coast , Flight ignominious , self-destructive , base . Admit this Maid : hear what she has to say : Hope springs fresh fountains in extremity . DUNOIS . DUNOIS . Your Majesty , the Duke of Alenon Thickens the blackness of the time o'ermuch . Methinks , gross as it is , unblenching swords Can cut a path to clearer distances . ALENON . ALENON . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th ' English legions that enfold and clutch That sparkling royal gem ; and thus re-earn The lofty title that he wears ? DUNOIS . DUNOIS . Most true , Orleans is our last hope . Give me the men , And I will pledge me here to raise its siege . ALENON . ALENON . Ha ! whence will swarm the needed men ? for Frenchmen , Brave as they are , ca n't fight unfed , unclad . GAUCOURT . GAUCOURT . I have no faith , my Liege , in women-warriors . But let us see this Maid . She 's beautiful , ' T is said ; and beauty fires a Frenchman 's heart . ARMAGNAC . ARMAGNAC . Your Majesty , here is a gentleman , Sir Bertrand de Pousengis , who can tell , It may be , something of this peasant girl . KING . KING . Sir Bertrand , speak what you have learnt or know . SIR BERTRAND . SIR BERTRAND . Your Majesty , this Maid of Domremy I have escorted all the perilous way From Vaucouleurs , enlisted by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beheld her there , Fed daily by the beaming saintliness Of a demeanor , where a manlike force So quickened maiden tenderness , all hearts Were boldened by a wise activity , Her words and deeds falling upon the people A showered benediction from above . Amid the city 's heated stir she shone Modest as moon new-hung in cloud-flecked sky . This fortnight past , threading the forest paths ,  --  Which had been weary both and dangerous , But for the constant light of her fair aspect And the sure prescience of her dispositions ,  --  She was the guardian of her harnessed guards , The comforter of th ' oft discouraged escort . I claim some knowledge of the wondrous Maid . Through tangled travel was I at her side By day and night . I see a sudden smile , My lords , brighten your bronzd visages ; But know , that to my thought , not reverenced child . Nor sister sacred , nor soul 's image of Divine perfection , could be flanked about By firmer rampart of high chastity , Than this poor peasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I vow myself her servant knight , almost I 'd said her worshipper , so good she is , So wise , so pure , so true . KING . KING . By Heaven , Sir Bertrand , You are a noble , chivalrous gentleman . Go bring your wondrous maiden to our presence . Exit Sir Bertrand . Dunois , take you my seat . The King descends from the throne , and Dunois seats himself thereon . She knows us not : We 'll try her promptly at her first approach . GAUCOURT . GAUCOURT . Give her such shriving drench , my lord Dunois , That she shall need confessor never more . DUNOIS . DUNOIS . If her bragged angels be not forced to lay Their plumeless pinions drooping at my feet , And she to offer penance for her fraud , May I ne'er hark for bugle blast again . Renter Sir Bertrand with the Maid . Well , Shepherdess , what is your will with me ? MAID . MAID . Not unto you , Bastard of Orleans , is My homage owed . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King , By that mysterious Wisdom which , through depths ,  --  To a frail mortal ken unfathomable ,  --  Chooses its instruments at times among The lowliest born , to you I 'm sent that I Be your chief servant in extremity , Ordered , empowered , to raise the siege of Orleans , And then to lead you to be crowned at Rheims . KING . KING . You speak not like a rustic peasant girl . MAID . MAID . I am a rustic peasant girl no more . Why me and not another they have sent At this distressful moment , that I know not . Of God 's true purposes ( in fostering which He useth angels , who in turn use us ) Only by inward watch upon ourselves , And honest outward look , can we learn aught , Becoming quicker , better learners we , The deeper is our childlike innocence ; For as with light He permeates the air , So does He interfuse with finer beam The souls of men clean passive to his will . As the Maid in speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps a little back from her in astonishment and admiration . Some of the lords do the same KING . KING . Your words are higher than I 'm wont to hear . That you by instinct knew Dunois and me , Is much ; but I would hold a subtler proof Of the supernal friends you claim to have . MAID . MAID . Your Majesty shall be full satisfied . First bid these gentlemen to stand aloof . The King and Maid go to one side , the lords to the other . ARMAGNAC . ARMAGNAC . So many are the sins he hath to score , ' Twill easy be to guess at one or two . DUNOIS . DUNOIS . See , see : the King is startled  --  turneth pale . She plies him further : why , he looks subdued . VENDOME . VENDOME . He is by far too much subdued already . If she 'll put life and courage into him , I shall believe she is by angels backed . KING KING ( alone ) . This Maid hath plucked a secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lively watch , It never had been breathed to living ear , Or whispered of by lips until by hers . It frightens me to think this mystery could By any one be known except myself . Strange gifts she hath , more than are natural . I will consult the Bishops ; they will know . Meanwhile , Duke Alenon , take charge of her ; And treat her as becomes your dignity . Exeunt King and lords , except Alenon and Sir Bertrand . ALENON . ALENON . Lieutenant , conduct her to my quarters . Say To the Duchess , I commend to kindest care This Maid . ( To the Maid . ) In her already you 've a friend . Exit Maid with Lieutenant . Delay , delay ; ever a putting off . Thriftless postponement is the kingly home , His petted palace , rounded with the soft And perfumed pillows of luxuriousness . His acts of kingly duty and renown Are in a future which he never grasps , That virtuous time aye smothered in his sloth . And hence the wreck of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , As stealthy darkness with ingenuous day . Sir Bertrand . Sir Bertrand . That lordly France should be so buffeted ! Dear bleeding France , pale with the loss of drops That redden lifted arms of enemies . Yet Orleans must be quick relieved . ALENON . ALENON . By whom ? The King hath lost the power to command ; His captains loyal temper to obey ; And the poor , trampled , scourged , abandoned people , All confidence in both , all faith , all hope . Bloody destruction glares upon the kingdom , Croaking malicious at our helplessness . SIR BERTRAND . SIR BERTRAND . Pardon , Duke Alenon ; I 'll comfort you . Were Vaucouleurs , where she abode a fortnight , But a league hence , you 'd see her compassed round By men armed to the teeth , each at his cost , So did she swell all hearts with forward zeal , Blow into them her martial spirit 's breath . And thus ' twill soon be here . She 's a born leader ,  --  And more than that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Transcendent breath at times so breathes its life Into selected soul , from this new might Men courage gather , as from impulses Inflamed by a descended God . Exeunt . SCENE II . Residence of the Duke of Alenon , at Chinon . The Duchess of Alenon and her daughter Emily , aged fifteen EMILY . EMILY . Mother , why does she keep away so long ? DUCHESS . DUCHESS . She undergoes sharp trial now at Poictiers , By hoary councilors and priests , to learn Whether she be from God or th ' evil one . EMILY . EMILY . Mother , she can not be from th ' evil one : I never feel so good as when with her . DUCHESS . DUCHESS . Surer than all this conclave 's cognizance Is that as voucher for a pedigree . If thy pure pulses be still purified By her strong breathing , she must be from heaven , Aye , and from heaven 's most heavenly circles sent . Methinks some women interspersed could piece The Council 's judgment out to sounder wholeness : Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EMILY . From Poictiers yesterday there was no courier : Is't not a sign that father 's coming home ? DUCHESS . DUCHESS . Ha ! here he is . Enter the Duke of Alenon . And good news on his face . ALENON . ALENON . The best : she 's cleared . The Council has pronounced , Swayed by the King and people . As ' t was here , So too at Poictiers : her great heart enclasps , Enfoldeth , melts all hearts , men , women , children , All warmly won ; as though the puissant air Were suddenly inflammable , and she A torch , that where she comes it flameth wide , Thawing the frozen courage of the land , Giving impetuous motions as of old . Men are all soul ; forget their bodies ; weep With Frenchmen 's joy . The King , even the lords , The skeptic lords , eye her with admiration . Soldiers pour in : she leads a freshened force To Orleans . What a sight to see her , armed Like manliest knight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she sat there To teach bold chivalry its horsemanship ; My look so dazzled that I seemed to see An image almost of the Virgin self , Descended on a cloud rainful of pity , To claim anew obediences and law ; As though men 's governance had failed on earth , And woman would recleanse infected power . She gives commands as she 'd ne'er done aught else . Good-will and zeal and courage rule afresh In all men 's hearts . She starts to-day , this hour . EMILY . EMILY . O father , shall I not see her again ? ALENCON . ALENCON . Thou shalt . By me she sends thy mother word , She 'll stop to bid good-by .

She gently unlinks herself from their embrace . War , war ! Blood , blood ! There is no other way . God 's will be done : I am an instrument . And noble Duke , my hearty thanks to you . We 'll meet again ere long , and side by side , Upon the battle field . Farewell ! Farewell ! Now must I weep at carnage which I cause : It is my destiny , my duty 's best .

FIRST CITIZEN . FIRST CITIZEN . Who would have believed it ? The English made no stir to balk her entrance . SECOND CITIZEN . SECOND CITIZEN . As she marched by , they looked on spell-bound , as if rooted in the earth , rigid as statues . Their chiefs , Talbot and Suffolk , feared to bid them attack , lest they should disobey , or worse than that , be panic-stricken . This I heard just now from a brave Champagnee , who deserted from them but an hour ago . Enter an Old Man . OLD MAN . OLD MAN .

No : I wish there was , I so long to set my two hundred to a charge . They 'd now ride down a regiment of English , were every man in it a Talbot . The Maid bade me meet her with my troop here in the public square : what for , I know not . Ha ! there 's a church : she 'll be going to make them charge upon that . Her they 'll follow even into a church . The half of them , I 'll be sworn , never saw the inside of one , unless as sanctuary after a homicide . Such troopers never sat horse before .

Men she draws to her , and moulds them to her will ; whether by help of angels or by force of soul I can not tell . Even her beauty could not alone do the half she does . She has one great quality , I 'm sure of . FIRST CITIZEN . FIRST CITIZEN . What 's that ? LA HIRE . LA HIRE . A commander 's eye . Great commanders are born , and rarely born .

France were now Erect and healthy , strong as any oak , The stoutest that for centuries hath braved The tempest on her bleakest mountain side , Had every noble Frenchman done his duty . Noble , I say ; for they whose part and place It is to plan and rule , in peace and war , Theirs are the weightiest and most sacred duties ; And France is prostrate , sapped , because her best And highest have been neither good nor high , Lacking obedience to command of right , Selfish , self-seeking , arrogant , and false . Obedience is the life of prosperous action . Here it must rule as gravest law of laws , If Orleans shall be saved . LA HIRE . LA HIRE .

Healthy religion ripes more foodful fruit . All days are God 's : He works on holy days As other days ; nor doth He Sunday bar The sun from shining , or the river 's flow . As all the days are God 's , so are they man 's ; And he who does good deeds should fear no frown Our motion 's swing , dear life and liberty , No charter binds but duteous rectitude .

If Count Gaucourt is better than a brigand , He hath not shown it yet .

Ha ! there she is ; she was unhorsed : she 's up again ; she plunges among our flying ranks : they rally round her ; cling about her like children to their mother in a storm .

But I am not mine own , that I may feast Mine honor on such dainty death . Brave comrades , Our lives , the lives of all these men , we hold In trust for England and our king . My friend ,  --  For such I 'm proud to call Sir William Blunt ,  --  A veteran in the services of war , Your judgment hath especial worth for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of siege ; For henceforth we 're no longer the besiegers , But the besieged , so lopped are all our means .

They 're gone ; and rescued Orleans breathes unbound . Now from this long o'ershadowed centre spreads A glow , that flusheth fainting France with hope , With high resolve . One little , rapid month , So dyed with change ! What a deep mystery Our living here on earth , its only clew In the great life beyond , and that there is A life beyond .

Distressful life 's sole sweetener is love , Love , lifting while it lights and furthers us ; For onward is aye surer when ' t is upward . But love itself hangs weights upon our feet : Love 's life 's in selfless helpfulness , whereby We rise the highest when we most descend . And now , to cheer the million sufferers Of this worn France , I must at once alight Upon the poisoned marsh of sluggishness , Where lives , or rather fails to live , the King .

The high should be on high , the low below ; Else action 's wheels strain sighing in a slough , And keep no pace with life 's loved promptitudes . This present joyousness of sweet success Is solely due to quick conformity To reclamations of th ' impending Will , Against whose benison our daily fret Keeps us forever bruised and dislocate . In France 's sour , self-wrought extremity , God hath unkinged a fruitless man-made King , And set above him this great woman-King , Blest with the gifts and secrets of command .

This can but be the sudden burst to flame Of passion stored unconsciously away . And yet it seemed full flashed in that one moment . Her upward look of maiden holiness Shot into me a life , so absolute I felt no other feeling , had no thought , Nor even knew when the won crown enringed me . A partnership so close there is among The fiery constituents of our being , Each kindles each ; and sometimes all on one Throw the united pulsings of the soul , That but by this one is the man inflamed ; As I am now , and with a deepening thrill I never knew before .

The Maid of Orleans , that 's the title , Sire , You 've given me , and by that I would abide . KING . KING .

Thy very tenderness is a decoy To snare thee . With thy soul 's mobility , Thy pity and thy melting lovingness , They lime the twig to lock thy free-born feet , Using thy trustfulness to cheat thy heart ; Then loosen thee , a slave to thy low self , Deplumed , sad , lonely , withered , void , unsexed . O God ! I shudder at the wantonness Which strews the earth with outcasts beautiful ! KING . KING . Unwittingly I have affrighted thee . Maiden imagination so hath wrought , Thou seest black harms where smiling good was meant . MAID . MAID . I can not blacken them , so deep are they With rot ingrained .

' T is much too big for instant measurement , This new event . And now to make the most Of such high-foaming fortune . Let me see . Ligny will hold her at a royal ransom : As kings now go , she 's worth a score of kings . The consecration at historic Rheims Was worth a manful army to the French .

To do their proper function , prelates should Have happier , holier thoughts than other men , Fresh pulses from th ' eternal love creative : What thoughts are theirs who sit in highest place To judge and burn a maiden innocent ? In this black nook ,  --  shifted to earth from hell ,  --  Great Cardinal Winchester is ministering devil . Are heaven 's sluices locked , that they ope not To shower , from streaming eyes of cherubim , A flood of tears , and drown this wickedness ? Oh , the blind arrogance of men , that they Would browbeat God . They snatch his mighty sceptre ; Then venture willfully to wield what is So laden with omnipotence , a turn , The slightest , from its flashing rectitude , Frights planets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springs a rebound That fells the puny wielders to the damned .

SOLDIER . Away , begone ! Thrusts Oyseleur out . BEAUVAIS . BEAUVAIS . Joan , it is not yet too late . Confess here , publicly , thy voices were From demons , and thou shalt not mount the pile . MAID . MAID . I can not say what is not . I believe ,  --  Nay , nay , I know my voices were from God . Angels hover incessant near to us , Peopling corporeal air with spiritual life .

Now , Heavenly Father , give me strength . And ye , My brothers , help me with your prayers . She ascends the pile , accompanied by brother Martin . A VOICE A VOICE ( from the judges ' platform ) . Executioner , do your duty . The executioner ties her to the stake , and then descends and lights the fire . MAID . MAID . Bishop of Beauvais , this day 's work is thine . Thee I forgive : may God : man never will . The Bishop covers his face with his hands , in agony . The flame and smoke rise , brother Martin still on his knees beside her . MAID . MAID . Go down , go down , good brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How terrible , how damnable , but how Sublime is this dread sight . Think that you saw The risen sun quick quenched in howling darkness . MAID MAID ( behind the smoke , with piercing cry ) . Jesus ! Jesus ! An English Knight rushes from the crowd , with hands uplifted . KNIGHT . KNIGHT . We 're lost , we 're lost ! Doomed , doomed ! We 've burnt a saint ! We shall be driven out of France  --  driven out . Above the smoke the Maid is seen to ascend , stretching out her hands in attitude of blessing . Angels just over her . See there , see : for the death we give to her , She gives to us the life of her high blessing , Falls on his knees . As she ascends to her great place in heaven . Others similarly touched , fall on their knees , some prostrate , exclaiming ,  --  O God ! have mercy on us ! mercy , mercy ! The curtain falls.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
