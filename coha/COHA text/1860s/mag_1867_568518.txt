303 ARTICLE 1W-WARD 'S LIFE OF PERCIVAL . The Life and etter8 of Jame8 Gate8 Percival . By JULIUS II . WARD . Boston : Ticknor &amp; Fields . 1866 . One volume . l2mo. pp. *83 . IT seems but a fitting portion of the strange history of this remarkable man , that lie should silently and unnoticed have passed away from life , ahd that years should have elapsed before the fragments of the story of his career were gathered together . Still more does the end of his history seem to answer to its beginning and progress , as we find the complete biography , which comes to us after so long an interval , to be the work , not of one who had been within the circle of his acquaintance or friendship , but of a person who , at the outset , knew nothing of him except his poetry , and who had never even seen his face . Dwelling apart from mankind , and shutting out the world from the retirement of his soul , he left at death the mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with no impulse to bear him onward in the search except that which had been awakened by the contemplation of his genius . We can scarcely help feeling that , if the poet could have foreseen the future , and have known that a young man , who had been thus inspired , even in childhood , with reverence and admiration for him , would , out of mere love for his memory , devote the leisure of several years to the work of giving a faithful narrative of his life and labors , he would have been , in a measure , satisfied in the desires of his heart for an appreciative remembrance . And for this reason , as well as because the record of such a man ought always to be kept , especially in the city where he made his home , we may well be glad that the author has been sustained in his purpose and energy until the end of his work . We propose to enter in this Article upon a brief review of // the story , and a brief estimate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's volume . The life of every man of letters is largely a life of retirement . Given up to the study of books or to the investigations of science , he is , of necessity , withdrawn from that sphere where political honors are gained , and where events that attract the notice of mankind are constantly exciting new interest . The narrative of such a man 's career , therefore , after death has terminated it , can not be full of incidents , like that of those who are prominent in civil or military affairs , but becomes a simple record of daily duties and of quiet progress , while the great results are seen , perhaps , only in the improved condition of the world , and often may not be traced , by those who experience the blessing of them , directly to their author . Especially must this be the case where the man of learning holds no public position , as in a university , in which his influence may be continually going out upon the pupils who listen to his teachings , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own dwelling , and rarely or never meets his fellow-men . Of this last mentioned class was the subject of this biography . The building which , in his closing years , he designed and prepared for his residence , was a sort of symbol of his life . With no entrance upon the public street , and no opening whatever in front excepting through three narrow windows , which were covered with heavy iron blinds , it resemnbled , as Mr. Ward remarks , " a monastic cell more than the residence of a human being . " And as we should not expect to discover in such a house much of variety* or even very much of interest to the ordinary mind , beyond the answer to curious questionings about the habits of the hermit who occupied it , so , as we follow the hermit himself through the passing years , we must be content with the study of his inward being rather than his outward history . The outward history is soon told . IDr . Percival was born just at the close of the last century-Sept. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Berlin , Connecticut . This is a common country village , such as we see everywhere in New England , and , though Mr. Ward refers to the beautiful scenery near his home , we can hardly believe that any peculiar inspiration could have // been derived from the meadows and mountains there , beyond what might be drawn from the surroundings of twenty villages in our own or any one of the neighboring States . He was the son of a respectable physician , who seems , from the accounts of him still preserved , to have been both earnest and successful in his work . One of his indefinitely-removed grandmothers , on the father 's side , is said to have been a daughter of John Robinson of Leyden ; and , like almost everybody else of whom we have ever heard , he was the descendant of one of three brothers who came over from England , and also was able to trace his family in England to the time of William the Conqueror , His mother 's name was Elizabeth Hart ; but of her ancestry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kensington from the time of its first settlement . She is described  --  and here we use substantially the language of the memoiras of a nervous , sensitive temperament , inclined at times to melancholy ; of a strong , keen , and clear mind ; and of a better education than women usually had in those days . She had also a good literary taste , which was evidenced in later years , according to the biographer , by a hearty appreciation of her son 's poetical fame , and a frequent use of the volumes of his poetry . Of his father 's abilities and characteristics , on the other hand , it is said , that he was the equal of his wife ; that he was not liberally educated , but had a taste for letters , and was as well read as most Connecticut doctors of his time ; that he was social and persuasive in society , but was noted for keeping his own counsel , and doing everything in his own way . The boy was , thus , like innumerable other children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , so far as we are able to discover , had nothing in his origin or the external circumstances of his early years that could , in any peculiar measure , have created or awakened the poetic power . Tie had great fondness for reading , indeed , and a wonderful memory , and an abstracted turn of mind , and more or less of a love of nature , but nothing that indicated a poet 's soul beyond numbers of boys perchance within the circle of our readers ' knowledge , from whom the world has never expected or desired the exercise of the poetic gift . Nor do his youtht'ul efforts in versethough , even at the age of fourteen , he attempted a mock // heroic of upwards of two thousand lines-show any extraordinary excellence , or give promise of any remarkable success in mature life . He was , in a word , simply an imaginative boy , disposed to solitude and melancholy , dissatisfied with the ordinary teaching of the schools , which the times afforded , as ill-adapted to meet the wants of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unknown . In due course of time he began his preparation for college , and entered the Freshman Class at Yale in the autumn of 1810 . After remaining here , however , for about eighteen months , he returned home , and subsequently became a member of the class of 1815 , with which he was graduated at the end of their course of study . During his college life he developed , at every step , a new love of reading , and manifested more clearly a wonderful power of remembering all that he read . To the excellence of his scholarship the testimony both of his classmates and of Dr. Dwight himself are given  --  the latter having even spoken of him as " the most remarkable scholar he had known for many years . " The poetic impulse , also , displayed itself , in these years , so strikingly , that it became evident both to himself and others , that his life would be devoted to poetry . We say " the poetic impulse , " for , so far as we are able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written , though better than those of ordinary college students , were still , to say the utmost in their favor , more remarkable for quantity than for quality . And in view of them , his passionate declaration , on occasion of some severe remarks respecting the rejection , by a publisher , of a poem written in his freshman year- " I do n't care ; I will be a poet " - may possibly be regarded as showing the determined energy more than the inspiration of his soul . We do not , in saying this , mean to speak depreciatingly of his college efforts , for we ordinarily expect only the beginnings and the first promise of the future at that early period . All that we mean is , that , as in his boyhood , so in these years of his education , he developed no such extraordinary power as to make his eminence in later life certain . More than one man since his time has sung quite as sweetly , and given his college associates quite as strong hopes in regard to his fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common // 307 work of life , or , at least , has failed to gain the recognition and admiration of the world . But few , probably , have had so strong a love of poetic composition and , at the same time , so strong a purpose to bring out the power within of which they themselves felt conscious , without ardently entering " the service of song " afterward , and becoming known as consecrated to the Muses . It was thus that he came forward into mature life . But alas for inspired souls ,  --  for all who would commune with nature as the poet does , or would dwell , as scholars , in the society of the departed great rather than of the common men of the present ,  --  the country , at that day , had comparatively little appreciation of poetry or literature . The pressing question of daily bread forced even the most retiring and those most given to solitude to seek after some practical work of ordinary life , and , as lawyers or statesmen perchance , to crush out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet this trying question at his graduation , for , though his father had accumulated a considerable property by his profession , yet at his death he had not left his children enough to maintain them in a life of literary leisure , lie determined accordingly to become a physician , and immediately entered upon the study of medicine . his remarkable powers of acquisition were displayed here as everywhere else . He gave himself earnestly to the work before him , with an absorbing love of knowledge , and at his examination for his degree , he was found almost to equal his teachers in all branches of the science . Soon afterward he established himself in his native village . It required , however , but littie time to show that his sphere was not that of a country doctor . Whatever he was called to do he did well . Yet his sensitive nature was unfitted for the responsibilities and trials of the work ; and though he seems , in the necessities and disappointments of his subsequent life , to have turned in thought , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself less to this employment than to any other into which his fertile mind led him to enter . He was now about twenty-five years of age , and his life from this time onward may be divided into two scetionsin the former of which he devoted himself largely to poetry , and in the latter to language and natural science . // The poetical period of Percival 's life extended over some ten or eleven years , until about the year 1831 . Its record is a record of repeated efforts and publications , with fhe story of the lingering and slowly dying hopes of a soul that found itself , to its own view , in an unappreciative age . The age was unappreciative , indeed , but not so much so as he thought . It gave him his fair share of commendation as compared with other poets of the time . But it had not a sufficiently cultivated taste , - in other words , the country was not yet far enough advanced in its literary history , to receive with eagerness the writings even of a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable him to live by his poetry . Nothing less than this : - nothing less than the joyful reception of his poems , with the continual testimony of the public approbation , could have satisfied his desires for fame ; and , on the other hand , nothing less than such a universal reception and approbation as would have placed him beyond the necessity of any uncongenial employment could have made hin* live a contented life . At length , grieved and chagrined at his ill success ,  --  to his own apprehension an entire failure ,  --  and disgusted with the neglectful or even hostile world , he suppressed the purposes and extinguished the inspirations of his soul . With a sorrowful spirit he turned away from the beautiful pathway in which he had walked so long , and from the bright anticipations of his earlier life . He laid aside his poetic pen , to take it up but seldom in the future , and became a scholar rather than a poet . During the larger part of this period he resided in New Haven . For a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either in the work of lecturing on Botany , or in endeavoring to find employment as a physician , in Charleston , S. C. , and , while there , he wrote many fugitive pieces in verse , which were , soon afterwards , collected and published in that city . These poems seem to have been favorably received , and to have gained him friends among the literary circles of Charleston . But the characters of the poet and the physician , as he expressed it , were so widely separated to the public apprehension , that he could not hope to gain his living there by his profession . Persons in want of medicine asked for a practical man , and not a visionary one , and they could not be persuaded that a writer of verses could see anything // except unreal visions . Accordingly he was compelled to return to the North , and , having been unsuccessful in securing a position , which he desired , in Harvard University , he devoted himself for some time to the publication of new volumes of poems . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support , it is said that he even thought of becoming an Episcopal minister ; but this was , as we should have supposed , only the thought of a moment . The more fitting occupation of an editor , however , being proposed to him , he entered upon it for a short period . Subsequently , he received an appointment under the general govermnent as Professor at West Point , or as Surgeon in the army service ; and , as various favorable propositions were made to him , he became , at different times , a stated contributor to periodicals or magazines . Especially his friends in Boston interested themselves in his behalf , and endeavored to persuade him to fix his residence in their city , encouraging him that he might gradually gain there all that he desived . But nothing seenls to have long held his attention or satisfied his sensitive soul , and , with every new change or disappointment , he found his way back to IN ew Haven , the home of his early choice . Here , however , he was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of genius , becorning continually more and more a stranger to the people , as well by reason of his frequent wanderings as because of his retiring disposition , which kept him from the public view . The prospect of success was , consequently , growing less as the years passed on , and , as he withdrew into himself more and more completely , and buried himself in his hermit life , his story became con tinnally a sadder one . Nevertheless he kept up the struggle , in a certain measure , and brought to the notice of the country , during these years , the largest part of all the poems which now bear his name . It would be impossible to give the whole narrative of this portion of his life , unless we were to follow Mr. Ward through all the minuteness of his successive chapters . But one can rarely find a more sorrowful record of disappointed ambition and gradually perishing hopes ,  --  none the less sorrowful , because we feel , at every step , that , with a less morbid sensitiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might have been a happy and a highly useful man . In the latter division of his life , commencing when he was about thirty-six years of age , Dr. Percival devoted himself mainly to linguistic studies and to natural science . Before this time , indeed , he had been extensively engaged in the preparation of Webster 's Dictionary , in association with the distinguished author of that work ,  --  a service , in which his patience and thoroughness in the examination of words seemed , at first , calculated to be of munch advantage . But Dr. Webstcr and himself , as the biographer well remarks , were not persons adapted to work together . The former was positive , energetic , thoroughly practical , and always confident in his own judgment . The latter was cautious in the extreme ; he thought only of patient study and the utmost conceivable minuteness and accuracy , while the practical and the waiting-world were wholly beyond his vision . He was always seeing new points to be investigated , and the farther he advanced , so much the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His colaborer and superior in the work , on the other hand , believed in the end , and moved steadily toward it ; he wanted help in reaching the end , and not an endless wandering into undiscovered regions . The result was that they parted company , and Percival withdrew with dissatisfaction . The translating and editing of IMlalte Brun 's Geography had also been committed to him by a Boston gentleman , some years before this ,  --  a work which was carefully and faithfully done , but which was protracted over so long a period that the publisher failed in his enterprise . These things , however ,  --  though in the line of his subsequent pursuits-belonged , in time , to the former period of his life , when he was still keeping up heart and hope as a poet . When this hope was finally crushed , he turned almost wholly to these new pursuits . At first , he occupied himself especially with the languages and comparative philology . Having great facility in acquisition and an extraordinary memory , he speedily gained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  including , according to Mr. Ward , every one of those in use in modern Europe , excepting the Turkish . Nor was he satisfied here , any more than he was // in other lines , with what was merely superficial . The tendency of his mind , when he was engaged in any employment , was not to rest content so long as there was anything still remaining to be learned ; and it is astonishing to see how much he accomplished , and how curiously he searched into all the peculiarities and mysteries connected with these studies , within the four years following 1831 . A large part , even , of the scattered attempts at poetry , during his later life , was made up of verses written in imitation of those in foreign tongues , and sometimes he composed in those tongues themselves . Of his success in these imitative efforts we do not propose to speak , but tl.ie efforts themselves show the enthusiasm of his studies , and the degree in which he entered into the spirit of the authors whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , at that time , bad made wider investigations or acquired a larger knowledge . The universal testimony of those who knew him seems to have been , that he was a true scholar , and even learned men were often glad to listen to his discourse upon the themes most familiar to them in their own field . In 1835 he was called to another work-namely , that of making a geological survey of the State of Connecticut . This work occupied his time for six years , and was completed then only because the patience of the legislative and executive branches of the government was exhausted ; and he was compelled to hand in his iReport , though , to his own view , by no means finished . Of the minuteness and carefulness of the survey no better account can be given than by quoting a few words of his own from a letter addressed to Governor Baldwin , then a member of the State Senate , with reference to what had been accomplished during the first five years of the work During this period , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a regular plan of sections from east to west , reducing the intervals in the last survey to an average distance of two miles ; thus passing along one side of each of the nearly five thousand square miles of the State . In the first survey I had employed seven months , in the last nearly a year of constant traveL I had examined all objects of geological interest , particularly the rocks and those including minerals , with minute attention . I had scarcely passed a ledge or point of rock without particular examination . I had completed eleven manuscript volumes , amounting to nearly fifteen hundred pages , very finely written in abbreviation . I had collected specimens from at least eight thousand localities , according // to a very reduced calculation from actual enumeration of one town , and several specimens from each locality-each specimen intended to illustrate something peculiar and noticed in my notes-all my specimens marked on the papers enclosing them , and checked in my note-books , so that I know their precise locality , and could again trace them to the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the commencement , I had had in view the determination of the geological system of the rocks of the State . All these researches had been a continued process , not only of particular examination , but of comparison and reflection , all tending to the determination of the great system . * * * While engaged in the survey , I can confidently say I have been laborious and diligent . While traveling , it was my practice to rise early , in the longer days generally at dawn ; in the shorter generally I got breakfast and was on my way by daybreak . I continued , scarcely with any relaxation , as long as I had daylight , and then was generally obliged to sit up till midnight , not unfrequently till one o'clock , A. M. , in order*to complete my notes and arrange my specimens . This was continued , not only week after week , but month'after month , almost without cessation . " Of the value of his report and the success of his work Professor Charles U. Shepard , who was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ever remain a monument to the scientific powers of its author . It des*cribes every shade of variation in the different rocks , and their exact distribution over the surface of the State . This it accomplishes with a minuteness never before essayed in any similar work . " And Professor Dana , in a letter to the author of this memoir , speaks of it in terms of respect and commendation . Percival was forty-six years of age when his labors on the Geological Survey were brought to their conclusion . For several years after this he lived in his old home , New Haven , and again gave himself to litei-ary pursnits ,  --  and now also to music , to which he became as enthusiastically devoted as he had been to science and language . Two extracts from letters , written by those who were associated with him at this time , give a somewhat striking as well as amusing account of his efforts in this line . One of these , from Mr. William G. Webster , is as follows " Percival was no musician himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysteries of musical science . Almost every evening , during the intervals betwen the meetings of our musical club , he came to my house at a very early hour ( frequently before tea ) , and going immediately to the piano , he would sit at arm 's length , and with a single finger pick out the notes of some simple strain of his composition the previous day , and request me to record it for future use . A tedious process for him and me , as he might strike a dozen keys before // the proper note would be produced , and sometimes a whole evening might thus be spent on a single theme ; and after all , on playing or singing the air myself , I would find it to be only a reminiscence of his earlier days . " He adds , " Sometimes Percival would bring his accordion and amuse me with the result of his studies since his previous visit . Placing his fingers on the keys he imagined that sounds were elicited , when to my acute ear not a tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye upon the ceiling , he went off into an ecstasy of imaginary melody , of which I did not catch one note in three , and continued playing , or rather manipulating , so long that I fell asleep , but was soon aroused by his asking me whether the air he had been playing were a reminiscence or not . " The other extract is from a letter of Richard S. Willis , Esq. , who says , speaking of the club referred to in the preceding quotation " I recollect on one occasion our club was to sing at a little gathering of friends , and Percival , quite to our astonishment , bad consented to accompany us-for he had shunned all general society for years . Still more were we astonished when he expressed his willingness , while there , to sing a song of his own . He had brought his accbrdion . In a retired corner of the room sat his gaunt , thin figure , bent over the instrument . To me he had never looked half so weird-like ; that noble Shakspearian head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes so full of the wild fire of genius , the thin , curling locks , all gave him the appearance of a minstrel come down from another age . We had already quieted the room for the expected song . Standing near him , I soon knew , by the motion of his lips , that he was singing . But no one heard him ; for I myself could distinguish only the soft breathing of a melody of his that was familiar to me . After a while , the company , supposing that he was not quite ready to begin , commenced talking again . The bard sang on , and the song was finished ; but few beside myself at all suspected that he had be n singing , most supposing , at last , that , for some reason , he had given up his intention . But his own soul had foaLed off upon his melody , and he had that sufficient reward which many a bard has-the silent rapture of song . But I believe and hope Percival was convinced that we shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed of a number of young men , who met together to sing the patriotic songs so well known in connection with the election of General Harrison as President of the United States , and Dr. Percival seems , at this time , to have had his old poetic impulse awakened once more for a short season , as in the days gone by . He wrote large numbers of these songs , which were set to music and did service in the cause . But after the campaign was over , and the short triumph of the Whig party was ended by the death of the President , // his song became silent again , and we hear nothing farther of his special devotion to music . He retired more completely than ever within the narrow limits of his hermit life , and little or nothing is known of the character or results of his labors , except that they were in the line of linguistic studies , until , in 1853 , lie was called to the West on a scientific service . A year later , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered upon the work with all the energy and care which had characterized his similar labors in his native State . After carrying on the survey , however , for a portion of two years , he was compelled , in December , 1855 , to suspend his labors on account of an illness , which continued between five and six months , and then terminated in his death , on the 2 ' 2d of May , 1856 . Within the time of his residence in the West , his more especial friends in New Haven had . in accordance with his desire and advice , erected the singular house , to which allusion was made at the beginning of our hasty review of his lif&amp; It was built in the hope that he might find in it a quiet resting-place for his closing years . The design of the building was his own , but it was so peculiar as to render it useless for any one except himself , and consequently the building was destroyed soon after his death . The record of his death is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no desire manifested to see his old home again , and even no wish uttered that he might be buried in New Haven . There were words of prayer and a calm outlook upon the future ; but the rest-all that was in his soul-was hidden , as it had been in lith and as we should have anticipated it would be at the end , from every one but himself and God . Thus , at the age of sixty-one , he passed away from earth , leaving the record of his life behind him as it was , and finding his grave in a land of strangers far removed from his early home . If we now turn from the narrative to retrace and carefully study the career of Dr. Percival , we think it must be admitted by all that it was by no means a successful career . The poet himself felt this most deeply during his lifetime , and his biographer , with all his admiration for him , can not hide from himself or his readers this lamentable fact . Even his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , the praise which he // asked for , and here , if in anything , he approached most nearly to success . It becomes a point of much interest to inquire into the causes of his failure . Were they in the age or in the man ? Were they in the outward circumstances or in the inward life ? We believe they were largely in the latter , an d , in endeavoring to show that they were so , we shall have occasion to notice several points of his character . So far as his poetic fame is concerned , it seems to us , that he failed of his hopes for the simple reason that he overestimated himself . No doubt , the time in which he began to write was , as we have already intimated , to some degree an unfavorable one for the true appreciation of poetry . But his contemporaries , as we think , notwithstanding this gave him all the commendation that he deserved , if not more than he deserved . Percival , to our view , was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was impossible that he should go down to future times with the name of one . He had , indeed , a certain measure of the divine gift . He was in advance of those who had gone before him in the preceding generation . He wrote some things which will find a place in every collection of American poetry . But when we have said all in his favor , we leave him quite outside of the highest ranks . And we think that the , judgrnent of mankind proves our view to be right , for the knowledge and the estimation of his works have diminished steadily from the beginning until now . The growth of poetry in this country has been a gradual growth . The poems of Barlow and Dwight and their a**ociates , in the last century , were only the first attempts of a new people , whose minds were mainly tbrced away by the practical necessities of their age from all departments of literature . Those writers would hardly have claimed great things for themselves . They were only the pioneers  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others of larger opportunities and greater powers . They were worthy to be remembered for what they did , but they ought not to be compared with the best poets of England , or with the most illustrious ones in our own land at the present day . Percival was at a stage of d evelopruent decidedly beyond theirs , yet only at a certain advance beyond them . The nation was destined to pass beyond him , also , // at a later time , and to leave him , like those who had gone before him , as a man of the past history and the early beginflings . It has been passing beyond him , even within these thirty years since the portion of his life which he gave to song was ended , and in the future he may probably be lost sight of far more than he is to-day . As the great poet who may rise among us , in the coining time , shall take his place in the company of the great of other lands and other ages , the memory of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may fade away-except so far as the student of history may recall the progress of this divine art . Percival himself , on the other hand ,  --  and his biographer seems to fall into something of the same mistake respecting him ,  --  took a much higher view of his own merits . lie believed himself to he a poet deserving of a wide-extended and long-enduring reputation . Lie felt that his countrymen ought always to bear him in their hearts and sound aloud his praises. lie demanded more than the wise and impartial judgment of the world could bestow upon him , and , of necessity , he was deeply disappointed . No reader of this volume can fail to see , everywhere throughout the earlier chapters , the evidence of his self esteem in reference to his poetic power , and his almost angry dissatisfaction when the results of his efforts at publication were made known to him . lie scolded the public unsparingly to his friends , and became so disgusted with mankind in general , that be shut himself up in his solitary life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can easily realize how a mind , which had so much of real enthusiasm and even of true inspiration as his had , and , at the same timc , so much determination to be what he thought himself capable of being , could become grieved and disheartened and even impatient under the trial of what seemed to him a too low appreciation of his genius . But the trial was in large measure , if not wholly , owing to himself . As we read Mr. Ward 's account of these years , we are impressed with the fact that he was not , in reality , neglected by the literary public . his poems were not received , indeed , with the eagerness with which a new volume from Tennyson would now be welcomed , and they certainly ought not to have been so received . They were not received even as willingly // as a novel , or perhaps as a treatise or , to use his own language , a " heavy-blank-verse melody " on doctrinal theology , was then received . But it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run after novel-reading , and that , at that day , they were unusually devoted to theological controversy . The true way of deciding the question is to compare his case with that of other poets , and , approaching the matter thus , we again submit that he was fairly treated by his contemporaries . They certainly ought to stand acquitted of all unjust depreciation of his merits ; and we question whether his poems were not more favorably accepted by the public , even if somewhat less widely circulated , than they would have been , had they been published a quarter of a century later . The number of readers has become greater , indeed , since that time , but it must not be forgotten that the standard of poetry has become higher also . We would give all praise to Percival for what he did . We would acknowledge his genius and the beauty of some of his verses . But we can not place him where he placed himself , nor can we wonder that his largest desires were ever unsatisfied . Had he estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have found a voice in song , and a joyous one too , even to the end of his life , and that the blessing of many happy years might have come to him , as it came to those other poets whose fame has descended to us from his own time , and some of whom are still enjoying their reward in old age , as they are conscious of the esteem and praises of their countrymen . The failure of his hopes in this loved and chosen sphere , and the necessity of finding the means of support led him , as we have seen , into other lines of working . But he seems to have carried his disappointed ambition with him everywhere , and , as the result of it , to have been dissatisfied with every employment which his friends-sometimes with infinite pains-secured for him . We hazard nothing in saying that , among the numerous things which he undertook , no one found him with a contented mind for more than a few months . Either the work itself became thoroughly irksome to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been agreed upon , became so small to his apprehension , in comparison with the lab'jr to be performed , // that he felt and openly intimated that his employer was over-reaching or defrauding him . Cases continually occurred where , on the presentation of his grievances , a new and more favorable pecuniary arrangement was made , but a short period only elapsed before he became as discontented as beibre . And almost universally the final result was , that he abandoned the work , if not in the most sudden manner , yet with the most deeply injured feeling . He saw no fault in himself at such times , but laid the blame wholly upon others , or upon the inconsiderate or ignorant world . A very striking instance , as exhibiting his character in this regard , is found in connection with his appointment to certain services under the War Department of the United States . As his friend , Prof William C. Fowler , in the year 1823 , was leaving New Haven for a short residence in Washington , Percival " requested him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general government . " After his arrival in Washington , Professor Fowler hmid a number of interviews with Mr. Calhoun , then Secretary of War , and made interest with him to such a de gree that a choice of three positions was offered to the poet ,  - -  a professorship of chemistry and kindred sciences in the Academy at West Point , the post of surgeon in the army , and some office-as a clerkship-at Washington . He preferred the position at West Point , became very earnest to secure it , endeavored to press Mr. Calhoun 's half-promise upon that gentleman 's attention , when political influences would have given the place to another , and finally fell into such a state of anxious suspense , that he was wholly unable to bear it , and actually made a journey to Washington , notwithstanding his extreme poverty , in order that he might learn his fate at the earliest moment . At length the nomination was made by Mr. Calhoun , though , as Professor Fowler remarks , " at the loss of political favor on his part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was about the first of March , 1824 . On the fifth of the following May , Percival wrote from West Point to his friend in* Washington-we quote his language almost verbatim-that he was altogether dissatisfied with his quarters ; that he was equally dissatisfied with his duties that his work was much more laborious than he had antici // pated , and in fact was mere drudgery ; that the employment was unhealthy ; that he hated chemistry , and had no notion of stifling himself with the stench and poison of a laboratory ; that he had been entirely deceived in regard to the place ; and that of all the disappointments of which his life had been full this was the worst . How long he had been in the new office we can not determine with absolute certainty , but it is evident that it was not more than two months , and he distinctly says that it was the very first evening of his entrance upon the quarters of which he speaks . A few days later , he discourses to the same friend in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been exposed to a loss of reputation ; and yet I believe you have had the very best intentions . I indulge no resentment . I regret that you were so hasty , that you were not better informed . I am sure , if you had been , we should at once have agreed that the surgeon 's place was far preferable , " &amp;c. , &amp;c. ,  - -  that is , in a sort of magnanimous mingling of forgiveness with reproach , hethrows the blame of brinoTho ' him into such an unpleasant position upon the one who had endeavored to render him a great service , which he had himself especially desired . The burden of his letters now was that he might be relieved from his professorship , and be transferred to the post of surgeon in the army , the second of the three positions suggested to him at the outset . Notwithstanding the delicacy of approaching Mr. Calhoun again with this new request , after he had exposed himself to ill-will by bestowing the West Point appointment as lie did , Professor Fowler did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being granted , Percival was stationed at Boston ,  --  the very station which he had wished for . Lie seems to have left the Military Academy in June . Six months afterward , in January , 1825. we find him writing again to the same friend , that his new place was disagreeable in itself ; and was one in which his compensation was reduced more than one-half without any chance of improvement , lie adds , " I have regretted , ever since I felt myself obliged to leave West Point , that you had not at first directed the patronage which was granted me last winter to the situation of a clerk at Washington , " - and , after some further remarks , he says , " Of course I can not be willing to continue here . " Professor Fow // icr once more interceded in his behalf , bringing his third proposition to the notice of the government , but , to use that zentieman 's own language , the matter was not followed up because he ( Percival ) became , just at this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story of his relations with the government . We may add , in a single word , that the first of these literary matters , to which Professor Fowler refers , was an abridgment of Lempriere 's Classical Dictionary , which he was to accomplish in ninety days But this , also , was given up , almost as soon as undertaken , and he began to support himself by contributions to various periodicals . His whole history is full of such instances of dissatisfaction and such changes of purpose ,  --  generally with a similar feeling that he had been either unintentionally deceived or intentionally cheated . Of course , under such circumstances , his poetry was not the only thing that failed . No life could be successful which proceeded on these principles . No efforts of others*could help it to success when the man himself threw away every opportunity that was offered to him from every side , and even every opportunity that he had himself urged his friends to secure in his behalf . This , however , was not the only obstacle which hindered his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career in this world is largely dependent on his relations to others . But Percival was as sensitive in his social relations as he was prone to find fault with his condition and his work . We venture to affirm that it was impossible for the most gentle and considerate and Christian person to be sure of living upon comfortable terms with him for a period of years . His was one of those suspicious and easily offended souls , which often interpret the most innocent and harmless remark as a designed slight to themselves . The past alone , therefore , could be safe to any of his acquaintance ; no one could imagine what the immediate future might bring to pass . The idea is believed to have prevailed in some quarters , and seems to have been in the poet 's own mind , that the citizens of New Haven were neglectful of him , and willingly excluded him from their society . But we see no evidence of this -- except so far as , by reason of his readiness to take offense where none was intended , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with farther attention . An instance in point has recently been brought to our notice . During the time-about the year 1840-when he was much interested in music , lie requested of one of the prominent citizens of New Haven the privilege of using his piano for the purpose of musical practice . The request was readily granted , and , accordingly , Percival appeared at this gentleman 's residence one evening not long afterward . With his habitual regardlessness of the lapse of t*ine , he continued playing upon the instrument until two o'clock in the morning . Of course , the repetition of such a thing could not be allowed , and the gentleman politely said to him , that his instrument was at his service on any occasion , whenever he might be inclined to make use of it ; but that , as he felt it necessary to close his house at ten o'clock at night , he hoped lie would make it convenient to use it at some earlier hour . Certainly this was not an unreason able request , and yet Percival was so incensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . We know not how such a man , after a residence in any city that was long enough to have given him the opportunity of coming into frequent intercourse with its inhabitants , could be anything besides a hermit ; and this not because his fellow-citizens turned away from his society , but because he , foolishly and without reason , turned away from theirs . Of his feeling in regard to the people of hartford , and his reception there in his early manhood , Mr. Ward speaks in the following paragraph : " He was invited by his classmate , the late Rev. Horace Hooker , to visit him at Hartford , and enter into the literary society of his acquaintances . He gladly embraced the opportunity , and prepared himself to talk elaborately on particular topics . But he was not a favorite . He was too shy and modest to adapt himself with readiness to different circles . He wanted confidence , and at social gatherings he talked at great length on single subjects , but in so low a tone that people could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ; it seemed to him that he was not appreciated , and he came away in disgust . How keenly he felt this disappointment may he seen from one of his early poems , entitled An Imprecation . His wounded sensitiveness grew morbid in the brightness of his imnaghi*ation . The following are the first and last stanzas : Ismir ! fare thee well forever ! From thy walls with joy I go , // Every tie I freely sever , Flying from thy den of woe . Ismir ! land of cursed deceivers , Where the sons of darkness dwell , Hope , the cherub 's base hereavers ,  - -  Hateful city ! fare thee well . " ' Surely this was not very encouraging to others elsewhere , who might open to him an enti ; ance into their own circle of society . The severe manner , also , in which he launches out , in " the Suicide , " upon his maternal uncle , the Reverend Seth Hart , gives similar evidence in regard to the question of his social adaptations and of his liability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-natured , common-place , Episcopal minister , at whose school on Long Island , Percival passed a year or two of his boyhood . He quite probably had a very moderate knowledge of the subjects which he professed to teach , and , perhaps , far less appreciation of the peculiar nature and needs of his imaginative and melancholy nephew . In a word , he was , quite probably , a second rate teacher . Moreover ,  --  though we have no indication of this in the biogra1 ) hy ,  --  - he may , possibly , have interfered at times with the youthful poet 's desires or even with his favorite studies . In addition to this , he is said to have enjoyed good living , and , finding that the timid and strange boy did not partake as largely of the provision set before him upon his table as he thought he ought to do , he heartily urged him to eat less sparingly ; and , on one occasion , he even offered him " a glass of spirit , " a thing which , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the custom in th3se days . " But by this act he offended him , " in his sense of perfect virtue for the whole of his past life , " beyond all forgiveness . One might naturally suppose that a person of a mind like Percival 's would have looked back , in after years , upon the time spent in this school as not very profitably employed , and upon the clerical uncle as no very helpful or useful guide in learning 's paths . We could not have blamed him had he done so . But when we find the good rector called , in this poem , an " arch moral murderer , " and bidden to " gorge and wallow in his priestly sty , " or to " crawl and die with his kindred reptiles , " we discover a // violence of passion in the mind of the writer , which easily explains how he may have fallen out of the notice or society of his fellow-citizens , with little fault on their part . We wonder rather , at the end of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his strange perverseness and to give him aid and encouragement through so many years , than that many left him to his solitude . He made it , in fact , impossible for others to be to him what he persistently demanded that they should be , and we feel compelled to say that he lived and died a hermit nmainly because he made one of himself . In one of his letters to his friend , Mr. Yvonnet , he seems to have had , for a moment , a vision of what it was that he needed . After discoursing for some time upon his failures and disappointments , he says ,  --  " l3ut I must stop these complaints and be a man . " This manly resolution ,  --  - this bold meeting the necessities and the trials of his condition , together with an energetic pressing on in the paths that were opened to him and a belief thai other men would deal with him , in general , as kindly and considerately as he would deal with them , would have changed his whole life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose , he complained of everything and of everybody ; he gave up every new employment almost as soon as he had entered upon it ; he lived in a ceaseless state of disgust ; and his life became a perpetual weeping over his hard fate . Now we would not , by any means , maintain that a man must succeed in life , in order to give evidence of superiority of mind or even of greatness . Many men of the finest character shrink from the roughness and conflict of the world , and fall into disappointment and obscurity , because destiny does not open to them any sphere for which they are fitted . But Percival did not fail , as it seems to us , on this account . Tie did not want opportunities for working , or capacity for doing the things that were presented to him to do . lie failed of his hopes in the poetic field because , as we have said , he overestimated himself ; and he failed everywhere else because he would not do the things , which he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , He had not , in any department of his life or work , so far as we are able to discover , anything of what we may call the " sink or swim , hive // or die , survive or perish " element ; and no man can be a great man , or even in the truest sense a man , in whose nature this element is wholly wanting . Percival 's inability was in his will and not in his powers . Indeed , after reading the story of his career , the conviction is forced upon ns , that if he had been a man of abundant wealth ,  --  - freed from all the diffienities and disconragements of poverty , and at liberty to follow ont his own tastes through his whole lifetinie ,  --  - he would never have accomplished any great results . He would never have been satisfied with the measure of approbation which the public bestowed upon him . He would have changed from one employment to another , and would never have carried his work , in any line , to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment of all who examine Mr. Ward 's biography of the poet with impartial minds . The world around him might have remained precisely as it was , and yet an abundant success would have been secured for him , if he had only been altered , within himself , into a reasonable and determined man . But had he continued as he was , we do not conceive it possible that the world around him could ever have been so far changed as to have made his life and fame satisfy the desires of his heart . He must necessarily have been an unhappy and unsuccessful man , because he was himself and could not escape himself . This was the simple great tact of his history . But , as we are obliged to make this declaration concerning him and to lay the charge of the failure at his own door , we think our judgment respecting his responsibility , or the degree in which he was to be blamed -- his character in this view of it-ought to be as lenient as possible . Percival , as it appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had a morbid sensitiveness and an overpowering melancholy which amounted to a sort of derangement , and these wholly ti were , in large measure if not , * , ic gift of nature . When , some twenty years after the event , Professor Fowler endeavored to apologize to Mr. Calhoun , in his friend 's behalf , for his singular course in respect to the appointments in the government service , to which allusion has been made , that distinguished gentleman replied , as if no apology were needed , " Oh , Dr. Percival was a poet , Dr. Percival was a poet . " It // was true . He was what Mr. Calhoun meant by a poet , or even more than he meant . He was a man whose character was to be judged I ) y no ordinary rules , for his soul was not like those of ordinary men -- -it was disordered , from his earliest life . His friends knew this , and they dealt with him accordingly , endnring all things and hoping all things . And those who become acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow the example of his friends , in some measure , if they would be both just and kindly to his memory . They can not , indeed , deny the facts , which are as clear as the sunlight . They can not reproach the age in which he lived as an unfeeling age , or the community among whom he established his residence for so many years as a heartless community . They can not respond , as we think , to the sentiment of the biographer , who says that his " reverence for his genius and attainments has increased with a riper knowledge of his character . " They can only feel that , while he was a perpetually complaining and weak-spirited man , who did not manfully rise to the emergencies of his condition , he was yet to be pardoned for what would have been a blameworthy , as well as grievous , weakness and fault in other men , because he was diseased in mind . And , feeling thus , they will speak more sorrowfully than sternly over his grave . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics and peculiarities of Dr. Percival , it should be noticed , first of all , that he was a man of wide-extended adaptations . This , indeed , has been incidentally referred to on the ) receding pages , and is manifest in every part of his history . That he had the poetic gift in no inconsiderable degree none will question . But he was equally successful , and almost as enthusiastic , in his pursuit of science or langnage as he was in th t of poetry . Every employment , among the many that were opened to him in the course of his career , found him , so far as the powers of his mind were concerned , ready to enter it and prepared for all that it demanded of labor or of research . The same man , who wrote the sweet verses of the poem called " Seneca Lake , " or the lines to which the biographer alludes in his preface as having first excited his interest in the poet , was the author of a Report on the Connecticut Survey , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that it is declared to be " one of the driest productions ever issued on geological science . " The same man , who astonished his examiners , by his proficiency in the science of medicine , in his early manhood , was , at one time , an eager student of twenty languages ; at another , was wholly engrossed in music , so that his soul seemed to find its highest delight in the charms of melody ; and at still another , was ready to think of entering the service of the Church as a preacher of the gospel . His poetry , thus , seems to have been but one of the many out-goings of his versatile mind - not the creation of a genius that was inspired by the Muses only ; and , with a child 's enthusiasm , he joyfully turned his thoughts to every new department of knowledge , as a new field for the play of his active powers . The danger to which every buch mind is exposed , is , of course , that of fallino ' into instability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is evident that Percival failed in this way-that he knew the child 's weariness and changeableness , as well as the child 's ardor at the outset ; and therefore he can scarcely be counted among the few great men of the world 's history , who have been especially distinguished for this all-embracing knowledge and all-penetrating zeal . A man of such wide-extended research was also , of necessity , a man of wide-extended information . But he had not only the love of investigation ; he had , in an equal degree , the power of remembering all that he had ever learned . Instances are recorded , in the volume before us , where he astonished his friends by the minute exactness of his knowledge in regard to subjects which he had not examined for years , and , when he presented his remarkably accurate Geological IReport to the Legislature of Connecticut , he wrote it hastily and almost entirely " from recollection , with but occasional reference to his materials . " Nor did he desire to keep all this varied information to himself . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to others , whenever they were desirous of receiving it . In fact , he was almost too ready to do so , for , on such occasions , being wholly absorbed in his subject and in his own thoughts , he lost sight of all things else . lie became utterly regardless of the passage of time , and poured forth an inces // sant stream of words until the person , who listened to him , was obliged to leave him alone . And , even then , he did not lose his hold upon his listener , but , at his next opportunity , seized upon him again , and , with some remark referring to the interrupted discourse , he commenced anew upon the old subject . Of course he was not , in any proper sense , a conversationist . Few great talkers are so . He was , rather , a lecturer to a single auditor ; and , though he was sometimes interesting and instructive , yet , like all lecturers in ordinary society , he was sometimes , also , wearisome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen and ladies in Hartford were not enchanted , in his early life , by his carefully-prepared and elaborate talk upon various topics ; or that the elder Professor Silliman , at one of the meetings of the Connecticut Academy of Sciences , when he had discoursed at interminable length , politely intimated to him , as he hesitated for a moment , that the members would be glad to have the conclusion of the subject at another time . Beyond all doubt , there was something in him , from the very beginning , of the character of the " Old Man of the Sea , " who troubled the pet Holmes so much in one of his waking dreams ; and men of this character can not expect to be universally attractive or universally courted . As a scholar , Dr. Percival seems to have been large-minded in his views ; a believer in progress and hopeful for the future disposed to penetrate into the deepest mysteries ; and willing to regard nothing as settled , so long as any shadow of uncertainty remained , or even the minutest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , in every direction , the moment he first entered it , and grew still wider and wider at every step of his course afterward . So far , even , did he carry this spirit of inquiry as to interfere very greatly with the attaimnent of those results , without which a scholar 's labors do the world comparatively little good . Could he have lived a hundred and fifty years , he might have finished something according to his own desires . But , unfortunately , he died at sixty , and the world gained almost nothing from him , because the time was not half long enough . He was fitted simply to pore over books in his own library , arid curiously to seek out the most curious things of literature and science . But , inas // April , Ward 's 3fe of Percival . much as he never , at any moment , to his own view knew anything , quite as he ought to know it , he never was ready to IJUI ) li5h his knowledge to mankind ; and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , does not know that he knew anything , except as it finds the fact recorded somewhere in the testimony of his friends . At the same time , he may have had a certain beneficial influence upon his contemporaries , by the mere example which he set before them , of " seif-abuegation and devotion to study , " as one of his friends claims for him ; and the words of that friend may be truethough we think not in his later years-that " his presence in the scholastic community where he lived was a perpetual incentive to industry and manliness , and that thousands yet live to thank him for lessons derived from the simple survey of his daily life . " If this be indeed so , as a scholar he did not live in vain . In regard to his feelings and sentiments toward the world , we agree with Professor Shepard , whose reminiscences of the poet are given in this volume , that he was not a misanthrope . He was a hermit , not because he hated or disliked his fellowmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association and approbation , and because the continual disappointment and poverty of many years made him shrink , more and more , from the public view . Gradually , of course , he came to love his retirement , and was , at last , unable to live outside of it . But , in early life , lie was even willing to enjoy the society of women ; he was susceptible to the charms of personal beauty , and would have married , had he not been disheartened by the failure of his efforts to win those whom he loved . He was not , as some men are , designed , through the very solitary tendencies of the natural character , to be a bachelor , and yet it would seem that no woman could have been designed to be his wife . But lie was not otherwise that of a kindly spirit , in general . lie bore no hatred or perpetual illwill toward individuals . He was a well-wisher of the race , and he loved both his home and his country . As we remember him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of curiosity to all-rarely showing himself in the public streets , and almost as unkiiown to the daily life of the world as if he // had been of an earlier age . Of his appearance and general bearing we can give no better account than that which Professor Shepard has presented , in his description of him . He says , " The impression made on me by his singular person and manners was vivid and indelible . Slender in form , rather above than under the middle height , he had a narrow chest , and a peculiar stoop , which was not in the back , but high up in the shoulders . his head , without being large , was fine . His eyes were of a dark hazel , and l ) ossessed uncommon expression . His nose , mouth , and chin were symmetrically , if not elegantly , formed , and came short of beauty only because of that meagreness which marked his whole person . His complexion , light without redness , inclined to sallow , and suggested a temperament somewhat bilious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , revealing to advantage that most striking feature of his countenance . Taken all together , his appearance was that of a weak man , of delicate constitution ,  --  an appearance hardly justified by the fact ; for he endured fatigue and privation with remarkable stanchness . " He adds , " Percival 's face , when he was silent , was full of calm , serious meditation ; when speaking , it lighted up with thought , and became noticeably expressive . He commonly talked in a mild , unimpassioned undertone , but just above a whisper , letting his voice sink with rather a pleasing cadence at the cornpletion of each sentence . Even when most animated , lie used no gesture except a movement of the first and second fingers of his right hand backward and forward across the palm of his left , meantime following their monotonous unrest with his eyes , and rarely meeting the gaze of his interlocutor . He would stand for hours , when talking , his right elbow on a mantelpiece , if there was one near , his fingers going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never once stirring from his position , he would not unfrequently protract his discourse till long past midnight . A n inexhaustible , undemonstrati ye , noiseless , passionless man , scarcely evident to you by physical qualities , and impressing you , for the most part , as a creature of pure intellect . " It remains only to speak of Dr. Percival 's rehi*ious charactem* . This was peculiarly hidden from the world . We find some expressions in his earlier poetry , which were disturbing // to many of his friends and of the people of his owi* day ; and , from occasional remarks in his letters , it would seem that he differed froni the doctrinal views and system held in the region where he lived . But we have no record of his later years , in this regard ; and , as we have seen , he died with prayer , but with the utterance of no words that might have borne witness respecting his spiritual life . We can only say that we believe the Divine work often goes on , gradually and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progress of many years , and that , while men see nothing but darkness and doubt , to the eye of God the light , though faint at first , becomes brighter and brighter until it fades into the perfect day . And we can not but hope that , amid all his searchings into the mysteries of science and learning , he may have found , in his lifetime , the unfolding of the mystery of Divine truth ,  --  and that out of all the trials and disappointments of his years on earth he may have passed , at the end , into the happiness and peace of those who are *satisfied forever . After so sorrowful a beginning it would be sad indeed , were there no joyful ending . We lay aside Mr. Ward 's volume with a mingled feeling of pleasure and regret that it has been published . A man like Percival , of so strange a history and of so much genius  --  a poet and a scholar-ought not to pass away , as we said at the beginning , without any record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembrance of men . And it is fitting-when his friends had followed him to the grave , and thus could speak of him no longer-that even a stranger should tell of what he did and what he was . But there is so much of weakness revealed iu the narrative , and our idea of the man is so pitiably lowered , as we discover the causes of his failure and the secrets of his inward being , that we are almost led to feel it would have been better to have left him in the solitude of his hermitage-reveali n g himself to in ankin d only through his poetry , and carrying with him even into the unseen world all other knowledge of himself It was a reverential hand , indeed , that lifted the veil , and a kindly heart that inspired the story . But we fear that it is the saddest thing that could have befallen the poet 's memory or his present fame , that the veil was lifted at all , or that the story was ever told to those who had not known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
