THE EMPEROR 'S EYE . 1850. - Information from a source that could not be discredited was conveyed to the underwriters of the barque Wandering Iris , that she had been struck by a gale of unprecedented severity , and had gone down with all her crew . She was a staunch , tight vessel , rating high , and had been trading for a number of years to the coasts of China and the islands of Java . She had left the port of Canton in good condition , with a full cargo , homeward-bound . The loss was deplorable in any event , but in one immeasurably so . Mr. Willard Lingenfelter , a prosperous , enterprising merchant in one of the seaport towns of the United States , was one of the chief owners of the Wandering Iris , and his son , Gallatin Lingenfelter , had gone out in her on this trip , partly for pleasure , but mostly that he might gain some experience , and also become acquainted with the correspondents of his father 's house in the East . He occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus reported , with the rest of the crew , as lost at sea , was a mere youth , not yet having reached his twentieth year ; but his was one of those natures that mentally and physically matures early . Perhaps , too , because Providence had vouchsafed but this one child to Mr. Willard Lingenfelter , as some sort of a compensation , the united excellencies of a whole troop of children were given him . He was handsome , brave , courteous , and generous , and it would not be out of place to say here , that the verdict of many an anxious mother and eke of many a willing daughter went farther , and saw in him the most fascinating young man in town . But , as yet , whether from his breeding or his nature , he had not seen , or , if he saw he did not correctly appreciate the many social wiles and traps that beset his path on all sides . Female society and companionship were pleasant , nay , delicious to him-as to what rosy-faced , blue-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , were the same-it mattered but little to him ; not yet had there beamed upon him that Presence that would make his heart flutter and his pulse beat high . Thus far in his life there had been room for but one controlling sentiment , that from his childhood had grown into a passion  --  a love of flowers , and delight in their cultivation . He had built himself a conservatory in the grounds that surrounded his father 's house , and there , the earliest in the morning and the latest at night , was he always to be found . It is said that , to be successful with flowers , one must truly love them . What a love , then , he must have brought to them , for he was more than successfuL The mute things , in his presence , seemed to be alive , unfolding their petals and exhaling their fragrance , as if thanking him for his tenderness and care . As may be expected , the loss of such a son fell heavy and sore upon Mr. Willard Lingenfelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society were gone ; for him , interest in his business vanished ; and thus mourning for their boy as only those mourn to whom is not left even the poor consolation of knowing that they have followed the dead body to its last resting-place , they retired from the city to a secluded place in the country , awaiting there the same Providence to relieve that had afflicted them . When it became evident that the Wandering Iris must go down , into her boats clambered the officers and crew . With Gallatin , there went , first , Manco Capac Winthrop , his servant , a hideouslooking but faithful negro , stalwart as an ox ; and , after him , ten of the common seamen . For six days , beatenabout by the winds and waves , they floundered helpless in the sea-for six days ill supplied with food , and with only such water as an opportune shower // of rain gave them , life seemed vanishing and death drawing near . At the end of the sixth day , they saw land , and , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but deep darkness settled down upon them before it had ceased to be but a blue mist on the far horizon . All night , however , by turns , they were at the oars , and when the gray of the morning came , exhausted and unable to do more , they found themselves beside an iron-bound coast , that looked quite as inaccessible and unfriendly as the sea itself . Far to the right and left the rocks rose before them , with no apparent break either way , but higher and higher , stonier and more relentless . Utterly dispirited , all but Gallatin and his servant Winthrop flung themselves upon the bottom of the boat , too weak and sick to care for what came next , even if it was death . Drifting with the tide , and propelled now and then by a feeble stroke of the oar such as these two were able to give , the boat moved slowly along the coast . The storm had entirely subsided , and there was only the soft ripple of the sea left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than two hours , thus listlessly drifting until the warm sun was seen approaching , did they skirt the unfriendly coast . Gallatin 's head and one of his arms hung over the side of the boat ; he was fast passing into unconsciousness . An exclamation from Winthrop aroused him , and he looked up . They had passed around a jutting rock , and in an instant thereafter were floating in a small bay that widened rapidly from its entrance into a harbor of no mean proportions . It was evident that they were not approaching an uninhabited land , for a well-kept lawn , sprinkled plentifully with flowers* reached down almost to the shore . Small trees like the mulberry were to be seen growing in frequent groups , and off in the distance , from amidst thick foliage , arose a lofty tower of goodly proportions . Gallatin 's companions would not arouse themselves from the lethargy into which they had fallen , even while listening to his description of their situation , and the apparent certainty of succor near at hand ; but still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the oar now and then , the boat drifted nearer and nearer to the land , and skirting a clump of trees that seemed to grow out of the water , so low down did the foliage commence , its keel grated upon the graveL They found themselves indeed in the land of the living . Not fifty feet from them , a group of women stood on the shore . All seemed impatiently assiduous to assist , in some manner , a young maiden , who , half unrobed , standing in their midst , was evidently preparing in that secluded nook for a sea bath . Her little dimpled feet were bare , and coquettishly put out , now one , then the other , into the water , and then drawn back with a shudder and a laugh as the waves came eagerly up to kiss the dusky skin . One held an umbrella at her back , to protect her from the rays of the sun that was just glancing fiery-red from the tops of the hills in the distance behind them ; three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another her shoes , and all were busy and chattering . For the space of a moment , like to Gallatin as it were the flash of a warm sunbeam in a cold , dark cell , he caught sight of the beautiful brown skin of the maiden , the dark hair in heavy masses falling far below her waist ; - he 4ook in the grace and ease and fawn-like gentleness of her movements , andthen the umbrella , changing its position , shut her out from his view . Wideopened black eyes , in several pairs , were turned upon him , at first with curiosity , then with alarm , and then each one dropping whatever she held in her hand , and crying out , " Chen-chi-cogis ! Chen-chi-cogis ! " they lIed affrighted as fast as the peculiar formation of their shoes would permit , they being set upon sticks two or three inches from the ground-leaving the maiden standing alone and unattended . She seemed , however , not the least abashed // 565 nor terrified . With a graceful toss of her head , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in her black eyes , almond-shaped and beautiful , there came more a look of wonder and admiration , with a slight , defiant dash , at what she might reasonably think was a very audacious proceeding . Painfully , Gallatin raised himself over the side of the boat , and waded towards her . He could not tell , but the thought passed through his mind , this may indeed be piratical Corea , where every man is a born Corsair ; but if all the women are like this one , and the men are at all like the women , no harm can befall me . He would have thrown himself at the feet of the young girl , as being the most natural way of exciting . her pity ; but even before he had left the water , a faintness seized him , from his long privation , that he could not resist nor overcome . He could only look toward her with a piteous glance from his earnest eyes , that even to a savage would have spoken volumes . And the look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of something akin to solicitude mingled with curiosity , ere his consciousness forsook him , and he sank into the water . When he revived  --  and it could not have been long after-he found that he had been dragged upon the land , and that his head was resting upon the maiden 's knee . Her soft hand , moistened , was going slowly over his temples and face , and as he opened his eyes , he met hers looking down upon him , eagerly and longingly . The long , black lashes , seemed fringes about a dark , limpid sea that was fathomless . But once , perhaps , in a man 's lifetime , does the feeling seize him , such as then for an instant possessed Gallatin . A certainty that this could not be the first time that he had ever looked into that lovely face ; that it and the beautiful form , its fitting counterpart , was a portion of his own existence , that , somehow or other , had become separated from him , and with which he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own being the mute volumes of eloquence that beamed from her eyes upon him ; his heart lightened in his bosom , as though a great weight had been lifted from it , and he was filled with a great satisfaction of living . All this , perhaps , because his body was weakened and his senses exhausted . It was not long before there came the distant noise of hurrying footsteps , harsh cries , sounding of conch-shells , then rude men jostled about on the shore  --  the face he had looked upon vanished , as dreams fly away amidst loud voices , his head was dropped heavy upon the ground , as though its support had been rudely pulled away , and all was dark to him again . When he again revived , hours had passed away , for the sun was high in the heavens . He saw that his companions , the crew of the boat , were seated about him , Winthrop the nearest of them all . Behind each one sat a soldier ; and at least two hundred other soldiers and officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his revival . He sought , but in vain , for the tender face and the gentle eyes full of sympathy , the last object upon which his eyes had rested ere they had closed . Presently , one brought him some water in a jug , and a small bowl of gruel , which he discovered was made of rice , and a gourd of liquor which they called " Saki . " Sparingly he ate and drank even of the meagre quantity which was offered to him , and in a few moments felt quite refreshed . As soon as he had finished eating , he was bound hand and foot in a curious manner , and , along with his companions , all bound in the same way , were dragged up from the seashore , andunderthe shadow of a mulberry tree passed the whole day . Gallatin had no difficulty in determining into what hands he had fallen . Peculiarities of dress , fashion of ornaments and weapons , style of arranging the hair and physiognomies , with all of which he had become more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then cruel and inaccessible Island of Japan , or Niphon ; or , as the Chinese call it , " Sun Sourcie. " // At nightfall , Gallatin and his companions , still bound , were placed in rude sorts of palanquins , or Kangos , and borne upon the shoulders of brawny men , they knew not whither . Irksomely and slowly , thus for a fortnight , did they proceed , tarrying in the shade of some grove during the day , moving on again when Right came . At the end of this time they came upon the outskirts of a great city , and rapidly threading its narrow streets , filled with a busy population , they were taken into a prison built of bamboo , which was reached by means of a drawbridge that was raised as soon as they crossed it . Many curious and entertaining things , that were continually happening to relieve , in a great measure , the monotony and tiresomeness of prison life , though not at all their anxiety as to their future , might be related of their three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official and another came to them . They were examined and cross-examined repeatedly , by means of an interpreter , whose vocabulary of English was limited to about fifty words . They were alternately feasted and starved , petted and abused . There arose within them a great contempt for their captors and their prison , and once they made their escape . But , quickly recaptured , their contempt was as quickly squelched . Two incidents only , however , need to l ) e dwelt upon . An old man , who appeared to have no especial business near them , or about the prison , but who was permitted to come and go as he pleased , even from their first coming there , would lounge in upon them , and gravely , with his hands behind his back , regard them in turn steadily , as if he considered them a new order of beings . Each time , just before he departed , he fumbled about his clothes , as if in search of something concealed in their multitudinous folds ; then , apparently in haste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At length his secret came out ; for , one day , he brought with him in his hand , several thin strips of wood , about three inches wide . After looking at them all very intently , he gave one to each of the prisoners . What was Gallatin 's surprise to see upon his strip a rude but nevertheless somewhat faithful likeness of the maiden he had seen on the seashore I To each one of his companions had also been given portraits of ladies . When the old gentleman came to depart , his strips of wood were offered to him , but he insisted that they should keep them ; and when asked why , he observed , with a wink that was at least intelligible , if nothing else was , that , when time hung heavy on their hands , they might console themselves by looking at them ; and he departed , rubbing his hands as though he considered that he had performed a good action , and was satisfied with himself . On his next visit , as well as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl whose portrait had been given him . " LaiLai-Lin , " was the answer . The liquid consonants and the vowels formed themselves pleasantly upon the lips of Gallatin , and he thought the name suitable for the creature . His next attempt was to discover who she was . This was attended with more difficulty ; for about all that he could understand of the answer was , " KuboSama , " and " Siogun , " that carried no more sense to his ears than the sound of an unpronounceable Welsh name . It was long after , that he knew that Lai-Lai-Lin was the only daughter of the favorite wife of the Kubo-Sama , or Emperor of Japan . But he kept the portrait . It came to the ears of the prisoners , at length-how , they could not tellthat a law of the Empire was to be enforced upon them , which directed that all foreigners found upon the island should be put to death . Such extreme exclusiveness had been the rule under the present Government , such a fear that foreign nations might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel edict , it was also commanded that natives retuming to Japan from an absence in other countries , no matter for what cause , should *tlso die . // As if to make the injustice still more glaring and complete , no notice was given to Gallatin and his companions of the time that they were to suffer the severe penalty of the law for being strangers in a strange land ; but one day , bound , they were let out into the yard of their prison , and , from the preparations , it was evident that their time had come . The sailors whispered among themselves to make a fight of it , and three or four did make a dash at the multitude of soldiers that stood about . But it was worse than useless-they were all only the more securely bound . It was clearly a day of executions , for , as Gallatin came out , he saw the mangled remains of a man carried past him , and there was another one sitting upon a low platform near by , who had chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attainted , and his family name not dishonored . He cut two horrid gashes in his breast , and a bloodyarmed fellow , struck off his head at a blow . Even assured of his own doom , now , Gallatin could not repress a shudder at the sickening spectacle . After one more similar exhibition of fearlessness as to death , the twelve Americans were formed in a row upon the same low platform , slippery with the recent blood of its victims . A sharp , shining sword was placed in front of each of them , and the executioner turned his back upon them , giving them thus to understand that it was their last and only privilege , if they chose to accept it , to nobly take their own lives ! As might be expected , twelve swords were almost simultaneously kicked from the platform , and fell ringing upon the ground ; each man among them straightened himself with a proud , upward look of fearlessness and disdain , a thought of home and of friends , and , like a flash of light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many a year , flashed through their minds , and they awaited a fate that no power seemed able to avert . The few moments that elapsed , in consequence , perhaps , of the apparent VOL . IIL-36 surprise caused by actions so uncommon on that platform , saved all their lives ; for the bloody-armed executioner was , coward-like , even then passing around behind them to perform his duty , when suddenly the blowing of a conch-shell , and the loud blast of a horn , put an end to further proceedings . Not knowing why they were led out , they were all , in the same ignorance , led back to their prison . A weary day or two followed , and then , one by one , his companions were taken away , leaving Gallatin alone . Ignorant as to their fate , the suspense as to his own growing momentarily more and more unbearable , nearly drove him mad . For a time , with wild pacing up and down his narrow prison-house , and then crouching in a corner in complete despair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary days and nights . Claims as to his citizenship of a country that protected , and , if wronged , bitterly avenged even the humblest man of them all , had no more effect upon the brown-skinned soldiers , nor as much , as the singing of " Hail Colum* bin , " which one day he indulged in to the full strength of his lungs , for ti*at brought grins to their faces . There was not even the relief of conversation for him ; for , unknowing the language of those about him , he might have been as well born deaf and dumb . It was on one of the darkest of dark nights , fully a month after their escape from death , that he himself was at length led forth . He argued well for his own safety , for he was unbound . A man on horseback was pointed out to him , and , by motions he was bidden to follow . He did , keeping close to the horse , until the first faint streak of day became visible . Taken then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with food , and remained all day alone . At night he was again led forth , and agaiw patiently followed the man on horse-. back . For four days and nights thus , until one morning , provided with the coarsest possible garments , he was led into the open air , and bidden to work-this day // with a rude hoe , digging at the weeds that seemed to fill e**tirely a large field . Though the following five years of Gallatin 's life may be passed over in a sentence , they seemed interminable to him . He was , he knew not where . But one thing told him he was upon the earth , and made him believe he was himself ; or had everhad an existence in another land  --  the heavens , with their stars . The same unchanged constellations , upon which his eyes had rested with wonder and awe when a youth , now rolled around him and shone down upon his forlorn condition . He , as many another slave has done , endeavored to escape , and reach the coast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting away from his master , he was retaken in less than ten hours , and subjected to indignities that were galling . It was , after all , those mute , inanimate objects upon which his early love had been showered , that now looked up and blessed him-that returned to him , with vast interest , the care and attention that he had lavished on them . It was the beautiful flowers , that , like fairies working invisibly in his behalf ; lifted him out of his misery and gave him his freedom . The farmer Kai-ra-tu , into whose hands he had fallen , was possessed of a small flower-garden , and , as aJI Japanese are , was passionately fond of flowers . At first allowed , Galintin was at length commanded to attend exdusively to these ; for his care and kindness soon had made the garden bloom with a never - before - known beauty . Beauty was cared for by Kai-ra-tu , for itself ; of course , but mainly because it brought him money . In this wise : Gallatin , exercising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was enabled to sell hosts of them on the streets , and thus add largely to Kai-ratn 's gains . Forth went the flowers all over the island , their fragrance and beauty telling a story for themseves ; but-what was more to the purposetelling The story also of Gallatin . Kaira-tu 's garden grew and increased until it swallowed up his whole farm ; he waxed fat , rich , and famous  --  a fame which the " flowers of Kai-ra-tu " enjoy , whether justly or not , to this day . Five years gave , then , these to Gallatin : a thorough knowledge of the Japanese language , and from perpetually working amongst the bright objects of his preference a remarkable beauty of face , that , even in his coarse dress , and the peculiar arrangement of his hair that he was forced to adopt , made him not the least object of admiration in his garden . There came a day when an immense retinue of some great person passed in front of Kai-ra-tu 's house , and Gallatin was bidden to stand upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slowly , with their mimic march , went past the pikemen , with clothes tucked up to their waist  --  the led-horses finely caparisoned , the umbrella and hat-carriers , the chest-bearers and footmen in livery , domestics and cloak-bearers , fellows carrying rich scimetars , pikes of state , fire-arms , and other weapons in lacquered wooden cases , as also quivers with bows and arrows . Finally , in the midst of the greatest crowd , came the norimon , or palanquin of the great person , borne upon the shoulders of eight stalwart fellows , with their brawny arms bare . Gallatin was too busy with his flowers , or , perhaps , too much accustomed to such displays , like as they were somewhat to the procession of a circus troupe in his own country , to see that , in answer to a slight cry of surprise and delight from the person in the norimon , it had stopped directly in front of his house , and that two particularly black eyes were bent with earnestness upon him . Whoever it was , failing to attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went toward a little green hut , like those built at short distances from each other all along the road , for the convenience of great persons . Arrived there , a messenger was dispatched in some haste to Gallatin , who proceeded unceremoniously , and with great rudeness , to pull him toward the green hut . // In a moment more , thus compelled , Gallatin , in no wise abashed nor dismayed , but with a beating heart , stood in the presence of Lai-Lai-Lin ! As much of a blush of pleasure as can suffuse the cheek of a dusky-skinned maiden flew into her face , and her eyes , by no means cast down , regarded him with longing satisfaction . Again did those feelings that seized him upon the seashore , till Gallatin 's bosom ; again did he look into the dreamy , wistful eyes before him ; but now he saw no pity , nor commiseration , nor solicitude-it was love he saw , instead . He could not fall , Japanese fashion , into the kitu , dropping upon his haunches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She gently touched him on the shoulder with her hand , as if acknowledging instinctively the salute ; but , light as was the touch , it made Gallatin tingle from crown to sole . He arose . Their conversation , more with eyes than lips , was brief . From her , the only spoken words . " From you come , then , these flowers I " was all she said . And Gallatin only bowed . Ascending once more her norimon , she went on her way ; but a beam of light and hope had crossed Gallatin 's pathway , and , beyond , he caught a glimpse of liberty and home . See , within five days from that time , not without many mutterings of discontent from Kai-ra-tu , which , however , he was careful should be only mutterings-see Gallatin transferred to the gardens of the Emperor of Japan , and his life begin anew . Five years had brought Lai-Lai-Lin from a child into the glory of her sixteenth year  --  a full woman , and as delicious an object for contemplation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a child , to one whom she had never seen , the Prince of Sinaro , the lord of the largest and wealthiest province on the island , still unmarried , she had not yet been compelled to disfigure her natural loveliness by the destruction of her eyebrows , the painting of her face , or the discoloring of her teeth-fashions that , happily for her sake , as well as for Gallatin 's , she was never to comply with . It would be difficult to say whether or not , for a time , the proximity of these two young people added to their happiness , for it may readily be imagined that it was not long that they were unacquainted with their mutual feelings . To her untutored , half-savage mind , any thing would have seemed proper that would have satisfied their love . To Gallatin , with better-cultivated sentiments , the mere transitory possession of to-day would not satisfy his deeper longings . It was his first passion , and , rude as may have been its object , it was , nevertheless , pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not lessen its effect when he came to know , from her lips , that it was by her interposition with her father that the lives of himself and his companions had been saved ; though she had been told that they had been sent from the island . Behind the low castles that made the imperial residences , there was rising ground ; this , beautified with curious and magnificent gardens and orchards , was Gallatin 's working-place . Farther back rose a higher hill , surmoimfed by a pleasant wood ; here were planted two curious kinds of plane trees , whose starry leaves , variegated with green , yellow , and red , were pleasing to the eye ; of which , as Gallatin learned , one kind was in full beauty in spring , the other toward autumn . Beyond this hill was the sea , and , at the foot of it , that quiet bay into which the boat of the Wandering Iris had drifted . In the midst of these ways of pleasantness and paths of peace , with a freedom that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the children of the nobility , especially in and about their own grounds and with their servants , Lai-Lai-Lin roamed often with Gallatin . Their intercourse was as pure and pleasant as is the intimacy of children . He tried to teach her ; and she , apt from her love for him , readily learned those varied things that seemed common to him , but passing // strange to her . He told her of all the wonderful appliances of modern civilization , showed her what a limited vision was hers , and what a small spot on the face of the earth was her little island . He spoke of his own countrylifted her soul from out its Eastern degradation , and created in her a pride in her sex , by speaking of the noble women there , and of their place by the side and in the hearts of men , not their playthings and slaves ; and he watched the gradual unfolding and ripening of her really beautiful heart and soul with something the same feeling , although with a far greater degree of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blooming and blossoming of some tender plant . A day , however , dreaded by both of them , was rapidly approaching  --  a day which must separate them forever . No power on earth could turn the Emperor from his design to consummate the marriage of his daughter to the Prince of Sinaro ; and Lai-Lai-Lin , never for one momeht thought to appeal to him to change his purpose . In fact , she was the same as married ; for her betrothal had been the preliminary and binding step . In all sincerity , then , she proposed one day to Gallatin that , in order to stop the hated nuptials , she was willing to do as another Princess , somewhat similarly situated , had done-eut off and shave her abundant hair ; one of the greatest of indignities ; or , if that would not do , cut off her nose also I What , then , would the Prince of Sinaro do ! Yes ; but what , then , would Gallatin himself do ? He had other ways and other hopes . Surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited upon his unoffending head , this last blessing of her love was not given him to make him the more unhappy . He did not despair , even humble and lowly as he was ; watched , suspected , and spied upon by all but her , he did not despair of being able to fly away to his own country , taking her with him ! And so he told her , adding the perhaps superfluous question , would she go ? - for are not the hearts of women the same the world over and in all ages ? Her answer came with a shudder of mingled gladness and fear , " Oh , if we only could ! ' * Then she lifted her eyes to his , and added , in her Eastern phraseology , " But where could we go where our marriage would be sanctioned ? What spot could we find on the earth , which you tell me is so large , that would shield me from my father 's anger ! The Emperor 's eye would follow us into the remotest and darkest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to slay you ! " Gallatin smiled at the notion , and soothed with his caresses the trembling creature at his side , who even at the bare idea of harm to him was so moved . Tie dreaded not at all the result , could he only escape ; - he little knew the Eastern persistence and patience that wait upon a desire for revenge or justice . It may be supposed that Gallatin had not been idle all of this time , and must have had some thread , even though it were slight indeed , upon which to hang a hope , else lie would never have mentioned it to Lai-Lai-Lin . He had discovered at least this much  --  the whereabouts of his companions of the Wandering Iris . His servant Winthrop was only a short distance from him . One of the sailors had died with a fever , and another one had committed suicide in a fit of depression . With all the rest he had established means of communication . Still was the dreaded day surely approaching , and even now had commenced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The robes , delicate-hued and varicolored and almost numberless , were making ; the pearls , tinted like a sea-shell , had been gathered and strung into a necklace ; the round , plain cake that , as man and wife , they were to eat , was already baked and drying ; the glass jar , to be drank from and then shattered , with all its beautiful tracery and inlaid work , the labor of years , was completed , and // even the great lantern , burning day and night at the gates of the palace , in evidence that a feast-day was at hand , had been lit . In great state from the Province of Sinaro had come the Prince 's mediator , to superintend and make ready for his master 's part in the ceremony . Even in the midst of all this , one great spark of hope was lit up in Gallatin 's bosom for a time , only to go out in the blackest darkness . Some foreign ships were in the harbor of the chief city , where they had lain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor himself . Lai-Lai-Lin herself had told hini this , and more , that they must be from his own country ! Wild with excited hopes , Gallatin tried every expedient that cunning could suggest , openly and secretly , to obtain communication with them . He failed at every turn . Go as he would , send as he might , or when , he was made conscious of a sleepless vigilance on the part of the Government to preserve perfectly that extreme exclusiveness that had always , except at rare intervals , marked this nation . He learned , one day , that the ships had departed , having obtained nothing save the survey of a limited portion of the coast and one of the small , inferior rivers , and permission to bury the dead body of a sailor . That day , standing in the midst of his gardens , with all the evidences of God 's goodness and love and of Nature 's overflowing beauty about him , he wrung his hands in despair , and , lifting up his voice , cursed the Power that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his cup of misery at one draught , as it were , it was something fearful to see his agony , when taking leave , as he thought , for the last time , of the only person in the world that had made his existence at all endurable ; for not for many more days now would their interviews have been possible . Pitiable in the extreme was the situation of this poor man . Life , at best , was but a burden . He had been living but upon his love and his hope ; and to see them both snatched away from him , and he utterly powerless to stay them , nearly upset the balance of his wellpoised mind . Happily for them both , he was enabled to contend successfully with a great desire to lay violent hands upon her and himself . Not long did this meeting continue , not long could it have continued and found them both alive ; such grief oftenest kills . A blind Jammabo Priest , or Bonze of the household , come of a distinguished race , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all instruments , the unhappy scene , came upon them unawares , tapped Gallatin gently on the shoulder , and beckoned Lai-Lai-Lin away . With one last , sad look upon the object of his adoration , Gallatin turned and ran at the height of his speed , not again looking back , down through the orchard and garden , over the hill and beyond , until he found himself on the same seashore where the boat of the Wandering Iris had landed him . He stopped , looking wistfully toward the far-off ocean . But a small patch of the restless , ever-changing sea was observable , set like a picture in a frame , between the high rocks that bounded the narrow entrance to the bay . Was it a thought to cast himself from the summit of those precipitous rocks into eternal oblivion , that tempted him to move rapidly along the shore and commence their ascent ; or did the rapid , but painful , motion afford him the relief he so much needed ; or , better than all , was it not that same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wickedly cursed , that was leading his footsteps l Be it what it may , it was not long before he stood upon the summit , looking out upon the vast expanse of ocean before him . Not death , nor oblivion , nor despair did he find there , but something it makes one 's blood tingle to tell . The surface of the sea , as far as the eye could reach , was glassy in its smoothness ; not the ripple of a wave was visible far and wide , and in the midst thereof , scarcely a mile from him , with // every sail set , as if awaiting the gentlest puff of air , lay a large vessel . But a piece of bunting clinging to the forepeak was what the , most startled Gallatin . It was the flag of his country ! So sudden and unlooked for , burst this blessed vision on his sight , that , for a moment , he gazed upon it like one fascinated . Then hot tears gushed to his eyes , a great sob rushed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he sank on his knees in an ecstacy of thankfulness . I- have seen missionaries , long absent in heathen lands from their country , cry like children , and hug the inanimate emblem of their land as though it was a thing of life . No one knows , unless he has experienced it , the thrill that trembles through one 's body at sight of the beautiful banner of his country , when it has long been absent from his gaze . Gallatin soon arose , and tore from his person his shirt. * Affixing it to a pole , he ran from point to point on the rocks , always keeping the vessel in sight , making frantic gestures and beckoning them to him . It was long before any sign of answer was macic  --  but one did finally come . A boat was lowered , and , with breathless expectation , he watched the rapid , eight-oared progress towards him . He directed their entrance into the bay , and with flying feet ran down to meet them . It was some time ere his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countrymen , the tones of their voices , and the sound of his native language , grown somewhat strange to him , would permit him to tell who he was . But when he did , his name was recognized . When the commander of the vesseland it happened to be the Commodore himself-came to know that there were nine other Aihericans confined in the island , he insisted that Gallatin should return with him to the chief city , and there , in the name of their country , demand their release . But Gallatin had other motives and other wishes and other ways for escape . A Japanese lady of high rank , and her servant , must accompany him , or he would not go at all . And , besides , their departure must be in the night , and attended with much care and secresy . The other Americans could be gathered together on that spot in thirty-six hours at the farthest . As the Commodore was displeased at the result of his mission , wishing to have something to show for it ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat romantic turn of mind ; assured , furthermore , that the ladf went of her own free will and accord , he agreed to lay off and on the island , out of sight of land for six-and-thirty hours , and then return and pick them all up . Failing in which , however , he would constantly thereafter apply to the Government for the release of his countrymen , and back up his application , if necessary , with shot and shell ! Woman-like , blindly giving her trust where she gives her love , Lai-Lai-Lin needed not the persuasion nor the fervent protestations of eternal faithfulness that Gallatin gave her , to induce her to follow him . One misgiving alone haunted her footsteps  --  the actions of the Emperor , her father , consequent upon her flight . To her reverent soul , his power seemed unlimited , almost God-like , stopping nowhere this side the grave . With this , and this alone , wei*hing upon her heart , she was yet willing to take the risk , and like many another woman before her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainty for what was at least unknown , asking in return only love . But the preparations for a wedding , in which she would take no part , did not cease . The coming and going of people , and the gathering together of the beautiful things of the land , still went on , until the third day before the event was to be celebrated , when it seemed as if the earth had met with some terrible shock . Lai-Lai-Lin was not to be found ! Never before , in the memory of the living , had there been such a tumult from one end to the other of the island . It was literally scoured for the fugitives ; for so successful had been their escape , // that it was not at first dreamed that they had left the Empire ! The anger of the Kubo-Sama , which was at first terrific , became , in time , deep grief ; for he loved his daughter , the child of his favorite wife . But the chagrin and disappointment of the Prince of Sinaro at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , it was uncontrollable . He raved about for days like one out of his senses , and burst in upon the privacy of the Kubo-Sama with the avowal that , unless his promised wife was given him within the month , he would stir up such a rebellion that the Empire would tremble to its foundations ! In the search that had been vigorously prosecuted through the island , it was discovered that a blind Jammabo , or Mountain Priest , one of the Bonzes of the royal household , could tell something of the matter . He confessed to having known of Lai-Lai-Lin 's frequent cofripanionship with the royal gardener  --  a foreigner ; but further he knew not . The sacred office of the Jammabo was all that saved his life for having kept silent about such a matter . Meetings of the chief nobles of the country were held to devise means to discover the whereabouts of Lai-LaiLin , to quiet the Prince of Sinaro , and to somewhat assuage the grief of the Kubo-Sama . At the end , there appeared to be but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nations of the earth ! It was excessively galling to the Kubo-Sama to go contrary to the policy that had been strictly enforced during his reign . No other motive could have existed powerful enough to induce him to so recognize the existing peoples of the earth as to send among them his ministers and nobles ; but this was a mattcr that most nearly affected the royal household , honor , and person , and all things must bend before it , even to the sacrifice of some pride . The offender must be discovered , and the offence atoned for . Affairs of this magnitude and importance take time , and it was nearly two years after Lai-Lai-Lin 's flight that two embassies were prepared , provided with the amplest authority , and departed from the island , one toward the East , the other toward the West . It is useless to dwell upon the doings of these embassies , matters of worldwide notoriety , or to more than allude to the fruitless termination of their search . It is well known that the chief persons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the court , almost immediately after their return . The Prince of Sinaro fomented the well-known rebellion , that , but for his death , would doubtless have proved successful in upsetting the rule of the Kubo-Sama ; foreigners were relentlessly driven from the island , some even massacred , and the land was shut up closer in its impenetrable shell than ever before . Once more the Jammabo priest , becoming no uninted with the growing sorrow and wearing *rief of his Emperor , as if to atone for his negligence in keeping silence when he should have spoken , came forth and suggested means more suitable than had yet been made use of for discovering the lost Princess . As are all successful tTmings , so was his - simple . It was this : That a company of jugglers or necromancers should visit every country on the face of the globe , and with care search out the missing one . Going everywhere amongst the people , seeing and being seen by every one , they would be far more likely to succeed than a grand embassy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught up the idea-it at least afforded him some relief ; and , considering his recent treatment of foreigners , such a project seemed more hopeful than any effort emanating directly from himself . The very best jugglers , balancers , and athletes were selected the whole Empire through , and were commanded to depart on their search-never to return if they were unsuccessful ; but , if successful , to bring with them not only LaiLai-Lin , but her captor , that he might be slain , and she thus the most punished . // This was to be their only objectfor gain they should not look ; for , if they were successful , the remuneration from their Emperor would be princely . The shrewdness of the Jammabo met with a reasonably rapid success . Commencing on the western shore of America , the jugglers , in time , made progress into the Eastern States . They found no difficulty in obtaining apt managers , who , while allowing them , in their privacy , every liberty , spread their fame far and wide-what was more , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their labors , while acquiring for themselves great fortunes . The necromancers , however , cared little for this . Their object was not gain , but to obey the command of their Emperor ; for which they saw , in the future , in their own land , wealth , power , and position . Patient in their search , with a curiosity that craved information in every spot , they left no stone unturned-only secretly , as they were bidden , doing their master 's order . Their success came to them , as it often comes , when the most unlooked-for , and whence least suspected . Crowds had greeted their remarkable performances everywhere ; and this one , on the memorable night , was no greater than those to which they had been accustomed . The usual concluding piece of their bill was the flight of one of the bright boys of the party , amidst waving of flags and the sudden appearing of lanterns and banners , on a rope , which was stretched from a trapeze near the proscenium to the far gallery in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sinewy lad climbed the bamboo rod to the dizzy height of the trapeze , and had swung himself over the rope , head downward , looking at the sea of faces upturned toward him . He had given forth his cheerful little cry that always was met with redoubled cheers , when , looking just below him , a face attracted his attention . He could not mistake it . Engraved , as it were , on all their hearts  --  a talisman  --  the spring of all their actions and hopes , even attired in a manner such as he had never before May , seen it , surely he could not be led astray . It must be the face of she whom they sought  --  the face of Lai-Lai-Lin ! A tremor of joy seized upon the poor little fellow ; his presence of mind , so much needed by him , and always heretofore completely under his command , deserted him , and , with a childish cry , he lost his hold upon the rope , and fell . The distance was considerable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What did he care ? What were his bruises now ? The wish of the Emperor had been obeyed , and his own future was assured . Gallatin , of course , had , in time , reached his own country , and sought out the new home of his parents . To them , his return was like the coming of a new life ; and though they expressed a willingness , even a desire , for his sake , to go out into the great world again , he would not listen to it , for their secluded life was exactly what he most desired , and what , to his wife , brought the greatest relief . Who she w s , and what her rank and station , she would never permit to be made known . For , though the dre d lest her father should seek her out , even in this far-away land , was in time almost entirely quieted , yet the coming of the embassy  --  a fact with which , of course , she could not help becoming acquainted-redoubled and intensified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held Gallatin closely to herself , confessing that she felt that her father 's eye was upon her , and his hand reaching out to separate them . She could never understand that strength of invisible law , that , in a free country , protects the person of all , and so could never patiently bear the absence of Gallatin from her side for any length of time . Otherwise than this , Gallatin and she were happy , if husband and wife ever were happy . They kept themselves very much secluded . Near neighbors knew of and had seen the sweet little dark-skinned , black-eyed woman , whom Gallatin called wife , and who experienced so much difficulty with her English ; but further than that she was PUTNAM 'S MAGAZINE . // a foreigner , which their senses told them , they knew not . Two boys had been born to them ; and , with all the means at their command that heart could wish , they asked for nothing more . The jugglers from her own country had excited the curiosity of Lai-LaiLin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had ventured out from her seclusion and gone to witness their familiar exhibition , little dreaming that here , last of all places in the world , she should finally meet the glance from her father 's eye , that she dreaded so much . In the momentary confusion consequent upon the falling of the lad , Gallatin and his wife escaped from the theatre , and went to their hotel . For the two or three days thereafter , previous to his return home , he felt , rather than saw , that he , as well as his wife , was being watched . He took what precautions he could to avert danger , for he felt that these swarthy foreigners must have had some stronger motives than usually govern show-people , to induce them to leave their country ; and what motive stronger than what most nearly concerned himself and wife ? Lie directed his servant Winthrop never for one moment to lose sight of his two children , who happened to be with him ; and , for himself ; he never left the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears , lest her own should be too vividly awakened . Once more in his own secluded home , his caution abated and his fears subsided . Again he little knew the patient , never-tiring vigilance that characterizes all the movements of those of Eastern origin . Weeks after , he was rudely awakened in the middle of the night , by feeling a hand upon his throat , and a rough wet cloth laid over his mouth . He could not cry out , but he put his hand upon the side of the bed where his wife was accustomed to lie . She was gone I There was a vigorous struggle for a moment , in the darkness , and then he felt himself bound in the same curious manner , as he had been years before on the seashore . A soft , fleecy substance was , for a moment , applied to his nostrils ; it exhaled a sickening , pungent odor ; and-well for his agony of mind at what all this betokened to his wife and children -- in a moment or two thereafter all his senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sharp sensation of having lain a long time in an uncomfortable position , he awoke . Impenetrable darkness still surrounded him , and he seemed to be confined in some narrow space ; indeed , slight movements that he was able to make , convinced him that he was closely surrounded on all sides , as if shut in a box . A chill crept over him , as he thought , Am I buried ! Lying a few moments , however , his eyes became accustomed to the situation , *and he discovered some specks of light coming down upon him from small holes just over his head . He felt sure that a man was sitting just over him , and talking ; for , ever and anon , he heard what he thought to be boot-heels clash up against the sides of his prison . He felt himself to be in rapid motion , too ; for , as his bewildered senses gradually became composed , he could hear the rattle and crash of wheels , and the monotonous click-click , as a rail was passed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and close scream of a steamwhistle , and the ringing of a bell . The sway of the car , the crash of the wheels ceased , and the train came to a standstill . Outside he could hear plainly that confused Babel of sounds that greets the arrival of a passenger-train at a busy station . Presently , the box he was in was seized and dragged out , dropping upon the ground with a crash that made every bone in his body grumble . " Here ! here ! What does this mean ? Those things go further on , " he heard one cry out . " Not if we know it ! " was the answer , with a laugh . " The Japs have got themselves in trouble . Our folks got a despatch to stop them and all their goods here . Guess they came away and forgot to pay their bills ! ' , So bound and gagged , it was very irksome for Gallatin to lay during the // long , weary hours of that day . Knowing now what his kidnapping meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his wife ; for he felt well assured that time alone was required to liberate him . His hunger and thirst , as the slow day grew on to its close , was what became more intolerable to him than his bonds . He saw , at length , the glimmer of the newly-lit lamps , and began to feel as if a lifetime had been passed in his cramped position . Had he been mistaken in supposing that his friends could , on the instant , identify his captors , and was he thus to be left to perish ? It was far into the evening when he felt and heard the thundering of a great train , as it dashed into the station , and halted . It was only a few moments thereafter , that the top of the box was carefully knocked off , and he saw standing over it his father and Winthrop . The latter carefully lifted him out and undid his bonds , saying , as he did so , " Dey ca n't do dat sort o ' ting in dis country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japs , shuah I " Gallatin looked around for a moment . He was surrounded by the ladders , poles , wicker baskets , and huge boxes , some of them differing in no wise from the one in which he had been confined , that go to make up the luggage of a travelling troupe of jugglers . Free and safe now , he could not help but feel how successful , even in taking him out of the country , these patient , shrewd strangers from a far land , with their grave , mysterious , taciturn ways , might have been , had not the quick wits of Winthrop suspected them . But his wife ! At mention of her , his father shook his head sorrowfully , and Winthrop shrugged his shoulders . Every box large enough for a cat to sleep in had already been opened . Stop ! They must know who and what she is , else why this attempt ? And knowing , they would not dare offer her any indignity . It was not without many denials , and the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were allowed to enter the apartments occupied by the Japanese . There , in the innermost room , jealously watched over by one of the troupe , who turned away with a downcast countenance at the unfavorable change in their affairs , Gallatin found his wife . He scarcely knew her , for she had been compelled to dress herself in the costume of her country , that she might be thought only an ordinary member of the company . It may be , believed , that the trembling , frightened creature , rushed with a glad cry into the arms of her husband , and covered him with caresses . They were never to be parted again . While this was going on , an animated conversation was being held by two of the Japanese in another corner of the apartment . One of them was evidently a personage of more than ordinary importance , for the other treated him with a deference that was humble in the extreme . By his direction , a beautifully lacquered wooden box was brought from an adjoining room , and with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though of only medium size , a calm dignity sat upon him , and he advanced with stately steps , slow , and with care . A glance at his sightless eyes told the reason why . Standing in front of them , in language which both Gallatin and Lai-Lai-Lin understood , he said , " The Kubo-Sama is lonely without Lai-Lai-Lin . He loves his daughter , and would have her return to him , even bringing with her theman she has married . All other means failing , I am directed to offer this . Her husband shall be received with honor , and his person shall be secure . Dignity and position will be given him . As a proof of which , and as a pledge of the Emperor 's word , he has bidden me give to you these scimetars , taken from his own imperial armory . " And , as he finished speaking , he opened the box , and gave into Gallatin 's hands two beautiful swords , richly carved and engraved . Such a pledge is more sacred than a bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to take his own life ! The natural longing and sometimes homesickness // of Lai-Lai-Lin , could be gratified with safety now , and should be , evea at the expense of some anxiety to Mr. Willard Lingenfelter and his wife . As she had given up all for Gallatin , it was no more than just that Gallatin should sacrifice something for her . Has that sacrifice , after all , been so great ? One by one are falling open the ports of Japan ; day by day is the exclusiveness of that nation vanishing , and her people are becoming citizens of the world , not dwellers in one island . And you will find , if you go there , that in all places , privileges and immunities granted to foreigners , stand foremost , as they should , the countrymen of Gallatin Lingenfelter. 1869. - 0*- THE DREAM OF LIFE . PIIWDAR , the great lyrist of antiquity , said , " Man is the dream of a shadow . " Partially inverting the expression , the old English poet , Sir John Davies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dream , nay , less than so , A shadow of a dream . A bard of the Orient , in imagery tinctured with that gorgeous theosophy for which the Sufi muse is memorable , exhorts his reader , Though human life be reason 's dream , Rouse thins ere morning break it , And offer up thy heart to Him , Who else unasked will take it . Montanus held that God alone is fully awake ; every other being is more or less asleep and dreaming . The gifted but unfortunate and wretched Poe depicts himself standing amidst the roar of a surf-tormented beach , holding in his hands a few golden grains of sand , which creep through his fingers into the sea . Weeping that he can not grasp them with a tinhter clasp , he cries , 0 God ! can I not save One from the pitiless wave ? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream ? The instances thus cited , of incidental allusion to human experience under the metaphor of a dream , will suffice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested to thoughtful persons . And surely , if our life *e a dream , he is wisest who best discerns its dreaminess . The most sober and elaborate treatment of the theme in this aspect , known to us , is in a forcible sermon by Bretschneider , called , " Is Life a Dream ? " He argues that it is , and that it is not . First , it is a dream because it is so deceptive and empty ; but not a dream , in that it has truth and earnest me aning . Secondly , it is a dream because its images vanish so easily from memory ; but not a dream , as its moral acts can never be obliterated . Thirdly , it is a dream because its weal and its woe so swiftly pass into forgetfulness ; but not a dream , its effects bearing fruit which no length of time can destroy . Fourthly , it is a dream because its fortunes change in such painted confusion ; but not a dream , connection and order being recognizable under it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dreaming , making it a more shallow and accidental affair than it really is , exaggerated the four points of dissimilarity . The resemblance of a dream to life is deeper and more comprehensive than he shows . A dream , too , has at bottom its truth and earnest , its causative laws , its lessons , its order , and often its permanent consequences . Still the sermon is full of a beauty and strength not unworthy of its gifted author . The miraculous harmony and perfection of the natural arrangements are exhibited quite as wonderfully as anywhere else , in the alternation of light and darkness , waking and sleeping . Consciousness is only possible by contrasts with unconsciousness . The only conceivable way in which any experi
