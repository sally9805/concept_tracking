txt Hon. HENRY MAY . of Baltimore , the most intelligent and able Peace Democrat in Congress , declared , in his elaborate speech of this week , that " The people of the South believe , and I believe , that there is established a fixed and unalterable antagonism between the sections where Slavery is and is not allowed , and that no future political union , as long as Slavery exists , can ever be maintained between them upon any basis whatever . " He therefore avowed himself prepared for a treaty with the Confederate Government , acknowledging its independence . We have no doubt that the belief here imputed to " the people of the South " actually prevails , and that this is the true reason why all the Unionism that exists in the regions recovered from the Confederacy has so completely identified itself with the emancipation policy . A considerable portion of the Northern people have not yet come up to this conviction . These still consider that the Union and Slavery are not incompatible . But there is no denying that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward a general recognition here at the North , likewise , that there can be " no future political Union , as long as Slavery exists . " This growing feeling has both theory and fact to favor it  --  the theory , that Slavery could have never caused disunion , unless it were essentially a disunion element ; and the fact , that all efforts to draw it back to Unionism , by concession , have failed utterly . We look upon it as certain , that unless some new and strange development occurs , the issue must , inevitably and at no distant period , take , before everybody whether they like it or not , this plain shape  --  Emancipation or Disunion ; and that there will be no Unionism left that is not in full accord with the President 's Proclamation . It is just this difficulty , of the irreconcilableness of Slavery , that so sorely exercises the Peaee Democrats generally . They dare not come out with HENRY MAY in positive favor of disunion ; they can not obtain from the rebel slaveholders anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not break with Slavery . The ground on which they stand between Emancipation and Disunion is daily crumbling beneath their feet ; still they stoutly protest that in no contingency will they take to either . What then is to become of them ? The true Union man , whatever he may think of emancipation , experiences no such dilemma . He is for the Union without alternative , and in all contingencies . He will not say , with WENDELL PHILLIPS , that if the Union endures Slavery , the Union must be abandoned ; nor with HENRY MAY , that if the Union is not endured by Slavery , the Union must be abandoned ; but that the Union must not be , and shall not be abandoned , whatever the disposition and whatver the lot of Slavery . He plants himself on that solid foothold , and is not to be moved from it one hair's-breadth by any regard to the institution , one way or the other . Away from that , his Unionism is at the mercy of every changeable policy of the Government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it his Unionism is ever secure and serene . Self-preservation is the first law of nature . The Creator has ordained it as truly in reference to nations as to individuals . However bad , or badly off , a nation or a man may be , to save the life is the first duty , as well as the first instinct . That secured , there is chance for time to mend . Without it comes ruin , absolute and hopeless . Let Slavery be as malignant an evil as its worst enemies say that it is , that is no reason why the nation should yield its life in order to destroy it . Let it be as great a good as its best friends claim it to be , that is no reason why the nation should yield its life in order to save it . The nation 's first duty is to itself  --  the.duty to live ; and whatever stands in the way of this , bad or good , small or great , has no title or character thatshould be taken into account an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war being for the restoration of the Union as it was . As a vague indication of what was desirable  --  a loose party watchword , . such ' as ' party ? watchwords generallyare  --  perhaps 14 Ivfts well enough : - But it imposed On ' noneiftit ' the shallowest t understanding . ; The thing ' is an absurdity . No form of human society has ever sustained such a shock as we have experienced , and-afterward returned to its original condition . History , we know , speaks of Restorations . But who is such an ignoramus as to suppose that the England of CHARLES Second was the England of CHARLES , First , or that the France of Louis Eighteenth was the France of Louts Sixteenth ? The reactionists may talk as much as they please about the Union as it was  --  they can not have it . ' They may have the same letter of the Constitution ? we trust they will  --  but it is as certain as that to-morrow will succeed to-day , that the principle , and spirit , and policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form and impress to the Union itself , can not hereafter be what they have been . We do not undertake to predict what they will be . In these great critical periods , " the unforeseen governs " always . It is enough for us to know that the stream which this rebellion , in its madness , has unlocked , can never , in the nature of things , be turned back ; it is enough for us to know this , without seeking to augur its ultimate destination . We repudiate , then , as deceptive , all such formulas as the Union as it was . A true Union man can not allow his Unionism to be subjected to any such qualification . He is for Union absolutely and unconditionally . He is for every thing necessary to secure Union , whether that thing agrees with the past or not . If , in the end , in order to consummate this , it shall be found necessary to change the Constitution itself  --  even that , by constitutional methods , he will not hesitate to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equality , and within its own sphere perfect inviolability , to any State in the Republic , yet , sooner than that ? the Republic shall be put to death , lhe will grind to the very dust , if need be , any State or any set of States , that persist in attempting it . What we say of States , we say of institutions too . If there be an institution , as HENRY MAY says there is. which , so long as it exists , makes future union impossible ; then that institution , we care not what it is , must cease to exist . Ile who says otherwise  --  he , who like MAY himself declares that the nation must die sooner than Slavery  --  has no right to be called a Union man . Whether he feels it or not , he is false to the core . We use plain language , because the crisis demands it . It is no time to be deferential to the little mousing , mole-blind intriguers of the hour . The Republic , with all its sanctions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me is against me , " said the Son of Man ; and by it He meant unqualified , unconditional , unhesitating , uncompromising devotion . He k new no other kind of fidelity . There is no acceptance of duty to Him with ifs and buts . Neither can there be in the most sacred of all earthly obligations  --  duty to country . The man who subordinates his patriotism to this or that object , who makes it dependent upon this or that condition  --  we care not in what rule he chooses to figure  --  is a renegade at heart . He belongs not to us , but to the enemy . If this nation is to be saved , it will be because the people , trampling down the politicians , come boldly up to this high mark of devotion . We have an unfaltering faith that , sooner or later , they will do it . A nation so young , so proud , so strong , so rational , bound to the past by such transcendent glory , associated with the present by such tireless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a nation which deems itself the last hope of the world , with all the redeeming agencies of the human race relying upon it for cooperation and guidance , with all the wonderful discoveries of art and all the mysterious powers of nature ready to do its bidding  --  gifted , in short , with every earthly thing that can make national existence a glory and a blessing  --  such a nation has a right to such supreme devotion ;  --  and unless Americans are a degenerate and cowardly race , have it they assuredly will .
