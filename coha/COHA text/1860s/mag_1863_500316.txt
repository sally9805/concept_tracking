THE CHICAGO ( ILLINOIS ) AND OTHER CANALS . CORK , Ireland , April 18 , 1863 . HON. IsAAC N. ARNOLD , M. C. , Chicago , IlllflOi8 . DEAR SIR : HERE I am in this beautiful city , in glorious old Ireland , so many of whose gallant sons have fallen in our defence , and thousands more of whom now fight the battles of our country . When I think of Shields , and Meagher , and Corcoran , and their brave associates , shedding their blood that the Union may live ; when I feel myself surrounded here by friends of my country , and realize how fervently all Ireland desires our success , my heart swells with gratitude for this noble race , and my prayers are , that Providence would crown them with every blessing . When you received my promise to attend as a delegate the Chicago Canal Convention , little was it then supposed by me , that duty would call me before that time to Europe . So much of my promise , however , as embraced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The project of an enlarged thorough-cut canal , uniting Chicago and the lakes with the Illinois river and Mississippi , has long attracted my attention . As a Senator of the United States , for many years , from a Southwestern State , then devoted to the Union , and elected to the Senate on that question , I have often passed near or over the contemplated route , always concluding , that this great work should be accomplished without delay . Every material interest of our whole country demands the construction of this canal , and the perpetuity of the Union is closely identified with its completion . It is for the nation 's benefit , and should be the nation 's work . It will give new outlets to the Mississippi , through the lakes , to the ocean , and neutralize that too exclusive attraction of Western commerce to the GuIf which has so often menaced the integrity of the Union . We must make the access from the Mississippi , through the lakes , to the ocean , as cheap , and easy , and eventually as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the flag of disunion will never float again over an acre of the soil , or a drop of all the waters of the mighty West . It is clear that , centuries ago , the lakes and Mississippi were united , through the Illinois and Wisconsin rivers , and we must remove the obstructions , now divorcing their waters , and restore their union , by thoroughcut canals . In a few years , the saving of transportation , in a single year , would more than pay the cost of the work . The increase of population , wealth , products , imports , exports , and revenue , which would follow the completion of this work , can scarcely now be estimated , and it should be accomplished if for no other reason , as a most profitable investment of capital for the benefit of the nation . But , great as is the importance of these enlarged canals , uniting the Illinois and Wisconsin rivers with the lakes , other great works , connecting with the East , are indispensable . But great as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erie , Champlain , Black River , Syracuse , and Oswego , Cayuga , Seneca , Chemung , and Elmira to the Pennsylvania State line , Rochester , and Alleghany River . Nearly all of these are 70 feet wide and 7 feet deep , and require only an enlargeme'nt of the locks , whilst a few require to be widened and deepened . The Chemung canal connects the Susquehauna with the Erie canal , at Montezuma , and the Chenango is nearly completed to the north branch of the Susquehanna at the Pennsylvania State line , whence , the Susquehanna canal passes through Wilkesbarre , Northumberland , Middleton , and Wrightsvllle , to Havre do I // Grace , in Maryland , on tide water , at the head of Chesapeake Bay . The great canal , from the southern boundary of N*w York , down the Susquehanna to tide water , is now five feet deep , and from 40 to 50 feet wide , and can all be readily enlarged to the dimensions of the Erie canal . With these works thus enlarged , the connection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the Delaware and Raritan canal with the Delaware , and by the Delaware and Chesapeake canal with the Chesapeake Bay , but also by the direct route , down the Susquehanna , to Baltimore , Norfolk , and Albemarle Sound . Is not this truly national , and is it not equally beneficial , to the East and the West , to open all these routes for large steamers ? The system , however , would not be complete , without uniting Champlain with the St. Lawrence , Ontario with Erie , and Huron and Michigan with Superior . The enlarged works should also be provided through Wisconsin , Indiana , Ohio , and we stern Pennsylvania , to the lakes , to the extent that these canals can be made of the dimensions of the Erie , and supplied with water . Nor should we forget the widening of the canal at Louisville , the removal of obstructions in the St. Clair flats and upper Mississippi , and the deepening of the mouth of this great river . The construction of these works would be costly , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our wealth and revenue , they would pay the nation tenfold . As the main object of these works is cheap transportation , the tolls should be diminished , as the works were completed , to the full extent that freight could be carried more cheaply in large boats , and provision should be made for an adequate sinking fund , so as gradually to liquidate the whole cost , and then to collect no more toll than would pay to keep the works in repair . Such is the true interest of the States and of the nation . If New York could collect a toll for navigating the Hudson , it would be against her interest , for the diminution and diversion of business , and tax on labor and products , would far exceed the net proceeds of any such toll . The same principle will apply to these canals . As some of them , unfortunately , are owned by private companies , adequate provision should be made , to prevent these aids from being perverted to purposes of individual speculation . The Erie and Ontario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Superior , Huron , and Michigan canal ( less than a mile long ) , at the falls of St. Mary , should be made ship canals , much larger than those of Canada . The cost of all these works may exceed $100,000,000 , but the admirable financial system of Mr. Secretary Chase , would soon supply abundant means for their construction . Already the price of gold has fallen largely , our legal tenders are being funded , by millions , in the Secretary 's favorite 5-20 sixes , and we shall soon have , under his system , a sound , uniform national currency , binding every State and citizen to the Union , and fraught ultimately with advantages to the nation , equal to the whole expense of the war . In passing down the Susquehanna canal , at Middletown , commences the canal which , by way of Reading and the Schuylkill , connects Philadelphia with the Susquehanna and the lakes . Most of this work is already six feet deep , but the whole route , if practicable , should be enlarged to the dimensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Museum some documents showing the original project ( absurdly abandoned ) for a large canal from the Schuylkill to the Susquehanna . A slight change will restore this work , and give to Philadelphia a complete seven-foot canal , via the Schuylkill and Susquehanna to the lakes , as short as from New York , and through a richer country , both mineral // and agricultural . It appears that Washington and Franklin both favored this route . 1 . Gunboats , and large commercial steamers , could then pass , without interruption , through all the lakes , to the St. Lawrence , the Hudson , the D elaware , Susquehanna , Chesapeake Bay , Albemarle Sound , the Ohio , and Mississippi . 2 . In case of war , foreign or domestic , the saving to the Government in prices of articles they must buy , and in transportation of men , munitions of war , supplies , and coal , would be enormous . It is believed that the excess of cost in prices and transportation during this rebellion , occasioned by the want of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor is this the only loss , but victories no doubt have often been turned into defeats , for the want of proper facilities for the movement of gunboats , of supplies , and munitions , and the rapid concentration of troops and re*nforcements. 3 . The ability to obtain supplies , and coals , and vessels , from so many points , and especially gunboats , where the coal , iron , and fluxes are in justaposition , would hasten construction , and cheapen prices to the Government . The enormous naval and military power , gained by such works , would tend greatly to prevent wars , foreign or domestic ; or , if they did occur , would enable us to conduct them with more economy and success . It is said such vessels can be built on the lakes , and so they can , for lake defence , but they would be liable to capture or destruction there , before completed , by the enemy , and iron vessels , and irondads , could not be constructed so cheaply . where there is neither coal nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alleghany , and Ohio , where these great articles abound , and can be used on the spot , with so much economy . It must be remembered , also , that , if these iron steamers and iron-clads are constructed on the seaboard or the lakes , still , the iron and coal for building them , and the coal for running them , could be supplied much more cheaply , if these enlarged canals were finished . Besides , events are now occurring , and may again , in our history , requiring the immediate construction of hundreds of iron vessels , rams , irondads , and mortar boats , calling for all the works on the seaboard , the lakes , the Western rivers , and enlarged canals , to furnish , in time , the requisite number . Rapid concentration of forces , naval and military , and prompt movements , are among the greatest elements of success in war . It will be conceded , that the ability to run gunboats , irondads , rams , and m ortr boats , through all our lakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to connect from both , through such enlarged canals , with the seaboard , and the Gulf ; would vastly increase our naval and military power . Is it not clear , then , that if such a movement , with such resources and communications , had been made , in sufficient force , the first year of the war , so as to seize , or effectully blockade , all the rebel ports , to occupy , by an upward and downward movement , the whole Mississippi and all its tributaries , isolating and cutting rebeldom in two , and thus preventing supplies from Texas , Louisiana , and Arkansas , that the contest must have been closed long ere this , and thus saved five or six times the cost of these works . As indicating the consequence of our occupation and command of the Mississippi and the Gulf , let us see its effect on the supply of the single indispensable article of 6eef to the rebel army and people . By the census of 1860 , table 36 , the number of cattle that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2,733,267 ; in Louisiana , 329,855 ; and in Arkansas , 318,355 ; - in those parts of the rebel States east of the Mississippi , not commanded by our troops and gunboats , 2,558,000 , and in the parts 94 // of those States thus commanded by us , 1,087,000 . Thus it will be seen , that the cattle in Texas alone ( whence the rebels , heretofore , have derived their main supplies ) , raised on their boundless prairies , and rich perennial grass , have largely exceeded all the cattle in those parts of the rebel States east of the Mississippi , commanded by them . But that commanded by us , of the Mississippi and its tributaries , and the GuIg as is now the case , cuts off the above supplies from Texas , Louisiana , Arkansas , west and north Mississippi , north Alabama , and west and middle Tennessee . Tlence the cries pf starvation from the South ; hence , mainly , the rise there in the price of beef , from a few cents to a dollar a pound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now are by us , so as to prevent any Western supplies of beef , and the desolation and inundation which have swept over so much of the rest of rebeldom since 1860 , their army and people can not be supplied with beef throughout this year . Nor would running the blockade help them in this respect , for Europe has no supplies of beef to spare , requiring large amounts from us every year . The revolt , then , is doomed this year by starvation , if not , as we believe , by victories . Indeed , I imagine , if our Secretaries of War and of the Navy were called on for official reports , they could clearly show , that with ample appropriations in July , 1861 , and all these works tken completed , they could have crushed the revolt in the fall of 1861 and winter of 1862 . All , then , that has been expended since of blood and treasure , and . all the risks to which the Union may have been exposed , result from the want of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with irresistible force , to the heart and judgment of every true American statesman and patriot . Great , however , as are the advantages in war to be derived from the construction of these works , it is still more in peace , and as arteries of trade , that the benefit would be greatest . If iron steamers are to confrol the commerce of the world , the cheap construction and running of such vessels may decide this great question in our favor . Now , whether these steamers are to be built on the seaboard or interior , the coal , and iron , and timber , with which to make them , and the coal and supplies with which to run them , could be furnished much more cheaply by these enlarged canals . And even if the vessels be of timber , the engines , boilers , anchors , &amp;c. , must be of iron , and they must . be run with coal , all which would be furnished cheaper at our lakes and seaboard , by these enlarged canals . Nor is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or coal to run them , that these works would be important , but the cheapening of transporation of coal , iron , timber , and supplies would be greatly beneficial in all industrial pursuits . It is , however , in cheapening the transportation of our immense agricultural products to the East , South , seaboard , and the return cargoes , that these works would confer the greatest benefits . The value of the freight transported on these canals , last year , was over $500,000,000 ; but , when all should be enlarged , as herein proposed , the value of their freight , in a few years , would exceed 5EVERAL BILLIONS OF DOLLARS . They would draw from a vastly extended area , from augmented population and products , and with greater celerity and economy of movements , from the increased distances that freight could be carried , and additional articles . With these improvements , millions of bales of cotton would be carried annually on these enlarged canals . All of Missouri , Iowa , Kentucky , Minnesota , Kansas , and the Northwestern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large portions of Tennessee , Alabama , Arkansas , Louisiana , and even of Texas , on the Red river , would be added to the region from which supplies would be sent , and return cargoes proceed by // these works . Our exports abroad would soon reach a BILLION of dollars , of which at least one third would consist of breadstuffs and provisions . Corn was consumed , last year , in some of the Western States , as fuel , in consequence of high freights . But this could never recur with these enlarged canals . Indeed , the products to be carried on these canals would include the whole valley of the lakes , the Ohio , Mississippi , and Missouri ; and many articles , thus reaching there , thence be carried , on our great imperial railway , to the Pacific , bringing back return cargoes for the same routes . Breadstuffs and provisions and cotton would be carried more cheaply through these canals to the manufacturing States , and their fabrics return , the same way , in vastly augmented amounts , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , breadstuffs and provisions , reaching $109 ,  - -  676,8Th in value , were exported abroad , from the loyal States alone ; but , with these enlarged canals , the amount could be more than tripled , the augmented exports bringing in increased imports , and vast additional revenue . Can we not realize the certainty of these great results , and have we not the energy and patriotism to insure their accomplishment ? Assuredly we have . Nor is it only our revenue from duties that would be increased to an extent sufficient of itself , in a few years , to pay the principal and interest of the debt incurred in the construction of these works , but our internal revenue , also , would be prodigiously aug*mented . The census of 1860 shows our increase of wealth , from 1850 to 1860 , to have been 126.45 per cent . ( Table 35 ) . Now , if we would increase our wealth only one tenth , in the next ten years , by the construction of these works , then ( our wealth being now $16,159,616,068 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of $36,593,450,585 , more than sixteen hundred millions *ireceter , or more than ten time8 the cost of these works ; and , in 1880 , instead of $82 ,  - -  865,868,849 , over three billions six hundred millions more , or more than twenty times the cost of those works . The same percentage , then , of our present internal tax , on this augmented wealth , estimated at only one per cent. , would be $16,000,000 ( annually ) in 1870 , and $36,000,000 ( annually ) in 1880 , and constantly increasing . Add this to the great increase of our revenue from duties , as the result of these works , and the addition would not only soon liquidate their cost , but yield a sum which , in a few years , would pay the principal and interest of our public debt . With such works , we would certainly soon be the first military , naval , and commercial power of the world . The West , with these reduced freights , would secure immense additional markets for her products , and the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cargoes , to the West . A new and great impulse would be given to the coal and iron interest . If the Delaware , Susquehanna , and their tributaries , and the Ohio and its tributaries , especially the Youghiogheny , Monongahela , and Alleghany had the benefit of low freight , afforded by these canals , they could supply not only the seaboard at reduced rates , but also central and western New York , the Canadas , and the whole lake region , with coal and iron . Indeed , the increased demand , thus caused for these great articles , would soon bring our make of iron , and consumption of coal , up to that of Engand , and ultimately much larger . Freight is a much greater element in the cost of coal and iron , than of agricultural products , but the increased exchange would be mutually advantageous . With this system completed , the Mississippi might communicate by large steamers with all the lakes , and eastward , by the enlarged canals , to Chicago or Green Bay , or pass up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 97 burg or Cincinnati to Toledo , or by Portsmouth or Bridgeport to Cleveland , or by Bridgeport to Erie city , or by Pittsburg , up the Alleghany , to Glean and Rochester , on the Erie canal , or by ship canal , from Buffalo to Ontario , thence , by the St. Lawrence , to Lake Champlain and the Hudson , or by Oswego to Syracuse , or by the Erie canal from Buffalo to the Hudson , or by the Chenango or Chemung route , down the Susquehanna , to Philadelphia , or Baltimore , or down the Chesapeake to NOrfolk , and on through Albemarle Sound south . Or , going from the East , or South , westward by these routes , the steamer could proceed west , and up the Missouri , to the points where they would meet the great railway leading to the Pacific . Indeed , if we do our duty now , the next generation may carry similar canals from the head of Lake Superior to the Mississippi and Missouri , and up the Kansas or Plat1*e to the gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Missouri , to the base of the Rocky mountains , with railroad connection thence to the mouth of the Oregon and Puget 's sound . There would be connected with this system , the lakes , and all the Eastern waters , the Ohio and all its tributaries , including the Youghiogheny , Monongahela , Alleghany , Kanawa , Guyandotte , Big Sandy , Muskingum , Scioto , Miami , Wabash , Licking , Kentucky , Green river , Barren , Cmiiberland , and Tennessee , the upper Mississippi and its tributaries , especially the Illinois and Wisconsin , the Desmoines and St. Peter 's , the lower Mississippi and all its vast tributaries , the St. Francis , White river , Arkansas , Red river , and Yazoo . These are no dreams of an enthusiast , but advancing realities , if now , now we will only do our duty in crushing this rebellion , and exorcise the foul fiend of slavery , that called it into being . We may best judge of what we may do in the , future , by what we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VOL. iv. -7 of canals ( including slackwater ) , at a cost of $132,000,000 . We have constructed ( including city roads ) 31,898 miles of railroad , at a cost of $1,203 ,  - -  285,569 , making an aggregate , for railroads and canals , of $1,335,285,569 . Now , one tenth of this sum will probably make all the works proposed now to be executed , for they are all only enlargements of existing canals , except the ship canal round the falls of Niagara , and a similar canal from Lake Champlain to the St. Lawrence , a work of vast importance , but that can only be accomplished with the aid and consent of Canada , and is not now estimated . These improvements would be truly national , especially as provision would be made for deepening the mouth of the Mississippi . We propose to make or enlarge no mere local works , but only such as connect the Atlantic and the Gulf with the lakes , Ohio , Mississippi , Missouri , Hudson , Delaware , Susquehanna , Chesapeake bay , and Albemarle sound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or State expenditures . The canals in New York , constituting so large a portion of the system , have already ( mostly ) the requisite width and depth , and only need an enlargement of the locks . The great Delaware and Raritan canal , connecting New York with Philadelphia , has a depth of 8 feet , and the Delaware and Chesapeake , uniting them with the Susquehanna and the lakes , Baltimore , Norfolk , and Albemarle sound , has a depth of ten feet . No doubt the enlightened proprietors of the Delaware and Raritan canal would , on fair terms to themselves and the Government , enlarge that canal ( if practicable ) to the depth of the Delaware and Chesapeake , which would be of incalculable benefit to the whole country , but especially to New York , Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Norfolk . The Pennsylvania canals proposed to be enlarged are the Schuylklll , leading // Th , e Chicago and other Canals . by the Union from Philadelphia , through Reading to Middleton on the Susquehanna , and thence up that river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 70 miles to Reading , has a depth of 6 feet , and from Reading to Middleton , 4 feet . The Susquehanna canal , from Havre de Grace , Maryland , at the head of tidewater , and the Chesapeake bay to the New York line , and system , has a uniform depth of 5 feet , and is about 300 miles long . This canal , leading through Maryland and Pennsylvania along the Susquehanna , can readily and cheaply be enlarged to the dimensions of the Erie canal , and will then furnish Norfolk , Baltimore , and Philadelphia a direct route to the lakes by the enlarged system , fully equal to that of New York . Western Pennsylvania and Pittsburg would have the route , by the enlarged system , up the Alleghany and Olean to Rochester on the Erie canal , and thence to the Hudson or the lakes , and from Bridgeport to Cleveland or Erie city . Ohio would have the benefit of the routes ( enlarged ) to and from Cleveland to Bridgeport or Portsmouth on the Ohio* and to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to Cincinnati . These canals are 40 feet wide and 4 feet deep . Indiana would have the benefit of the Wabash and Erie canal to Evansville , on the Ohio , from Toledo , and to and from the same point to the mouth of the Miami at Lawrenceburg and to Cincinnati , and would also largely participate in the benefit of the Chicago and Illinois canal of the whole system . Wisconsin would have the benefit of all these canals , but especially of that connecting the Wisconsin river with Green Bay , and the rest of the lakes with Lake Superior . Illinois would have the benefit of the Wabash and Erie , the Chicago and Illinois , and of the entire system . Indeed , with a thorough-cut canal from the Illinois river to Chicago , fact will outstrip fancy as regards the progress of that great city . And here a strong argument in favor of the whole of these works is presented to every true American , by the fact that the vast and increasing heavy and bulky products of the West demand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Hudson , the Delaware , and Susquehanna , she will have them by the Canada canals , and the St. Lawrence to its outlet in the Gulf . Minnesota would have the benefit of the improvement of the upper Mississippi , and of the canals uniting the Wisconsin with Green Bay , and Superior with the other lakes . Iowa , Missouri , Kansas , an the whole Western Territories would have the benefit of the improvement of the Mississippi , of the routes by Chicago , Green Bay , the Ohio , and the whole system . The glorious new free State of Western Virginia would have the benefit of all the routes up and down the Ohio and Mississippi to the lakes , the Hudson , Delaware , Susquehanna , and the Gulf . So would Kentucky , and the enlargement of the Louisville canal would be within her own limits . When we reflect that Kentucky borders for nearly a thousand miles on the Ohio and Mississippi , with her streams , the Big Sandy , Licking , Kentucky , Green river , and Barren ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cumberland , and Tennessee , all tributaries of the Ohio , the benefits to her would be prodigious . The interest of the States of Tennessee , Arkansas , Mississippi , Louisiana , North Alabama , on the Tennessee river , and Texas , on the Red river , would be greatly promoted . They would all have improved routes to and from the mouth of the Mississippi , and to and from the Ohio , the lakes , and the Atlantic . Eastern Virginia and North Carolina would derive great advantages by the enlarged routes , connecting Albemarle sound and the Chesapeake with New York , Philadelphia , the Hudson , the Delaware , the Susquehanna , and the lakes . Delaware and Maryland could avail themselves most beneficially of all these routes , and Baltimore would derive immense 98 I // advantages from the enlarged route by the Susquehanna to the lakes , having then as good a route there as New York , and the difference of distance being only 30 miles . New Jersey , by her route from the Delaware and Raritan to the Hudson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and New York , and by the enlarged system to the lakes , would find all her interests greatly advanced , and the business on her canals and railroads vastly increased . Michigan , with a larger lake shore than any other State , fronting on Lakes Superior , Michigan , Huron , St. Clair , the connecting straits and rivers , and Lake Erie , would derive immense advantages . By her immediate connection with the whole New York and Eastern system , and by Toledo , Cleveland or Erie city , to the Ohio river , and by the Chicago or Green Bay routes to the Mississippi and the Gulf her vast agricultural products in the peninsula would find new and augmented markets ; while , with the ship canal to Lake Superior , her magnificent iron and copper mines on that immense inland sea , as well as those in Wisconsin , and the splendid pineries and fisheries of ' both States , would receive an immense development . Pennsylvania has no large available through route now from the Delaware and Susquehanna to the lakes , nor from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well from the East as from the West . This would give to her coal and iron , her vast agricultural products , her immense manufactures , and all her industrial pursuits a new impulse , while her two great cities , Philadelphia and Pittsburg , would be greatly advanced in wealth and population . When we reflect that coal and iron have mainly contributed to make England what she is , and how superior , in this respect , are the natural advantages of Pennsylvania with her bituminous and anthracite coal and iron and fluxes in juxtaposition , with a continent surrounding her to furnish a market , with her cen tral location , fronting on the deep tidewater of the Delaware , and upon the lakes and the Ohio , witb its two great confluents at Pittsburg , the Alleghany and Monongahela , we can not fully realize the immense advantages which she would derive from these enlarged communications . But what of New York ? With all her routes , as well as that of the Erie canal , enlarged as proposed , with her mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake Champlain to Superior , south by the Delaware and Susquehanna , west by the Alleghany , Ohio , Missouri , and Mississippi , and her great city with an unrivalled location , what an imperia* destiny lies before her , with the Union preserved ? Oh ! if she would only fully realize these great truths , and spurn from her embrace the wretc*hed traitors who , while falsely professing peace , mean the degradation of the North and the dissolution of this Union , who can assign limits to her wealth and commerce ? Let us now examine the relatkrns of New England to these proposed works . Vermont , upon Lake Champlain , by the enlarged system , connecting her with the Hudson , the St. Lawrence , and the lakes , would be greatly advanced in wealth and population . But with cheapened transportation to and from Lake Champlain or the Hudson , not only Vermont , but all New England , in receiving her coal and iron , and her supplies from the West , and in sending them her manufactures , will enjoy great advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , also , New England , on the Sound , and , in fact , the whole seaboard and all its cities . Bridgeport , New Haven , New London , Providence , Fall River , New Bedford , Boston , Portland , Bangor , Belfast , and Eastport will all transact an immense increased business with New York , Philadelphia , Baltimore , and the West . As the greatest American consumer of Western breadstuffs and provisions , and // of our iron and coal , and the principal seat of domestic manufactures , the augmented reciprocal trade of New England with the South and West will be enormous . Her shipping and shipbuilding interests , her cotton , woollen , worsted , and textile fabrics , her machinery , engines , and agricultural implements , boots and shoes , hats and caps , her cabinet furniture , musical instruments , paper , clothing , fisheries , soap , candles , and chandlery , in which she has excelled since the days of Franklin , and , in fact , all her industrial pursuits , will be greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive of agriculture and the earnings commerce , were of the value of $494,075,408 . But , in a few years after the completion of these works , this amount will be doubled . Such is the skilled and educated industry of New England , and such the inventive genius of her people , that there is no limit to her products , except markets and consumers . As New York increases , the swilling tide of the great.city will flow over to a vast extent into the adjacent shores of Connecticut and New Jersey , and Hoboken , West Hoboken , Weehawken , Hudson City , Jersey City , and Newark will meet in one vast metropolis . Philadelphia will also flow over in the same way into Camden and adjacent portions of New Jersey , whose farms already greatly exceed in value those of any other State . The farms of New Jersey in 1860 were of the average value of $60.38 per acre , while those of South Carolina , the great leader of the rebellion , with all her boasted cotton , rice , and tobacco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of $8.61 per acre . ( Census Table 36 . ) And yet there are those in New Jersey who would drag her into the rebel confederacy , cover her with the dismal pall of slavery , and who cry Peace ! peace ! when there is no peace , except in crushing this wicked rebellion . The States of the Pacific , as the enlarged canals reached the Mississippi and Missouri , and ultimately the base of the Rocky mountains , would be greatly advanced in all their interests . Agricultural products and other bulky and heavy articles that could not bear transportation all the way by the great Pacific railroad , could be carried by such enlarged canals to the Mississippi and Missouri , and ultimately to the base of the Rocky mountains , and thence , by railroad , a comparatively short distance to the Pacific ? and westward to China and Japan . In order to make New York and San Francisco great depots of interoceanic commerce for America , Europe , Asia , and the world , these enlarged canals , navigated by large steamers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have named , then , all the Territories , and all the thirty-five States , except three , as deriving great and special advantages from this system . These three are Georgia , South Carolina , and Florida , with a white population , in 1860 , of 843,338 . These States , however , would not only participate in the increased prosperity of the whole country , and in augmented markets for their cotton , rice , sugar , tobacco , and timber , and in cheaper supplies of Eastern manufactures , coal , iron , and Western products , but they would derive , also , special advantages . They have a large trade with New Orleans , which they would reach more cheaply by deepening the mouth of the Mississippi . They could pass up Albemarle sound , by the interior route , to Baltimore , Philadelphia , New York , or the West , and take back return cargoes by the same route . Georgia , also , by her location on the Tennessee river , together with South Carolina , connected with that river at Chattanooga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarged canals and improved navigation of the West , sending their own and receiving Western products more cheaply . Thus , every State and every Territory in the Union would be advanced A ' // weeks , and lands , farms , factories , town and city property , all be improved in value . But there is another topic , connected with this subject , of vast importance , particularly at this juncture , to which I must now refer . It is our public lands , the homestead bill , and immigration . On reference to an article on this subject , published by me in the November number of Tins CONTINENTAL MONTHLY , it will be found that our unsold public lands embraced 1,649 ,  - -  861 square miles , being 1,055,911,288 acres , extending to fifteen States and all the Territories , and exceeding half the area of the whole Union . The area of New York , being 47,000 square miles , is less than a thirty-fifth of this public domain . England ( proper ) , 50,922 square miles ; France , 203,736 ; Prussia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public domain , then , is more than eight times as large as France , more than fifteen times as large as Prussia , more than twenty times as large as Germany , more than thirty-two times as large as England , and larger ( excluding Russia ) than all Europe , containing more than 200,000,000 of people . As England proper contained , in 1861 , 18,949,916 inhabitants , if our public domain were as densely settled , its population would exceed 606,000 ,  - -  000 , and it would be 260,497,561 , if numbering as many to the square mile as Massachusetts . These lands embrace every variety of soil , products , and climate , from that of St. Petersburg to the tropics . After commenting on the provisions of our homestead bill , which gives to every settler , American or European , 160 acres of this land for ten dollars ( the cost of survey , etc . ) , I then said : The homestead privilege will largely increase immigration . Now , besides the money brought here by immigrants , the Census proves that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , in 1860 , $220 for 101 each man , woman , and child , independent of the gains of commerce-very large , but not given . Assuming that of the immigrants at an average annu&amp; value of only $100 each , or less than thirty-three cents a day , it would make , in ten years , at the rate of 100,000 each year , the following aggregate : 1st 2d 3d 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 10th year 100,000 = $10,000,000 200,000 = 20,000,000 300,000 = 30,000,000 400,000 = 40,000,000 500,000 = 50,000,000 600,000 = 60,000,000 700,000 70,000,000 800,000 80,000,000 900,000 = 90,000,000 1,000,000 = 100,000,000 Total , $550,000,000 In this table the labor of all immigrants each year is properly added to those arriving the succeeding year , so as to make the aggregate the last year 1,000,000 . This would make the value of the labor of this million of immigrants in ten years , $550,000,000 , independent of the annual accumulation of capital , and the labor of the children of the immigrants ( born here ) after the first ten years , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , by the official returns ( p. 14 , Census ) , the number of alien immigrants to the United States , from December , 1850 , to December , 1860 , was 2,598,216 , or an annual average of 260,000 . The effect , then , of this immigration , on the basis of the last table , upon the increase of national wealth , was as follows : = $26,000,000 = 52,000,000 = 78,000,000 = 104,000,000 = 130,000,000 = 156,000,000 = 182,000,000 = 208,000,000 = 234,000,000 = 260,000,000 Total , $1,430,000,000 Thus , the value of the labor of the immigrants , from 1850 to 1860 , was $1,430,000,000 , making no allowance for the accumulation of capital , by annual reinvestment , nor for the natural 1st year 2d " 3d " 4th " 5th " 6th " 7th " 8th " 9th " 10th " 260,000 520,000 780,000 1,040,000 1,300,000 1,560,000 1,820,000 2,080,000 2,340,000 2,600,000 The Chicago and other Canale. // increase of this population , amounting , by the Census , in ten years , to about twenty-four per cent . This addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first ten years , would be small ; but in the second and each succeeding decade , when we count children , and their descendants , it would be large and constantly augmenting . But the Census shows that our wealth increases each ten years at the rate of 126.45 per cent . ( Census Table 35 . ) Now , then , take our increase of wealth , in consequence of immigration , as before stated , and compound it at the rate of 126.45 per cent , every ten years , and the result is largely over $3,000 ,  - -  000,000 in 1870 , and over $7,000,000,000 in 1880 , independent of the effect of any immigration succeeding 1860 . If these results are astonishing , we must remember that immigration here is augmented population , and that it is population and labor that create wealth . Capital , indeed , is but the accumulation of labor . Immigration , then , from 1850 to 1860 , added to our national products a sum more than double our whole debt on the 1st of July last , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus enabling us to bear the war expenses. * As the homestead privilege must largely increase immigration , and add especially to the cultivation of our soil , it will contribute vastly to increase our population , wealth , and power , and augment our revenues from duties and taxes . As this domain is extended over fifteen States and all the Territories , the completion of these enlarged canals , embracing so large a portion of them , would be most advantageous to all , and the inducement to immigration would greatly increase , and immigration must soon flow in from Europe in an augmented volume . Indeed , when these facts are generally known in Europe , the desire of small renters , and of the working classes , to own a farm , and cultivate their own lands here , must bring thousands to our shores , even during the war . But it will be mainly when the rebellion shall have been crushed , the power of the Government vindicated , its authority fully re*stablishcd , and slavery extinguished , so as to make labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this immigration will surge upon our shores . When we shall have maintained the Union unbroken against foreign and domestic enemies , and proved that a republic is as powerful in war as it is benign in peace , and especially that the people will rush to the ranks to crush even the most gigantic rebellion , and that they will not only bear arms , but taxes , for such a purpose , the prophets of evil , who have so often proclaimed our Government an organized anarchy , will lose their power to delude the people of Europe . And when that people learn the truth , and the vast privileges offered them by the Homestead Bill , there will be an exodus from Europe to our country , unprecedented since the discovery of America . The wounds inflicted by the war will then soon be healed , and European immigrants , cultivating here their own farms , and truly loyal to this free and paternal Government , from which they will have received this precious gift of a farm for each , will take the place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have seen that the total cost of our railroads and canals , upto this date , was $1,335,285,569 , and I have estimated the probable cost of these enlarged works as not exceeding one tenth of this sum , or $133,528,556 . Let us now examine that question . We have seen that our 4,650 miles of canals cost $132,000,000 , being $28,387 per mile , or less , by $8,395 per mile , than our railroads . It will be recollected that a large number of miles of these canals have already the requisite depth of seven feet , and width of seventy , and need only an enlargement of their locks . It appears , however , by the returns , that the Erie canal , the Grand Junction , Champlain canal , and the Black River , Chemung , Chenango , and Oswego , in all 528 miles , are all seven feet deep , and seventy feet wide , and cost $83,494 per mile , while the like Chicago and otker Canals . I // average cost of all our canals , varying from forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ten in depth , was $28,387 per mile . Assuming $28,000 per mile as the average cost of the canals requiring enlargement , and $83 ,  - -  000 that of those per mile having already the requisite dimensions , the difference would be $55,000 per mile , as the average cost of those needing increased dimensions . The estimated cost , then , would stand as follows : 598 miles New York canals , enlargement of locks Enlarging dimensions , etc. , of 1,696 miles , at $55,000. per mile 93,280,000 Total , $99,260,000 Theconjectural estimate heretofore made by me was $133,528,556 , or one tenth the cost of our existing railroads and canals , and exceeding , by $1,528 ,  - -  556 , the cost of all our present 4,650 mil*s of canal . Deduct this from the above $133,528,556 , leaves $34,268,556 , to be applied to improving the St. Clair fiats , the Mississippi river , deepening its mouth , and for the ship canal round the Falls of Niagara . No estimate is now presented of the cost of the canal from Lake Champlain to the St. Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroads of our country would increase their business , with our augmented wealth and population , especially in the transportation of passengers and merchandise . They would also obtain iron cheaper for rails , boilers , and engines , timber for cars , breadstuffs and provisions for supplies , and coal or wood for their locomotives . Great , however , as would be the effect of these works in augmenting our commerce , wealth , and population , their results in consolidating and perpetuating our Union would be still more important . When the Ohio , Mississippi , and Missouri , and all their tributaries , arterializing the great valley , shall be united by the proposed routes with the lakes , the St. Lawrence , the Hudson , Delaware , Susquehanna , Chesapeake , and Albemarle , what sacrilegious hand could be raised against such a Union ? We should have no more rebellions . We should hear no more of North , South , East , and West , for all would be linked together by a unity of commerce and interests . Our Union would become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity , and no State would risk by $5,980,000 secession the benefit of participating in its commerce . We should be a homogeneous people , and slavery would disappear before the march of civilization , and of free schools , free labor , free soil , free lakes , rivers , and canals . It is the absence of such a system ( aided by slavery ) , drawinq the TFe8t and South*oest , by a 8apposed 8ltperior attraction to the Gulf , that has led the Southwest into this rebellion . But with slavery extinguished , with freedom strengthening labor 's hand , with education elevating the soul and enlightening the understanding , and with such communications uniting all our great lakes and rivers , East and West , all crowned with flourishing towns and mighty cities , with cultured fields and smiling harvests , exchanging their own products and fabrics , and those of the world , by flying cars and rushing steamers , revolt or disunion would be impossible . Strike down every barrier that separates the business of the North and East from that of the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce , we would be a unit , drawing to us , by the irresistible attraction of interest , intercourse , and trade , the whole valley of the lakes and St. Lawrence . Whom God had united by geography , by race , by language , commerce , and interest , political institutions could not long keep asunder . Of all foreign nations , those which would derive the greatest advantages // from such an union would be England and France , the two governments which a wicked pro-slavery rebellion invites to attempt our destruction . With such a commerce , and with slavery extinguished , we would have the Union , not as it was , but as our fathers intended it should be , when they founded this great and free republic . We should soon attain the highest civilization , and enjoy the greatest happiness of which our race is capable . So long as slavery existed here , and we were divided into States cherishing , and States abhorring the institution , so long as free and forced labor were thus antagonized , we could scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist truly as a nation . Slavery loomed up like a black mountain , dividing us . Slavery kept us always on the verge of civil war , with hostility to liberty , education , and progress , and menacing for half a century the life of the republic . The question then was not , Will any measure , or any construction of the constitution , benefit the nation ? but , Will it weaken or strengthen slavery ? All that was good , or great , or national , was opposed by slavery-science , literature , the improvement of rivers and harbors , homesteads for the West , defences and navies for the East . American ocean steamers were sacrificed to foreign subsidies , and all aid was refused to canals or railroads , including that to the Pacific , although essential to the national unity . Slavery was attempted to be forced on Kansas , first by violence and invasion , and then by fraud , and the forgery of a constitution . Defeated in Kansas by the voice of the people , slavery then took the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1860 , by which all the Territories , nearly equal in area to the States , were to be subjected forever as Territories to slavery , although opposed by the overwhelming voice of their people . Slavery was nationalized , and freedom limited and circumscribed with the evident intent soon to strangle it in all the States , and spread forced labor over the continent , from the North to Cape Horn . Failing in the election , slavery then assailed the vital principle of the republic , the rule of the majority , and inaugurated the rebellion . Slavery kept perjured traitors for months in the cabinet and the two Houses of Congress , to aid in the overthrow of the Government . Then was formed a constitution avowedly based on slavery , setting it up as an idol to be worshipped , and upon whose barbaric altars is now being poured out the sacrificial blood of freemen . But it will fail , for the curse of God and man is upon it . And When the rebellion is crushed , and slavery extinguished , we shall emerge from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march to the step and music of a redeemed humanity , and a regenerated Union . We shall feel a new inspiration , and breathe an air in which slavery and every form of oppression must perish . Standing upon these friendly shores , in a land which abolished slavery in the twelfth century , and surrounded by a people devoted to our welfare , looking westward , along the path of empire , across the Atlantic , to my own beloved country , these are my views of her glorious destiny , when the twin hydras of slavery and rebellion are crushed forever . If our Irish adopted citizens could only hear , as I now do , the condemnation of slavery and of this revolt , by the Irish people ; if they could hear them , as I do , quote the electric words of their renowifed Curran against slavery , and in favor of universed emancipation ; if they could listen , as they repeated the still bolder and scathing denunciations of their great orator , O'Connell , as he trampled on the dehumanizing system of chattel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders , who , under the false guise of Democracy , but in hostilit5r to all its principles , would now lure them , by the syren cry of peace , -I // into the destruction of the Union , which guards their rights , and protects their interests . The convention now assembled at Chicago , can do much to inaugurate a new era of civilization , freedom , and progress , by aiding in giving to the nation these great interior routes of tion commerce and intercourse , in. the centre of which your great city will hold the urn , as the long-divorced waters of the lakes and the Mississippi are again commingled , and , the Union linked together by the imperishable bonds of commerce , interest , and affec
