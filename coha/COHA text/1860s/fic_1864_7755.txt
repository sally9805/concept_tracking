Piatt , John James , 1835-1917 : TO JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL. from The nests at Washington ( 1864 ) TO GIVE YOUR NAME AN HONOR I WERE FAIN , BUT  --  THOUGH WITH A RICH WILL  --  I ONLY MAKE MY POOR DEED PROUD BEARING YOUR NAME IN VAIN : I CAN NOT GIVE THE HONOR THAT I TAKE . J. J. P. Woodley , Georgetown Heights , D. C. , October , 1863 . I. Piatt , John James , 1835-1917 : A MIRAGE OF THE WEST . from The nests at Washington ( 1864 ) Above the sunken sun the clouds are fired With a dark splendor : the enchanted hour Works momentary miracles in the sky ; Weird shadows take from fancy what they lack For semblance , and I see a boundless plain , A mist of sun and sheaves in boundless air , Gigantic shapes of Reapers moving slow In some new harvest : so I can but dream Of my great Land , that takes its Morning star Out of the dusky Evening of the East , My Land , that lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afar , ( Like yonder fading fantasy of cloud , ) With shadowy Reapers moving , vague and slow , In some wide harvest of the days to be  --  A mist of sun and sheaves in boundless air ! Piatt , John James , 1835-1917 : Benjamin M. Piatt . Ob . April 20 , 1863  --  t. 84. from The nests at Washington ( 1864 ) Near his loved home , among familiar flowers , ( Whose memories mingle fragrant breath with ours , ) Sleeps a gray father of the mighty West . His hands had Nature 's plea for folded rest : For , through long years and manhood 's noble strife , Whiten 'd his head above his golden life . He pass 'd as one who from his harvest goes , Attended by the sun , to his repose  --  Gracious and good . Behold his simple fame : He lies asleep beneath his honor 'd name .
