txt In a recent report of the " First Ward Industrial School , " which has reached us , we learn certain facts in regard to the tenementhouse population of that ward , which ate suggestive . We hear of a " family living in Washington-street ; the father and two boys lodge in an underground room , about 12 feet by 30 ; within this narrow space there are twelve beds , each one containing three occupants or more , making at the lowest number thirty-six lodgers , men , women and children . The man and his two boys pay 50 cents a they provide themselves with Jr ) cents worth of scraps and 10 cents worth of bread , and thus they live . The boys are both of them in our school , but irregular in attendance , as a part of their time is devoted to bootblacking . Drinking is going.on in this cellar , and drunkeness is the order of the night . " This is not the only instance of overcrowding of population in our city . In one abandoned quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eighty feet long by fifty feet deep , there are huddled twelve hundred and fifty persons . A single house in the Fourth Ward is constructed to hold one hundred and twenty-six families ; and it is computed that sometimes this building contains over fifteen hundred human beings . The visitors of the Citizens ' Association report that there are twenty-seven thousand persons who eat , cook and sleep in cellars throughout the city ; that " there are single blocks containing nearly twice as many families as reside on the whore Fifth-avenue , " and that any ten of our tenement-house blocks will often contain more inhabitants than New-Haven or Syracuse . If any persons are curious to see such quarters , let them walk through the lower parts of Washington and Greenwich streets , or the south ends of Cherry and Water streets , or traverse the rag-pickers ' districts in Pitt , Willett and the neighboring streets , or hunt out " Rotten-row " in Laurens-street , or " Harmony-court " in Tenth-avenue , or huge blocks with double houses in front and rear in East Eleventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of population , can we wonder that " diseases from domiciliary causes , over which we have control , have increased in many instances 100 per cent. ; cholera infantum , 250 per cent. ; diarrhoea , 1,000 per cent. , " and an almost equal ratio with typhcid and other diseases ? Is it anything remarkable that the police report crime on the increase , and the offspring of these pens of misery as crowding our poor-houses and our asylums and prisons ' ? Every physician and every moralist knows that crime and disease follow such condensions of population , by a law as certain as it is terrible . The Citizen 's Association computes that 6,000 lives were sacrificed uselessly in this city last year , by a want of sanitary regulations . Who can compute the characters ruined , the children trained in theft anti debauchery , the fearful immorality spread abroad by this massing of human beings in close and filthy rooms ? What we need to check these evils , ( as we have often repeated. ) is a Health Law from the Legislature , similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed in 1848 , restricting rigidly the number of lodgers or residents to a given number of cubic inches ; at the same time , permitting or requiring the police to enforce the act . We sl ; ould also be in favor of a provision to forbid cellar lodgings , unless under certain conditions , such as a given number of windows , or so much space above the surface of the street . The result of such provizions would he the scattering of the cellar-population , and the forcing them to better habitations . All new tenement-houses could be required to he built with certain means of ventilation , and the old forced to improve . It possible , the fatal system ' of " double houses " ought to be entirely done away with , for these places are nests of fever , pestilence and crime . We believe that the Citizen 's Association are preparing plans and legislative acts , bearing on these evils . Every philanthropic and wealthy citizen , who desires to correct these dreadful evils of our city , should consult with this association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the most iniquitous means , will always be used to bolster up the old and profitable system .
