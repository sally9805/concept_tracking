MAXiMILIAN OF MEXICO . MAXIMILIAN OF MEXICO . qwq that it was his object to obtain redress of past grievances , and to assist the Mexicans to establish any stable government which they might choose ; but that government must be adopted by the people themselves , and that it must respect property , punish crime , levy taxes impartially , and protect perfect freedom of conscience in worship . A Provisional Government was organized under the protection of the French troops . First , a Superior Council was appointed , consisting of thirty-five of the most distinguished Mexican citizens . This Council chose three executive officers called the Regency , consisting of General Almonte , General Salas , and the Archbishop of Mexico . This Regency summoned an assembly of Mexican Notables two hundred and fifteen in number . This Provisional Government , thus consisting of a Regency of three members , a Council or Senate of thirty-five members , and a General Assembly of two hundred and fifteen members , met on the 10th of July , 1863 , and voted with almost entire unanimity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maximilian of Austria to accept the throne . Maximilian was a young man thirty years of age , of much moral worth , and of good abilities well cultivated . The testimony in his favor is unvarying . his morals were pure , his character elevated , and his bearing remarkably frank and genial . The thoroughness of his education and his studious tastes were evinced by the fact that he spoke fluently several languages , and , young as he was , several voluxYies , journals of travels , highly creditable in their literary character , had already been published from his pen . His connections were such that lie could probably bring more influence to his support than any other prince in Europe . The Emperor of Austria was his elder brother ; Leopold , King of the Belgians , was his father-in-law ; Victoria Queen of England , Isabella Queen of Spain , and the Kings of Italy and Sweden , were his cousins ; the Eniperor of the French was his personal friend . Maximilian was liberal in his political views and universally popular . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently published in London , in three volumes , entitled , " Recollections of My Life , by Maximilian I. , Emperor of Mexico . ' A few extracts from these volumes , written for his friends alone , will give the reader some idea of the mind and heart of the Archduke . In August , 1851 , Maximilian was traveling in Italy . He was then nineteen years of ago . No tourist will ever forget the descent of Vesu*ius in the yielding ashes . Maximilian thus describes it : " Here a pleasure of the rarest kind awaited us . The famous gliding through the ashes was to be gone through . I had often heard of such a thing at home , lint could never form a distinct idea of It . With mad delight I threw myself forward and jumped into the ashes , the whole company after me . The feeling is indescribably a*reeahle . One gets a notion of the splendid feelinas of a bird of prey when winging Itself from the height of the air down into the deep valley . Thus it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vied , nevertheless , with each other in Jumping with a feeling of mad rapture . I often jumped yards wide into the sloping ashes . Sometimes I stopped for a moment to prolon* the pleasure and to recover breath for fresh laughing , and to observe my companions in the different phases of jumping . One was so glad to be once again allowed to be a child with all one 's heart , and on a legitimate occasion to give unrestrained vent to merrimeiit . " Vesuvius is a remnant of chaos . Thus the past speaks to us through the spirit of fire , and also gives us a warning of the future . As the fire purifies , and as out of mist and smoke the earth arose in its splendor , and God himself enjoyed his work and said , It is good , so once again will smoke and mist arise and withdraw this foul old ball from the blessed eye of the Creator . But let us fly before these awful thoughts to the little church of the hermitage , to pray for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembled iii the poor chapel the priest read the holy mass , and then we returned in quick time , between splendid vineyards , to Resina . " Under date of August 18 , 1831 , Maximilian wrote from Naples : " All put on their holiday dress and prepared for High Mass , which was to be read , in celebration of the birthday of our Emperor , at ten o'clock . Our ship chaplain , a very worthy young luau , read with calm devotion the holy mass , and sung after it the Te Deum . I felt very sad during the service ; for it was the first time I had not been with my brother on this happy day . I was alone , quite alone , in strange seas , under another sky . Besides I had thought so long and so deeply of one of my beloved at home , about whom my heart was anxious , that I was in one of those forlorn dispositions of mind in which a man feels a sort of sweet despair and longs for home . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is well that such a life should have an end ; and these heavy hours are a bitter but a wholesome medicine . To celebrate the day I invited the officers of the ship and the chaplain to dinner . " The following were his reflections upon visiting a Carthusiauz cloister in the valley of the Arno : " A tall , serious young man , picturesquely dressed in white , entered the hail from his room , astonished at the sight of visitors , and avoiding speech with them in every possible way . It was the master of novices . What could have induced him to choose the solitude of death ? Will he not , at times , lean on a stone support of his altar and look down upon the sunny , lau*hlug , joyous valley , where all is full of hope and happiness , where the children of earth playfully hasten over blooming fields as free as the birds of the air ; or when , on the evening of St. John , the cupola of the cathedral is glorified with hundreds of lights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver waves , and the merry songs of the moving crowds are heard in the cloister-will he not , at these times , be seized with an unfathomable woe , by an irresistible longing for a momeiit ( if pleasure and joy , for one hour of terrestrial deli*hc ? " Pitiable , very pitIable man ! You are proud of your life , which is pure because temptation is removed . You have consecrated your heart to death , and death alone will give it its icy rest . We left the cell , and the novice - master remained . How I should have liked to bring him back to nature  --  to life ! But he is dead to the world ; the Carthusian monastery is his tomb ; and who knows whether it will not , at last , bring to him , as to many others , rest and peace ? " At Syracuse he writes as follows : " There are some thiu*s which stamp themselves on our memory with melaimcholy impression . This I found here ; for far from the world , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eighteen years old , who , separated by the wide , wide ocean from his // fatherland and his relatives , from all that was dear to him , lies in strange ground among foreign people and people of a different religion . " This young man , in the bloom of youth , was killed by a bullet in a duel . They have granted him , in the Latomia , a narrow little place in the rocky wall , quiet as death ; and the wide ocean flows between him and his family . I can not express how sad I felt when I saw this grave , and I still think frequently , with sorrow , of the poor young American in the Latomia of hot Syracuse . " On the 6th of July , 1852 , he wrote from Ma-deira " I bad hardly opened my eyes when the sweet tones of our national hymn sounded in my ears , and suggested solemn thoughts to my mind on my entrance into my twenty-first year . This was a kind of surprise on the part of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hymn of noble Austria . I was twenty years of age , and had arrived at an important period of my life . Notwithstanding my youth many grave and solemn thoughts dwelt in my mind on that morning . Externally the attainment of my majority would cause but little change in my life ; as before it I was already , so far as my position would allow , my own master ; and even in material points had not been . fettered by the usual restrictions upon minors . If there be any prophetic warning in the manner in which one 's birthday is spent , then the year to come will be gay , bright , and free from care ; for never did I pass this anniversary in so joyous and enchaniing a manner . Quite early in the morning I escaped , with a circle of friends , from the ship , to spend the day as travelers in country fashion . " In Albania , on the 1st of August , lie wrote : " The building before us was called a Christian church . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its desolate space only a few solitary intimations of its august purpose , and these almost effaced or destroyed . And yet tbe spirit of the Almighty still dwelt within this little church , for we were almost involuntarily drawn into it , and amidst dust and decay the men from the north and the south uncovered their heads and made the sign of the cross , that symbol of peace by which we brethren may recognize each other in all parts of this vast globe , whatever be our language , whatever our station in life . " The following touching description of a deathscene , on board the ship of which Maximilian was commander , affords very interesting insigist to his character : " A commander who understands his position and cons ? ders himself a true sailor loves his subordinates . After a time there is a bond that unites the whole crew . Dangers are experienced together , pleasures enjoyed together , seas are crossed in pleasant company , and every one feels that on the wide ocean he belongs to a little world linked together by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large family becomes endangered one must be devoid of feeling not to feel anxious . Some days ago one of our sailors said that he was unwell . He was now hovering between life and death . He had been carried on deck in a hammock to enjoy the fresh air . The doctors did all that their unfortunately too precarious art advised , but to no avail . The lamp of life slowly burned to its end , and the vital spark flickered more and more faintly . I frequently asked the dying man how he was . But his glassy eye could recognize me no more , and his lips only stammered unintelligible words . " When the doctor reported to us that death would soon certainly take place I ordered to send for a priest as speedily as possible . Messen*ers were sent out in all directions , and tele*raphie signs agreed on from the coast , in order to announce his arrival ; hut hours passed , and sp*eltual consolation could not be found . However , I could not allow an Austrian sailor to end his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I requested those of the crew who crowded sympathizin* ly and wonderingly round the dying man to recite some pious prayers for the departing . But none of them had the courage to do it . The crowd stood around , mute and awe-stricken , while the all-important moment might easily be lost . I did not hesitate , but hurried to my cabin , whence I returned with a splinter of the holy cross and my prayer-book . I attached the former to the hammock , and knelt on the deck near the dying man . That seemed to break the spell , and all joined in devout prayers for the salvation of this poor soul . When the sun shed his last beams on the anxious group the poor young man had breathed his last . The ship 's bell was tolling tremulously , and the coming night soon spread its pall over the departed . " I had never before witnessed a death , and it required a great effort for me to remain to the last . It was especially moving to witness the dying man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hammock , while his companions had to restrain bun by holding him . At last he suddenly dropped his head and died . It was horrible for me to witness all this , although after it dying appeared much easier than I imagined . The moment was solemn , and , I thank God , devoted to prayer . I saw many a tear in the eyes of our young officers , who otherwise would perhaps have thought of any thing but death . It was altogether a bitter but very beneficial lesson for me and for all . " lATe will give one more extract-an important one-expressing the writer 's views upon the subject of slavery : " There are four causes , three of which maybe termed negative , which contribute to destroy domestic life in Brazil : the want of an old established home belonglug to the head of the family , in which *eneration after generation lives , in the same style and with the same habits ; the total absence of all idea and all feeling of conscience ; the entire want of a religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficienily to be deprecated , is that of slavery , which it is the duty of every Christian man , be his nation and rank what it may , to wage war against , both by word and deed . Slavery unites within herself , and , alas ! reproduces the three former evils . How can the blessing of home dwell side by side with slavery ? How can conscience exist , when there are men beyond the pale of the law-when beings who have souls depend exclusively on the arbitrary power and caprices of some few of their fellow-creatures ? Is not religion a mockery and an empty jest , when the white man arrogates the right to treat those who are , equally with himself , born in the image of the Creator , like beasts of burden or like bales of goods ? " True progress and real prosperity can never be spoken of in Brazil so long as slavery exists . Slaves and respectable immigrants can not live side by side . Slave-owners can not be just . To break through slavery , therefore , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be done without some pain ; but all natural vigor begins in pain . What revoltin* reasons do not cold-hearted sophists give for a continuance of slavery ? Why do not people who uphold such institutions return to the worship of heathen gods ? It would be much more consistent and convenient . If Brazil would thrive and prosper among the empires of the world , it must have an iron-handed regenerator , a white despot , basing his principles on justice . His would be the melancholy lot not to be understood by the men of his time , to be hated by his Brazilian contemporaries . But history would accord him a high rank among those who work for the future , and he would be blessed by future generations . " These brief extracts will give the reader an idea of the character of Maximilian such as could be obtained in no other way . In the summer of 1863 , when the Provisional Government was organized in Mexico , Maximilian , with his young wife , Carlota , was residing in his // palace of Miramar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position of GovernorGeneral of Lombard-Venice . His bride , the Princess Maria Carlota Amelia , usually called Carlota , was daughter of Leopold , the King of the Belgians . Leopold 's first wife was Princess Charlotte , daughter of George IV . of England , and heiress to the British throne . His second wife , the mother of Carlota , was the daughter of Louis Philippe . The father of Carlota was a Protestant ; her mother was a very earnest Catholic . Carlota was at this time twentythree years of age . The French was her vernacular tongue ; and yet it is said that she spoke with equal fluency German , English , Spanish , and Italian . Her education had been very carefully conducted , and we know not that any voice has ever spoken to her detriment . She was tall , beautiful , and graceful , and remarkably mild and affectionate in her disposition . Both her father and mother were morally and intellectually superior characters , and Carlota inherited the virtues and the excellences of both . There perhaps was never a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashionable life , and was earnestly devoted to the welfare of the people . The poor ever found in her a friend . It is not easy to imagine a more enviable position to be occupied in this world than was then occupied by Maximilian and Carlota . Upon the shores of the Adriatic Sea , about threemiles from the city of Trieste , is situated the beautiful castle of Miramar . It is one of the most attractive palaces of Europe , in the midst of scenery of rare loveliness , and in a delicious clime . In the rear of the castle are gardens , parks , and lawns , embellished with all the attractions which wealth and taste can confer . A massive marble staircase descends from the eastern front to the tideless waters of the sea . On the one side one was cheered by the breathing of the wind through the forest , the foliage , and the flowers , and the songs of birds . On the other the spirit was lulled to repose by the soft murmurs of the sea . The castle is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 84 feet wide , and is flanked by a tower which rises to the height of 140 feet above the surface of the water . In its interior arrangements it has all the elegance and convenience which modern art and wealth can confer . Here Maximilian and Carlota were residing , apparently in the enjoyment of every blessing earth could confer-youth , health , wealth , rank , and the enthusiastic homage of all who surrounded them . On the 3d of October , 1863 , the Mexican deputation visited the Castle of Miramar to announce to Maximilian that the Mexican nation had adopted for its form of government a limited , hereditary monarchy , and offered the crown to His Imperial Highness , the Arch duke , with the title of Emperor of Mexico . This delegation consisted of nine distinguished Mexicans . Sefior Estrada , the President of the Commia sion , addressed the Archduke in a carefully prepared speech , in which he alluded to the anarchy with which Mexico had been devastated for nearly half a century ; to the unsuccessful attempts to establish republican institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditions , customs , and inclinations of the people ; to the absolute necessity of some foreign aid to enable Mexico to escape from the confusion which had so long reigned , in consequence of the struggles of rival chieftains ; and , finally , to the almost universal desire of the Mexican people that Maximilian should accept the crown . He said : " We , who are but feeble interpreters of the general applause , of love , of the hopes and prayers of a whole nation , come to present , in that nation 's name , to your Imperial Highness the crown of the Mexican Empire , which the people offer you , Prince , freely and spontaneously , by a olemn decree of the Notables , already ratified by many provinces , and which will soon be , as every one says , by the entire nation . " The Archduke , in a very graceful reply , declined accepting the throne unless its acceptance were the clearly defined wish of the Mexican people . The vote of the Notdbles alone was not in his view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegation that he was ready to undertake the task of the regeneration of Mexico , if he were called to the task by the voice of universal suffrage . The commission returned to Mexico to obtain , as far as possible , this popular vote . Six months passed away . On the 10th of April , 1864 , the delegation again visited the Castle of Mirainar . Maximilian had been apprised of its coming , and that the deputation had obtained for his election , as far as possible , the sanction of the popular vote . In preparation for the ceremony of acceptiug the proffered crown the Archduke had the day before renounced all claims to the succession to the throne of Austria . The solemn ceremony took place at Miramar , in the presence of the Emperor of Austria and his other brothers . At the close Maximilian and Francis-Joseph repeatedly*embraced each other , while tears flowed down the cheeks of both . They seemed to have a monition that they were about to part never to meet on earth again . It was Sunday , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Mexican deputation left their apartments in the hotel do Ville , of Trieste , and repaired to the palace of Maximilian . The pleasure-grounds were thrown open , as usual , on that day , and the inhabitants of the city thronged those avenues and bowers . A mounted escort preceded the four carriages which conveyed the deputation , and the long line of additional carriages which were filled with persons of distinction in the regalia of full dress . They were presented to the Archduke in the magnificent hall of reception . Maximilian , in the uniform of Vice-Admiral of the Austrian Navy , stood before a table covered with a cloth of richest tapestry . Carlota was by his side , // qwq of the Emperor and Empress at Vera Cruz was enthusiastic in the highest degree . The Emperor issued a proclamation to the Mexican people announcing that he had come in response to their call ; that painful as it was to him to leave his country and his friends , and that weighty as were the responsibilities thus assumed , he cheerfully undertook the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only by the suifrages of the Mexican people , hut also by the voice of God . " I have , " said he , " hid farewell forever to my own , my native country , being convinced that the Almighty has pointed out to me , through you , the noble mission of devoting all my strength and heart to a people who , tired of war and disastrous contests , sincerely wish for peace and prosperity . " A committee , composed of the officers of the city of Vera Cruz , led by the Mayor , immediately repaired on shipboard and addressed their Majesties in the warmest terms of congratulation and welcome . The heat of approaching summer in this tropical climate was excessive . It was not deemed safe for those unacelimated to remain long upon the coast . It was therefore decided that the royal pair should leave early the next morning for the purer air of the mountainous interior . At five o'clock the next morning mass was said , on which occasion the Emperor remarked , " I wish , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are Indians and those who are not . All are Mexicans , and have an equal right to my solicitude . " Immediately after mass the Emperor and Empress , in a small boat , were conveyed to the shore . Here the Emperor was met by the public officers , and in a congratulatory address was presented with the key of the city , on a silver salver . After a brief reply their Majesties , accompanied by General Almonte , entered an open carriage and drove through the principal streets of the city . An immense retinue followed them in carriages , upon horseback , and on foot . They passed beneath triumphal arches . The windows were festooned with flowers , and the shouts of the populace blended with all the festival sounds of joy . This popular reception was at an early hour , to avoid the heat of the sun . Accompanied by an imposing escort , Maximilian and Carlota took their seats in the cars , and at nine o'clock reached Soledad , where they breakfasted . Continuing their journey in carriages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cordova until two o'clock the next morning . The night was dark and rainy . Men were sent out several miles to meet them with torches . The Town Council in a body received them with congratulation . On the ensuing day at ten o'clock they attended mass and the Te Deum . They were then presented to the authorities of the city . The festivities of the occasion were closed with fire-works , . and with , apparently , the rejoicings of the whole population . At eight o'clock the next morning they re sumed their journey in carriages to Orizaba , eighteen miles distant . Stopping a moment to receive the congratulations of the inhabitants of a little village on the way , they entered the city of Orizaba . The Mayor , accompanied by the city officials , received them and conducted them into the city , where they were received with all the demonstrations of enthusiastic welcome which flowers , banners , music , booming cannon , and the heartiest acelamations of the populace could give . In response to the congratulations which were uttered , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country greets us profoundly moves us . If all will unite in the sole end of promoting the lasting greatness and prosperity of our country , Providence then will crown our efforts . May it please God to hear our prayers , and to give the Empire the era of peace which it so much requires to advance in greatness and prosperity . " During the procession the people , in their ardor , endeavored to unharness the mules , that they might draw the carriage of the Emperor and Empress with their own hands . But Maximilian was unwilling to accept such homage , and they good-naturedly desisted . They examined the schools in Orizaba , giving rewards in gold coins to the pupils who had distinguished themselves . In the evening there was a ball , which was continued until six in the morning , though the Emperor and Empress retired a twelve . The next day was passed in visiting the institutions of the city , and in acquainting themselves with the wants of the people . At eight o'clock the following morning they resumed their journey toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on foot , composed their enthusiastic cortege as they left the city . The Empress gave three hundred dollars to the Mayor for the benefit of the poor and the sick in the hospitals . At ten o'clock on the morning of the 5th of June Maximilian and Carlota entered the city of Puebla , a city containing eighty thousand inhabitants . The road from Orizaba had presented a succession of triumphal arches , banners , wreaths of flowers , and rejoicing multitudes . But their reception at Puebla surpassed all they had yet experienced , lit is , however , to be remembered that they were on the track over which the French army had passed , and which was still in possession of the French troops . All opposed to the Empire had probably fled with the dispersed army of republicans under Juarez . The intelligent portions of these cities were almost universally in favor of the Empire . The majority of the pol ) ulnce were mere children in intelligence . They had no political opinions , and were ready to shout with delight upon any occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlota should have interpreted this applause as expressing the unanimous voice of the nation . At Puebla a grand procession , led by the municipal authorities , met the sovereigns at the gates of the city , presented them the keys , and conducted them to the cathedral . At the conclusion // of very imposing religious ceremonies the Emperor was addressed in the affectionate terms of welcome by representatives of the city and of the nation . In his reply to the authorities of Puebla , he said : " With a sentiment of pleasure mingled with grief I see your city : with pleasure I salute one of the largest , most beautiful , and important cities of the Empire ; with pain I contemplate the inhabitants agitated by the evils of political disruptions . The government , to whose elevation you have contributed , will impose upon itself the task of healing your wounds as soon as possible , and of facilitating , by means of institutions which are in accordance with the age , the development of prosperity , so that the resources of this rich country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of June was Carlota 's birthday . She was then twenty-four years of age . In the morning , in accordance with her devout habits , she attended mass in the thronged Cathedral , where the event was celebrated in anthems of thanksgiving . At seven o'clock in the evening there was a grand banquet given at the palace . rihis was followed at a later hour l ) y a ball in the vast market-house , which was l ) repared for the occasion . The scene is represented by those who witnessed it as one of great brilliancy . The path of their Majesties from the street was carpeted with flowers . Colossal pyramids in the angles of the court glittered with vases of variegated colors . Nothing occurred to mar the festivities of the occasion . At half past twelve the Emperor and Empress retired . But Carlota 's heart was with the poor and the sorrowing . She had never manifested any fondness for the pageantries of courts . She took part in these festivities very cheerfully as one of the necessities of her situation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her true character : " Sa&amp;oa PaEFEcT ,  --  It is very pleasing to me to find myself in Puebla the first anniversary of my birthday which I have passed far from my old country . Such a day is for every body one of reflection . And these days would be sad for me if the care , attention , and proofs of affection , of which I have been the object in this city , did not cause me to recollect that I am in my new country among my people . " Surrounded by friends and accompanied by my dear husband I have no time to be sad . And I give thanks to God because he has conducted me here , presenting unto Him fervent prayers for the happiness of the country which is mine . United to Mexico long ago by sympathy , I am to-day united to it by stronger bonds and at the same time sweeter-those of gratitude . " I wish , Sefior Prefect , that the poor of this city may participate in the pleasure which I have experienced among you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds , which is to be dedicated to the rebuilding of the House of Charity , the ruinous state of which made me feel sad yesterday , so that the unfortunate ones , who found themselves deprived of shelter , may return to inhabit it . " Senor Prefect , assure my compatriots of Puebla that they possess , and will always possess , my affec tions . CkaaoTA. " made a brief tarry to respond to the enthusiastic greetings which invariably met them . At two o'clock in the afternoon of the eleventh of June they entered Guadalupe , a suburb within three miles of the capital . Here they were met by the ecclesiastical dignitaries and the civil authorities of the town , and were conducted to the great cathedral , where thanks were offered to God , with all the imposing ceremonies of the Church , for their safe arrival . They were then , while surrounded by these solemn appeals to Almighty God , in the following terms welcomed to Mexico : " The Political Prefect of the First Department of the Empire , the Municipal Prefect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ayuutamiento , the Illustrious Senor Archbishop , and other authorities present themselves full of grateful pleasure , with their souls overflowing with joy , before their belo*ed Sovereigns to congratulate them on their pleasant arrival at the gate of the city in which is erected the throne which has been raised by the Mexicans for them . " Words fail me to manifest our gratitude ; because you have , in compassion for our misfortunes , abandoned another throne , riches , country , parents , brothers , and friends , and condescended to come and try to make us happy , and save us from the evils that were causing us to disappear from the catalogue of nations . " Your Majesties only knew , through statements and papers , the will of the people who applauded you . Now , to-day , you see that you are not deceived ; and that from the shores of Vera Crnz to the gates of the capital all applaud their sovereigns with unbounded enthusiasm . The Mexicans will so continue until the end . And I assure your Majesty , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us will obey and assist the monarchs , whom , by acclamation , we have chosen . " The heart of Maximilian was touched with this abounding proof of confidence and affection . His eye was moistened and his voice tremulous as he briefly replied : " Profoundly moved by the universal enthusiasm which I have received in all the towns on my route , my emotion and my gratitude acquire greater intensity as I find myself at the gate of the capital , as I see gathered to salute me its principal authorities , in a place so much respected by me and the Empress and all Mexicans . I gratefully receive your congratulations , and salute you with the effusions of one who loves you , and who has identified his fate with yours . " A grand procession was formed which conducted their Majesties to the Plain of Aragon . Here they were met by two deputations-one of gentlemen , the other of ladies-who bade them welcome in the name of the inhabitants of the capital of the Empire . At the close of these ceremonies their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great magnificence , and where they enjoyed a few hours of repose from the fatigues of their long journey . The next day was Sunday , the 12th of June . The sovereigns were to make their triumphal entrance into the world-renowned capital of the ancient Empire of the Mexicans . They attended mass.in the morning , and then entered the qwq keys of the city were presented , richly wrought in enameled gold . Accompanied by a very magnificent procession , the Imperial pair were conducted through the principal streets of the city to the far - famed cathedral . ' Here the Archbishop received them , beneath a canopy richly embroidered with gold , and conducted them into the vast interior of the church , which was decorated in the highest style of combined Mexican and French taste . A throne was prepared for the Emperor and Empress . Maximilian was dressed in the uniform of a Mexican General . Carlota wore a silk dress of blue and white , with a blue scarf and a hat simply decorated with natural flowers . The grand Te Deum was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the religious solemnities their Majesties were conducted , on foot , a short distance over carpeted ground and beneath a beautiful canopy , to the Archiepiscopal palace , where the city authorities were presented . In the evening the city blazed with illuminations and fire-works , and every demonstration of public rejoicing . The National palace was assigned to the Emperor . It was reared upon the foundation of the angient palace of Montezuma . Maximilian immediately devoted all his energies to the momentous task before him , examining the finances , studying the condition of the Empire , and seeking to ascertain the wants of the people . For several months he devoted himself to these labors with zeal which never abated . He was much troubled on finding that the neighboring republic of the United States was regarding his Government with a jealous and even hostile eye . The Juarez party , discomfited by the French troops , had retired in broken and apparently powerless bands , without funds , far away to the north , where there was but little chance of their maintaining themselves by plunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Empire in Mexico , and had exchanged embassadors . On the 2d of October , 1865 , Maximilian issued a proclamation to the Mexicans , stating that " The cause which 0 . Benito Juarez defended with so much valor and energy has already succumbed under the force , not only of the national will , hut also of the very law which that officer invoked in support of his pretensions . To-day even the faction into which the said cause degenerated is abandoned , by the departure of its chief from the native soil . " The National Government for a long time was lenient , and exercised great clemency , in order to give the chance to misled and misiuformed men to rally to the majority of the nation , and to place themselves anew in the path of duty . " Hereafter the contest will only be between the honorable men of the nation and the gangs of criminals and robbers . Clemency will cease now ; for it would only profit the mob , who hum villages , rob and murder peaceful citizens , poor old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resting on its power , from this day will be inflexible in its punishments , since the laws of civilization , the rights of humanity , and the exigencies of morality demand it . " The next day , October 3 , the Emperor issued a decree containing the following announce-ment : " Maximilian , Emperor of Mexico . Having heard our Council of Ministers and our Council of State , we decree : " All persons belonging to armed bands or corps not legally authorized , whether they proclaim or not any political principles , and whatever be the number of those who compose said bands , their or*anization , character , and denomination , shall be tried militarily , by the courts-martial , and if found guilty even only of the fact of belonging to the band , they shall be condemned to capital punishment within twenty-four hours following the sentence . From the penalty shall only be exempted those who , having done nothing more than being with the band , shall prove that they were made to join it by force , or did not belong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All those who will voluntarily assist the guerrillas with money or any other means whatever ; those who give them advice , information , or counsels ; those who voluntarily , and knowing that they are guerrillas , will put within their reach or sell them arms , horses , ammunition , subsistence , or any articles of war whatever , shall also be tried and sentenced conformably with article first of this law . And it is prohibited that any demands for pardon be gone through . " This Decree has been regarded as inhuman and barbarous , an insult to modern civilization , and demanding the severest rebuke . The following is the plea which the friends of the Imperial Government present in mitigation of judgment . We copy an article from the Mexican Times of February 24 , 1866 : " We are satisfied that the United States press , which has criticised so severely the order of His Majesty the Emperor requiring all guerrillas taken with arms in their hands to he shot , are entirely ignorant of the state of things existing in Mexico . A long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering severely from the conduct of the dissidents . Whenever they took a Frenchman he was immediately shot , while the prisoners taken by the French troops were released and sent back to their homes . " The Emperor , in the kindness of his heart , has turned loose hundreds and thousands who , not appreciating his leniency , went straight into the mountains and joined again their old friends the robbers . This state of things lasted in Mexico for a long time , the dissidents killing their prisoners without mercy , while the Imperial forces spared theirs . " Although there has been no organized force in Mexico , opposed to the Empire , since the fall of Oajaca , still his Majesty did not issue this decree until Juarez had fled the country , leaving behind him no constituted legal authority whatever to carry on the war . President Juarez took with him his entire cabinet , leaving no head or leader in Mexico . As for Escobedo and Cortina they were simply outlaws , who rob friend and foe , and murder for filthy lucre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and party , and the shocking barbarity committed on their persons . If these guerrillas are under the control of Juarez he is responsible for this wholesale murder of those innocent men . We , therefore , request our friends of the northern press to recollect , " 1st . That the guerrillas inaugurated this shooting of prisoners . 2d . That there had not been , for many a long month before the issuance of the decree by the Emperor , any organized force making war upon the Empire . 3d . There is none now . 4th . The Ex-President Juarez , with his whole court and cabinet , had abandoned Mexico before the decree was issued . The only force in arms against the Empire , at the time the decree was issued , were irresponsible guerrillas who robbed friend and foe , old and young , women and children . " Mr. Frederic Hall , the American jurist , who was one of the Emperor 's legal advisers , states // in this connection : " Under the foregoing state of facts , and the provisions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could hardly be expected by rational men that some law in retaliation of those acts of savage barbarity should not be created by the Empire . The decree was issued at the instance of Marshal Bazaine. lie appeared before the Council and stated , as a positive fact , that Juarez had left the territory of Mexico , and that he was thea in the State of Texas , in the United States of North America . Bazaine said to the Council and to the Emperor that it was absolutely necessary to pass some severe law to put down the malcontents ; that inasmuch as the leader of the opposite party had abandoned the territory , the remaining few were nothing more in the eye of the law than banditti , and therefore such a decree would be sustained by the law of nations . " In the mind of the Emperor such a law was marked with too much severity , and he expressed himself decidedly opposed to it . But after much debate and consideration , together with a decided opinion of the ministry in support of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be observed that this is one of the few decrees signed by all the ministers . That the Emperor fully believed that Juarez was actually beyond the jurisdiction of Mexico there can be no doubt . " Shortly after the issuance of the decree twenty-eight persons were taken prisoners by General Mendez . Four of them were shot . When information reached the Emperor that the four had been executed he felt exceedingly grieved ; and dispatched a courier to inform Mendez that he disapproved the act , and that lie must shoot no more . The Emperor immediately issued orders to the commanders of the different divisions to execute no prisoners until orders were received from him to that effect . " Although the decree was in force , it was not the intention of his Majesty to carry it out ; but only to hold it as a terror over the enemy in order that it might have a tendency to stop bloodshed . With a view of preventing executions , under that decree , the Emperor ordered the telegraph office to be kept open nights . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a message came which reported a capture of prisoners . He was frequently awakened under that order ; and he never failed to send an order prohibiting the execution of the prisoners . " Such are the facts and such is the nature of the defense which the friends of Maximilian * This law of Jnarez condemned to immediate death , upon arrest , all persons , whether " Mexicans or foreign residents , " who had invited or should invite " subjects of other powers to invade the naMonal territory , or to change the form of government which has been given to the Republic , whatever may be the pretext under which it is done ; " and persons involved " in any kind of complicity to excite or prepare the invasion , or to favor its realization and end ; " and in such cases " an appeal for pardon is not admissible. " present to the public . With this statement we leave the question to the decision of the reader . But Maximilian soon found himself in great embarrassment . Every day his path grew more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not deem it her duty to incur war with the United States in the endeavor to rescue Mexico from barbarism . It al* was evident that the Empire could not he established while encountering the moral and physical opposition of the United States . One of the first measures of Maximilian had been to write a very friendly letter to Juarez , proposing an interview , that they might consuIt together respecting the measures to be adopted to promote the prosperity of Mexico . Maximilian had not then a doubt that the great majority of the people desired the Empire . lie could not doubt this . It was affirmed by the deputation which offered him the crown ; and this affirmation seemed to be proved by the manner in which he had been received by the people . Juarez returned a contemptuous answer to the Emperor 's appeal for an intervie*v . Maximilian wished for perfect freedom of conscience , and to respect those sales of church property which had been effected under administrations which preceded him . This alienated the high church party , and even the Pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States rendered it certain that France would soon withdraw her protecting troops . To add to their accumulating griefs , Leopold , King of the Belgians , one of the best of fathers and of sovereigns , died . The malcontents of all parties were now rallying around Juarez . The Uni%ed States were ready to furnish him funds . Adventurers from the United States were eager to join his banners . Maximilian , harassed by these embarrassments , and seeing daily evidence of the fickleness of the ignorant Mexican population , began to doubt whether there were that intelligent unanimity in his favor which he had been led to suppose existed . Guerrilla bands swept the country , and the old chaos reigned wherever the French troops were not present to preserve order . The French prisoners and all Mexican Imperialists taken captive were mercilessly killed , often after hideous torture . There was no law outside of the lines of the French army . And those troops were about to be withdrawn . On the 6th of February , 1866 , the French troops left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government of Maximilian ceased . The French Government , in withdrawing their troops , earnestly entreated Maxinilian to accompany them , being convinced that the attempt to establish the Empire in Mexico without foreign aid must fail . Maximilian desired to do so . He wrote to Juarez , informing him of his readiness to depart if Juarez would grant a genei*al amnesty to all identified with the Imperial cause . " Juarez , " // tidings from Europe indicate that her disordered intellect is gradually regaining its lost powers . Early in October the Emperor received the intelligence of this new woe which had fallen upon him . He was overwhelmed by the tidings . For ten days he surrendered himself to almost uncontrollable grief . The embarrassments which surrounded him were perhaps as great as man has ever encountered . Should he leave Mexico and hasten to his stricken wife ? This would be abandoning his friends to certain ruin . Death was the only penalty which would satisfy the vengeance of the Junrez party . Still , there was but little hope in remaining . The increasing guerrilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the distracted state of the country afforded them . Maximilian could not thus support his troops . his treasury was empty . He could raise no loans . Agitated by these thoughts he paced the floor , now exclaiming , with moistened eye and tremulous voice , " Poor Carlota , poor Carlota ! " Again he would endeavor to summon fortitude to abide by the destinies of the Empire , and meet the fate of his companions whatever that fate might be . Thus afflicted and perplexed he repaired to Orizaba , about the 20th of October , with the intention of leaving the country . Here , in conference with his friends , he changed his plans and resolved to remain with them , at least until another effort should be made to ascertain the will of the nation . lie accordingly issued a proclamation stating that circumstances of great magnitude had led him to the conviction that he ought to reconsider the power confided to him , and calling for a Congress of the whole nation , without excluding any political class , to deliberate upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " has given as their opinion that the welfare of Mexico still requires our presence at the head of affairs , and we have considered it our duty . to accede to their request . This Congress shall decide whether the Empire shall continue in the future . " said Maximilian upon his trial , " refused this , and I had no course left but to remain , and to do all in my power to protect a large proportion of the Mexican people . " Under these painful circumstances , and perhaps also influenced by the desire to remove Carlota from these scenes where danger was so rapidly accumulating , the Emperor commissioned the Empress to return to Europe as his confidential agent to some of the courts there . At a very early hour on the morning of the 8th of July they attended mass together . Carlota then took her departure for Vera Cruz , on her way to Europe . The Emperor accompanied her as far as Rio Frio . There he bade her adieu . They never met again . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe immediately repaired to the French court . It was generally understood that her object was to induce the French Government to postpone the withdrawal of the French troops , and to furnish the Empire with additional funds . It was manifestly inexpedient for France thus to attempt to sustain the Empire , with the whole influence of the United States opposing it . Poor Carlota , disappointed and trembling for the safety of her husband , was in despair . The intensity of her anguish was such that reason became dethroned . She was first thrown into a state of extreme dejection , and then became hopelessly insane . Some of her physicians attributed her insanity to the effect of poison administered to her in Mexico . There were many such reports in Mexico . It was there said that she had eaten of fruit in which there had been placed the poisonous juice of the milk-tree . The first indication of her insanity appeared on her journey to Rome , when suddenly she became impressed with the idea that it was not safe for her to go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At Rome , as upon all the towns on her route , Carlota was received with great distinction . Ordinarily she appeared perfectly sane , very qwq ter , written on the 2d of March , the assembling of a Congress to determine upon the destinies of Mexico . On the 14th of March General Escobedo , one of the officers of the Juarez party , attacked Queretaro with an army numbering thirty thousand men . Maximilian had under his command at that place nine thousand . In the fierce battle which ensued the enemy was repulsed . The Emperor shared in all the perils , toils , and hardships of his men . A few days after he sent the Mexican general , Marquez , with a thousand mounted men to the city of Mexico for reinforcements and supplies , ordering him immediately to return . Marquez , probably from an error of judgment , did not return . The Emperor was thus weakened , and being nearly destitute of supplies his condition became very perilous . On the 27th of March he again attacked the enemy and captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of April the Emperor made another attack , capturing nineteen guns and six hundred prisoners . But these transient victories were of no avail against his vastly outnumbering foes . Greatly disappointed that Marquez did not arrive , after waiting ten days beyond the appointed time , he sent Prince Saim-Saim , with five hundred men , at midnight of April 17 , to cut his way through the enemy 's lines , and to bring up Marquez with all his forces , and to arrest Marquez should he refuse to comply . But Salm-Salm found the lines too strong to be broken , and he was driven back wounded . On the 1st of May the Imperialists made another attack , but were driven back with loss . During these dark days Maximilian was unwearied in his exertions . He shared all the deprivations of the soldiers ; visited the outposts often by night and dn foot ; after every battle he was found at the hospital speaking kind words to the wounded ; he placed the batteries and sighted the guns , going daily the rounds , wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white blouse . He was always accessible to those who had any petition to present , and the poorest man was as sure of a hearing as the most powerfuL Provisions became exhausted . The poor were starving . The little army was subsisting upon the flesh of horses and mules . There were now but six thousand Imperialist troops in Queretaro , and thirty thousand foes surrounded them . A council of war was held , and it was decided to make arrangements to march out with their whole force on the night of the 15th , and to cut their way through the hostile lines . It was thought that this could easily be done . By a rapid march they could soon reach the city of Mexico , where they would find large reinforcements and ample supplies . The sortie was to be made on the west side of th' city . Secret orders were given*to all the generals . No fires were to be lighted , and the strictest silence was to be observed . The troops were to move in the lightest marching order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazines . Light eight and ten pounders were to be taken , with supplies of grape and canister . Twelve hundred of the citizens of Queretaro were armed to remain behind and keep order in the city , with directions to surrender to General Escobedo at discretion twenty-four hours after the evacuation . These arrangements being all completed , the Emperor retired to rest about two o'clock on the morning of the 14th of May . At the same hour one of his Mexican generals , Lopez , in whom he had reposed unlimited confidence , silently crept from his quarters to admit the enemy into the city . The Emperor had regarded Lopez with much affection , had stood as godfather for his child , and had intrusted him with very responsible commands . On this occasion Lopez was the officer of the day . He had conspired with the enemy , and had engaged , it is said for a bribe of forty-eight thousand dollars , to open the way for them into the city . Threading his way in the darkness through his outposts , he reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who conducted him to the tent of Escobedo . After a brief interview he returned , and led the guard , under its commander , Garza , to an opening in the wall which he had left unprotected . Entering the dark and silent streets of the city , they soon reached a station of the Imperial troops . The officers had no suspicion of the fidelity of Lopez , and supposed that the troops accompanying him were their own comrades . Lopez ordered these Imperial troops to the rear , and placed the post in possession of the enemy . Thus he proceeded unti1* all the points under his control were in possession of the foe . Before the dawn nearly one-half of the city was held by the enemy . And now , to create bewilderment and confusion , men were sent to ring simultaneously all the bells of the city with great violence . An adjutant of Lopez , a Mexican , by the name of Yablouski , who was in the conspiracy , was anxions that Maximilian , who was universally beloved , should not receive any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small chambers or cells of the Convent of La Cruz . Yablouski awoke his secretary , Blaslo , and informed him that the enemy was in possession of the garden of the convent . Blasio immediately went to the room of the Emperor with the alarming tidings . Several officers , who also occupied the convent , were speedily assembled in the Emperor 's room . The confusion was so great in the gloom of the night that , though the convent was held by the enemy , Maximilian and his friends , heing mistakea for civilians , succeeded in escaping and in reaching the quarters of one of the Imperial cavalry regiments . The men were ordered immediately to mount , and to advance with all speed to an elevation called the Hill of the Bells . Just then the traitor Lopez made his appearance , // and , feigning fidelity , exclaimed , " Allis lost ! See , your Majesty , the enemy 's force is upon us . " As he spoke these words a body of the enemy 's troops were dimly discerned approaching . Maximilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavored to induce his victim to enter a house for concealment , where he could easily be secured . But the Emperor refused , determined , if possible , to reach the Hill , and to make a desperate stand there . A horse was brought for him , but he refused to mount as long as his friends were on foot . They reached the Hill , where they found about one hundred and fifty men . Soon the cavalry regiment arrived . Generals Miramon , Mejia , and Mendez were . makinghe most desperate exertions to rally their troops , aud join the Emperor on the Hill . General Mendez was surrounded .. His troops were mercilessly cut down . In his heroic endeavor to cut his way through the foe he was taken captive , and in cold blood shot . General Miramon met a body of the hostile troops whom he supposed to be his own men . A pistol-shot pierced his cheek . Faint with the loss of blood , he was seized , bound with ropes , and dragged to the Convent of Terricitas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching the Hill . The morning was now beginning to dawn . General Escobedo brought up his batteries and opened a deadly fire upon the little hand upon the Hill . As the missiles of death fell thickly around , the Emperor , weary of the woes which were overwhelming him , exclaimed to Prince Salm-Salm , " Oh how much would I now give for a friendly shell I " But death seldom comes when longed for . To remain as they were was only devoting his faithful adherents to destruction . The Emperor inquired of Generals Castillo and Mejia if they deemed it possible to cut through the lines of the enemy . General Mejia carefully examined , with his glass , the situation of the foe , and then deliberately replied : " Sire , it is impossible . But if your Majesty orders it , we will try . For my part , I am ready to die . " Maximilian , more than ready to die himself was not willing uselessly to sacrifice the lives of his friends . He ordered the white flags of surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confer with Escobedo upon terms of capitulation . A troop of cavalry rode up , and an officer demanded , with an oath , where was the Emperor . Maximilian stepped forward and said : " I am he . If you require any body 's life , take mine ; but do not harm my officers . I am willing to die , if you require it . But intercede with General Escobedo for the life of my officers . " The Emperor and his officers were placed upon horses and conducted down the Hill , and delivered to General Escobedo , who assured the Emperor that he should be treated as a prisoner of war . He was conveyed , with his officers , to the Convent of La Cruz , and was placed , as a prisoner , in the same room which scarcely an hour before he had occupied as an Emperor . Prostrated by toil , exhaustion , and sorrow , the Emperor for four days suffered severely from sickness . The captives were then removed to the Convent of Terricitas , where they remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Capuchinas . To blight his fair fame his enemies forged a mis -- erable proclamation , pretending it to be his . Here the Emperor was imprisoned in a cheerless apartment of brick and stone , with no windows save one opening into the corridor . An iron bedstead , two or three common chairs , and two small pine tables , constituted its only furniture . Generals Miramon and Mejia occupied adjacent rooms , and the three prisoners were allowed to visit each other . Sentinels were stationed at the doors of these apartments day and night , and a battalion of soldiers was quartered in the convent . While thus situafrd , Frederic Hall , Esq. , an American jurist , then in Mexico , was summoned by the Emperor to act as one of his legal advisers . Mr. Hall has published an account of these tragic scenes in a very impartial and instructive volume . To this work we are indebted for many of the details contained in this article . The Emperor met Mr. Hall with great cordiality , and said to him : " I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth . When I came to Mexico it was with the sincere belief that I was called by the will of a major . ity of the people . I told the Mexican deputation , when they first visited me at Miramar , in the fall of 1863 , that I would not accept the throne of Mexico until satisfied that a majority of the people sanctioned it . The deputation said that they believed that the majority of the people were in favor of my coming . But the evidence did not convince me . " When the deputation appeared the second time , In the following April , the proof they presented left no doubt upon my mind . My consent to accept the crown was based upon that belief . When I arrived at Vera Cruz and witnessed the demonstration in my favor , which continued to the capital of the nation , I was more convinced than ever of the truth of the statement made by the Mexican deputation . I never , in all Europe , saw a sovereign received with such enthusiasm as greeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his foes , and did not anticipate much mercy . On the 4th of June he said to Mr. Hall , " We must hurry with business . I have been talking with Miramon . He has counted up the time , and thinks they will shoot us on Friday morning . " Again , says Mr. Hall : " ile asked me , one day , if I thought that he and his two general , Miramon and Mejia , would be justified in escaping if they could . I answered him , Certainly , by all means . I have no idea that the courtmartial will do you justice . The law is clearly in your favor ; but from my discussion on some of the principles of law with the officers of the Government , I am quite satisfied that the determination is to convict you at all hazards . " ' As theEmperor was in no sense upon his parole it showed a very nice appreciation of honor that he should have questioned his right to es // cape . The Mexican lawyers who were associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as men , to save the Emperor , but in vain . The Juarez party clamored so loudly for his blood that it has been doubted whether Juarez could have saved him had he been disl ) osed to do so . " While the Emperor was sitting up in bed one day , " says Mr. Hall , " the name of Lopez came up in the conversation . The wife of Prince Salm-Salm was present , who remarked to me , What do you think ? A few days ago his Majesty heard that some man was in pursuit of Lopez to kill him ; and his Majesty sent a person to inform Lopez of the fact that he might be on his guard . ' I looked at the Emperor and observed , Did your Majesty do that ? ' He smiled , blushed a little , and answered , Yes , I did . ' I then said that that was more than I could have done to a man that had sacrificed me . He made some remark to the effect that he supposed but few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all foreigners to leave the city . Mr. Hall begged permission to remain as one of the counsel of the Emperor . his request was brusquely denied . Calling upon the captive he took a sad and affectionate adieu , being thus compelled to abandon him to his fate . Don Benito Juarez convened a council of war to pass judgment " upon Maximilian the Archduke of Austria and the so-called Generals , Miramon and Mejia . " This military court , to decide upon the life or death of these illustrious captives , consisted of a lieutenant-colonel for President , and six other officers who enjoyed only the rank of captain . Two law-officers of the Government conducted the prosecution . Twelve charges were brought against the Emperor . The substance of these charges was that Maximilian had come to Mexico as the agent of French intervention , and had excited and taken the lead in an unjust civil war . The defense was , that Maximilian had come , not of his own accord , but truly supposing that he was invited by the Mexican people to aid them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him was not constitutional , since the title to the Presidential chair of the Republic was claimed by Ortega as well as by Juarez , and the question was not yet decided which of the two was entitled to the office ; and that Maximilian was a prisoner of war , and was declared to be so by Escobedo , the commander-in-chief to whom he had surrendered himself . Mr. Hall draw up a protest , copies of which the Emperor wished him to send to this country , that distinguished men here might understand the position which he assumed . The trial was a farce . The clamors of the chieftains of the Juarez party had already settled the doom of the captive . The court-martial was convened on the 13th of June in the theatre of Iturbide . The court occupied the stage . A crowd filled the house . The Emperor did not appear before the court . He said , " If I am to be condemned my presence or absence will make no difference . " Just after midnight , in the morning of June 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the next day , approved the sentence , and ordered them to be shot at three o'clock in the afternoon of that day , Sunday , the 16th . Two of the Emperor 's council , not doubting the sentence of the court-martial , had repaired to San Luis Potosi to plead with Juarez for the life of the Emperor . Their entreaties produced no impression . Immediately upon heaiing , by telegraph , the tidings of the sentence , the council renewed their supplications . Juarez reluctantly consented to allow the condemned to live three days longer , that they " might arrange their business , " postponing the execution to Wednesday morning , the 19th . Baron Magnus , the Prussian Minister to the Imperial Government , pleaded earnestly with Juarez for the life of Maximilian , but in vain . In these hours of dismay , on the 15th of June , the tidings , which subsequently proved to be false , reached Queretaro that Carlota had died . The Emperor wrote to his friend , the Austrian embassador , Baron Largo : " I have just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news affects my heart , yet , on the other hand , under the present circumstances it is a consolation . I have but one wish on earth , that is , that my body may he buried next to that of my poor wife . I intrust you with this as the representative of Austria . I ask you that my legal heirs will take the same care of those who surrounded me , and of my servants , as though the Empre*s and I hadlived . " At noon of the 16th t*ae Emperor , not knowing of the reprieve , expected every moment that the officers would enter his cell to convey him to his execution . He took from his finger his marriage-ring and gave it to his physician , Dr. Bascb , with the request that he would carry it to the Archduchess , his mother , supposing at the time that his wife wa* dead . When he heard of the reprieve he took the ring back again and placed it upon his finger . The next day he wrote the following letter to Baron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look for in this world . My last wishes are limited to my mortal remains , which soon will be free from suffering and in the care of those who outlive me . My physician , Dr. Basch , will have my body transported to Vera Cruz . Two servants , Gull and Tudas , will he the only ones who will accompany him . I have given orders that my body be carried to Vera Cruz without any pomp , and that no extraordinary ceremony be made on board . I await death calmly , and I equally wish to enjoy calmness in the coffin . So arrange it , dear Baron , that Dr. Basch and my two servants he transported to Europe in one of the two war vessels . " I wish to be buried by the side of my poor wife . If the report of the death , of my poor wife has no foundation , my body should he deposited in some place until the Empress may meet me through death . " Have the goodness to transmit the necessary orders to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodness to do all you can to have the widow of my faithful companion in arms , Miramon , go to Europe in one of the two war vessels . I rely the more upon this wish being complied with , inasmuch as I have recommended her to place herself under my mother at Vienna . " Again I give you my most cordial thanks for all the inconveniences which I caused you , and I am , with the greatest good-will , yours , MAxuemamMe. " // Baron Magnus on the 18th repaired to Queretaro and immediately visited the Emperor . Overwhelmed in view of the cruel execution of one so young , so noble , so beloved , at 9 o'clock at night he sent the following telegram to the Junrez Government at San Luis Potosi : " Having reached Queretaro to-day , I am sure that the three persons condemned on the 14th died morally last Sunday ; and that the world so estimates it , as they had made every disposition to die , and expected every instant for an hour to be carried to the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to communicate to them the order suspending the act . The humane customs of our epoch do not permit that after having suffered that horrible punishment , they should he made to die the second time to-morrow . In the name then of humanity and Heaven , I conjure you to order their lives not to he taken . And I repeat to you again that my sovereign , His Majesty the King of Prussia , and all the monarchs of Europe , united by the ties of blood with the imprisoned Prince , namely , his brother the Emperor of Austria , his cousin the Queen of the British Empire , his brother-in-law the King of the Belgians , and also his cousins , the Queen of Spain and the Kings of Italy and Sweden , will easily understand how to give his Excellency Senor D. Benito Joarez all the requisite securities that none of the three prisoners will ever return to the Mexican territory . " The answer came back that " the President of the Republic did not deem it possible to pardon the Archduke Maximilian . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf of his companions : " I desire that you may preserve the lives of D. Miguel Miramon and B. Thomas Mejia , who , day before yesterday , suffered all the tortures and bitterness of death ; and , as I manifested , on being taken prisoner , that I should be the only victim . " MAxunaux . " The United States Government also made an earnest endeavor to save the life of the Emperor . As it was probably through the influence of the United States that the French troops were withdrawn , without which withdrawal the Empire would unquestionably have been established , it was supposed that a humane request from Secretary Seward would be heeded . But the application was repelled with insult as an impertinence . And Jnarez issued a proclamation , in which he ignored entirely any assistance from the United States , and declared that the Juarez party in Mexico , by its own unaided efforts , had driven out the French and crushed the miperialists . These results , he affirmed , were effected by " the good sons of Mexico , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , without the necessary elements of war . " The Emperor slept but little during the night . His soul was agitated with many thoughts , but not with fears . He remarked to one of his companions , " It is not so very hard to die after all . I feel as though I were going into battle . " At half past eleven in the evening , General Escobedo , influenced by some strange motive , called upon the condemned captive , whom he had promised should be treated as a prisoner of war . Maximilian received his merciless foe with his accustomed affability , and , at the request of Escobedo , gave him his photograph . After the denarture of the General , Maximilian obtained a couple of hours of troubled sleep , and at three o'clock rose and dressed himself to die . His spiritual adviser soon came , and he spent an hour in devotional exercises . Again he gave his marriage-ring to his physician , to be conveyed to his mother , still supposing Carlota to be dead . He then wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death in consequence of having wished to prove whether new political institutions could succeed in putting an end to the bloody civil war which has devastated for so many years this unfortunate country , I shall lose my life with pleasure if its sacrifice can contribute to the peace and prosperity of my new country . " Fully persuaded that nothing solid can he founded on a soil drenched in blood and agitated by violent commotions , I conjure you in the most solemn manner , and with the true sincerity of the moments in which I find myself , that my blood may be the last to be spilt-that the same perseverance which I was pleased to recognize and esteem in the midst of prosperity-that with which you have defended the cause which has just triumphed-may consecrate that blood to the most noble task of reconciling the minds of the people ; and iu founding , in a stable and durable manner , the peace and tranquillity of this unfortunate country . " At half past six in the morning three carriages stood before the door of the convent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soria , descended the stairs and entered the first . His condemned companions were placed in the others , each with his accompanying priest . The Emperor was dressed in a single-breasted black fi-ock coat , closely buttoned , with black neck-tie and pants , and a broad-brimmed Mexican hat . His physician , Dr. Basch , was so unnerved that he could not witness the execution of one so loved and revered . Five mounted soldiers led the procession . Then came a company of infantry . The three carriages followed , guarded by a battalion of infantry , one-half of whom flanked each side of the road . A rear-guard , composed of two hundred and fifty mounted men , closed the procession . Slowly they approached the Hill of the Bells , where the Emperor was captured , about a mile outside of the city . At the base of this bill , which was crowned by a fort , there were the remains of a stone-wall , which formerly consti tuted a part of the fortifications . " While the cort*qe advanced to the place of execution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surrounding multitude were pictured with sorrow . Crowds upon crowds rushed along , mournfully looking at the victims for the sacrifice , shedding tears , offering up prayers , and holding up the cross as the true emblem of consolation . Could one have dropped suddenly from the clouds among that gathered concourse he would have thought that a whole nation were in mourning . If ever there were proof of true affection from a whole people for living man , it was then . It was not idle curiosity that assembled that mighty host . Their actions , their expressions of grief , their contempt exhibited toward the soldiery , were too apparent to deceive the observing witnesses . " // About twenty minutes vere occupied in reaching the death-ground . Mnximilian , as he stepped from the carriage , took off his hat and gave it , with his handkerchief , to his servant , to be conveyed to his mother and brother . Stroking his flowing beard with his hand , as was his wont , he advanced with a firm step to the designated spot where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his side . The three emhraced each other affectionately , Maximilian saying , " We shall soon meet in Heaven . ' Then turning to General Miramon he said : " Brave men are respected by sovereigns . Permit me to give you the place of honor . " Thus speaking he placed General Miramon in the centre . Maximilian took his stand on General Miramon 's left , while General Mejia occupied his right . The officer in command read aloud the following order : " Soldiers ! In the name of the nation , he who solicits pardon for the three prisoners , or for any of them , will he shot . " About three thousand soldiers were drawn up so as to inclose three sides of a square , of which the hill and the wall composed the fourth side . Six soldiers , with their loaded muskets , were placed a few feet in front of each of the victims . The Emperor left for each of his executioners a twenty-dollar gold piece containing his effigy . As an opportunity was given for the condemned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Persons of my rank and birth are brought into the world either to insure the welfare of the people or to die as martyrs . I did not come to Mexico from motives of ambition . I came at the earnest entreaty of those who desire the welfare of the country . Mexicans ! I pray that my blood may be the last to he shed for our unhappy country ; and may it insure the happiness of the nation . Mexicans ! Long live Mex-ico be permitted to embalm his remains , and , in conjunction with Baron Magnus , convey them to his friends in Austria . The petition was forwarded to the Government by General Escohedo . It is difficult to conceive why such a request should have been refused . But a very peremptory refusal was telegraphed hack from San Luis Potosi by the Government . The telegram declared that the bodies of Miramon and Mejia should be immediately given to their friends , should they ask for them . But Escobedo was required to deny any one the right to make any disposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission to embalm the body , the request should be refused ; but Escobedo could provide that it might be done by Mexicans , " without prohibiting the presence of foreigners . " The body was then to be deposited in a secure place , with the customary religious acts . Baron de Largo , on the day of the execution , sent a telegram direct to Juarez : " I pray you to concede to me the body of Maximilian , that I may convey it to Europe . " The prompt response from the President was , " The right can not be granted you to dispose of the body of Maximilian . " Immediately after the execution the body , mutilated and gory , was taken back to the convent . Two Mexican physicians unskillfully undertook the office of embalming . Dr. Baseb , the Emperor 's physician , was allowed to be present , but not to render any assistance . After the work of embalming had been very impelfeetly performed , the body , having been twice varnished , and having passed through a process which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military boots , blue coat with gilt buttons , black uecktie , and hlack silk gloves . It was then placed in a coffin lined with zinc , and qwq supreme Government refused to deliver any corpse to the relatives who asked for it . " In conclusion he said , " I beg that you will condescend to answer my respectful solicitation , whatever that answer may be , that on returnIng to my country I may be able to justify myself before the family of the deceased Archduke in having done all on my part that I could to succeed in transporting the body to them. ? ' The reply which immediately came back was , " The President of the Republic has determined that for various and grave considerations the petition can not be acceded to . " On the 20th of August the Austrian Admiral Tegethoff arrived at Vera Cruz in the Austrian war steamer Elizabeth . Proceeding to the capital he had an audience with the Minister of Foreign Relations of the Juarez Government . He stated that he had come to Mexico to ask of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maximilian . The Minister , M. Lerdo , promised to submit the petition to *Tuarez ; but wished to know first in what character he made the solicitation . The Admiral replied that he came not on an " official mission , " but onlywith a private charge from the family ; from the mother of the Archduke and from his brother the Emperor of Austria ; that the natural feelings of affection and l ) iety created the strongest desire to possess and honor the mortal remains of the Archduke . The reply , which was soon returned , was that the Government " had reasons " for not acceding to the petitions of I*ron Largo , Baron Magnus , and Dr. Baseb ; that before deciding the question of the restoration of the remains , it was necessary that they should receive either " an official document from the Government of Austria or an express request from the family of the Archduke . " With this rebuff the Admiral retired . The body was now conveyed to the city of Mexico , and placed in the San Andres Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one was permitted to see it . More than two months passed away when Admiral Tegethoff returned . He brought to the Mexican Minister a letter from the Chancellor of the Austrian Empire . In this letter it was stated : " His Imperial and Royal Apostolic Majesty has the very natural desire that the mortal remains of his unfortunate brother may find their last repose beneath the vault that covers the ashes of the princes belonging to the house of Austria . The father , the mother , and the remaining brothers of the august deceased share in this desire with an equal earnestness , as do likewise all the members of the Imperial family . " The Emperor , my augnst master , has the confidence that the Mexican Government , listening to the sentiments of humanity , will not refnse to mitigate the just grief of his Majesty by facilitating the realization of this desire . To that end Vice-Admiral Tegethoff has been sent to Mexico with orders to address to the President a petition for the delivery to him of the remains of his Imperial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveyed to Europe . On my part I am charged , in my capacity as Minister of the Imperial Household , to request the kind interposition of your Excellency for the object of securing for the ViceAdmiral the authority necessary for that effect . " I have the honor , Excellency , of asking that you will convey , in anticipation , to the Chief Executive the expression of gratitude on the part of the august Imperial family for the granting of this petition ; and accept for yourself the expression of that same gratitude for the good offices which you may have to perform . " I avail myself of this occasion to preseat to your Excellency the assurance of my high consideration . " BUEsT. " chancellor of the Empire and Minioter ef the Imperial Honeehold . " The purpose of President Juarez , whatever that purpose was , seems now to have been attained . A polite answer was returned . " In accordance , " said the Mexican Minister , " with the dispositions of the President I have made known to Vice-Admiral de Tegethoff that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered to his care , that he convey them to Austria , and thus accomplish the object of his mission . " The remains were escorted by the Vice-Admiral and a Mexican force of one hundred men to Vera Cruz , which place they reached at four o'clock in the afternoon of the 25th of November . They were placed on board the Novara , the same ship which but a few months before had conveyed Maximilian with his happy bride to occupy the throne which had been so urgently pressed upon him . A table covered with black cloth stood in the centre of the saloon , and the coffin was placed upon it . An altar , bearing a cross with the image of the Saviour , stood at the head of the remains . The Austrian and Mexican flags were blended in the drapery of the coffin . Upon all was laid Maximilian 's sword . Around the coffin were six silver candlesticks , each containing a lighted wax - candle . Day and night two armed sentinels guarded the remains . Imposing religious services were performed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As she entered that port two Spanish war steamers commenced playing funeral marches . All the flags on the ships and forts were wreathed with black crape , and floated at half-mast . The harbor was crowded with boats , so eager were the people to get a view of the ship which bore the remains . As the Novara , at six o'clock in the evening of the 4th of December , steamed from the port , the air was filled with requiems from the martial bands , and the Spanish authorities did every thing in their power to honor the memory of the illustrious dead . As the vessel neared the Austrian coast it was met by the Austrian fleet and escorted to port . The remains of Maximilian are now mouldering to dust in the sepulebres of his fathers . Nobly he fulfilled the sad mission of his life . Thousands who never knew him will drop a tear of affection to his memory .
