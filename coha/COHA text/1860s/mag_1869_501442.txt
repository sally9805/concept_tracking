* subject of the present condition of the drama , which will be considered somewhat discursively in this article , could not be better introduced than by the following letter . Private although it was , I have no hesitation in using it thus , as I have voided it of every name or allusion that could indicate its writer or the persons on whose behalf he writes ; and , as in this manner he will receive a reply which , I suspect , he would otherwise be obliged to forego . 20th July , 1869 . My object in writing you at this time , is to obtain from you some information in regard to the drama and dramatic composition on behalf of tsvo persons , botb friends of toy family : one , a lady by birth and education , well known here , who possesses a remarkable dramatic talent , and has for the last three monthsunknosvn to her family and immediate friends , wiso would oppose her plan-been studying for the stage . She hds already , in this short space of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowles 's " Hunchback , " Lady of Lyons , Medea , and Lady Macbeth . She possesses time morale and *hysiqsee for a superior artist , has a quick and ready memory , a fine voice , great spirit and fire , isa genuine lover of the legitimate drama , and despises thoroughly the modern sensational and spectacular school . Her taste inclines to tragedy . She has taken a fcsv lessoiss from a lady long since retired from tise stage , who predicts a complete success for her if time can direct her studies amsd energies in the proper channel . SIse wislses to obtain from some dramatic scholar-rather tlsan from an actor-some fesv hints and advice in regard to the proper course of study for her . She wishes to know if there is any school , or studio , where education , or gesture , and stage business , are taught ; or are there any works upon the subject , to which she can be referred ? Unfortunately , she knows no one to whom she can apply . . . I have volunteered to aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Can you also inform her where she can obtain a list of the plays of the French amad German tragic drama . As she is a good Spanish scholar , she intends , at sonae future day , to translate some of the plays of Lope de Vega , time " Spanish Shakespeare , " as he is called . Many Fr*cla plays are badly translated , Medea for instance ; and it seems that translations of Elizabeth , Marie Antoinette , Mary Stuart , Ristori 's plays , catsnot be obtaitsed . The other person of whom I am about to speak , possesses a , *encdant for dramatic composition , or rather time adaptation of romantic tales-aol of time East Lynne or Griffith Ganist order , by any omeans  --  and epic poems to scenic representation . She wishes to kimow this : Suppose Byron 's " Bride ot Abydos , " or " Corsair , " or Moore 's " Veiled Prophet of Kohrassan , " were to be dramatized . How far , coinpatabie with propriety or the requirements of strict dramatic criticism , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tatter poem , would it be proper-as preliminary to subsequent evolmitioms of time plot-explanatory as it were  --  to introduce an initial scene between Azim ammd Zelica , as lovers , with appropriate dialogue , before she falls listo the hands of Mokanna . And also , in subsequent scenes , to introduce time merely narrative parts as d2alog-ues or soilioqoys in time mouths of subordinate characters , such as a captain of the Caliph 's guards or chief eunuch of the harem . Furthermore , also , as the poena is in iambic metre , could a different metre be occasionally introduced ( the " Bride of Abydos " contaimas three differemmi metres ) for the sake of vaeiety , atmd also ( what would be the most important ) to consider , perhaps as the poem in its rhyme might become somewhat monotonous to the ear of the auditor , because of its never-changing musical cadence - would it be proper to alter the versification of mammy parts , or even to introduce time pentameter blamak verse , as itt Shakespeare , or even prose , provided always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Will you be so kitmd and give my dramatic friend time benefit of your opinion on this point particularly . She begs to know , also , by whose authority were maimy interpolations made in Shakespeare 's plays . For instance , in " Romeo and Juliet " - in addition to interpolation ( I speak of time stage editio , m of Fretmch plays , as they are called ) there is an alteratmon of the last scene . In the original , Romeo dies immmmediateiy after swallowing time poison , and Juliet , awakening from her medicated trance , discovers isis dead body . Wisereas in time stage editioma the poison works slower , and allows dialogue between the distracted lovers , ere Romeo expires in her arms . Are " Immgomar , " the " Apostate , " " Evadne , " " Bertram , " and " Venice Preserved , " stammdard plays ? My desire to aid two very talented ladies in this matter is my only excuse for occupying your valuable time with this somewhat lengthy epistle . I hope you will be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and which I shall be happy to comumunicase to them .

She is known to some of the first people of New York , and wisises to keep her plan a profound secret , until size can surprise them on the theatrical boards . The lady who itastructs liner says she can make a splendid actress in the tragic drama . Hopimtg to hear from you soon , I am , very truly yours , RICHARD GRANT WHtTR , EsQ. , New York City . // first , in behalf of the literary fraternity , if I may be permitted to speak for them , direct attention to the nature and the extent of demands which are often made upon them uy laymen , of which this letter is a characteristic example . Here a man who is an entire stranger to the person whom he addresses , asks , in behalf of two other persons , also entire strangers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , to answer which would require an amount of labor that most professional men undertake reluctantly , even in that satisfying way , the way of business . A few hints and some advice in regal d to a proper course of study for the stage  --  a difficult subject , and one which could not be treated , even in the most cursory manner , in less space than two pages of this magazine ; directions where to find a list of the plays of the French and German tragic drama ; an opinion upon the prudence of translating some of the plays of Lope de Vega , " the Spanish Shakespeare , " and hints as to the feasibility of obtaining , and the desirableness of translating , the plays written for Ristori ; advice on the dramatizing of " The Bride of Abydos , " or " The Corsair , " or " The Veiled Prophet , " with a special opinion as to an introductory love scene " with appropriate dialogue , ' and as to turning Byron 's and Moore 's narrative passages into dialogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the propriety of mingling eight-syllable rhyme and blank verse and prose in one dramatic work , for the sake of variety , provided always the ideas and imagery of the poet were retained , ( the opinion on this point is to be particular ) ; the mode in which and the persons by whom the acting versions of Shakespeare 's plays were made , with some particular discussion of the last scene of " Romeo and Juliet ; " an excursus or monograph upon " Ingomar , " " Venice Preserved , " and other dramas , giving judgment whether they are standard plays , which involves a consideration of the question , What is a standard play ? - this is the trifling task which the writer of the letter set before the person whom he addressed , and from whom he hoped to hear soon . Writers of such letters always do have that hope , and that they do shows a cheery confidence on their part , and suggests a readiness to render service on the part of the literary craft which it is pleasant to contemplate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him a professional opinion involving half the labor that is required for a proper reply to those questions , and expect him to undertake the task without a good retaining fee No man in his senses would think of making such a request . And yet such requests are continually made of men whose profession is literature . I have known masses of manuscript upon which the writers hoped , nay , confidently expected , to found fame and fortune , sent for examination , and an opinion , with suggestions , to entire strangers , men every minute of whose working time was occupied , without the slightest hint of recompense , present or future , and from whom an intimation that this was proper resulted in a sullen withdrawal of the proposed laborious task . It speaks well for the general kindness of men of letters , who hare so little time and energy to spare , that these requests continue to be made . It must be that in most cases they are complied with , and not ungraciously . Certainly the case presented above is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; one of whom wishes to be an actress , the other a dramatic author , and both of whom despise not only burlesque but even the sensational drama . The former must not only scorn to rival or even to eclipse Miss Lydia Thompson in beauty and in saucy spritefulness , but disdain the extremely proper although sensational roles of Miss Bateman and Miss Maggie Mitchell : the latter holds herself far above Boucicault and Robertson and Dumas fils , and will do nothing less than turn epic poems into dramas , rewrite Byron for the // stage , and translate " the Spanish Shakespeare . " Their tastes incline to tragecly . This is not surprising : the tastes of gifted ladies in private life who wish to become dramatic authors or artists do usually have that serious , not to say gloomy and overpowering cast . To the youthful aspirant for dramatic honors , and particularly to female aspirants at whatever period of woman 's never-ending youth , the genius of the drama always appears with a bowl in one hand and a dagger in the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this generally leads to quick retirement from the stage , or a rapid transformation into a singing chambermaid or a ballet-girl ; in that of the sterner sex , to the role of general utility , heavy fathers , the second man in farces , or the clown of a circus . And venturing to speak for the gentleman who received this letter , a person for whom I have a great regard , but of whose opinion I have not so high an estimate as the polite and intelligent writer of the letter seems to have-I tell his fair clients frankly , and in all kindness that , if I know anything of the temper of the time , they are wasting their lives and their labor . If the one wishes to study and practice the higher kind of dramatic composition , particularly tragedy , for her own pleasure and mental improvement , printing her compositions at her own expense and olvincr them away to friends the ardor of whose attachment she wishes to cool ; if the other would be content to play tragedy alone in the seclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could both doubtless derive a great deal of satisfaction from so doing . But if they have a notion that they can make a decent living , the one by writing , the other by acting tragedy and scorning " the modern extravagant and sensational school , " they are miserably deluded . Ristori has done that , so did Rachel , but not in Great Britain or the United States ; and even on the continent of Europe they would fail to attain the success they had if they were to begin their careers now . What is the type of the successful modern drama ? " Formosa , " which , produced in London only a few weeks ago , is now ( the end of September ) played at six theatres in this country , and probably will hold the boards at all of them for two or . three months without interruption . Recently I said that " Rosedale " was the typical modern drama . And " Rosedale " or " Formosa , " " Formosa " or " Rosedale , " what essential difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " change places , and handy dandy , which is the justice and which is the thief ? " Except indeed that " Rosedale " may be somewhat the better play . As to their plots , and their incidents , and their spirit , and their moral-if we must prate about the moral of a play or a song-they are as unlike as possible . But in their dramatic character , which is the point of view from which we now regard them , they are as like , if not as twins , as members of one family . They have the same form , and they seek the same end by the same means . Those means , reduced to their elements , are simply two-realistic representation of every-day life in costume , scenery , language and manner , on the one hand , and on the other , the production on the eye or the mind of a sudden , strong sensation . The latter is necessary as a relief to the former ; or rather it is like the strong compensating color , the red and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green of heaven and earth satisfy the cravings of the eye for all the tints in the sunbeam ; or it may be compared to_the the sight of stirring events and striking catastrophes upon familiar ways and among familiar people . Commonplace personages and every-day motives are the web and woof of these dramas and their sort . The gre at playwrights dramatized the chronicles of the ages past ; the playwrights of to-day dramatize that chronicle of the day , the newspaper . " Formosa " is but our special correspondent 's letter about the Oxford and // Cambridge boat-race , and our own reporter 's account of the scandal about the captain of the Oxfords , and how he ruined himself by gambling and for Anonyma ; these welded together , then broken up into dialogue , and then put upon the stage with very fine scenes in which to recite it withal . But does it therefore do what playwrights are continually bidden to do , and continually boast that they are doing-hold the mirror up to nature ? Let us see . The principal personages of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , daughter of the sporting keeper of a little river-side inn , who goes to London and lives there the life of a courtesan of the highest class , and Tom Burroughs , a wealthy young Oxonian and captain of the University crew , who is deeply enamored of Formosa , and who is really loved by her . They have the usual surroundings of such people , notably , a great scoundrel who cheats Tom and leads him to ruin , and who , by threatening to expose Formosa to her parents , compels her to aid him in his designs . Tom also loves , but chiefly consents to be loved by a pattern young lady , supposed to be the daughter of a physician , in whose family she has been brought up , but whose real father is a convict , by whom she is claimed and whose fortunes she follows as if he had been the best of men and the tenderest of parents . These personages are all such as may be found in London by scores , with little search ; and the incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxing , and gambling , and love-making , and swindling , are in themselves hardly out of the track of every-day life . Even the issue of the plot-in which Tom Burroughs marries the pattern young woman , daughter of the convict , and Formosa , as we are left to suppose , gives up Tom and marries a wealthy gentleman who has been her devoted lover throughout the play-is so far within the bound of probability that most of us have known or heard of such disentanglements of complicated relations . At least one half of the interest of the play depends upon this reality of its structure , and a corresponding reality in the scenery and appointments with which it is presented . Everything on the stage is practicable , if not real . Excepting that the walls of the various buildings are of painted canvas instead of stones , or wood , or plaster , the scenes and properties are as real as if the personages were living the lives of the characters they assume ; and the beauty , or at least the realistic faithfulness of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the managers and the public as the greater part of the attraction of the entertainment . But " Formosa " ( which I take as the principal subject for examination merely because it is a fine example of its kind , and is now fresher in the minds of most readers than any other play ) notwithstanding this careful conformity to facts , this reality in words and in things , is belittling and distorting as a mirror of nature , and a coarse daub as a picture of life . It is a mingling of a bald and utterly insignificant reproduction of real life , with the effects of a burlesque spectacular extravaganza . In the very first scene , after some dialogue at the river-side inn , which is as faithful , as commonplace , and as colorless as the idealess work of a mechanical photographer , the Oxford crew come in after a row on the Thames ; and what do the ) ' do , but take out some trestles , or carpenters ' horses , which they evidently keep for that purpose , and bestriding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorously on dry land , with no oars in their hands , making believe hard enough to satisfy Dick Swiveller 's little Marchioness ! As burlesque this is only tolerable ; as a representation of real life , it is not laughable , but ridiculous . And yet the taste which dramatists must please , if they would not starve , is shown by the fact that this absurd performance calls forth great ap // plause , and is nightly demanded a second time . Such is the humor in which people now go to the theatre , that if Tom Burroughs were at any period of the play , even the most serious , to climb a greased pole or go flying into the air on a broom-stick , or sing " Villikins and his Dinah , " they would applaud , and , if possible , obtain a repetition of the feat . The dialogue of " Formosa " rarely makes even a slight impression upon the delighted audience , and is so absolutely void of thought or even of significance , that it is difficult to remember in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest semblance to the result of thought that I noticed are two speeches of Formosa . Discovering that Tom Burroughs has received her love and enjoyed her beauty , without really returning the former , she says : " You have allowed yourself to be loved . My passion has been your plaything . I will never forgive you . " Her real lover , Spooner , the genuineness of whose feeling and the simplicity of whose character make him about the most estimable and lovable personage in the play , but whom of course she pities and at whom she laughs a little , offers her a bouquet with a jewelled holder . She says : " I have told you never to give me a present of that kind . " But , " he replies , " you take em from the other fellows . " " Do n't you see , " is her rejoinder , " that I wish to preserve the one true love I have pure ? " * This is well enough , and the sentiment in either case is not above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But how barren , and unsuggestive , and insignificant the language . And so throughout the play , of which these speeches are unfairly favorable specimens , there is not a sentence which in itself is of any value , and which , uttered out of the scene or unexplained by the action , would have any meaning . Excepting in so far as they are limittd by the action , the personages might as well say anything else as what they do say . At only one point does the dialogue touch any question of morals . Eden , a young earl and a friend of Tom , is endeavoring to induce him to leave his brilliant mistress . He says , " Tom , you ca n't love both these women . " Tom answers , " But I do . " This seems to be a mere adaptation of the significant Yankee story of the judge* s warning . " Do n't you see ? you ca n't do that ; " and the reply , " But do n't you see ? I hey . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now for consideration . But , however it may be decided on general principles , in this case , as Tom , in the end , like most men , gives up Formosa , not for Formossisima , but for Carissima , the handsome , manly fellow is forgiven by the fairer part of his audience , to each of whom he for the time represents her lover . For women never tire of forgiving sins when they love the sinner . As to the moral character of " Formosa . " it surely is without the slightest immoral taint or tendency . This view of it , which has been taken by its most subtle and profound as well as irreproachable British critic , has , however , been supplemented by the objection that the mere putting of such a woman as Formosa on the stage is a great mistake , because it is a violation of the traditionary creed and theory , that " a properly brought up young woman " is sexually ignorant and innocent-supremely innocent , because absolutely ignorant . " There is nothing in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an English maiden . " To argue with people who believe that girls can live in the world and grow into women in ignorance that they have sexual functions and sexual passions , and that even if they did not learn this from without they would learn it from within * I have not read " Formosa , " and I give these speeches only as I caught them at the performance . // would be like wasting time in explaining the nature of light to a man blind from his birth . But as to the moral tone of the young women , or of a large proportion of them , who see this play in London , there have been lately some revelations in a high quarter , " The Pall Mall Gazette , " which are worthy of consideration . That journal has published , during the last few months , a series of letters upon social subjects which profess to be written by an Oriental person named Azamat Batuk , but which are from the pen of a keen observer of London society who is thoroughly acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not many weeks ago , recount and comment upon an experience of the writer among those cleanest of all things in the world , English maidens , which is very instructive . Desiring female acquaintance , but being a stranger , he is delighted to learn that , as he expresses it in the imperfect English which he assumes , " the most charming young ladies , whose official acquaintance he could not obtain unless he spent half a year in getting letters of introduction , can be very easily made on a walk or in some place of public entertainment . " He soon makes such an acquaintance in the person of the beautiful Miss Lucy Z who , coming out of a shop as he is passing , drops her purse , which bursts , scattering its contents over the pavement . He helps her to gather them up ; but two half sovereigns have rolled out of sight . This she laments in the face of her admiring assistant , because she was just going to buy a new bonnet . However , she says , the bonnet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , have a walk together , in which she proposes that they should go to the opera-with her sister , of course . They go ; she and her sister taking him up in the family carriage at a corner . On the way Miss Lucy discovers that she has left gloves and handkerchief at home , and begs her cavalier to stop at a shop and get them for her  --  the gloves , " lemon , six and a half , with two buttons , " the handkerchief " with some lace " - which , of course , be does . He remarks that the gloves , and the handkerchief and the box , etc. , cost him a five pound note . He next meets her in the family pew at a fashionable church , where her mother , an elegant matron , also appears . He puts his charmer into the family carriage , and tips the eminently respectable coachman , who takes it all as matter of course , and touches his hat in that thoroughly English manner which so eloquently and lacohically says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have just enjoyed . They meet again at the Marble Arch in the Park , and , going thence , stop at all the shops , where Miss Lucy admires all the prettiest things , and remarks how cheap they are , and finally , not being asked to take anything , herself selects a handsome fan , which is to be paid for by her admirer . Now the writer , who is evidently of authority in that highest of highclass English newspapers , " The Pall Mall Gazette , " expressly warns his readers against assuming that Miss Z is a courtesan , and tells them that she is of a respectable family , lives in a fashionable quarter of the town , is well educated , and that hers-let this be noted- " is not an exceptional case . " And this is the ignorant and innocent English maiden of the upper middle class ! Here is a plain confession , a direct charge , made at home by those who know , that girls of that condition , while restraining their own passions , are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their own profit-that by humoring desires which they do not mean to gratify , they get presents of articles of dress , and jewels , and other means and appliances of luxury . Faugh ! Which is the cleaner creature , Miss Lucy Z , or Formosa ? which is the ko ; ies/ woman ? And can any entirely sane person believe that by the sight of Formosa and her mode of life , upon the stage , anything before hidden to this British maiden // would be revealed ? True , she might learn something from Formo*a-good faith and generosity . Of the wit of this play , which is quite as witty as any successful play of the period , the most brilliant and most applauded example is a speech of the returned convict , who when asked why he is so earnest in his inquiries after his daughter , whom he has not seen or cared to see for many years , and upon whom he is seeking to quarter himself , replies : " Ven ye ca n't do for hourselves , the nateral feelins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prodigal son to the ome of our hoffspring . " This is amusing enough ; but it has no place in comedy : it is broad burlesque , caricature of the most extravagant kind . So it is when the villanous old half-pay major says that Tom 's extravagant conduct is to be attributed to a confusion of drinks ; that he fell " because he deserted simple brandy and water ; he mixed his liquors and consequently lost his moral taste . " This is humorous , in so far as it has humor , from sheer absurdity ; but it gets the speaker applause and laughter . But what can we expect of the dialogue of a play which is written with the intention that music shall be played through all the speeches The fact is that " Formosa " is a mere contrivance for amusing people by the sight of beautiful scenery and fine dresses , and by a glimpse at a very real representation of free life among the upper classes in England , and by stage tableaux z'lvauts carefully composed and illuminated with various-colored calcium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of delectation is a commonplace story of every-day life which is told in the form of dialogue . There is not a dramatic motive , or a dramatic evolution of character , from the first scene to the last . The play is played by the manager . Mr. Harry Palmer performs " Formosa . " He has bought of Mr. Boucicault the right to put himself on the stage in certain situations , and in certain dresses . Sometimes he appears in dark hair and sober gown , at others gorgeous in golden locks and corn-colored moird antique ; he is moral and sententious in the former condition , and free and easy in the latter . He is now a handsome fellow in a blue jersey , then a stout party of the other sex , now an old scamp , then a pretty simple girl ; what he is , depending , be it observed , entirely on his outside . What he says is of no importance ; and what he is within , his audience neither know nor care . It is Mr. Harry Palmer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching over his interests with eager eye ) or behind the scenes scolding a ballet-girl , or assuaging the griefs and soothin* the jealous rivalry of two leading ladies , ( " Tantas comfonere tiles / " ) but he plays . He could not play " Macbeth , " I venture to say , or " Kino* Lear , " or even " Hamlet ; " but he can and does play " Formosa " straight through . And this is the play of the period ! This is the style of drama which now delights the public of Great Britain and the United States , filling the principal theatres of the principal towns of both countries evening after evening for weeks , and it is safe to say , months together . Cheers go up on one side and the other at the return of the legitimate drama , and what is welcomed with music and feasting turns out to be this il-legitimate creature , who has nothing in common with the prodigal son but harlots and riotous living-not even repentance . Lydia Thompson is better than this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burlesque makes no pretence ; it has no purpose but amusement ; it professes no excellence but the flavor of fun and of satire . We are not called upon to believe , or to make believe , that burlesque means anything . its only end is entertainment , careless gayety of heart-which the world , and America chiefly of all the world , is now so much in need of . It professes to teach nothing , mor // al or immoral . It is as void of moral purpose as " A Midsummer Night 's Dream , " " The Comedy of Errors , " or " The Merry Wives of Windsor . " It offers as its attractions the enjoyment of fun , and the sight of beauty ; and it does this without hypocritical pretence of any kind , either in the way of art or of morality . And as to the dramatic art of the play of the period , whether it is called " Formosa , " or " Ours , " or " The Flying Scud , " or " The Streets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me rather a clown in a circus that is , if he is not a Shakespearian clown , endeavoring to make his wit go pregnant with wisdom from whose sickly humor I should flee to seek a little healthy amusement in sound practical joking . What the attraction of the legitimate drama is now-a-days , we have been told by the manager of Drury Lane Theatre , in a letter full of instruction valuable to all those who wish to live by the stage , whether as playwrights or players . He confesses that for more than six years past he has produced the best plays of Shakespeare , Byron , Milton , and Goethe ; that to perform these plays he secured the services of actors of the highest reputation ; and that he produced them with the best scenery that could be painted by the most accomplished scene-painters in London . The result was that he lost money . Had not " pantomime and Christmas " come to his rescue-butlesque pantomime-he would have been ruined . Having played the legitimate drama to almost empty stalls and boxes , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and having found that Shakespeare spelled ruin and Byron bankruptcy , he followed the example of some of his fellow-sufferers , and , laying aside the legitimate drama , he produced " Formosa . " The consequence is that his boxes and stalls are filled with an elegant and cultivated audience , including ladies " the highest and most respectable in London , " whose names he is ready to show on his box book , ladies being in fact " a large majority " of this part of his audience . The amount taken at his box office " for securing stalls and private boxes alone to see Formosa ' exceeds the gross contents of the theatre to witness Macbeth . ' " Yet more , when he produces Shakespeare " a class of literary men and dilettanti that profess to deplore the degradation of our times and who are entitled by courtesy to admission to the theatre , rarely ask for orders ; " but since he has produced " Formosa , " he has been " overwhelmed with applications from this quarter for private boxes for their wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " of " The Streets of London , " of " Ours , " and of the play of the period whatever its name , or whatever the little story that tacks its costumes and its scenery together , is not only not legitimate , it is no.t even dramatic . Its motive is not dramatic at all , it is purely spectacular . And spectacle-that is , something funny , or beautiful , or sensational to look at , no matter what is said by the personages who figure in it , is , excepting the broad burlesque of farce , almost the only form of theatrical entertainment now paid for by the public . Spectacle and sensation must be united for us , unless we have the caricature of sensation , which forms the staple of burlesque ; and the spectacle must be of something that is of our own period . We like to see our own parlors and kitchens put upon the stage , and will go a mile or two and pay money to see that which we can see better and for nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do and say in the scenes-we are not exacting , except on one point : It must not express too much thought or feeling , and it had better not be too witty . Mere beautiful scenery , and costumes , and wit will not command a profitable succession of full houses . Mr. Lester Wallack , on taking his theatre into his own hands again , did homage to the legitimate drama by the production of " The // School for Scandal . " It was put upon the stage with that elegance and correctness for which his stage management is justly celebrated . It was played throughout well enough to please any public that really enjoys the performance of comedy . But after the first representation , which drew a large audience , not only because it was the first , but because it was the occasion of the return of a favorite and charming lady to this theatre , the audience fell off ; and it was soon withdrawn . On its third representation , on the fair evening of a fair day , good seats were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The " School for Scandal " is old . True , but the public is not old . Year by year the world renews its youth . There comes up with unvarying succession an audience to which all the great old things are new . " The School for Scandal , " although written ninety-two years ago , is as new to a new audience as if it were written yesterday . But by the time that these lines are read there will be more theatre-going people in New York under thirty-five years old who have never seen Sheridan 's first comedy than who have not seen Boucicault 's last . " The School for Scandal " is not brought forward here as an example of great dramatic merit , either in its construction , its personages , or its language . It is full of wit , but that is all its claim to admiration . There is in it no development of character , no thoughtful connection of its incidents or the experience of its personages with the eternal truth of human nature . Those personages are , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , photographically-correct outside representations of types of the period . And in correctness and variety of trait , our plays are rather the better . Sir Peter Teazle is a testy old bachelor who has married a young wife Lady Teazle is a giddy , saucy young woman who for a fine establishment has married an old man . This we know when they first come upon the stage , and we know nothing more of them , or of any of the subordinate personages in the last scene than in the first . They do not develop their characters with the progress of the play. ; and for one very good reason among others-they have no real characters to develop . They are mere puppets to speak Sheridan 's wit , which is very keen and brilliant , but which itself is utterly devoid of character-dramatic character . Sir Benjamin Backbite , Lady Sneerwell and Mrs. Candour might exchange speeches , and so might Rowley and Sir Oliver ( except such as mention facts ) without the least violation of dramatic propriety or the production of incongruous effect . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy , at once too unsensational and too unfamiliar for our dramatic taste . Our day has , however , produced one kind of dramatic performance , the success of which has been brought forward as a fact quite at variance with the opinion expressed by me in a former article , " The Age of Burlesque , " that the public interest in emotional drama was dying , if not quite dead . " Rip Van Winkle , " " Leah , " " Fanchon , " and " Solon Shingle " are fair examples of this sort of play . And certainly it would seem that a period that can produce and richly re*vard such impressive and such finished acting as that of Mr. Jefferson and Miss Bateman , not to rate so highly that of Miss Mitchell and Mr. Owens , admirable although it is , was one in which the professions of the playwright and the player flourished . But , premising that in the essay in question I particularly excepted these plays by name from the scope of my remarks , * I can not but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those above named , and the fact that an actor can go on playing one part for years to thronged houses , as evidence , strong and unequivocal , of the decadence of the drama . This is the starring THE GALAXY for August s869 , p. 258. // s**stem , that grand step downward of the theatre , carried out to its absurd but legitimate conclusion , by which to all began two thousand live hundred years ago . Rip Van Winkle , an impersonation by Mr. Jefferson , is one of the most perfect studies of human nature ever seen upon the stage . The actor reveals to us not only the emotions , but the passing , inconclusive thoughts that disturb 1*t do not rouse the weak brain of the poor , good-natured cast-away . " Rip Van Vinkle , " a drama , is too weak to bear the tenderest touch of criticism , and is remarkable for nothing but the manner in which it coarsens and vulgarizes Irving ' s charming version of the old Dutch legend . Nor can a conclusion favorable to the dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Mr. Jefferson 's performance of this drama . For those parts of the play that best please his audiences are his tipsy scenes and the ddnoziement  --  the very passages in which Irving 's conception is degraded ; and when the actor represents Rip as waking from sleep to woe , and elevated by mystery and sadness above himself ; so that the white-haired , white-bearded face turns upon you with an expression worthy of the grief of half-crazed Lear , the people laugh . And in Solon Shingle the character is a very careful and finished , though strongly caricatured working up of a minute study from nature ; but the drama is a wretched burlesque . A good play is written to be played ; but just in porportion as it is good , that is , dramatic in the higher sense , will it give pleasure when it is read . And thus the dramatic value of these plays , " Rip Van Winkle , " " Leah , " " Fanchon , " and " Solon Shingle , " may be fairly judged by asking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unendurable . And yet Mr. Robertson 's new play , " Progress , " which is the most thoughtful and readable of its class , being produced at Wallack 's , and worthily performed , fails to make an impression even on the comparatively cultivated audiences of that theatre , and hardly holds the stage a fortnight . The success of a play now-a-days as a money-making entertainment is thus inversely as its real dramatic merit , according to the " legitimate " standard . The position which I took in a previous article , that we now-a-days are too intolerant of displays of emotion in others , too much ashamed of them ourselves , to permit us to enjoy serious drama , not to say tragedy , heartily , and which has provoked not a little adverse criticism , is one which , after further consideration of the subject , I hold more firmly than before . It is one , too , in which I find myself sustained by other observers of the temper of the times . The vcry title of that article , published in the August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage of Charles Reade 's novel , " Put Yourself in His Place , " which was published in the next number of this magazine : " Come , young lady , " said Mr. Raby , " I know it is an age of burlesque ; but let us spare the sacraments , the altar and such trifles . " My article was printed and published before that chapter had left the other side of the Atlantic . I merely happened to see and say what Charles Reade also saw and said at the same time . In another excellent novel , one of the best of the second class , and one that gives evidence of a closer and more apprehensive study of the time than is shown in books that rank higher as works of art-Mr . Shirley Brooks 's " Sooner or Later , " I find the following striking reduplication of the assertion made in that article , that the habit of civilized men as regards emotion has changed , and that we now do not seem to be equal o a grand scene of passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , // and that we cower under a tempest of feeling , and seek refuge in scorn and ridicule . Charity Faunt , a reprobate but very intelligent old woman , drives a disappointed and ruined young man mad with taunts . After he has left her she says : He is a stronger and a weaker man than I thought to find him . I believed he would have struck me , and I do n't know that I should have hated him any more for that . I hate ntilksops . But people are not what tlsey were . Men are all so civil and timid in these days . Nobody has spirits for a real row . And to think what I have seen when a man had the pluck to go half mad and show it . " Yet more to the purpose is the following passage from an essay on " Audiences , Old and New , " which I find in the London " Spectator " of May last : The temper of audiences haa changed-changed in reality as well as seeming . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suppress the display of emotion , but have ceased to feel it , except when more deeply moved . . . . Watch any audience witnessing Mr. Fechter 's very striking representation of Othello , and you will see that a very slight increase in the fury and the unreasonableness would excite disgust ; that the stalls and the boxes , even while applauding , watch his face critically , with something of contempt , not for him , but for all that tempest of emotion . . . . Is there not , besides the decline of sympathy with the violent expression of emotion , a decline in the capability of emotion itself ? We are inclined to suspect there is ; that the critical , self-conscious temper which has been prevalent for most of this century , has weakened , slightly , the faculty of emotion , and that the conviction , now so general , that nothing is quite so wonderful , or so fearful , or so important as it seems to be , has deadened our se , tsibilities . . . . The uneducated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on them a tragic actor catt still produce a very startling effect-as great an effect as on imaginative children . The faint dislike for tragedy which is so decided an intellectual feature of our time must be due , in part , at all events to a kind of thickening of the chords which vibrate to tragic feeling . " It will be found , I think , that the views of my August article are only a little in advance of general opinion here , and were , in fact , behind those of one writer in England . I , at least , am willing to leave them without further defence . As to burlesque , the death of which was noisily announced by those who thought they had killed it , of whatever fate it is worthy , we may be sure it is not dead . Here it may have been suffering , in July , the fate of the man who went down from Jerusalem to Jericho ; and is true that the priest and the Levite had passed by on the other side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , according to all accounts , Miss Lydia Thompson and her company have been enjoying renewed life and uninterrupted prosperity . Observe , too , the significance of the following paragraph , which recently appeared in the leading columns of the " New York Tribune : " The epidemic of theatrical burlesque still rages in Europe . Herve 's " Petit Faust ' is to be even translated into German . Nothing wilt be held too sacred for transmogrification after this . " Faust " is , perhaps , a work of the purest literary art in any language ; and with all its passages of pathos , sentiment , and tragedy , it is not without a comic element of its own . All is now to be hashed together to make fools laugh . We are curious to know what will be done with that last , dreadful scene of a betrayed and despairing girl in church . The present tendency of dramatic writing is to tum all serious things into extravagant ridicule , a : * Hamlet , Othello , Macbeth , are nnetamorphosed into ntountebanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse to come ? It " argues nothing of the kind . Never was culture so deep , never so widely diffused as it is now . " This " shows merely a change in the public taste for theatrical entertainment . No , it is in vain to blink this matter . There is no unwiser course than to spend time and strength in arguing that that can not be which is . Whether the days of the legitimate drama are absolutely numbered , it would be unsafe to predict . But there can be no question that at present it has no hold upon the public , and that the tendency of the age , socially , intellectually , morally , is to the gradual , but not very slow extinction of the drama as an intellectual entertainment . Even now , in this respect , between the burlesque of the period and the play of the period , there is but little to choose .
