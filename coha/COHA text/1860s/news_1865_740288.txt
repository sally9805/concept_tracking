txt There is nothing in military literature or history comparable with the report of Lieut. - Gen. U. S. GRANT , which was published- complete in the TIMES of yesterday . It is more compact than CESAR , more lucid than Jorars-I , more pungent than NAPIER . It covers the operations of a mightier army , operating over a vaster surface , than ever was marshaled by any Commander . It will command the attention of the soldiers of the world , and will be read by the generations as long as the great war of secession is remembered . The report embraces but one year out of the four years of war . But it was a year in which such multitudinous battles were fought and won  --  in which such a bewildering mass of movements were made from points all but innumerable  --  in which such a number of commanding officers figured honorably or otherwise  --  that it seems in perusing the report , which embraces the whole in its scope , as if we were reading of a century of battles covering the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military reporter was by no means easy . Not that it was so difficult for him to make a compact record of the greater and lesser campaigns which he directed and superintended  --  though that was by no means a simple matter . Not that the mere extent of territory covered , magnitude of numbers involved , or complexity of operation included , made clearness of statement hard ? though they almost necessarily did so . But the most difficult of all matters of treatment in such a report was that of personality  --  that which established the historical position , fixed the station of honor or dishonor for all time to come , of each of the prominent officers holding command under the LieutenantGeneral . What Gen. GRANT , in this report , says about any of his subordinates , about their campaigns or actions , is , as near as may be , the final verdict . The judgments are hardly , in any case , reversible . Parties who consider themselves aggrieved may make explanations , put forth rebutting testimony , write elaborate pamphlets . or books in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and will quickly pass away and be forgotten , while the original verdict of the Lieutenant-General in each case will stand permanently and unaffected . This put a great and perilous responsibility upon the eminent reporter , not merely from an individual , but from a public point of view . It called for such a clear knowledge of all the facts , such a large sense of justice , such freedom from selfishness , favoritism and passion , such perfect independence of character , and such courage of statement , that we could hardly expect to find any one  --  gifted with all these qualifications . In nearly all cases GRANT gives confirmation to what was the popular judgment of the hour . SrIEIntAN , SHERIDAN , SCHOFIELD and THOMAS were the admired of the people , as they are the praised of GRANT . With others , as Berms and GILLMORE , he is significantly silent . ROSEGRANS he speaks of rather harshly ; Baldy Sacra he treats severely , and with BUTLER he deals at once scornfully , and , in a Western sense , viciously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous officers of only less eminence than these , are dismissed with significant or insignifiant praise or blame . In some of these and other instances , it must be allowed , the judgment of the country  --  less capable and less well informed , of course , than that of Gen. Gaarr  --  has heretofore differed from that officially put forth in this report . GILLMORE was always a renowned name with the people ; Baldy SMITH had a reputation which was not diminished by his removal from active service ; RosEcnasts stood for two years among the foremost names in the army of the Union ; while , on the other hand , we think that so far as public opinion was concerned , Gen. HUNTER only got credit for a minimum amount of soldierly capacity . Except with the political and personal partisans of Gen. BUTLER , we imagine that GRANT 'S criticisms upon his military career will be considered severely just . BUTLER is charged with direct violation oP orders in one case , with impertinent assumption in another , and again and again with the grossest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most damaging results ; and he states that finally his request for his removal was peremptory . In all the judgments and estimates of action and character , however , Gen. GRANT is thoroughly unimpassioned and self-possessed ; and if occasionally ho uses vigorous language , he generally leaves the impression that it is justified by fact . Near the close of his report , after recounting in compact detail all the events of the year 's history , Gen. GRANT sets forth his estimate of the relative warlike capacities of the soldiers from the Eastern and Western sections of the country . It was his fortune , he says , to see both of them fighting battles , and he gives it as the result of all his observation that there is no difference in their fighting qualities ; while , elsewhere , in the same paragraph , he gives the enemy credit for the most herbulean deeds of valor on the field of battle . So that , in this respect , Gen. GRANT 4riata all Americans from all sections upon a level . We imagine that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of all parts of the United States .
