GYPSY BREYNTON By ELIZABETH STUART PHELPS New York Dodd , Mead and Company Entered according to Act of Congress , in the year 1866 , by GRAVES &; YOUNG , in the Clerk 's Office for the District Court of Massachusetts Copyright , 1894 , by Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward . PREFACE . Having been asked to write a preface to the new edition of the Gypsy books , I am not a little perplexed . I was hardly more than a girl myself , when I recorded the history of this young person ; and I find it hard , at this distance , to photograph her as she looks , or ought to look to-day . She does not sit still long enough to be " taken . " I see a lively girl in pretty short dresses and very long stockings ,  - -  quite a Tom-boy , if I remember rightly . She paddles a raft , she climbs a tree , she skates and tramps and coasts , she is usually very muddy , and a little torn . There is apt to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a laugh in her eyes . Wherever there is mischief , there is Gypsy . Yet , wherever there is fun , and health , and hope , and happiness ,  - -  and I think , wherever there is truthfulness and generosity ,  - -  there is Gypsy , too . And now , the publishers tell me that Gypsy is thirty years old , and that girls who were not so much as born when I knew the little lady , are her readers and her friends to-day . Thirty years old ? Indeed , it is more than that ! For is it not thirty years since the publication of her memoirs ? And was she , at that time , possibly sixteen ? Forty-six years ? Incredible ! How in the world did Gypsy " grow up ? " For that was before toboggans and telephones , before bicycles and electric cars , before bangs and puffed sleeves , before girls studied Greek , and golf-capes came in . Did she go to college ? For the Annex , and Smith , and Wellesley were not . Did she have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edit a Quarterly Review , or sing a baby to sleep ? Did she write poetry , or make pies ? Did she practice medicine , or matrimony ? Who knows ? Not even the author of her being . Only one thing I do know : Gypsy never grew up to be " timid , " or silly , or mean , or lazy ; but a sensible woman , true and strong ; asking little help of other people , but giving much ; an honor to her brave and loving sex , and a safe comrade to the girls who kept step with her into middle life ; and I trust that I may bespeak from their daughters and their scholars a kindly welcome to an old story , told again .

Hon. Gypsy Breynton , Esq. , M. A. , D. D. , LL . D. , &c.,; &c.; Gypsy Breynton , R. R. " Tom was very proud of his handwriting . It was black and business-like , round and rolling and readable , and drowned in a deluge of hair-line flourishes , with little black curves in the middle of them . It had been acquired in the book-keeping class of Yorkbury high school , and had taken a prize at the end of the summer term . And therefore did Tom lean back in his chair , and survey , with intense satisfaction , the great sheet of sermon-paper which was covered with his scrawlings . Tom was a handsome fellow , if he did look very well pleased with himself at that particular moment . His curly hair was black and bright , and brushed off from a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moustache just visible above his lips , and that irresistible twinkle to his great merry eyes , it was no wonder Gypsy was proud of him , as indeed she certainly was , nor did she hesitate to tell him so twenty times a day . This was a treatment of which Tom decidedly approved . Exactly how beneficial it was to the growth within him of modesty , self-forgetfulness , and the passive virtues generally , is another question . The room in which Tom was sitting might have been exhibited with profit by Mr. Barnum , as a legitimate relic of that chaos and Old Night , which the poets tell us was dispelled by the light of this order-loving creation . It had a bed in it , as well as several chairs and a carpet , but it required considerable search to discover them , for the billows of feminine drapery that were piled upon them . Three dresses ,  - -  Tom counted , to make sure , one on the bedpost , one rolled up in a heap on the floor where it had fallen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . What with kerosene oil , candle drippings , and mugs of milk , Gypsy managed to keep one dress under the benzine treatment all the time ; it was an established institution , and had long ago ceased to arouse remark , even from Tom . There was also a cloak upon one chair , and a crocheted cape tied by the tassels on another . There was a white tippet hanging on the stovepipe . There was a bandbox up in one corner with a pretty hat lying on the outside , its long , light feather catching the dust ; it was three days now since Sunday . There were also two pairs of shoes , one pair of rubbers , and one slipper under the bed ; the other slipper lay directly in the middle of the room . Then the wardrobe door was wide open , it was too full to stay shut , upon a sight which , I think , even Gypsy would hardly want put into print . White skirts and dressing-sacks ; winter hoods that ought to have been put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trimming ; a calico dress that yawned mournfully out of a twelve-inch tear in the skirt ; a pile of stockings that had waited long , and were likely to wait longer , for darning ; some rubber-boots and a hatchet . The bureau drawers , Tom observed , were tightly shut ,  - -  probably for very good reasons . The table , at which he sat , was a curiosity to the speculative mind . The cloth was two-thirds off , and slipping , by a very gradual process , to the floor . On the remaining third stood an inkstand and a bottle of mucilage , as well as a huge pile of books , a glass tumbler , a Parian vase , a jack-knife , a pair of scissors , a thimble , two spools of thread , a small kite , and a riding-whip . The rest of the table had been left free to draw a map on , and was covered with pencils and rubber , compasses , paper , and torn geography leaves . There were several pretty pictures on the walls , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window was unlooped , and you could write your name anywhere in the dust that covered mantel , stove , and furniture . And this was Gypsy 's room . Tom had spent a longer time in looking at it than I have taken to tell about it , and when he was through looking he did one of those things that big brothers of sixteen long years ' experience in this life , who are always teasing you and making fun of you and " preaching " at you , are afflicted with a chronic and incurable tendency to do . It is very fortunate that Gypsy deserved it , for it was really a horrible thing , girls , and if I were you I would n't let my brothers read about it , as you value your peace of mind , lace collars , clean clothes , good tempers , and private property generally . I 'd put a pin through these leaves , or fasten them together with sealing-wax , or cut them out , before I 'd run the risk . And what did he do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room , tied a broom to it ( he found it in the corner with a little heap of dust behind it , as Gypsy had left it when her mother sent her up to sweep the room that morning ) , and dressed it up in the three dresses , the cloaks and the cape , one above another , the chair serving as crinoline . Upon the top of the broom-handle he tied the torn apron , stuffed out with the rubber-boots , and pinned on slips of the geography leaves for features ; Massachusetts and Vermont giving the graceful effect of one pink eye and one yellow eye , Australia making a very blue nose , and Japan a small green mouth . The hatchet and the riding-whip served as arms , and the whole figure was surmounted by the Sunday hat that had the dust on its feather . From under the hem of the lowest dress , peeped the toes of all the pairs of shoes and rubbers , and the entire contents of the sliding table-cloth , down to every solitary pencil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line on the carpet . To crown the whole , he pinned upon the image that paper placard upon which he had been scribbling . When his laudable work was completed , this ingenious and remorseless boy had to stand and laugh at it for five minutes . If Gypsy had only seen him then ! And Gypsy was nearer than he thought -- in the front door , and coming up the stairs with a great banging and singing and laughing , as nobody but Gypsy could come up stairs . Tom just put his hand on the window-sill , and gave one leap out on the kitchen roof , and Gypsy burst in , and stopped short . Tom crouched down against the side of the house , and held his breath . For about half a minute it was perfectly still . Then a soft , merry laugh broke out all at once on the air , something as a little brook would splash down in a sudden cascade on the rocks . " O -- oh ! Did you ever ? I never saw anything so funny ! Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the merry laugh began to spell out the placard . " Gypsy Breynton . Hon. -- Hon . Gypsy Breynton ,  - -  what ? Oh , Esq. , M. A. , D. D. , LL . D. -- what a creature he is ! Gypsy Breynton , R. R. R. R. ? I 'm sure I do n't know what that means -- Tom ! Thom -- as ! " Just then she caught sight of him out on the ridge-pole , whittling away as coolly as if he had sat there all his life . " Good afternoon , " said Gypsy , politely . " Good afternoon , " said Tom . " Been whittling out there ever since dinner , I suppose ? " " Certainly . " " I thought so . Come here a minute . " " Come out here , " said Tom . Gypsy climbed out of the window without the slightest hesitation , and walked along the ridge-pole with the ease and fearlessness of a boy . She had on a pretty blue delaine dress , which was wet and torn , and all stuck together with burs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her white stockings spattered and brown ; her turban was hanging round her neck by its elastic ; her net had come off , and the wind was blowing her hair all over her eyes ; she had her sack thrown over one arm , and a basket filled to overflowing , with flowers and green moss , upon the other . " Well , you 're a pretty sight ! " said Tom , leisurely regarding her . Indeed , he was not far from right . In spite of the mud and the burs and the tears , and the general dropping-to-pieces look about her , Gypsy managed , somehow or other , to look as pretty as a picture , with her cheeks as red as a coral , and the soft brown hair that was tossing about her eyes . Gypsy 's eyes were the best part of her . They were very large and brown , and had that same irresistible twinkle that was in Tom 's eyes , only a great deal more of it ; and then it was always there . They twinkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they twinkled over her school-books ; they twinkled , in spite of themselves , at church and Sabbath school ; and , when she was at play , they shone like a whole galaxy of stars . If ever Gypsy 's eyes ceased twinkling , people knew she was going to be sick . Her hair , I am sorry to say , was not curly . This was Gypsy 's one unalleviated affliction in life . That a girl could possibly be pretty with straight hair , had never once entered her mind . All the little girls in story-books had curls . Who ever heard of the straight-haired maiden that made wreaths of the rosebuds , or saw the fairies , or married the Prince ? And Gypsy 's hair was not only straight , it was absolutely uncurlable . A week 's penance " done up in paper " made no more impression than if you were to pinch it . However , that did not interfere with her making a bit of a picture , perched up there on the roof beside Tom , among her burs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimples from forehead to chin . " Where have you been ? " said Tom , trying to look severe , and making a most remarkable failure . " Oh , only over to the three-mile swamp after white violets . Sarah Rowe , she got her two hands full , and then she just fell splash into the water , full length , and lost ' em -- Oh , dear me , how I laughed ! She did look so funny . " " Your boots are all mud , " said Tom . " Who cares ? " said Gypsy , with a merry laugh , tipping all the wet , earthy moss out on her lap , as she spoke . " See ! is n't there a quantity ? I like moss ' cause it fills up . Violets are pretty enough , only you do have to pick ' em one at a time . Innocence comes up by the handful ,  - -  only mine 's most all roots . " " I do n't know what 's going to become of you , " said Tom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I , " said Gypsy , demurely ; " I wish I did . " " You wo n't learn to apply yourself to anything , " persisted Tom . " Work or play , there 's no system to you . You 're like a --  --  " Tom paused for a simile --  " Well , like a toad that 's always on the jump . " " Ow ! " said Gypsy , with a little scream , " there 's a horrid old snail crawled out my moss ! " and over went moss , flowers , basket , and all , down the roof and upon the stone steps below . " There ! Good enough for it ! " Tom coughed and whittled . Gypsy pulled her net out of her basket , and put up her hair . There was a little silence . Nothing had yet been said about the image in Gypsy 's room , and both were determined not to be the first to speak of it . Gypsy could have patience enough where a joke was in question , and as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself outwitted . For not a word said Gypsy of the matter , and half an hour passed and the supper-bell rang . " There ! " said Gypsy , jumping up , " I do declare if it is n't supper , and I 've got these burs to get off and my dress to mend and my shoes and stockings to change , and -- Oh , dear ! I wish people did n't ever have to do things , anyway ! " With this very wise remark , she walked back across the ridge-pole and climbed in the window . There was nothing for Tom to do but follow ; which he did slowly and reluctantly . Something would have to be said now , at any rate . But not a syllable said Gypsy . She went to the looking-glass , and began to brush her hair as unconcernedly as if everything were just as she left it and precisely as she wanted it . Tom passed through the room and out of the door ; then he stopped . Gypsy 's eyes began to twinkle as if somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " said Tom . " What do you say ? " replied Gypsy . " What do you suppose mother would have to say to you about this looking room ? " " I do n't know what she 'd say to you , I 'm sure , " said Gypsy , gravely . " And you , a great girl , twelve years old ! " " I should like to know why I 'm a railroad , anyway , " said Gypsy . " Who said you were a railroad ? " " Whoever wrote Gypsy Breynton , R. R. , with my red ink . " " That does n't stand for railroad . " " Does n't ? Well , what ? " " Regular Romp . " " Oh ! " CHAPTER II A SPASM OF ORDER " I ca n't help it , " said Gypsy , after supper ; " I ca n't possibly help it , and it 's no use for me to try . " " If you can not help it , " replied Mrs. Breynton , quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in every way a suitable and praiseworthy condition of things that you should keep your room looking as I would be ashamed to have a servant 's room look , in my house . People are never to blame for what they ca n't help . " " Oh , there it is again ! " said Gypsy , with the least bit of a blush , " you always stop me right off with that , on every subject , from saying my prayers down to threading a needle . " " Your mother was trained in the new-school theology , and she applies her principles to things terrestrial as well as things celestial , " observed her father , with an amused smile . " Yes , sir , " said Gypsy , without the least idea what he was talking about . " Besides , " added Mrs. Breynton , finishing , as she spoke , the long darn in Gypsy 's dress , " I think people who give right up at little difficulties , on the theory that they ca n't help it , are --  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ? " " Cowards . " " Exactly . " " I hate cowards , " said Gypsy , in a little flash , and then stood with her back half turned , her eyes fixed on the carpet , as if she were puzzling out a proposition in Euclid , somewhere hidden in its brown oak-leaves . " Take a chair , and sit by the window and think of it , " remarked Tom , in his most aggravating tone . " That 's precisely what I intend to do , sir , " said Gypsy ; and was as good as her word . She went up-stairs and shut her door , and , what was remarkable , nobody saw anything more of her . What was still more remarkable , nobody heard anything of her . For a little while it was perfectly still overhead . " I hope she is n't crying , " said Mr. Breynton , who was always afraid Gypsy was doing something she ought not to do , and who was in about such a state of continual astonishment over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his quiet home for twelve years , as a respectable middle-aged and kind-hearted oyster might be , if a lively young toad were shut up in his shell . " Catch her ! " said the more appreciative Tom ; " I do n't believe she cries four times a year . That 's the best part of Gyp. ; with all her faults , there 's none of your girl 's nonsense about her . " Another person in the room , who had listened to the conversation , went off at this period into a sudden fit of curiosity concerning Gypsy , and started up-stairs to find her . This was Master Winthrop Breynton , familiarly and disrespectfully known as Winnie . A word must be said as to this young person ; for , whatever he may be in the eyes of other people , he was of considerable importance in his own . He had several distinguishing characteristics , as is apt to be the case with gentlemen of his age and experience . One was that he was five lengthy and important years of age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chance acquaintances , were informed at every possible and impossible opportunity . Another was , that there were always , at least , half a dozen buttons off from his jacket , at all times and places , though his long-suffering mother lived in her work-basket . A third , lay in the fact that he never walked . He trotted , he cantered , he galloped ; he progressed in jerks , in jumps , in somersets ; he crawled up-stairs like a little Scotch plaid spider , on " all fours ; " he came down stairs on the banisters , the balance of power lying between his steel buttons and the smooth varnish of the mahogany . On several memorable occasions , he has narrowly escaped pitching head first into the hall lamp . His favorite method of locomotion , however , consisted in a series of thumps , beginning with a gentle tread , and increasing in impetus by mathematical progression till it ended in a thunder-clap . A long hall to him was bliss unalloyed ; the bare garret floor a dream of delight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still a fourth peculiarity was a pleasing habit when matters went contrary to his expressed wishes , of throwing himself full length upon the floor without any warning whatsoever , squirming around in his clothes , and crying at the top of his lungs . Added to this is the fact that , for some unaccountable reason , Winnie 's eyes were so blue , and Winnie 's laugh so funny , and Winnie 's hands were so pink and little , that somehow or other Winnie did n't get half the scoldings he deserved . But who is there of us that does , for that matter ? Well , Winnie it was who stamped across the hall , and crawled up-stairs hand over hand , and stamped across the upper entry , and pounded on Gypsy 's door , and burst it open , and slammed in with one of Winnie 's inimitable shouts . " Oh Winnie ! " " I say , father wants to know if --  --  " " Just see what you 've done ! " Winnie stopped short , in considerable astonishment . Gypsy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she had pulled out of its place . That drawer was a sight well worth seeing , by the way ; but of that presently . Gypsy had taken out of it a little box ( without a cover , like all Gypsy 's boxes ) filled with beadwork ,  - -  collars , cuffs , nets , and bracelets , all tumbled in together , and as much as a handful of loose beads of every size , color , and description , thrown down on the bottom . Gypsy was sorting these beads , and this was what had kept her so still . Now Winnie , in slamming into the room after his usual style , had stepped directly into the box , crushed its pasteboard flat , and scattered the unlucky beads to all four points of the compass . Gypsy sat for about half a minute watching the stream of crimson and blue and black and silver and gold , that was rolling away under the bed and the chair and the table , her face a perfect little thunder-cloud . Then she took hold of Winnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a little shake , and , if it had been given in good temper , would not have struck Winnie as anything but a pleasant joke . But he knew , from Gypsy 's face , it was no joke ; and , feeling his dignity insulted , down he went flat upon the floor with a scream and a jerk that sent two fresh buttons flying off from his jacket . Mrs. Breynton ran up-stairs in a great hurry . " What 's the matter , Gypsy ? " " She sh -- sh -- shooked me -- the old thing ! " sobbed Winnie . " He broke my box and lost all my beads , and I 've got them all to pick up just as I was trying to put my room in order , and so I was mad , " said Gypsy , frankly . " Winnie , you may go down stairs , " said Mrs. Breynton , " you must learn to be more careful with Gypsy 's things . " Winnie slid down on the banisters , and Mrs. Breynton shut the door . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pick up my room , " said Gypsy . " But what had that to do with stringing the beads ? " " Why , I -- do n't know exactly . I took out my drawer to fix it up , and my beads were all in a muss , and so I thought I 'd sort them , and then I forgot . " " I see several things in the room that want putting in order before a little box of beads , " said Mrs. Breynton , with a smile that was half amused , half sorrowful . Gypsy cast a deprecating glance around the room , and into her mother 's face . " Oh , I did mean to shut the wardrobe door , and I thought I 'd taken the broom down stairs as much as could be , but that everlasting Tom had to go and --  --  Oh dear ! did you ever see anything so funny in all your life ? " And Gypsy looked at the image , and broke into one of her rippling laughs . " It is really a serious matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled at the laugh . " I know it , " said Gypsy , sobering down , " and I came up-stairs on purpose to put everything to rights , and then I was going to live like other people , and keep my stockings darned , and -- then I had to go head first into a box of beads , and that was the end of me . It 's always so . " " You know , Gypsy , it is one of the signs of a lady to keep one 's room in order ; I 've told you so many times . " " I know it , " said Gypsy , forlornly ; " do n't you remember when I was a little bit of a thing , my telling you that I guessed God made a mistake when he made me , and put in some ginger-beer somehow , that was always going off ? It 's pretty much so ; the cork 's always coming out at the wrong time . " " Well , " said Mrs. Breynton , with a smile , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Pick up the beads , and tear down the image , and go to work with a little system . You 'll be surprised to find how fast the room will come to order . " " I think , " she added , as she shut the door , " that it was hardly worth while to --  --  " " To shake Winnie ? " interrupted Gypsy , demurely . " No , not at all ; I ought to have known better . " Mrs. Breynton did not offer to help Gypsy in the task which bade fair to be no easy one , of putting her room in order ; but , with a few encouraging words , she went down stairs and left her . It would have been far easier for her to have gone to work and done the thing herself , than to see Gypsy 's face so clouded and discouraged . But she knew it would be the ruin of Gypsy . Her only chance of overcoming her natural thoughtlessness , and acquiring the habits of a lady , lay in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaided patience , these very things that came so hard to her . Gypsy understood this perfectly , and had the good sense to think her mother was just right about it . It was not want of training , that gave Gypsy her careless fashion of looking after things . Mrs. Breynton was a wise , as well as a loving mother , and had done everything in the way of punishment , reproof , warning , persuasion , and argument , that mothers can do for the faults of children . Nor was it for want of a good example , Mrs. Breynton was the very pink of neatness . It was a natural kink in Gypsy , that was as hard to get out as a knot in an apple-tree , and which depended entirely on the child 's own will for its eradication . This disorder in her room and about her toilet was only one development of it , and by no means a fixed or continued one . Gypsy could be , and half the time she was , as orderly and lady-like as anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom said , she was " always on the jump . " If her dress did n't happen to be torn and her room dusty , why , she had a turn of forgetting everything . If she did n't forget , she was always getting hurt . If it was n't that , she lost her temper every five minutes . Or else she was making terrible blunders , and hurting people 's feelings ; something was always the matter ; and some one was always on the qui vive , wondering what Gypsy was going to do next . Yet , in spite of it all , the person who did not love Gypsy Breynton ( provided he knew her ) was not to be found in Yorkbury . Whether there was any reason for this , you can judge for yourself as the story goes on . After her mother had gone down , Gypsy went to work in earnest . She picked up the beads , and put them back into the drawer which she left upon the floor . Then she attacked Tom 's image . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to pieces , for the true boy-fashion in which it was tied , pinned , sewed , and nailed together , would have been a puzzle to any feminine mind . She would have called Tom up to help her , but she was just a little bit too proud . The broom she put out in the entry the first thing ; then , remembering that that was not systematic , she carried it down stairs and hung it on its nail . The shoes and the dresses , the cape and the cloak , the tippet and the hat , she put in their places ; the torn apron and the unmended stockings she tumbled into her basket , then went back and folded them up neatly ; she also made a journey into the woodshed expressly to put the hatchet where it belonged , on the chopping-block . By this time it was quite dark , but she lighted a lamp , and went at it afresh . Winnie came up to the entry door , and , at a respectful distance , told her they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head , and proceeded with her dusting like a hero . Tom whistled for her up the chimney-flue ; but she only gave a little thump on the floor , and said she was busy . It was like walking into a labyrinth to dispose of the contents of that table-cloth . How to put away the pencils and the rubber , when the drawing-box was lost ; how to collect all the cookey-crumbs and wandering needles , that slipped out of your finger as fast as you took hold of them ; where on earth to put those torn geography leaves , that would n't stay in the book , and could n't be thrown away ; where was the cork to the inkstand ? and how should she hang up the riding-whip , with the string gone ? These were questions that might well puzzle a more systematic mind than Gypsy 's . However , in due time , the room was restored to an order that was delightful to see , for , if Gypsy made up her mind to a thing , she could do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer . This drawer was a fair specimen of the rest of Gypsy 's drawers , shelves , and cupboards , and their name was Legion . Moreover , it was an " upper drawer , " and where is the girl that does not know what a delicate science is involved in the rearranging of these upper drawers ? So many laces , and half-worn collars that do n't belong there , are always getting in ; loose coppers have such a way of accumulating in the crevices ; all your wandering pins and hair-pins make it a rendezvous by a species of free-masonry utterly inexplicable ; then your little boxes fit in so tightly , and never have room to open , and are always getting their covers caught when you shut the drawer , and , when you try to keep them down , you pinch your fingers so . Please to imagine , O orderly readers ! who keep every pin in its proper place , the worst looking upper drawer that your horrified eyes ever beheld , and you will have some idea of this drawer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes small , boxes round , square , and oblong ; boxes with covers ( only two ) , and boxes without ; handkerchiefs , under-sleeves , collars ,  - -  both clean and soiled ,  - -  laces and ribbons , and bows and nets ; purses and old gloves , a piece of soap , a pile of letters , scratched and scattering jewelry , a piece of dried cake , several fans all covered with dust , and nobody knew what not , in the lower strata , out of sight . Gypsy sat and looked at it for about two minutes in utter despair . Then she just turned the whole thing bottom upwards in a great heap on the floor , and began to investigate matters , with her cheeks very red . Presently , the family down stairs heard a little scream . Winnie stamped up to see what was the matter . " Why , I 've found my grammar ! " said Gypsy . " It 's the one in marble covers I lost ever -- ever so long ago , and had to get a new one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Pretty soon there was another little scream , and Gypsy called down the chimney : " Tom Breynton ! What do you think ? I 've found that dollar bill of yours you thought I 'd burnt up . " After awhile there came still another scream , a pretty loud one this time . Mrs. Breynton came up to see what had happened . " I 've cut my hand , " said Gypsy , faintly ; " there was a great heap of broken glass in my drawer ! " " Broken glass ! " " Yes , I 'm sure I do n't know how it came there ; I guess I was going to frame a picture . " Mrs. Breynton bound up her finger , and went down again . She was no more than fairly seated before there came from up-stairs , not a scream , but one of the merriest laughs that ever was heard . " What is to pay , now ? " called Tom , from the entry . " Oh , dear ! " gasped Gypsy ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the carving-knife we scolded Patty for losing last winter , and -- Oh , Tom , just look here !  - -  my stick of peanut candy , that I thought I 'd eaten up , all stuck on to my lace under-sleeves ! " It was past Gypsy 's bed-time when the upper drawer was fairly in order and put back in its place . Three others remained to go through the same process , as well as wardrobe shelves innumerable . Gypsy , with her characteristic impulsiveness , would have sat up till twelve o'clock to complete the work , but her mother said " No " very decidedly , and so it must wait till to-morrow . Tom came in just as everything was done , and Gypsy had drawn a long breath and stood up to look , with great satisfaction , all around her pleasant , orderly room . " Well done ! I say , Gypsy , what a jewel you are when you 're a mind to be . " " Of course , I am . Have you just found it out ? " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rough , as a general thing . You need cutting down and polishing . " " And you to polish me ? Well , I like the looks of this room , anyhow . It is nice to have things somewhere where you wo n't trip over them when you walk across the room -- only if somebody else would pick ' em up for me . " " How long do you suppose it will last ? " asked Tom , with an air of great superiority . " Tom , " said Gypsy , solemnly ; " that 's a serious question . " " It might last forever if you have a mind to have it ,  - -  come now , Gyp. , why not ? " " That 's a long time , " said Gypsy , shaking her head ; " I would n't trust myself two inches . To-morrow I shall be in a hurry to go to school ; then I shall be in a hurry to go to dinner ; then I shall be in a terrible hurry to get off with Sarah Rowe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I feel , to-night , precisely as if I should never want to take a single pin out of those little black squares I 've put them into on the cushion . " Gypsy found herself in a hurry the next day and the next , and is likely to , to the end of her life , I am afraid . But she seemed to have taken a little gasp of order , and for a long time no one had any complaint to make of Gypsy 's room or Gypsy 's toilet . CHAPTER III MISS MELVILLE 'S VISITOR As will be readily supposed , Gypsy 's name was not her original one ; though it might have been , for there have been actual Billys and Sallys , who began and ended Billys and Sallys only . Gypsy 's real name was an uncouth one -- Jemima . It was partly for this reason , partly for its singular appropriateness , that her nickname had entirely transplanted the lawful and ugly one . This subject of nicknames is a curiosity . All rules of euphony , fitness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly at fault here . A baby who can not talk plainly , dubs himself " Tuty , " or " Dess , " or " Pet , " or " Honey , " and forthwith becomes Tuty , Dess , Pet , or Honey , the rest of his mortal life . All the particularly cross and disagreeable girls are Birdies and Sunbeams . All the brunettes with loud voices and red hands , who are growing up into the " strong-minded women , " are Lilies and Effies and Angelinas , and other etherial creatures ; while the little shallow , pink-and-white young ladies who cry very often and " get nervous , " are quite as likely to be royal Constance , or Elizabeth , without any nickname at all . But Gypsy 's name had undoubtedly been foreordained , so perfectly was it suited to Gypsy . For never a wild rover led a more untamed and happy life . Summer and winter , seed-time and harvest , found Gypsy out in the open air , as many hours out of the twenty-four as were not absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A fear of the weather never entered into Gypsy 's creed ; drenchings and freezings were so many soap-bubbles ,  - -  great fun while they lasted , and blown right away by dry stockings and mother 's warm fire ; so where was the harm ? A good brisk thunderstorm out in the woods , with the lightning quivering all about her and the thunder crashing over her , was simple delight . A day of snow and sleet , with drifts knee-deep , and winds like so many little knives , was a festival . If you do n't know the supreme bliss of a two-mile walk on such a day , when you have to shut your eyes , and wade your way , then Gypsy would pity you . Not a patch of woods , a pond , a brook , a river , a mountain , in the region ( and there , in Vermont , there were plenty of them ) , but Gypsy knew it by heart . There was not a trout-brook for miles where she had not fished . There was hardly a tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , that it was away from the main road and people 's eyes -- that she had not walked . Gypsy could row and skate and swim , and play ball and make kites , and coast and race , and drive , and chop wood . Altogether Gypsy seemed like a very pretty , piquant mistake ; as if a mischievous boy had somehow stolen the plaid dresses , red cheeks , quick wit , and little indescribable graces of a girl , and was playing off a continual joke on the world . Old Mrs. Surly , who lived opposite , and wore green spectacles , used to roll up her eyes , and say What would become of that child ? A whit cared Gypsy for Mrs. Surly ! As long as her mother thought the sport and exercise in the open air a fine thing for her , and did not complain of the torn dresses oftener than twice a week , she would roll her hoop and toss her ball under Mrs. Surly 's very windows , and laugh merrily to see the green glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surly termed an " impropriety . " Therefore it created no surprise in the family one morning , when school-time came and passed , and Gypsy did not make her appearance , that she was reported to be " making a raft " down in the orchard swamp . " Run and call her , Winnie , " said Mrs. Breynton . " Tell her it is very late , and I want her to come right up ,  - -  remember . " " Yes mum , " said Winnie , with unusual alacrity , and started off down the lane as fast as his copper-toed feet could carry him . It was quite a long lane , and a very pleasant one in summer . There was a row of hazel-nut bushes , always green and sweet , on one side , and a stone-wall on the other , with the broad leaves and tiny blossoms of a grape-vine trailing over it . The lane opened into a wide field which had an apple-orchard at one end of it , and sloped down over quite a little hill into a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anemones , and sweet-flag grew in abundance . In the summer , the water was apt to dry up . In the spring , it was sometimes four feet deep . It was a pleasant spot , for the mountains lay all around it , and shut it in with their great forest-arms , and the sharp peaks that were purple and crimson and gold , under passing shadows and fading sunsets . And , then , is there any better fun than to paddle in the water ? Gypsy looked as if she thought not , when Winnie suddenly turned the corner , and ran down the slope . She had finished her raft , and launched it off from the root of an old oak-tree that grew half in the water , and , with a long pole , had pushed herself a third of the way across the swamp . Her dress was tucked up over her bright balmoral , and the ribbons of her hat were streaming in the wind . She had no mittens or gloves on her hands , which were very pink and plump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hullo ! " said Winnie , walking out on the root of the oak . " Hilloa ! " said Gypsy . " I say -- that 's a bully raft . " " To be sure it is . " " I have n't had a ride on a raft since -- why since ' leven or six years ago when I was a little boy . I should n't wonder if it was twenty-three years , either . " " Oh , I ca n't bear people that hint . Why do n't you say right out , if you want a ride ? " " I want a ride , " said Winnie , without any hesitation . " Wait till I turn her round . I 'll bring her up on the larboard side , " replied Gypsy , in the tone of an old salt of fifty years ' experience . So she paddled up to the oak-tree , and Winnie jumped on board . " I guess we 'll have time to row across and back before school , " said Gypsy , pushing off . Winnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's very late , " said Gypsy . " Oh , just look at that toad with a green head , down in the water ! " observed Winnie . They paddled on a little ways in silence . " What makes your cheeks so red ? " asked Gypsy . " I guess it 's scarlet fever , or maybe it 's appleplexy , you know . " " Oh ! " Just then Winnie gave a little scream . " Look here -- Gyp. ! The boat 's goin'clock down . I do n't want to go very much . I saw another toad down there . " " I declare ! " said Gypsy , " we 're going to be swamped , as true as you live ! It is n't strong enough to bear two ,  - -  sit still , Winnie . Perhaps we 'll get ashore . " But no sooner had she spoken the words than the water washed up about her ankles , and Winnie 's end of the raft went under . The next she knew , they were both floundering in the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half deep , very cold , and somewhat slimy . Gypsy had a strong impression that a frog jumped into her neck when she plunged , head first , into the deep mud at the bottom . After a little splashing and gasping , she regained her feet , and stood up to her elbows in the water . But what she could do , Winnie could not . He had sunk in the soft mud , and even if he had had the courage to stand up straight , the water would have been above his head . But it had never occurred to him to do otherwise than lie gasping and flat on the bottom , where he was drowning as fast as he possibly could . Gypsy pulled him out and carried him ashore . She wrung him out a little , and set him down on the grass , and then , by way of doing something , she took her dripping handkerchief out of her dripping pocket and wiped her hands on it . " O -- o -- oh ! " gasped Winnie ; " I never did -- you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What a story ! " said Gypsy ; " you 're no more drowned than I am . To be sure you are rather wet , " she added , with a disconsolate attempt at a laugh . " You ought n't to have tooken me out on that old raft , " glared Winnie , through the shower of water-drops that rained down from his forehead , " you know you had n't ! I 'll just tell mother . I 'll get sick and be died after it , you see if I do n't . " " Very well , " said Gypsy , giving herself a little shake , very much as a pretty brown spaniel would do , who had been in swimming . " You may do as you like . Who teased to go on the raft , I 'd like to know ? " " Besides , " resumed Winnie , with an impressive cough ; " you 're late to school , ' cause mother , she said you was to come right up when she sent me down , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ,  - -  I rather think I did . Anyways , you 're late ,  - -  so ! " Gypsy looked at Winnie , and Winnie looked at Gypsy . There was an awful silence . " Winnie Breynton , " said Gypsy , solemnly , " if you do n't get one whipping ! " " I do n't care to hear folks talk , " interrupted Winnie , with dignity , " I am five years old . " Gypsy 's reply is not recorded . I have heard it said that when Tom espied the two children coming up the lane , he went to his mother with the information that the fishman was somewhere around , only he had sent his fishes on ahead of him . They appeared to have been freshly caught , and would , he thought , make several dinners ; but I can not take the responsibility of the statement . It was very late , much nearer ten o'clock than nine , when Gypsy was fairly metamorphosed into a clean , dry , very penitent-looking child . She hurried off to school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened on the occasion of that interview , has never been made known to an inquiring public . On the way to school Gypsy had as many as six sober thoughts ; a larger number than she was usually capable of in forty-eight hours . One was , that it was too bad she had got so wet . Another was , that she really supposed it was her business to know when school-time came , no matter where she was or what she was doing . Another , that she had made her mother a great deal of trouble . A fourth was , that she was sorry to be so late at school -- it always made Miss Melville look so ; and then a bad mark was not , on the whole , a desirable thing . Still a fifth was , that she would never do such a thing again as long as she lived -- never . The sixth lay in a valiant determination to behave herself the rest of this particular day . She would study hard . She would get to the head of the class . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' chairs , nor tickle anybody , nor make up funny faces , nor whisper , nor make one of the girls laugh , not one , not even that silly Delia Guest , who laughed at nothing ,  - -  why , you could n't so much as make a doll out of your handkerchief and gloves , and hang it on your pen-handle , but what she had to go into a spasm over it . No , she would n't do a single funny thing all day . She would just sit still and look sober and sorry , and not trouble Miss Melville in the least . Her mind was quite made up . Just as she had arrived at this conclusion she came to the school-house door . Gypsy and a number of other girls , both her own age and younger , who either were not prepared to enter the high school , or whose parents preferred the select school system , composed Miss Melville 's charge . They were most of them pleasant girls , and Miss Melville was an unusually successful teacher , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school-house was a bit of a brown building tucked away under some apple-trees on a quiet by-road . It had been built for a district school , but had fallen into disuse years ago , and Miss Melville had taken possession of it . Gypsy slackened her pace as she passed under the apple-boughs , where the tiny , budding leaves filled all the air with faint fragrance . It was nearly recess time ; she knew , because she could hear , through the windows , the third geography class reciting . It was really too bad to be so late . She went up the steps slowly , the corners of her mouth drawn down as penitently as Gypsy 's mouth could well be . Just inside the door she stopped . A quick color ran all over her face , her eyes began to twinkle like sparks from a great fire of hickory , and , in an instant , every one of those six sober thoughts was gone away somewhere -- nobody could have told where ; and the funniest little laugh broke the silence of the entry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that was so very amusing . The entry was quite deserted . Nothing was to be seen but a long row of girls ' " things , " hanging up on the nails -- hats and bonnets , tippets , sacks , rubbers , and baskets ; apparently as demure and respectable as hats , bonnets , tippets , sacks , rubbers , and baskets could be . Yet there Gypsy stood for as much as a minute laughing away quietly to herself , as if she had come across some remarkable joke . About ten minutes after , some one knocked at the school-room door . Miss Melville laid down her geography . " Cape Ann , Cape Hatteras , Cape -- may I go to the door ? " piped little Cely Hunt , holding up her hand . Miss Melville nodded and Cely went . She opened the door -- and jumped . " What 's the matter , Cely ?  - -  Oh ! " For there stood the funniest old woman that Cely or Miss Melville had ever seen . She had on a black dress , very long and very scant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old waterproof cloak . Over that , she wore a curious drab-silk sack , somewhat faded and patched , with all the edges of the seams outside . Over that , was a plaid red-and-green shawl , tied about her waist . There was a little black shawl over that , and a green tippet wound twice around her throat with the ends tucked in under the shawl . She had a pair of black mitts on her hands , and she carried a basket . Her face no one could see , for it was covered with a thick green veil , tied closely about her bonnet . Cely gave a little scream , and ran behind the door . Miss Melville stepped down from the platform , and went to meet the visitor . " Good arternoon , " said the old woman , in a very shrill voice . " Good afternoon , " said Miss Melville , politely . " I come to see the young uns , " piped the old woman . " I ben deown teown fur some eggs , an'clock I heerd the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , an'clock thinks says I to myself , says I , bless their dear hearts , I 'll go in an'clock see ' em , says I , an'clock I 'll thank ye kindly for a seat , for I 'm pretty nigh beat out . " The scholars all began to laugh . Miss Melville , somewhat reluctantly , handed her visitor a chair by the door , but did not ask her upon the platform , as the visitor seemed to expect . " There 's a drefful draught here on my neck , " she muttered , discontentedly ; " an'clock I 'm terribly afflicted with rheumatiz mostly . Ca n't see much of the young uns here , nuther . " " I doubt if there is much here that will interest you , " observed Miss Melville , looking at her keenly . " You may rest yourself , and then I think you had better go . Visitors always disturb the children . " " Bless their dear hearts ! " cried the old woman , shrilly . " They need n't be afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little angel boy once myself ; he 's gone to Californy now , an'clock I 'm a lone , lorn widdy . I say -- little gal ! " and the stranger pointed her finger ( it trembled a little ) at Sarah Rowe , who had grown quite red in the face with her polite efforts not to laugh . " Little gal , whar 's yer manners ?  - -  laughin'clock at a poor ole creetur like me ! Come out here , and le 's hear ye say that beautiful psalm of Dr. Watts -- now ! " " How doth the little busy bee ! " But just then something happened for which the old woman and the scholars were equally unprepared . Miss Melville looked through the green veil straight into the old woman 's eyes , and said just one word . She said it very quietly , and she said it without a smile . It was " Gypsy ! " There was a great hush . Sarah Rowe was the first to break it . " Why , that 's my sack turned wrong side out ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you please , Miss Melville , that 's my black shawl ,  - -  I know it by the border , " piped a very little girl in mourning . " I do believe that 's my waterproof , and Lucy 's plaid shawl , " giggled Delia Guest . " Did you ever ? " " And my green veil , " put in somebody else , faintly . Miss Melville quietly removed the veil , and Gypsy looked up with her mischief bright all over her face . Her eyes fell , however , and her cheeks flushed crimson , when she saw the look about Miss Melville 's mouth . " You may go and put away the things , Gypsy , " said Miss Melville , still without a smile . Gypsy obeyed in silence . The girls stopped laughing , and began to whisper together behind the desk-covers . " The school will come to order , " said Miss Melville . " Cely , what is the largest river in New England ?  - -  Next . " Gypsy hung up the things , and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her seat , but took no further notice of her . Gypsy , silent and ashamed , took out her spelling-book , and began to study . The girls looked at her out of the corners of their eyes , and every now and then Delia Guest broke out afresh into a smothered laugh , but no one spoke to her , and she spoke to nobody . The spelling-class was called out , but Miss Melville signified , by a look , that Gypsy was to keep her seat . Recess came , but Miss Melville was busy writing at her desk , and took no notice of her , further than to tell the group of girls , who had instantly clustered buzzing and laughing about her , that they were all to go out doors and play . They went , and Gypsy sat still with her head behind the desk-cover . Something in Miss Melville 's manner said , louder than words , that she was displeased . It was a manner which made Gypsy feel , for once in her life , that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her books , and tried to look unconcerned when the scholars came back . The arithmetic class recited , but her teacher did not call for her ; the history class , but no one spoke to Gypsy . The disgrace of this punishment was what Gypsy minded the most , though it was no slight thing to see so many " absent " marks going down on her report , when she was right in the room and had learned her lessons . After what seemed to her an interminable time , the morning passed and the school broke up . The children , controlled by that something in Miss Melville 's manner , and by Gypsy 's averted head and burning cheeks , left the room quickly , and Gypsy and her teacher were alone . " Gypsy , " said Miss Melville . There was no answer . " Gypsy . " There came a faint " Yes 'm " from behind the desk-cover . Miss Melville laid down her pencil , closed her own desk , and came and sat down on the bench beside Gypsy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am , " she said , simply . Something very bright glittered on Gypsy 's lashes , and two great drops stood on her hot cheeks . " I do n't see what possessed me ! " she said , vehemently . " Why do n't you turn me out of school ? " " I did not think you could willingly try to make me trouble , " continued Miss Melville , without noticing the last remark . The two great drops rolled slowly down Gypsy 's cheeks , and into her mouth . She swallowed them with a gulp , and brushed her hand , angrily , across her eyes . Gypsy very seldom cried , but I fancy she came pretty near it on that occasion . " Miss Melville , " she said , with an earnestness that was comical , in spite of itself ; " I wish you 'd please to scold me . I should feel a great deal better . " " Scoldings wo n't do you much good , " said Miss Melville , with a sad smile ; " you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it for you . " Gypsy turned around in a little passion of despair . " Miss Melville , I ca n't ! It is n't in me -- you do n't know ! Here this very morning I got late to school , tipping Winnie over in a raft -- drenched through both of us , and mother , so patient and sweet with the dry stockings she 'd just mended , and was n't I sorry ? Did n't I think about it all the way to school -- the whole way , Miss Melville ? And did n't I make up my mind I 'd be as good as a kitten all day , and sit still like Agnes Gaylord , and not tickle the girls , nor make you any trouble , nor anything ? Then what should I do but come into the entry and see those things , and it all came like a flash how funny it would be'n I 'd talk up high like Mrs. Surly ' n you would n't know me , and -- that was the last I thought , till you took off the veil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just like me -- I never can help anything anyhow . " " I think you can , " said her teacher , kindly . " You certainly had the power , when you stood out there in the entry , to stop and think before you touched the things . " " I do n't know , " said Gypsy , shaking her head , thoughtfully ; " I do n't believe I had . " " But you would n't do it again ? " " I guess I would n't ! " said Gypsy , with an emphasis . " What you can do one time , you can another , " said Miss Melville . Gypsy was silent . " There 's one other thing about it , " continued her teacher , " besides the impropriety of playing such a trick in school hours -- that is , that it was very unkind to me . " " Unkind ! " exclaimed Gypsy . " Yes , " said Miss Melville , quietly , " unkind . " " Why , Miss Melville , I would n't be unkind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nevertheless , Gypsy , it was very unkind to deliberately set to work to annoy me and make me trouble , by getting the school into a frolic . Anything done to break the order of study-hours , or to withstand any rule of the school , is always an unkindness to a teacher . There is scarcely a girl in school that might help me more than you , Gypsy , if you chose . " " I do n't see how , " said Gypsy , astonished . " I do , " said Miss Melville , smiling , " and I always think a little vote of thanks to you , when you are quiet and well-behaved . An orderly scholar has a great deal of influence . The girls all love you , and are apt to do as they see you do , Gypsy . " There was a little silence , in which Gypsy 's eyes were wandering away under the apple-boughs , their twinkling dimmed and soft . At last she turned quickly , and threw her arms about her teacher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me one kiss , I 'll never be an old woman again , if I live as long as Methuselah ! " Miss Melville kissed her , and whispered one or two little loving words of encouragement , such as nobody but Miss Melville knew how to say . But Gypsy never told what they were . " I believe there 's a bolt left out of me somewhere , " she said , as they left the school-house together ; " what do you suppose it is ? " " It is the strong , iron bolt , ' stop and think , ' Gypsy . " " Um -- yes -- perhaps it is , " said Gypsy , and walked slowly home . CHAPTER IV GYPSY HAS A DREAM " Come , Tom -- do . " " Do what ? " " You know as well as I do . " " What did you observe ? " " Tom Breynton ! " " That 's my name . " " Will you , or will you not , come down to the pond and have a row ? " " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! If you wo n't come for a civil request , I wo n't tease for it . " " Very good , " said Tom , laying aside his Euclid ; " I like your spunk . Rather think I 'll go . " Tom tossed on his cap and was ready . Gypsy hurried away to array herself in the complication of garments necessary to the feminine adventurer , if she so much as crosses the yard ; a continual mystery of Providence , was this little necessity to Gypsy , and one against which she lived in a state of incessant rebellion . It was provoking enough to stand there in her room , tugging and hurrying till she was red in the face , over a pair of utterly heartless and unimpressible rubbers , that absolutely refused to slip over the heel of her boot , and to see Tom through the window , with his hands in his pocket , ready , waiting , and impatient , alternately whistling and calling for her . " I never did ! " said Gypsy , in no very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coolly . " These old rubbers ! " said Gypsy . " What 's the matter ? " asked her mother , stopping at the door . " It 's enough to try the patience of a saint ! " said Gypsy , emphatically , holding out her foot . " Perhaps I can help you , " said Mrs. Breynton , stooping down . " Why , Gypsy ! your boots are wet through ; of course the rubbers wo n't go on . " " I did n't suppose that would make any difference , " said Gypsy , looking rather foolish . " I got them wet this morning , down at the swamp . I thought they were dry , though : I sat with my feet in the oven until Patty drove me off . She said I was in the bread . " " You will have to put on your best boots , " said her mother . " Oh , Tom ! " called Gypsy , in despair , as the shrillest of all shrill whistles came up through the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there as soon as I can . " She changed her boots , tossed on her turban , whisked on her sack , and began to fasten it with a jerk , when off came the button at the throat , and rolled maliciously quite out of sight under the bed . " There ! " said Gypsy . " Ca n't wait ! " shouted Tom . " I mended that sack , " said Gypsy , " only yesterday afternoon . I call it too bad , when a body 's trying to keep their things in order , and do up all their mending , that things have to act so ! " " I think you have been trying to be orderly , " said her mother , helping her to pin the offending sack about the throat , for there was no time now to restore the wandering button . " I have noticed a great improvement in you ; but there 's one thing wanting yet , that would have kept the button in its place , and had the boots properly taken off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " asked Gypsy , in a great hurry to go . " A little more thoroughness , Gypsy . " This bit of a lesson , like most of Mrs. Breynton 's moral teachings , was enforced with a little soft kiss on Gypsy 's forehead , and a smile that was as unlike a sermon as smile could be . Gypsy gave two thoughts to it , while she jumped down stairs three steps at a time ; then , it must be confessed , she forgot it entirely , in the sight of Tom coolly walking off down the lane without her . But words that Mrs. Breynton said with a kiss did not slip away from Gypsy 's memory " for good an a ' , " as easily as that . She had her own little places and times of private meditation , when such things came up to her like faithful angels , that are always ready to speak , if you give them the chance . Tom was still in sight , among the hazel-nut bushes and budding grape-vines of the lane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foot as a young gazelle , and soon overtook him . She had just stopped , panting , by his side , and was proceeding to make some remarks which she thought his conduct richly deserved , when the sound of some little trotting feet behind them attracted their attention . " Why , Winnie Breynton ! " said Gypsy . " Where are you going ? " asked Tom , turning round . " Oh , nowheres in particular , " said Winnie , with an absent air . " Well , you may just turn round and go there , then , " said Tom . " We do n't want any little boys with us this afternoon . " " Little boys ! " said Winnie , with a terrible look ; " I 'm five years old , sir . I can button my own jacket , and I 've got a snowshovel ! " Tom walked rapidly on , and Gypsy with him . A moment 's reflection seemed to convince Winnie that his company was not wanted , and he disappeared among the hazel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they reached the pond in a marvellously short time . This pond was about a half-mile from the house , just at the foot of a hill which went by the name of Kleiner Berg -- a German word meaning little mountain . There were many of these elevations all along the valley in which Yorkbury was situated . They seemed to be a sort of stepping-stones to the great , snow-crowned mountains , that towered sharply beyond . The pond that nestled in among the trees at the foot of the Kleiner Berg was called the Kleiner Berg Basin . It was a beautiful sheet of water , small and still and sheltered , and a great resort of pleasure-seekers because of the clouds of white and golden lilies that floated over it in the hot summer months . Mr. Breynton owned a boat there , which was kept locked to a tiny wharf under the trees , and was very often used by the children , although Tom declared it was no better to fish in than a wash-tub ; as a Vermont boy , used to the trout-brooks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's that ? " asked Gypsy , as they neared the wharf . " Looks as much like a little green monkey as anything , " said Tom , making a tube of his hands to look through . " It 's in the boat , whatever it is . " " It 's a green-and-white gingham monkey , " said Gypsy , suddenly , " with a belt , and brown pants , and a cap on wrong side before . " " The little --  --  , he may just walk home anyhow , " observed Tom , in his autocratic style . " He ought to be taught better than to come where older people are , especially if they do n't want him . " " I suppose he likes to have a boat-ride as well as we do , " suggested Gypsy . " Winthrop ! " called Tom , severely . Winnie 's chin was on his little fat hand , and Winnie 's eyes were fixed upon the water , and Winnie was altogether too deeply absorbed in meditation to deign a reply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh ! " said Winnie , looking up , carelessly ; " that you ? " " How did you get down here , I 'd like to know ? " said Gypsy . Winnie regarded her impressively , as if to signify that his principles of action were his own until they were made public , and when they were made public she might have them . " You may just get out of that boat , " said Tom , rather crossly for him . Winnie hinted , as if it were quite an accidental remark , that he had no intention of doing so . He furthermore observed that he would be happy to take them to row . " Father said whoever took the boat first was to have it . " Tom replied by taking him up in one hand , twisting him over his shoulder , and landing him upon the grass . At this Winnie , as characteristic in his wrath as in his dignity , threw himself flat , and began to scream after his usual musical fashion . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , Tom -- do . " " He should have stayed where he was told to , " argued Tom , who , like most boys of his age , had a sufficiently just estimate of the importance of his own authority , and who would sometimes do a very selfish thing under the impression that it was his duty to family and state , as an order-loving individual and citizen . " I know it is n't so pleasant to have him , " said Gypsy , " but it does make him so dreadfully happy . " That was the best of Gypsy ; she was as generous a child as poor , fallen children of Adam are apt to be ; as quick to do right as she was to do wrong , and much given to this fancy of seeing people " dreadfully happy . " I have said that people loved Gypsy . I am inclined to think that herein lay the secret of it . Then Gypsy never " preached . " If she happened to be right , and another person wrong , she never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into becoming as good as she was . She made her suggestions in such a straightforward , matter-of-fact way , as if of course you thought so too , and she was only agreeing with you ; and was apt to make them so merrily withal , that there was no resisting her . Therefore Tom , while pretending to carry his point , really yielded to the influence of Gypsy 's kind feeling , in saying ,  --  " On the whole , Winnie , I 've come to the conclusion to take you , on condition that you always do as I tell you in future . And if you do n't stop crying this minute , you sha' n't go . " This rather ungracious consent was sufficient to dry Winnie 's tears and silence Winnie 's lungs , and the three seated themselves in the little boat , and started off in high spirits . It was a light , pretty boat , painted in bright colors , and christened The Dipper , it being an appropriate and respectful title for a boat on the Kleiner Berg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a May-flower , and as warm as sunshine ; there was a soft , blue sky with clouds of silver like stately ships sailing over it , and such a shimmering , bright photograph of it in the water ; then Tom was so pleasant , and rowed so fast , and let Gypsy help , and she could keep time with him , and the spray dashed up like silver-dust about the oars , and the bees were humming among the buds on the trees , and the blue dragon-flies , that skipped from ripple to ripple , seemed to be having such a holiday . Altogether , Gypsy felt like saying , with famous little Prudy ,  --  " Oh , I 'm so glad there happened to be a world , and God made me ! " After a while Tom laid down his oars , and they floated idly back and forth among the lily-stems and the soft , purple shadows of the maple-boughs , from which the perfumed scarlet blossoms dropped like coral into the water . Tom took off his cap , and leaned lazily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in making a series of remarkable faces at himself in the water , for a wonder sat still , and Gypsy lay down across two seats , with her face turned up watching the sky . It was very pleasant , and no one seemed inclined to talk . " I wish I were a cloud , " said Gypsy , suddenly , after a long silence . " A little white cloud , with a silver fringe , and not have anything to do but float round all day in the sunshine , no lessons nor torn dresses nor hateful old sewing to do . " " S'posin ' it thunder-stormed , " suggested Winnie . " You might get striked . " " That would be fun , " said Gypsy , laughing . " I always wanted to see where the lightning came from . " " Supposing there came a wind , and blew you away , " suggested Tom , sleepily . " I never thought of that , " said Gypsy . " I guess I 'd rather do the sewing . " Presently a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped right into Gypsy 's mouth ( which most unpoetically happened to be open ) . " Just think , " said Gypsy , whose thoughts seemed to have taken a metaphysical turn , " of being a little red flower , that dies and drops into the water , and there 's never any fruit nor anything ,  - -  I wonder what it was made for . " " Perhaps just to make you ask that question , " answered Tom ; and there was a great deal more in the answer than Tom himself supposed . This was every solitary word that was said on that boat-ride . A little is so much better than much , sometimes , and goes a great deal further . It seemed to Gypsy the pleasantest boat-ride she had ever taken ; but Tom became tired of it before she did , and went up to the house , carrying Winnie with him . Gypsy stayed a little while to row by herself . " Be sure you lock the boat when you come up , " called Tom , in starting . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " " Did you bring up the oars ? " asked Tom , at supper . " Yes , they 're in the barn . I do sometimes remember things , Mr. Tom . " " Did you --  --  , " began Tom , again . But Winnie just then upset the entire contents of his silver mug of milk exactly into Tom 's lap , and as this was the fourth time the young gentleman had done that very thing , within three days , Tom 's sentence was broken off for another of a more agitated nature . That night Tom had a dream . He thought the house was a haunted castle --  ( he had , I am sorry to say , been reading novels in study hours ) , and that the ghost of old Baron Somebody who had defrauded the beautiful Lady Somebody-else , of Kleiner Berg Basin and the Dipper , in which it was supposed Mrs. Surly had secreted a blind kitten , which it was somehow or other imperatively necessary should be drowned , for the well-being of the beautiful and unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going down stairs , with white silk stockings on his feet and a tin pan on his head . At this crisis Tom awoke , with a jump , and heard , or thought he heard , a slight creaking noise in the entry . Winnie 's cat , of course ; or the wind rattling the blinds ;  - -  nevertheless , Tom went to his door , and looked out . He was exceedingly sleepy , and the entry was exceedingly dark , and , though he had not a breath of faith in ghosts , not he ,  - -  was there ever a boy who had ?  - -  and though he considered such persons , as had , as candidates for the State Idiot Asylum , yet it must be confessed that even Tom was possessed of an imagination , and this imagination certainly , for an instant , deluded him into the belief that a dim figure was flitting down stairs . " Who 's there ? " said Tom , rather faintly . There was no reply . A curious sound , like the lifting of a distant latch by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still . " Stuff and nonsense ! " said Tom . Nevertheless , Tom went to the head of the stairs , and looked down ; went to the foot of the stairs , and looked around . The doors were all closed as they had been left for the night . Nothing was to be seen ; nothing was to be heard . " Curious mental delusions one will have when one is sleepy , " said Tom , and went back to bed , where , the reader is confidentially informed , he lay for fifteen entire minutes with his eyes wide open , speculating on the proportion of authenticated ghost-stories ; to be sure , there had been some ; it was , perhaps , foolish to deny as much as that . After which , he slept the rest of the night as soundly as young people of sixteen , who are well and happy , are apt to sleep . That night , also , Gypsy had a dream . She dreamed that Miss Melville sailed in through the window on an oar , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her that her ( Gypsy 's ) father had been hung upon a lamp-post by Senator Sumner , for advocating the coercion of the seceded States , and that Tom had set Winnie afloat on the Kleiner Berg Basin , in a milk-pitcher . Winnie had tipped over , and was in imminent danger of drowning , if indeed he were not past hope already , and Tom sat up in the maple-tree , laughing at him . Her mother appeared to have enlisted in the Union army , and , her father being detained in that characteristic manner by Mr. Sumner , there was evidently nothing to be done but for Gypsy to go to Winnie 's relief . This she hastened to do with all possible speed . She dressed herself under a remarkable sense of not being able to find any buttons , and of getting all her sleeves upon the wrong arm . She put on her rubber-boots , because it took so long to lace up her boots . Her stockings she wore upon her arms . The reason appeared to be , that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stopped to put on her sack , her turban , and her blue veil . She also spent considerable time in commendable efforts to pin on a lace collar which utterly refused to be pinned , and to fasten at her throat a velvet bow that kept turning into a little green snake , and twisting round her fingers . When at length she was fairly ready , she left the house softly , under the impression that Tom ( who appeared to have the remarkable capacity of being in the house and down in the maple-trees at one and the same time ) would stop her if he heard her . She ran down the lane and over the fields and into the woods , where the Kleiner Berg rose darkly in front of her ; so , at last , to the Basin , which rippled and washed on its shore , and tossed up at her feet -- an empty milk-pitcher ! A horrible fear seized her . She had come too late . Winnie was drowned . It was all owing to that lace collar . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peered down into the dark water . But Tom laughed in the maple-tree ; and there was no sign nor sound of Winnie . She cried out with a loud cry , and awoke . She lifted up her head , and saw --  --  CHAPTER V WHAT SHE SAW A great , solemn stretch of sky , alive with stars . A sheet of silent water . A long line of silent hills . She had acted out her dream ! When the truth came to Gypsy , she sat for a moment like one stunned . The terrible sense of awakening in a desolate place , at midnight , and alone , instead of in a safe and quiet bed , with bolted doors , and friends within the slightest call , might well alarm an older and stouter heart than Gypsy 's . The consciousness of having wandered she did not know whither , she did not know how , in the helplessness of sleep , into a place where her voice could reach no human ear , was in itself enough to freeze her where she sat , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the darkness . After a few moments she stirred , shivered a little , and looked about her . It was the Basin , surely . There were the maples , there was the Kleiner Berg rolling up , soft and shadowy , among its pines . There were the mountains , towering and sharp -- terrible shadows against the sky . Here , too , was the Dipper beneath her , swaying idly back and forth upon the water . She remembered , with a little cry of joy , that the boat was always locked ; she could not have stirred from the shore ; it would be but the work of a moment to jump upon the wharf , then back swiftly through the fields to the house . She looked back . The wharf was not in sight . A dark distance lay between her and it . The beds of lily-leaves , and the dropping blossoms of the maples were about her on every side . She had drifted half across the pond . She understood it all in a moment -- she had not locked the boat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were half a mile away , in the barn at home . There was not so much as a branch floating within reach on the water . She tried to pull up the board seats of the boat , under the impression that she could , by degrees , paddle herself ashore with one of them . But they were nailed tightly in their places , and she could not stir them . Evidently , there was nothing to be done . Perhaps the boat would drift ashore somewhere ; she could land anywhere ; even on the steep Kleiner Berg side she could easily have found footing ; she was well used to climbing its narrow ledges , and knew every crack and crevice and projection where a step could be taken . But , no ; the boat was not going to drift ashore . It had stopped in a tangle of lily-leaves , far out in the water , and there was not a breath of wind to stir it . If the water had not been deep she could have waded ashore ; but her practised ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against her hand , that wading was not to be thought of . To be sure , Gypsy could swim ; but a walk of half a mile in drenched clothes was hardly preferable to sitting still in a dry boat , to say nothing of the inconvenience of swimming in crinoline , and on a dark night . No , there was nothing to be done but to sit still till morning . Having come to this conclusion , Gypsy gave another little shiver , and slipped down into the bottom of the boat , thinking she might lie with her head under the stern-seat , and thus be somewhat shielded from the chilly air . In turning up her sack-collar , to protect her throat , she touched something soft , which proved to be the lace collar . This led her to examine her dress . She now noticed for the first time that one stocking was drawn up over her hand ,  - -  the other she had probably lost on the way ,  - -  and that she had put her bare feet into rubber-boots . The lace collar was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her throat , and which had doubtless been the snake of her dream . Lonely , frightened , and cold as she was , Gypsy 's sense of the ludicrous overcame her at that , and she broke into a little laugh . That laugh seemed to drive away the mystery and terror of her situation , in spite of the curious sound it had in echoing over the lonely water ; and Gypsy set herself to work with her usual good sense to see how matters stood . " In the first place , " she reasoned , talking half aloud for the sake of the company of her own voice , " I 've had a fit of what the dictionary calls somnambulism , I suppose . I eat too much pop-corn after supper , and that 's the whole of it , it always makes me dream ,  - -  only I never was goose enough to get out of bed before , and I rather think it 'll be some time before I do again . I came down stairs softly , and out of the back door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear me till morning , and I 'm in a pretty fix . If I had n't forgotten to lock the boat I should be back in bed by this time . Oh dear ! I wish I were . However , I 'm too large to tip myself over and get drowned , and I could n't get hurt any other way ; and there 's nothing to be afraid of if I do have to stay here till morning , except sore throat , so there 's no great harm done . The worst of it is , that old Tom ! Wo n't he laugh at me about the boat ! I never expect to hear the end of it . Then when they go to my room and find me gone , in the morning , they 'll be frightened . I 'm rather sorry for that . I wish I knew what time it is . " Just then the distant church-clock struck two . Gypsy held her breath , and listened to it . It had a singular , solemn sound . She had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before in her life . That was once when she was very small , when her father was dangerously sick , and the coming of the doctor had wakened her . She had always somehow associated the hour with mysterious flickering lights , and anxious whispers and softened steps , and a dread as terrible as it was undefined . Now , out here in this desolate place , where the birds were asleep in their nests , and the winds quiet among the mountain-tops , and the very frogs tired of their chanting ,  - -  herself the only waking thing , these two far , deep-toned syllables seemed like a human voice . Like the voice , Gypsy fancied , of some one imprisoned for years in the belfry , and crying to get out . Two o'clock . Three -- four -- five -- six . At about six they would begin to miss her ; her mother always called her , then , to get up . Four hours . " Hum , well , " said Gypsy , drawing her sack-collar closer , " pretty long time to sit out in a boat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just then her foot struck something soft under the seat . She pulled it out , and found it to be an old coat of Tom 's , which he sometimes used for boating . Fortunately it was not wet , for the boat was new , and did not leak . She wrapped it closely around her shoulders , curled herself up snugly in the stern , and presently pronounced herself " as warm as toast , and as comfortable as an oyster . " Then she began to look about her . All around and underneath her lay the black , still water ,  - -  so black that the maple-branches cast no shadow on it . About and above her rose the mountains , grim and mute , and watching , as they had watched for ages , and would watch for ages still , all the long night through . Overhead , the stars glittered and throbbed , and shot in and out of ragged clouds . Far up in the great forests , that climbed the mountain-sides , the wind was muttering like an angry voice . Somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she were a poet , she would write some verses just then ; indeed , if she had had a pencil , I am not sure but she would have , as it was . Then some other thoughts came to Gypsy . She wondered why , of all places , she chanced to come to the Basin in her dream . She might have gone to the saw-mill , and been caught and whirred to death in the machinery . She might have gone to the bridge over the river , and thrown herself off , not knowing what she did . Or , what if the pond had been a river , and she were now floating away , helpless , out of reach of any who came to save her , to some far-off dam where the water roared and splashed on cruel rocks . Or she might , in her dream , have tipped over the boat where the water was deep , and been unable to swim , encumbered by her clothing . Then she might have been such a girl as Sarah Rowe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find herself in such a place . But she had been led to the quiet , familiar Basin , and no harm had come to her , and she had good strong nerves , and lost all her fear in five minutes , so that the mischance would end only in an exciting adventure , which would give her something to talk about as long as she lived . Well ; she was sure she was very thankful to -- whom ? and Gypsy bowed her head a little at the question , and she sat a moment very still . Then she had other thoughts . She looked up at the shadowed mountains , and thought how year after year , summer and winter , day and night , those terrible masses of rock had cleaved together , and stood still , and caught the rains and the snows and vapors , the golden crowns of sunsets and sunrisings , the cooling winds and mellow moonlights , and done all their work of beauty and of use , and done it aright . " Not one faileth . " No avalanche had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers . No volcanic fires had torn them into seething lava . No beetling precipice , of which she ever heard , had fallen and crushed so much as the sheep feeding in the valleys . To the power of the hills as to the power of the seas , Someone had said , Thus far shalt thou go , and no farther . And the Hand that could uphold a mountain in its place , was the Hand that had guided her -- one little foolish , helpless girl , out of millions and millions of creatures for whom He was caring -- in the wanderings of an uneasy sleep that night . There was a great awe and a great joy in this thought ; but sharp upon it came another , as a pleasure is followed by a sudden pain ,  - -  a thought that came all unbidden , and talked with Gypsy , and would not go away . It was , that she had gone to bed that night without a prayer . She was tired and sleepy , and the lamp went out , and so ,  - -  and so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . Gypsy 's bowed head fell into her hands , and there , crouched in the lonely boat , under the lonely sky , she put this thought into a few whispered words , and I know there was One to hear it . Other thoughts had Gypsy after this ; but they were those she could not have put into words . For three of those solemn , human syllables had sounded from the distant clock , and far over the mountain-tops the sweet summer dawn was coming . Gypsy had never seen the sun rise . She had seen , to be sure , many times , the late , winter painting of crimson and gold in the East , which unfolded itself before her window , and chased away her dreams . But she had never watched that slow , mysterious change from midnight to morning , which is the only spectacle that can properly be called a sunrise . There was something in Gypsy that made her sit like a statue there , wrapped in Tom 's old coat , her face upturned , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and melted , and the stars began to dim in a pale , gray light , that fell and folded in the earth like a mist ; as the clouds , that floated faintly over the mountains , blushed pink from the touch of an unseen sun ; as the pink deepened into crimson , and the crimson burned to fire , and the outlines of the mountains were cut in gold ; as the gold broadened and brightened , and stole over the ragged peaks , and shot down among the forests , and filtered through the maple-leaves , and chased the purple shadows far down among the valleys ; as the birds twittered in unseen nests , and the crickets chirped in the meadows , and the dews fell and sparkled from nodding grasses , and " all the world grew green again . " Gypsy thought it was worth an ugly dream and a little fright , to see such a sight . She wondered if those old pictures of the great masters far away over the sea , of which she had heard so much , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flitting notion that , in a world where there were sunrises every day , it was very strange people should ever be cross , and tear their dresses , and forget to lock boats . It seemed as if they ought to know better . Just then Gypsy fell asleep , with her head on the bottom of the boat ; and the next she knew it was broad day , and a dear , familiar voice , from somewhere , was calling ,  --  " Gypsy !  - -  Why , Gypsy ! " " How do you do ? " said Gypsy , sleepily , sitting up straight . Tom was standing on the shore . He did not say another word . He jumped into an old mud-scull , that lay floating among the bushes , and paddled up to her before she was wide enough awake to speak . " Why , Gypsy Breynton ! " " I 've been walking in my sleep , " said Gypsy , with a little laugh ; " I came out here to save Winnie from upsetting in a milk-pitcher , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock the boat , and I could n't get ashore . " " How long have you been here ? " Tom was very pale . " Since a little before two . There was a splendid sunrise , only it was rather cold , and I did n't know where I was at first , and I -- well , I 'm glad you 're come . " " Put on my coat over that . Lean up against my arm -- so . Do n't try to talk , " said Tom , in a quick , business-like tone . But Tom was curiously pale . " Why , there 's no harm done , Tom , dear , " said Gypsy , looking up into his face . " I ca n't talk about it , Gypsy -- I ca n't , I thought , I --  --  " Tom looked the other way to see the view , and did not finish his sentence . " You do n't suppose she 's going to be a somnambulist ? " asked Mr. Breynton . This was the first time he had remembered to be worried over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent so much time in looking at her , and kissing her , and wiping his spectacles . " No , indeed , " said her mother ; " it was nothing in the world but popped-corn . The child will never have another such turn , I 'll venture . " And she never did . It is needless to say that nobody scolded Gypsy for forgetting to lock the boat . She was likely enough to remember the incident . She had , perhaps , received a severe punishment for so slight a negligence , but the reader may rest assured that the boat was always locked thereafter when Gypsy had anything to do with it . CHAPTER VI UP IN THE APPLE TREE " Gypsy ! Gypsy ! " " What 's wanted ? " " Where are you ? " " Here . " " I do n't know where ' here ' is . " " Well , you 'll find out after a while . " Winnie trotted along down the garden-path , and across the brook . " Here " proved to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch , there was a little flutter of a crimson and white gingham dress , and a merry face peeping down through the dainty pink blossoms that blushed all over the tree . It looked so pretty , framed in by the bright color and glistening sunlight , and it seemed to fit in so exactly with the fragrance and the soft , dropping petals , and the chirping of the blue-birds overhead , that I doubt if even Mrs. Surly would have had the heart to say , as Mrs. Surly was much in the habit of saying ,  --  " A young lady , twelve years old , climbing an apple-tree ! Laws a massy ! I pity your ma -- what a sight of trainin'clock she must ha ' wasted on you ! " " It looks nice up there , " said Winnie , admiringly , looking up with his mouth open ; " I 'm acomin'clock up . " " Very well , " said Gypsy . Winnie assailed a low-hanging bough , and crawled half way up , where he stopped . " Why do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think I like it better down here . You can see the grass , and things . There 's a black grasshopper here , too . " " What do you want , anyway ? " asked Gypsy , taking a few spasmodic stitches on a long , white seam ; " I 'm busy . I ca n't talk to little boys when I 'm sewing . " " Oh , I guess I do n't want anythin'clock , very much , " said Winnie , folding his arms composedly , as if he had seated himself for the day ; " I 'm five years old . " Down went Gypsy 's work , and a whole handful of pink and white blossoms came fluttering into Winnie 's eyes . " How am I going to sew ? " said Gypsy , despairingly ; " you 're so exactly in the right place to be hit . I do n't believe Mrs. Surly herself could help snowballing you . " " Mrs. Surly snowball ! Why , I never saw her . Would n't it be just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go away ? " " I say , Gypsy , if you cut off a grasshopper 's wings , and frow him in a milk-pan , what would he do ? " remarked Winnie , inclining to metaphysics , as was Winnie 's custom when he was n't wanted . Gypsy took several severe stitches , and made no answer . " Gypsy -- if somebody builded a fire inside of me and made steam , could n't I draw a train of cars ? " " Look here -- Gyp. , when a cat eats up a mouse --  --  " Winnie forgot what he was aiming at , just there , coughed , and began again . " Samson could have drawed a train of cars , anyway . " " Oh , Winnie Breynton ! " " Well , if he had a steam-leg , he 'd be jest as good as an engine -- would n't I like to seen him ! " Just then a branch struck Winnie 's head with decidedly more emphasis than the handful of blossoms , and Winnie slid to the ground , and remarked , with dignity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would come again another day . About half way up the walk , he stopped , and turned leisurely round . " Oh -- Gypsy ! Mother want 's to know where 's the key of the china-closet she let you have . She 's in a great hurry . That 's what I come down for ; I s'posed there was something or nuther . " " Why , Winnie Breynton ! and you 've been sitting there all this --  --  " " Where 's the key ? " interrupted Winnie , severely ; " mother had n't ought to be kept waitin'clock . " " It 's up-stairs in -- in , I guess in my slippers , " said Gypsy , stopping to think . " Slippers ! " " Yes . I was afraid I should forget to put it up , so I put it in my slipper , because I should feel it , and remember it . Then I took off the slippers , and that was the last I thought of it . " " It was very careless , " said Winnie , with a virtuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be out of hearing of Gypsy 's reply . Gypsy returned to her seam , and the apple-blossoms , and to her own little meditations about the china-closet key ; which , being of a private and somewhat humiliating nature , are not given to the public . The apple-tree stood in one corner of a very pleasant garden . Mr. Breynton had a great fancy for working over his trees and flowers , and , if he had not been a publisher and bookseller , might have made a very successful landscape-gardener . Poor health had driven him out of the professions , and the tastes of a scholar drove him away from out-door life ; he had compromised the matter by that book-store down opposite the post-office . The literature of a Vermont town is not of the most world-stirring nature , and it did occur to him , occasionally , that business was rather dull , but his wife loved the old home , the children were comfortable and happy , and he himself , he thought , was getting rather old to start out on any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family nest for life . It was the same methodical kind-heartedness that made him at once so thoughtful and tender a father , and yet so habitually worried by the children 's little failings , that gave him his taste for beautiful flowers and shrubbery , and his skill in cultivating them . This garden was his pet enterprise . It was gracefully laid out with winding walks , evergreens , fruit-trees and flower-beds ; not in stiff patterns , but with a delightful studied negligence , such as that with which an artist would group the figures on a landscape . Rocks and vines and wild flowers were scattered over the garden very much as they would be found in the fields ; stately roses and dahlias , delicate heliotrope and aristocratic fuchsias , would grow , side by side , with daisies and buttercups . But , best of all , Gypsy liked the corner where the golden russet stood . A bit of a brook ran across it , which had been caught in a frolic one day , as it went singing away to the meadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pond . The short-tufted grass swept over its edge like a fringe , and in their season slender hair-bells bent over , casting little blue shadows into the water ; the apple-boughs , too , hung over it , and flung down their showers of pearls and rubies , when the wind was high . Moreover , there was a statue . This statue was Gypsy 's pride and delight . It was Aladdin 's Palace , the Tuilleries , Versailles , and the Alhambra , all in one . The only fault to be found with it was that it was not marble . It was a species of weather-proof composition , but very finely carved , and much valued by Mr. Breynton . It was a pretty thing -- a water-nymph rising from an unfolded lily , with both hands parting her long hair from a wondering face , that , pleased with its own beauty , was bent to watch its reflection in the water . Altogether , the spot was so bewitching , that it is little wonder Gypsy 's work kept dropping into her lap , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless seams on a white skirt that you have torn from the placket to the hem , is not a very attractive sight , if you have it to mend , and do n't happen to like to sew any better than Gypsy did . She seemed fated to be interrupted in her convulsive attempts at " run-and-back stitching . " Winnie was hardly in the house , before Sarah Rowe came out in the garden to hunt her up . " Oh , dear , " said Gypsy , as Sarah 's face appeared under the apple-boughs ; " I 'm not a bit glad to see you . " " That 's polite , " said Sarah , reddening ; " I 'll go home again . " " Look , " said Gypsy , laughing ; " just see what I 've got to mend , and I came out here on purpose to get it done , so I could come over to your house . You see I ought n't to be glad to see you at all , but I am exceedingly . " Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , swaying bough . " Now do n't you speak a single word , " said Gypsy , with an industrious air , " till I get this done . " " No , I wo n't , " said Sarah . " What do you have to sew for , Saturday afternoons ? " " Why , it 's my mending : mother wants me to do it Saturday morning , and of course it 's a great deal easier , because then you have all the afternoon to yourself , only I never seem to get time ; I 'm sure I do n't know why . This morning I had my history topics to write . " " Why , I wrote mine yesterday ! " " I meant to , but I forgot ; Miss Melville said I mus n't put it off another day . There ! I was n't going to talk . " " Mother does my mending for me , " said Sarah . " She does ! Well , I just wish my mother would . She says it would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear such a great place , I 'd like to know ? " " Put my foot right through it , " said Gypsy , disconsolately . " It was hanging on a chair , and I just stepped in it and started to run , and down I went ,  - -  and here 's the skirt . I was running after the cat . I 'd put her under my best hat , and she was spinning down stairs . You never saw anything so funny ! I 'm always doing such things ,  - -  I mean like the skirt . I do declare ! you must n't talk . " " I 'm not , " said Sarah , laughing ; " it 's you that are talking . You have n't sewed a stitch for five minutes , either . " Gypsy sighed , and her needle began to fly savagely . There was a little silence . " You see , " said Gypsy , breaking it , " I 'm trying to reform . " " Reform ? " said Sarah , with some vague ideas of Luther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacles , and reading Cruden 's " Concordance . " " Yes , " nodded Gypsy , " reform . I never knew anybody need it as much as I. I never do things anyway , and then I do them wrong , and then I forget all about them . Mother says I 'm improving . She says my room used to look like a perfect Babel , and now I keep the wardrobe door shut , and dust it out -- sometimes . Then there 's my mending . I came out here so 's to be quiet and keep at it . The poor dear woman is so afraid I wo n't learn to do things in a lady-like way . It would be dreadful not to grow up a lady , would n't it ? " " Dreadful ! " said Sarah ; " only I wish you 'd hurry and get through , so we can go down to the swamp and sail . Could n't you take a little bigger stitches ? " " No , " said Gypsy , resolutely ; " I should have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it right , if it takes me all day . " Gypsy began to sew with a will , and Sarah , finding it was for her own interest in the end , stopped talking ; so the fearful seam was soon neatly finished , the work folded up , and the thimble and scissors put away carefully in the little green reticule . " I lose so many thimbles , you do n't know ! " observed Gypsy , by way of comment . " I 'm going to see if I ca n't keep this one three months . " " Now let 's go , " said Sarah . " In a minute ; I must carry my work up first . I 'm going to jump off -- it 's real fun . You see if I do n't go as far as that dandelion . " So Gypsy sprang from the tree , carrying a shower of blossoms with her . " Oh , look out for the statue ! " cried Sarah . The warning came too late . Gypsy fell short of her mark , hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the water , where the paved bottom was hard as rock . " Just see what you 've done ! " said Sarah , who had not a capacity for making comforting remarks . " What do you suppose your father will say ? " Gypsy stood aghast . The water gurgled over the fallen statue , whose pretty , upraised hands were snapped at the wrist , and the wondering face crushed in . There was a moment 's silence . " Do n't you tell ! " said Sarah at length ; " nobody saw it fall , and they 'll never think you did it . You just seem surprised , and keep still about it . " Gypsy flushed to her forehead . " Why , Sarah Rowe ! how can you say such a thing ? I would n't tell a lie for anything in this world ! " " It would n't be a lie ! " said Sarah , looking ashamed and provoked . " You need n't say you did n't do it . " " It would be a lie ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if anybody knew ,  - -  I would n't be so mean , even if I knew he could n't find out . I am going to tell him this minute . " Gypsy started off , with her cheeks still very red , up the garden paths and down the road , and Sarah followed slowly . Gypsy 's sense of honor had received too great a shock for her to take pleasure just then in Sarah 's company , and Sarah had an uneasy sense of having lowered herself in her friend 's eyes , so the two girls separated for the afternoon . It was about a mile to Mr. Breynton 's store . The afternoon was warm for the season , and the road dusty ; but Gypsy ran nearly all the way . She was too much troubled about the accident to think of anything else , and in as much haste to tell her father as some children would have been to conceal it from him . Old Mr. Simms , the clerk , looked up over his spectacles in mild astonishment , as Gypsy entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Simms , who had no children of his own , and only a deaf wife and a lame dog at home for company , Gypsy was always pretty , always " such a wonderful development for a young person , " and always just about right in whatever she did . " Why , good afternoon , Miss Gypsy , " said Mr. Simms ; " I 'm surprised to see you such a warm day -- very much surprised . But you always were a remarkable young lady . " " Yes , " panted Gypsy ; " where 's father , Mr. Simms ? " " He 's up in the printing-room just now , talking with the foreman . Can I carry any message for you , Miss Gypsy ? " " Oh , Mr. Simms , " said Gypsy , confidentially , " I 've done the most dreadful thing ! " " Dear me ! I do n't see how that is possible , " said Mr. Simms , taking his spectacles off nervously , and putting them on again . " I have , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is that all ? " asked Mr. Simms , looking relieved ; " why , how did it happen ? " " I jumped on it . " " Jumped on it ! " " Yes ; I 'm sure I do n't know what father 'll say . " " Well , I must say you are a wonderful young person , " said Mr. Simms , proudly . " I 'm sure I 'm glad that 's all . Do n't you fret , my dear . Your father wo n't care much about water-nymphs , when he has such a daughter . " " But he will , " said Gypsy , who regarded Mr. Simm 's compliments only as a tiresome interruption to conversation , and by no means as entitled to any attention ; " he will be very sorry , and I am going to tell him right off . Please , Mr. Simms , will you speak to him ? " " Remarkable development of veracity ! " said Mr. Simms , as he bowed himself away in his polite , old-fashioned way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printing-rooms . It seemed to Gypsy , waiting there so impatiently , as if her father would never come down . But come he did at last , looking very much surprised to see her , and anxious to know if the house were on fire , or if Winnie were drowned . " No , " said Gypsy , " nothing has happened ,  - -  I mean nothing of that sort . It 's only about me . I have something to tell you . " " I think I will walk home with you , " said her father . " There is n't much going on Saturday afternoons . Simms , you can lock up when you go home to supper . I hope you have n't been giving your mother any trouble , or thrown your ball into Mrs. Surly 's windows again , " he added , nervously , as they passed out of the door and up the street together . " No , sir , " said Gypsy , faintly ; " it 's worse than that . " Mr. Breynton heaved a sigh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm always up to mischief , and I do n't suppose I 'll ever learn to be a lady and know how not to break things , and I 'm so sorry , but I did n't suppose there was any harm in jumping off an apple-tree , and the water-nymph went over and perhaps if you sent me to school or something I 'd learn better where they tie you down to a great board , " said Gypsy , talking very fast , and quite forgetting her punctuation . " The water-nymph ! " echoed Mr. Breynton . " Yes , " said Gypsy , dolefully ; " right over , head-first -- into the pond -- broken to smash ! " " Oh , Gypsy ! that is too bad . " " I know it , " interrupted Gypsy ; " I know it was terribly careless -- terribly . Did you ever know anything so exactly like me ? The worst of it is , being sorry does n't help the matter . I wish I could buy you another . Wo n't you please to take my five dollars , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want your money , my child , " said Mr. Breynton , looking troubled and puzzled . " I 'm sorry the nymph is gone ; but somehow you do seem to be different from other girls . I did n't know young ladies ever jumped . " Gypsy was silent . Her father and mother seemed to think differently about these things . To her view , and she felt sure , to her mother 's , the fault lay in the carelessness of not finding out whether the image was in her way . She could not see that she was doing anything wrong in going out alone into an apple-tree , and springing from a low bough , upon the soft grass . Very likely , when she was a grown-up young lady , with long dresses and hair done up behind , she should n't care anything about climbing trees . But that was another question . However , she had too much respect for her father to say this . So she hung her head , feeling very humble and sorry , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow , he was always so ready to do things for her . " Well , " said her father , after a moment 's thought , in which he had been struggling with a sense of disappointment at the destruction of his statue , that would have made a less kind-hearted man scold . " Well , it ca n't be helped ; and as to the climbing trees , I suppose your mother knows best . I am glad you came and told me , anyway -- very glad . You are a truthful child , Gypsy , in spite of your faults . " " I could n't bear to tell lies , " said Gypsy , brightening a little . It is possible this was another one of the reasons why people had such a habit of loving Gypsy . What do you think ? CHAPTER VII JUST LIKE GYPSY One afternoon Gypsy was coming home from the post-office . It was a rare June day . The great soft shadows fell and faded on the mountains , and the air was sweet with the breath of a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seemed to Gypsy that she had never seen such mellow sunlight , or skies so pure and blue ; that no birds ever sung such songs in the elm-trees , and never were butterflies so golden and brown and beautiful as those which fluttered drowsily over the tiny roadside clovers . The thought came to her like a little sudden heart-throb , that thrilled her through and through , that this world was a very great world , and very beautiful , it seemed so alive and happy , from the arch of the blazing sky down to the blossoms of the purple weeds that hid in the grass . She wondered that she had never thought of it before . How many millions of people were enjoying this wonderful day ! What a great thing it was to live in such a world , where everything was so beautiful and useful and happy ! The very fact that she was alive in it made her so glad . She felt as if she would like to go off on the rocks somewhere , and shout and jump and sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowded tenement-houses , swinging her little letter-basket on her arm , and dreaming away with her great brown eyes , as such young eyes will always dream upon a summer 's day , there suddenly struck upon that happy thought of hers a mournful sound . It was a human groan . It grated on Gypsy 's musing , as a file grates upon smooth marble ; she started , and looked up . The sound came from an open window directly over her head . What could anybody be groaning about such a day as this ? Gypsy felt a momentary impatience with the mournful sound ; then a sudden curiosity to know what it meant . A door happened to be open near her , and she walked right in , without a second thought , as was the fashion in which Gypsy usually did things . A pair of steep stairs led up from the bit of an entry , and a quantity of children , whose faces and hands were decidedly the worse for wear , were playing on them . " How do you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who lives here ? " asked Gypsy , again . The children put their fingers in their mouths . " Who is that groaning so ? " persisted Gypsy , repressing a strong desire to box their ears . The children crawled a little further up-stairs , and peered at her from between their locks of shaggy hair , as if they considered her a species of burglar . At this moment a side door opened , and a red-faced woman , who was wiping her hands on her apron , put her head out into the entry , and asked , in rather a surly tone , what was wanted . " Who is that groaning ? " repeated Gypsy . " Oh , that 's nobody but Grandmother Littlejohn , " said the woman , with a laugh , " she 's always groanin'clock . " " But what does she groan for ? " insisted Gypsy , her curiosity nowise diminished to see a person who could be " always groanin'clock , " through not only one , but many , of such golden summer days . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the matter of that , " said the woman , carelessly ; " she 's broke a bone ,  - -  though she do make a terrible fuss over it , and very onobligin'clock it is to the neighbors as has the lookin'clock after of her . " " Broken a bone ! Poor thing , I 'm going right up to see her ! " said Gypsy , whose compassion was rising fast . " Good luck to you ! " said the woman , with a laugh Gypsy did not like very much . It only strengthened her resolution , however , and she ran up the narrow stairs scattering the children right and left . Several other untidy-looking women opened doors and peered out at her as she went by ; but no one else spoke to her . Guided by the sound of the groans , which came at regular intervals like long breaths , she went up a second flight of stairs , more narrow and more dark than the first , and turned into a little low room , the door of which stood open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from inside . " I , " said Gypsy ; " may I come in ? " " I do n't know who you be , " said the voice , " but you may come ' long ef you want to . " Gypsy accepted the somewhat dubious invitation . The room was in sad disorder , and very dusty . An old yellow cat sat blinking at a sunbeam , and an old , yellow , wizened woman lay upon the bed . Her forehead was all drawn and knotted with pain , and her mouth looked just like her voice -- fretful and sharp . She turned her head slowly , as Gypsy entered , but otherwise she did not alter her position ; as if it were one which she could not change without pain . " Good afternoon , " said Gypsy , feeling a little embarrassed , and not knowing exactly what to say , now she was up there . " Good arternoon , " said Grandmother Littlejohn , with a groan . " I heard you groan out in the street , " said Gypsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up to see what was the matter . " " Matter ? " said the old woman sharply , " I fell down stairs and broke my ankle , that 's the matter , an'clock I wonder the whole town hai n't heerd me holler ,  - -  I ca n't sleep day nor night with the pain , an'clock it 's matter enough , I think . " " I 'm real sorry , " said Gypsy . Mrs. Littlejohn broke into a fresh spasm of groaning at this , and seemed to be in such suffering , that it made Gypsy turn pale to hear her . " Have n't you had a doctor ? " she asked , compassionately . " Laws yes , " said the old woman . " Had a doctor ! I guess I have , a young fellar who said he was representative from somewhere from Medical Profession , seems to me it war , but I never heerd o n't , wharever it is , an'clock he with his whiskers only half growed , an'clock puttin'clock of my foot into a wooden box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind , and he hai n't come nigh me since , and I wo n't have him agin noways . " " But they always splinter broken limbs , " said Gypsy . " Splinters ? " cried the old woman ; " I tell ye I fell down stairs ! I did n't get no splinters in . " Gypsy concluded to suppress her surgical information . " Who takes care of you ? " she asked , suddenly . " Nobody ! I do n't want nobody takin'clock care of me when I ai n't shut up in a box on the bed , an'clock now I am , the neighbors is shy enough of troublin'clock themselves about me , an'clock talks of the work-house . I 'll starve fust ! " " Who gives you your dinners and suppers ? " asked Gypsy , beginning to think Grandmother Littlejohn was a very ill-treated woman . " It 's little enough I gets , " said the old woman , groaning afresh ; " they brings me up a cup of cold tea when they feels like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth to eat ' em . I hai n't had a mouthful of dinner this day , and that 's the truth , now ! " " No dinner , " cried Gypsy . " Why , how sorry I am for you ! I 'll go right home and get you some , and tell my mother . She 'll take care of you -- she always does take care of everybody . " " You 're a pretty little gal , " said Mrs. Littlejohn , with a sigh ; " an'clock I hope you 'll be rewarded for botherin'clock yourself about a poor old woman like me . Does your ma use white sugar ? I like white sugar in my tea . " " Oh yes , " said Gypsy , rather pleased than otherwise to be called a " pretty little gal . " " Oh yes ; we have a whole barrel full . You can have some just as well as not ; I 'll bring you down a pound or so , and I have five dollars at home that you might have . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Dear me ! " said Mrs. Littlejohn ; " what a angel of mercy to the poor and afflicted you be ! I should like some fresh salmon and green peas , now , if I could get ' em . " " Very well , " said Gypsy ; " I 'll hurry home and see about it . " Accordingly she left the old woman groaning out her thanks , and went down the narrow stairs , and into the street . She ran all the way home , and rushed into the parlor where her mother was sitting quietly sewing . She looked up as the door burst open , and Gypsy swept in like a little hurricane , her turban hanging down her neck , her hair loose and flying about an eager face that was all on fire with its warm crimson color and twinkling eyes . " Why Gypsy ! " " Oh , mother , such an old woman -- such a poor old woman ! groaning right out in the street -- I mean , I was out in the street , and heard her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she broke her ankle , and the neighbors wo n't give her anything to eat , unless she goes to the poor-house and starves , and she has n't had any dinner , and --  --  " " Wait a minute , Gypsy ; what does all this mean ? " " Why , she fell down those horrid stairs and broke her ankle , and wants some salmon and green peas , and I 'm going to give her my five dollars , and --  -- Oh , white sugar , some white sugar for her tea . I never heard anybody groan so , in all my life ! " Mrs. Breynton laid down her work , and laughed . " Why , mother ! " said Gypsy , reddening , " I do n't see what there is to laugh at ! " " My dear Gypsy , you would laugh if you had heard your own story . The most I can make out of it is , that a little girl who is so excited she hardly knows what she is talking about , has seen an old woman who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ankle , and is starving , " began Gypsy . " Stop a minute , " interrupted Mrs. Breynton , gently . " Sit down and take off your things , and when you get rested tell me the story quietly and slowly , and then we will see what is to be done for your old woman . " Gypsy , very reluctantly , obeyed . It seemed to her incredible that any one could be so quiet and composed as her mother was , when there was an old woman in town who had had no dinner . However , she sat still and fanned herself , and when she was rested , she managed to tell her story in as connected and rational manner , and with as few comments and exclamations of her own , as Gypsy was capable of getting along with , in any narration . " Very well , " said her mother , when it was finished ; " I begin to understand things better . Let me see : in the first place , you felt so sorry for the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among a sort of people you knew nothing about , and without stopping to think whether I should be willing to have you -- was n't that so ? " " Yes 'm , " said Gypsy , hanging her head a little ; " I did n't think -- she did groan so . " " Then Mrs. Littlejohn seems to like to complain , it strikes me . " " Complain ! " said Gypsy , indignantly . " Yes , a little . However , she might have worse faults . The most remarkable thing about her seems to be her modest request for salmon and white sugar . You propose giving them to her ? " " Why , yes 'm , " said Gypsy , promptly . " She 's in such dreadful pain . When I sprained my wrist , you gave me nice things to eat . " " But it would n't follow that I should give Mrs. Littlejohn the same , " said Mrs. Breynton , gently . " Salmon and white sugar are expensive luxuries . I might be able to do something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to afford to take her down the two or three pounds of sugar you promised her , nor to spend several dollars on fresh salmon -- a delicacy which we have had on our own table but once this season . Besides , there are thirty or forty sick people in town , probably , who are as poor and as much in need of assistance as this one old woman . You see , do n't you , that I could not give salmon and peas and white sugar to them all , and it would be unwise in me to spend all my money on one , when I might divide it , and help several people . " " But there 's my five dollars , " said Gypsy , only half convinced . " Very well , supposing I were to let you give it all away to Mrs. Littlejohn , even if she were the most worthy and needy person that could be found in town , what then ? It is all gone . You have nothing more to give . The next week a poor little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sunday-school , excites your sympathy , and you would be glad to give something toward buying her a hat -- you have not a copper . You go to Monthly Concert , and want to drop something into the contribution box , but Mrs. Littlejohn has eaten up what you might have given . You want to do something for the poor freedmen , who are coming into our armies ; you can not do it , for you have nothing to give . " " Well , " said Gypsy , with a ludicrous expression of conviction and discomfiture , " I suppose so ; I did n't think . " " Did n't think !  - -  the old enemy , Gypsy . And now that I have pointed out the little mistakes you made this afternoon , I want to tell you , Gypsy , how pleased I am that you were so quick to feel sorry for the old woman , and so ready to be generous with your own money and help . I would rather have you fail a dozen times on the unselfish side , than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made poor , and in suffering --  -- there ! I have given you a long sermon . Do you think mother is always scolding ? " Mrs. Breynton drew her into her arms , and gave her one of those little soft kisses on the forehead , that Gypsy liked so much . " I will go down and see the old woman after supper , " she said , then . " Could n't you go before ? " suggested Gypsy . " She said she had n't had any dinner . " " We ca n't do things in too much of a hurry ; not even our charities , " said Mrs. Breynton , smiling . " I have some work which I can not leave now , and I have little doubt the woman had some dinner . The poor are almost always very kind neighbors to each other . I will be there early enough to take her some supper . " So Gypsy was comforted for Mrs. Littlejohn . It was nearly dark when Mrs. Breynton came up from the village , with her pleasant smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sight , for the biscuit and the jellies , the blanc-mange , and the dried beef and the cookies , that it brought to so many sick-beds . Gypsy had been watching for her impatiently , and ran down to the gate to meet her . " Well , did you find her ? " " Oh , yes . " " What do you think of her ? " asked Gypsy , a little puzzled by her mother 's expression . " She is a good deal of a scold , and something of a sufferer , " said Mrs. Breynton . Gypsy 's face fell , and they walked up to the house in silence . " Then you 're not going to do anything for her ? " asked Gypsy , at length , in a disappointed tone . " Oh , yes . She needs help . She ca n't be moved to the poor-house now , and , besides , is likely to get well before long , if she is properly taken care of . I gave her her supper , and have arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals for a few days , till we see how she is , and what had better be done . I take care of her to-morrow , and Mrs. Rowe takes her the next day . " " Good ! " said Gypsy , brightening ; " and I may take her down the things , may n't I , mother ? " " If you want to . " Gypsy went to bed as happy as a queen . The next morning she rose early , to be sure to be in time to take Mrs. Littlejohn 's breakfast ; and was disappointed enough , when her mother thought it best she should wait till she had eaten her own . However , on the strength of the remembrance of her mother 's tried and proved wisdom , on certain other little occasions , she submitted with a good grace . She carried Mrs. Littlejohn a very good breakfast of griddle-cakes and fish-balls and sweet white bread , and was somewhat taken aback to find that the old woman received it rather curtly , and asked after the salmon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dinner , the walk was long and wearisome , and Mrs. Littlejohn neglected to call her an angel of mercy , and it must be confessed Gypsy 's enthusiasm diminished perceptibly . That evening Mr. and Mrs. Breynton were out to tea , and Tom was off fishing . Mrs. Breynton left Mrs. Littlejohn 's supper in a basket on the shelf , and told Gypsy where it was . Gypsy had been having a great frolic in the fresh hay with Sarah Rowe , and came in late . No one but Winnie was there . She ate her supper in a great hurry , and went out again . Patty saw her from the window , and concluded she had gone to Mrs. Littlejohn 's . That night , about eleven o'clock , some one knocked at Mrs. Breynton 's door , and woke her up . " Who is it ? " she called . " Oh , mother Breynton ! " said a doleful voice ; " what do you suppose I 've done now ? " " I 'm sure I do n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hope she has n't been walking in her sleep again , " said Mr. Breynton , nervously . " Forgotten Mrs. Littlejohn 's supper , " said the doleful voice through the key-hole . " Why , Gypsy ! " " I know it , " said Gypsy , humbly . " Could n't I dress and run down ? " " Why , no indeed ! it ca n't be helped now . Run back to bed . " " Just like Gypsy , for all the world ! " said Tom , the next morning . " Always so quick and generous , and sorry for people , and ready to do , and you can depend on her just about as much as you could on a brisk west wind ! " CHAPTER VIII PEACE MAYTHORNE " After you have seen Mrs. Littlejohn , and explained why she went supperless last night , " said Mrs. Breynton , " I want you to do an errand for me . " " What is it ? " asked Gypsy , pleasantly . She felt very humble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make herself useful . " I want you to find out where Peace Maythorne 's room is , it is in the same house ,  - -  and carry her this , with my love . " Mrs. Breynton took up a copy of " Harper 's Magazine , " and handed it to Gypsy . " Tell her I have turned the leaf down at some articles I think will interest her , and ask her if the powder I left her put her to sleep . " " Who is Peace Maythorne ? " asked Gypsy , wondering . " Is she poor ? " " Yes . " " How funny to send her a ' Harper 's , ' " said Gypsy . " Why do n't you give her some money , or something ? " " Some things are worth more than money to some people , " said Mrs. Breynton , smiling . " Why ! then you had been into that house before I found Mrs. Littlejohn ? " said Gypsy , as the thought first struck her . " Oh , yes ; many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under her arm , wondering if there were a house in town , filled with these wretched poor , in which her mother was not known as a friend . Her heart sank a little as she climbed the dark stairs to Mrs. Littlejohn 's room . She had begged of her mother a tiny pailful of green peas , with which she hoped to pacify the old woman , but she was somewhat in dread of hearing her talk , and ashamed to confess her own neglect . Mrs. Littlejohn was eating the very nice breakfast which Mrs. Rowe had sent over , and groaning dolefully over it , as Gypsy entered . " Good morning , " said Gypsy . " Good morning , " said Mrs. Littlejohn , severely . " I went out to play in the hay with Sarah Rowe , and forgot all about your supper last night , and I 'm just as sorry as I can be , " said Gypsy , coming to the point frankly , and without any attempt to excuse herself . " Oh , of course ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's all I expect . I 'm a poor lone widdy with a bone broke , and I 'm used to bein'clock forgot . Little gals that has everything they want , and five dollars besides , and promises me salmon and such , could n't be expected to remember the sufferin'clock and afflicted ,  - -  of course not . " It was not an easy nor a pleasant thing to apologize to a person to whom she had played the charitable lady the day before ; and Mrs. Littlejohn 's manner of receiving the explanation certainly made it no easier . But Gypsy , as the saying goes , " swallowed her pride , " and felt that she deserved it . " I 've brought you some peas , " she said , meekly . " Oh ! " said the old woman , relenting a little , " you have , have you ? Well , I 'm obleeged to you , and you can set ' em in the cupboard . " Gypsy emptied her peas into a yellow bowl which she found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything for you ? " " I 'm terrible thirsty ! " said Mrs. Littlejohn , with a long groan . " There 's some water in that air pail . " Gypsy went into the corner where the pail stood , and filled the mug with water ; then , not being able to think of anything more to say , she concluded to go . " Good mornin'clock , " said Mrs. Littlejohn , in a forgiving tone ; " I hope you 'll come agin . " Gypsy secretly thought it was doubtful if she ever did . Her charity , like that of most young people of her age and experience , was not of the sort calculated to survive under difficulties , or to deal successfully with shrewish old women . After inquiring in vain of the group of staring children where Peace Maythorne 's room was , Gypsy resorted to her friend , the red-faced woman , who directed her to a door upon the second story . It was closed , and Gypsy knocked . " Come in , " said a quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not get up and open the door , and if she did not know it was more polite . She stopped short , as she entered the room , and wondered no longer . It was a plain , bare room , but neat enough , and not unpleasant nor unhomelike , because of the great flood of morning sunlight that fell in and touched everything to golden warmth . It touched most brightly , and lingered longest , on a low bed drawn up between the windows . A girl lay there , with a pale face turned over on the pillows , and weak , thin hands , folded on the counterpane . She might , from her size , have been about sixteen years of age ; but her face was like the face of a woman long grown old . The clothing of the bed partially concealed her shoulders , which were cruelly rounded and bent . So Peace Maythorne was a cripple . Gypsy recovered from her astonishment with a little start , and said , blushing , for fear she had been rude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother sent me down with a magazine . " " I am glad to see you , " said Peace Maythorne , smiling . " Wo n't you sit down ? " Gypsy took a chair by the bed , thinking how pleasant the old , pale face , was , after all , and how kindly and happy the smile . " Your mother is very kind , " said Peace ; " she is always doing something for me . She has given me a great deal to read . " " Do you like to read ?  - -  I do n't , " said Gypsy . " Why , yes ! " said Peace , opening her eyes wide ; " I thought everybody liked to read . Besides I ca n't do anything else , you know . " " Nothing at all ? " asked Gypsy . " Only sometimes , when the pain is n't very bad , I try to help aunt about her sewing , I ca n't do much . " " Oh , you live with your aunt ? " said Gypsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's out , just now . " " Does your back pain you a great deal ? " asked Gypsy . " Oh , yes ; all the time . But , then , I get used to it , you know , " said Peace . " All the time !  - -  oh , I am so sorry ! " said Gypsy , drawing a long breath . " Oh , it might be worse , " said Peace , smiling . " I 've only lain here three years . Some people ca n't move for forty . The doctor says I sha' n't live so long as that . " Gypsy looked at the low bed , the narrow room , the pallid face and shrunken body cramped there , moveless , on the pillows . Three years ! Three years to lie through summer suns and winter snows , while all the world was out at play , and happy ! " Well , " said Gypsy , as the most appropriate comment suggesting itself ; " you are rather different from Mrs. Littlejohn ! " Peace smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Poor Mrs. Littlejohn ! You see , she is n't used to being sick , and I am ; that makes the difference . " " Oh , I forgot ! " said Gypsy , abruptly , " mother said I was to ask if those powders she left you put you to sleep . " " Nicely . They 're better than anything the doctor gave me ; everything your mother does seems to be the best sort , somehow . She ca n't touch your hand , or smooth your pillow , without doing it differently from other people . " " That 's so ! " said Gypsy , emphatically . " There is n't anybody else like her . Do you lie awake very often ? " Peace answered in the two quiet words that were on her lips so often , in the quiet voice that never complained ,  --  " Oh , yes . " There was a little silence . Gypsy was watching Peace . Peace had her eyes turned away from her visitor , but she was conscious of every quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flutter of her hands . The two girls were studying each other . Gypsy 's investigations , whatever they were , seemed to be very pleasant , for she started at last with a bit of a sigh , and announced the result of them in the characteristic words ,  --  " I like you ! " To her surprise , Peace just turned up her eyes and turned them away , and the eyes were full of tears . After a moment ,  --  " Thank you . I do n't see many people so young -- except the children . I tell them stories sometimes . " " But you wo n't like me , " said Gypsy . " I rather think I shall . " " No you wo n't , " said Gypsy , shaking her head decidedly ; " not a bit . I know you wo n't . I 'm silly , well , I 'll tell you what I am by-and-by . First , I want to hear all about you ,  - -  everything , I mean , " she added , with a quick delicacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had a great deal ,  --  " everything that you care to tell me . " " Why , I 've nothing to tell , " said Peace , smiling , " cooped up here all the time ; it 's all the same . " " That 's just what I want to hear about . About the being cooped up . I do n't see how you bear it ! " said Gypsy , impetuously . Peace smiled again . Gypsy had a fancy that the smile had stolen one of the sunbeams that lay in such golden , flickering waves , upon the bed . Too much self-depreciation is often a sign of the extremest vanity . Peace had nothing of this . Seeing that Gypsy was in earnest in her wish to hear her story , she quietly began it without further parley . It was very simple , and quickly told . " We used to live on a farm on the mountains -- father and mother and I. There were a great many cattle , and so much ground it tired me to walk across it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us in the evenings . I suppose that 's the way I 've learned to love to read , and I 've been so glad since . I was pretty small when they died ,  - -  first father , then mother . I remember it a little ; at least I remember about mother , she kissed me so , and cried . Then Aunt Jane came for me , and brought me here . We lived in a pleasant house up the street , at first . I used to work in the mill , and earned enough to pay aunt what I cost her . Then one day , when I was thirteen years old , we were coming out at noon , all of us girls , in a great hurry and frolic , and I felt sick and dizzy watching the wheels go round , and , well , they did n't mean to ,  - -  but they pushed me , and I fell . " " Down stairs ? " " All the way , it was a long , crooked flight . I struck my spine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Gypsy , half under her breath . " I was sick for a little while ; then I got better . I thought it was all over . Then one day I found a little curve between my shoulders , and so , well , it came so slowly I hardly knew it , till at last I was in bed with the pain . We had come here because it was hard times , and aunt had to support me ,  - -  and then there were the doctor 's bills . " " Does n't he say you can ever get well ? never sit up a little while ? " " Oh , no . " Gypsy gasped a little , as if she were suffocating . " And your aunt ,  - -  is she kind to you ? " " Oh , yes . " A certain flitting expression , that the face of Peace caught with the words , Gypsy could not help seeing . " But I mean , real kind . Does she love you ? " The girl 's cheek flushed to a pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very good to me . I am a great trouble . You know I am not her own . It is very hard for her that I ca n't support myself . " Gypsy said something just then , in her innermost thought of thoughts , about Aunt Jane , that Aunt Jane would not have cared to hear . " If I could only earn something ! " said Peace , with a quick breath , that sounded like a sigh . " That is hardest of all . But it 's all right somehow . " " Peace Maythorne ! " said Gypsy , in a little flash , " I do n't see ! never to go out in the wind and jump on the hay , and climb the mountains , and run and row and snowball ,  - -  why , it would kill me ! And you lie here so sweet and patient , and you have n't said a cross word all the while you 've been telling me about it . I do n't understand ! How can you , can you bear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell Him , " said Peace , softly . " Whom ? " " God . " There was a long silence . Gypsy looked out of the window , winking very hard , and Peace lay quite still upon the bed . " There ! " said Gypsy , at last , with a jump . " I shall be late to school . " " Oh , " said Peace , " you have n't told me anything about yourself ; you said you would . " " Well , " said Gypsy , tying on her hat , " that 's easy enough done . I 'm silly and cross , and forgetful and blundering . " " I do n't believe it , " said Peace , laughing . " I am , " said Gypsy , confidentially ; " it 's all true ; and I 'm always tearing my dresses , and worrying father , and getting mad at Winnie , and bothering Miss Melville , and romping round , and breaking my neck ! and then , when things do n't go right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked incredulous . " It 's just so , " said Gypsy , giving a little sharp nod to emphasize her words . " And here you lie , and never think of being cross and impatient , and love everybody and everybody loves you , and -- well , all I have to say is , if I were you I should have scolded everybody out of the house long before this ! " " You must n't talk so about me , " said Peace , a faint shadow of pain crossing her face . " You do n't know how wicked I am -- nobody knows ; I am cross very often . Sometimes when my back aches as if I should scream , and aunt is talking , I hide my face under the clothes , and do n't say a word to her . " " You call that being cross ! " said Gypsy , with her eyes very wide open . She buttoned on her sack , and started to go , but stopped a minute . " I do n't suppose you 'd want me to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I should be so glad ! " said Peace , with one of those rare smiles : " I did n't dare to ask you . " " Well ; I 'll come . But I told you you would n't like me . " " I do , " said Peace . " I like you very much . " " How funny ! " said Gypsy . Then she bade her good-by , and went to school . " Mother , " she said , at night , " did you have any particular reason in sending me to Peace Maythorne ? " " Perhaps so , " said Mrs. Breynton , smiling . " Why ? " " Nothing , only I thought so . You were a very wise woman . " A while after she spoke up , suddenly . " Mother , do n't the Quakers say good matches are made in heaven ? " " Who 's been putting sentimental ideas into the child 's head ? " said her father , in an undertone . " Why , Gypsy Breynton ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had n't ought to say such things . Of course , the brimstone falls down from hell , and they pick it up and put it on the matches ! " " What made you ask the question ? " said Mrs. Breynton , when the laugh had subsided . " Oh , I was only thinking , I guessed Peace Maythorne 's name was made in heaven . It so exactly suits her . " After that , the cripple 's little quiet room became one of the places Gypsy loved best in Yorkbury . Two or three weeks after that Mrs. Littlejohn , who had been gaining rapidly in strength and good temper under Mrs. Breynton 's wise and kindly care , took it into her head one morning , when she was alone , to walk across the room , and look out of the window . The weakened limb was not in a fit state to be used at all , and the shock given to it was very great . Inflammation set in , and fever , and the doctor shook his head , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if so , they had better be sent for . But the poor creature seemed to be desolate enough ; declared she had no relatives , and was glad of it ; she only wanted to be let alone , and she should get well fast enough . She never said that when Mrs. Breynton was in the room . Gypsy went down one evening with her mother , to help her carry a bundle of fresh bed-clothing , and she was astonished at the gentleness which had crept into the old withered face and peevish voice . Mrs. Littlejohn called her up to the bed , just as she started to go . " I say , little gal , I told ye a fib the day ye fust come . I did have a dinner , though it war a terrible measly one -- Mrs . Breynton , marm ! " Mrs. Breynton stepped up to her . " What was that ye read t' other day , ' bout liars not goin'clock into the kingdom of heaven ?  - -  I ' most forgot . " Gypsy crept out , softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity to this fretful old woman so wisely , that her words , unfitly spoken , were becoming a trouble to herself , and her hours of increasing pain turned into hours of late , faint repentance . Perhaps the charm lay in a certain old book , dog-eared and worn , and dusty from long disuse on the cupboard shelf . This little book Mrs. Breynton had found , and she had read in it many times , until that painful groaning ceased . And so one night it chanced that the old yellow cat sat blinking at the light , and the yellow , furrowed face turned over on the pillow and smiled , and lay still . The light burned out , and the morning came ; the cat jumped purring upon the bed , and seeing what was there , curled up by it , with a mournful mewing cry . " Peace Maythorne says , " said Gypsy , " that if Mrs. Littlejohn went to heaven , she will be so happy to find she does n't scold ! Is n't it funny , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IX CAMPING OUT Do you remember Mr. Gough 's famous story of the orator who , with a great flourish of rhetoric as prelude , announced to his audience the startling fact that there was a " gre -- at difference in people ? " On the strength of this original statement , it has been supposed that there were a variety of tastes to be suited in selecting for the readers of " Gypsy Breynton " the most entertaining passages of this one summer in her life . The last two chapters were for the quiet young people . This one is for the lively young people -- the people who like to live out of doors , and have adventures , and get into difficulties , and get over them . The quiet people aforesaid need not read it , if they do n't want to . Did you ever " camp out " ? If you ever did , or ever very much wanted to , you will know how Gypsy felt one morning after her summer vacation had begun , and she was wondering what she should do with herself all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  " Gypsy , do n't you wish you were a boy ? I 'm going to spend a week at Ripton , with Hallam . " " Mr. Hallam ! " exclaimed Gypsy . Mr. Guy Hallam was a lawyer about thirty years old ; but Tom had the natural boy 's feeling about " mistering " any one , that he had gone on fishing excursions with , ever since he could remember ; while Gypsy was more respectful . " Ripton ! " said Gypsy , again ; " Oh , dear me ! " " And going to camp out and have a fire , and cook our trout , and shoot our rabbits , " said Tom , with an aggravating appearance of indifference , as if these were only a specimen of innumerable delights unmentioned . " Oh , dear me ! " said Gypsy , with a long sigh . " There are several disadvantages in being a girl , my dear , as you will find out , occasionally , " said Tom , with a lordly air . " Girls are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashing up . " Only they ca n't camp out . " " I 'm not so sure of that , sir . " " Indeed ! " " Girls do camp out ; I 've heard about it ; parties of ladies and gentlemen go out up on the Adirondacks . You might take Sarah Rowe and me . " Tom smiled a very superior smile . " Come , Tom , do -- there 's a good fellow ! " " Take along a couple of girls that ca n't fish , and scream when you shoot a squirrel , and are always having headaches , and spraining their ankles , and afraid to be left alone ? No , thank you ! " " I can fish , and I 'm no more afraid to be left alone than you are ! " said Gypsy , indignantly . " I 'll go and ask mother . " She ran down stairs , slamming all the doors , and rushed noisily into the parlor . " Oh , mother ! Tom 's going to camp out with Mr. Guy Hallam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , what now ? " said Mrs. Breynton , laughing , and laying down her work . " Only for a week , mother , up Ripton -- just think ! With a tent and a fire , and Mr. Hallam to take care of us . " This last remark was a stroke of policy on Gypsy 's part , for Tom had come in , and it touched a bit of boy 's pride , of which Gypsy was perfectly aware he had a good deal . " As if I could n't take as good care of you as Guy Hallam , or the next man ! " he said , in an insulted tone . " Then Tom is willing you should go , " observed Mrs. Breynton . " Why -- I do n't know , " said Tom , who had not intended to commit himself ; " I did n't say so . " " But you will say so -- now , there 's a dear , good Tom ! " said Gypsy , giving him a soft kiss on one cheek . Gypsy did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the best argument she could have used ; for , though Tom always pretended to be quite above any interest in such tender proceedings , yet this rogue of a sister looked so pink and pretty and merry , with her arms about his neck and her twinkling eyes looking into his , that there was no resisting her . Gypsy was quite conscious of this little despotism , and was enough of a diplomatist to reserve it for rare and important occasions . " We -- ell , " said Tom , slowly ; " I do n't know as I care , if Hallam doesn't -- just for once , you understand ; you 're not to ask me again as long as you live . " " There , there ! " cried Gypsy , clapping her hands , and jumping up and down . " Tom , you are a cherub -- a wingless cherub . Now , mother ! " " But supposing it rains ? " suggested Mrs. Breynton . " Oh , we 'll take our water-proofs . " " The tent will be dry enough , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good soldier , now he was fairly enlisted . " But if you catch cold and get sick , my dear ; Tom wo n't want to cut short his excursion to bring you home . " " There 's Mr. Fisher , right on top of the mountain ; he 'd bring me in his wagon . Besides , I would n't be silly enough to get sick . " " But Sarah might . " " Sarah does as I tell her , " said Gypsy , significantly . " I should take care of her . " " But Mrs. Rowe may not be willing Sarah should go , and Mr. Guy Hallam must be asked , Gypsy . " " Well , but --  --  , " persisted Gypsy ; " if Mrs. Rowe and Mr. Hallam and everybody are willing , may I go ? " " Well , " said Mrs. Breynton , after a few minutes ' thinking , " I guess so ; if Tom will take good care of you ; and if you will promise to go to Mr. Fisher 's the rainy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mother , mother Breynton ! There never was such a dear little woman in this world ! " " Why , my dear ! " said Mr. Breynton , when he heard of it ; " how can you let the child do such a thing ? She will fall off the precipice , or walk right into a bear 's den , the first thing . " " Oh , I 'll trust her , " answered her mother , smiling ; " and then , Mrs. Fisher will be so near , and so ready to take care of her if it is cold or wet ; it is n't as if she were going off into a wild place ; of course , then , I should n't let her go without some grown woman with them . " " Well , my dear , I suppose you know best . I believe I agreed to let you do as you pleased with your girl , seeing she 's the only one . " Mrs. Rowe was willing if Mrs. Breynton were willing ; Mr. Guy Hallam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tom patronizing , and Winnie envious , and so , amid a pleasant little bustle , the preparations began , and one sunny morning the party stowed themselves and their baggage comfortably away in Mr. Surly 's double-seated wagon ( much to the horror of his excellent wife , who looked out of the window , and wondered if Miss Rowe did expect that wild young un of hers to come home alive ) , and trotted briskly out of Yorkbury , along the steep , uneven road that led to the mountain . Ripton was a long ride from Yorkbury , and the wagon was somewhat crowded , owing to the presence of Mr. Surly , who was by no means a thin man , and who acted as driver . He was to return with his " team , " as the Vermont farmers invariably call their vehicles , and when the party were ready to come home Mr. Fisher was to be hired to bring them down . It would have been unsafe for any but an experienced driver to hold the reins on those mountain roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride was over . For the first few miles the way led along the beautiful valley of the Otter Creek , and then grew suddenly steep as they began to ascend the mountain . Such beautiful pictures unfolded before them , as they wound slowly up , that even Gypsy did not feel like talking , and it was a very silent party . They passed through pine forests , dense and still , where the wind was hoarse , and startled squirrels flew over the fallen trunks and boughs of ruined trees . They rode close to the edge of sheer precipices four hundred feet down , with trout-brooks , like silver threads , winding through the gorges . Great walls of rock rose above and around them , and seemed to shut them in with a frown . Sharp turns in the road brought them suddenly to the edge of abysses from which , in dark nights , they might have easily ridden off . Gay flowers perfumed the fresh , high winds , and rank mosses grew and twined , and hung thickly upon old stones and logs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far above were the tops of those tall , sentinel trees , called , by Vermonters , the Procession of Pines , the tower above their lesser comrades two by two , regular , solemn , and dark against the sky for miles of forest-track . Between these were patches and glimpses of a sky without a cloud . Gypsy had seen it all many times before ; but it was always new and grand to her ; it always made the blood leap in her veins and the stars twinkle in her eyes , and set her happy heart to dreaming a world of pleasant dreams . She was leaning back against the wagon-seat , with her face upturned , to watch the leaves flutter in the distant forest-top , when Mr. Surly reined up suddenly , and the wagon stopped with a jerk . " I declare ! " said Mr. Guy Hallam . " Waal , this is sum'at of a fix neow , " said Mr. Surly , climbing out over the wheel . " What 's the matter ? " asked Gypsy and Sarah , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , " said Tom . For , turning a sharp corner just ahead of them , was a huge wood-cart , drawn by two struggling horses . The road was just wide enough for one vehicle ; where their wagon stood , it would have been simply impossible to place two abreast . At their right , the wooded slope rose like a wall . At their left , a gorge two hundred feet deep yawned horribly , and the trout-brook gurgled over its stones . " You hold on there , " shouted the driver of the wood-cart ; " I 'll turn in here anigh the mountain . You ken git by t' other side , ca n't you ? " " Reckon so , " said Mr. Surly , measuring the distance with his eye . He climbed in again , and took the reins , and the driver of the wood-cart wheeled up into a semi-circular widening of the road where a sand-heap had been dug away . The space left was just wide enough for a carriage to pass closely without grazing the wheels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only fence on the edge of the ravine . " Oh , we shall certainly tip over and be killed ! Oh dear , let me get out ! " cried Sarah , as the wagon passed slowly forward . " Hush up ! " said Gypsy , quickly . " Tom wo n't let us go , if you act so . Do n't you suppose four grown men know better than we do whether it 's safe ? I 'm not afraid a bit . " Nevertheless , Gypsy and Tom , and even Mr. Hallam , looked narrowly at the old frail log , and down into the gorge where the water was gurgling . Once the wheels grazed the log , and it tilted slightly . Sarah screamed aloud . Mr. Surly knew what he was about , however , and knew how to do it . He passed on safely into the wider road , and the wood-cart rattled composedly on . " There a'r 'd a ben a purty close shave in the night , " he remarked , coolly , pointing with his whip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down here five years ago ,  - -  jist off that maple-tree there ,  - -  horse , wagin , and all , an'clock two men , brothers they was , too ; one man hung onto a branch or suthin'clock , and was ketched and saved ; t' other one got crushed to jelly . It was a terrible dark night . " Even Gypsy gave a little shiver during this entertaining conversation , and was glad they had come up in the daytime . Mr. Surly drove to a certain by-road in the woods , where he left them , and returned home ; and the party proceeded on foot , with their baggage , to the place Mr. Hallam had chosen as a camp-ground . It was a pleasant spot , far enough in the woods to be still and wild , near enough to the little settlement on top of the mountain to be free from bears , as Sarah had required to be informed ten separate times , on the way . There was a little , natural clearing among the trees , which Mr. Hallam and Tom made larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought hatchets with them , as well as guns , knives , and fish-hooks . It seemed very warlike and real , Gypsy thought -- quite as if they intended to spend the rest of their lives there . She almost wished a party of Indians would come and attack them , or a bear or a wolf . Having selected a smooth , level spot for the tents , Mr. Hallam thought they had better put them up immediately . It chanced that he and Tom each owned one , which was a much better arrangement than the dividing of one into two apartments . The two were placed side by side , and the girls ' tent was distinguished and honored by a bit of a flag on top , and an extra fold of rubber-cloth in front , to keep out the rain . There was also a ditch dug around it , to drain off the water in case of a severe storm . " Besides , if it rains very hard , they can be sent to Mr. Fisher 's , " said Tom . " Catch me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all the fun to sleep out in the rain . " While Mr. Hallam and Tom were setting up the tents -- and it took a long time -- the two girls busied themselves unpacking the baggage . They were really astonished to find how much they had brought , when it was all taken out of the baskets and boxes and bags , and each article provided with a place within or without the tents . To begin with , the little girls had each a bag of such things as were likely to be necessary for their mountain toilet , consisting principally of dry stockings ; for , as Gypsy said , they expected to wet their feet three or four times a day , and she should enjoy it for once . Then they had brought their long waterproof cloaks , in which they considered themselves safe from a deluge . There were plenty of fish-lines , and tin pans and kettles , and knives and steel forks , and matches , and scissors and twine and needles , and the endless variety of accoutrements necessary to a state of highly-civilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  - -  Mrs . Breynton would not consent to letting her silver ones go ,  - -  and Gypsy thought the others were better , because it seemed more like " being wild . " Indeed , she would have dispensed with spoons altogether , but Sarah gave a little scream at the idea , and thought she could n't possibly eat a meal without . Then the provision basket was full of bread and butter and cake and pies , and summer apples and salt and pepper , and Indian meal and coffee , and eggs and raw meat , and fresh vegetables . They expected , however , to live chiefly on the trout which Mr. Hallam and Tom were to catch , and Mrs. Fisher would supply them with fresh milk from her dairy . The girls made their toilet arrangements in one corner of their tent . A rough box served as a dressing-table , and Sarah had brought a bit of a looking-glass , which she put on top of it . They collected piles of sweet , dry leaves for a bed , and a certain thoughtful mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blanket ; so they were nicely fitted out . Gypsy had a secret apprehension that they were preparing for a very luxurious sort of camp-life . After a little consultation , they decided to make two rooms out of their tent , as they were sadly in need of a kitchen . Accordingly they took their heavy blanket shawls , tied them together by the fringe , and hung them up as a curtain across the middle of the tent . The front apartment served nicely as a kitchen , and the provisions and crockery were moved in there , in spite of Tom 's ungallant remark that he and Mr. Hallam should never see any of the pies he knew . By way of recompense , he took the guns , and all dangerous implements , under his own care . The afternoon was nearly spent , when their preparations were at last completed , and they were ready to begin house-keeping . " Let 's have supper , " said Gypsy . Gypsy was always ready to have supper , whenever dinner-time was passed . " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is rather late to fish , " said Mr. Hallam . " The little girls are tired and hungry , indeed we all are , for that matter ,  - -  and I guess we will have supper . " Gypsy installed herself as housekeeper-in-general , and she and Sarah lost no time in unpacking the cake and bread and butter . Tom collected some light , dry brushwood for a fire , and he and Mr. Hallam made the coffee . It seemed as if no supper had ever tasted as that supper did . The free mountain air was so fresh and strong , and the breath of the pines so sweet . It was so pleasant to sit on the moss around a fire , and eat with your fingers if you chose , without shocking anybody . Then the woods looked so wide and lonely and still , and it was so strange to watch the great red sunset dying like a fire through the thick green net-work , where the pine-boughs and the maple interlaced . For about five minutes after supper was cleared away , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah discoursed in a vague , scientific way , about the habits of bears , and Gypsy had a dim notion that she should n't so very much object to see her mother come walking up the mountain , seized with an uncontrollable desire to spend a night in a tent . But Tom was so pleasant and merry , and Mr. Hallam told such funny stories , that they were laughing before they knew it , and the evening passed happily away . Gypsy could not sleep for some time that night , for delight at spending a night out doors in a real tent on a real mountain , that was known to have an occasional real bear on it . She did not feel afraid in the least , although Sarah had a very uncomfortable way of asking her , every ten minutes , if she were perfectly sure it was safe . " Oh , do n't ! " said Gypsy , at last . " I am having such a good time thinking that I 'm really here . You go to sleep . " Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that she turned over and went to sleep without another word . It was not a good thing for Gypsy to be so much with just such a girl as Sarah . She was physically the weaker of the two , as well as the more timid , and she had fallen into a habit of obeying , and Gypsy of commanding , by a sort of mutual tacit agreement . It was partly for this reason , as was natural enough , that Gypsy chose her so often for a companion , but principally because Sarah never refused any romp or adventure ; other timid girls liked to have their own way and choose their own quiet plays . Sarah 's timidity yielded to Gypsy 's stronger will . If Gypsy took a fancy to climb a ruined windmill , Sarah would scream all the way , but follow . If Gypsy wanted to run at full speed down a dangerous steep hill , where there were walls to be leaped , and loose , rolling stones to be dodged , Sarah scolded a little , but went . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this sort of companionship . Her frank , impulsive generosity saved her from becoming tyrannical or dictatorial . The worst of it was , that she was forced to form such a habit of always taking the lead . She lay awake some time that night after Sarah had fallen asleep , listening to the strange whispers of the wind in the trees , and making plans for to-morrow , until at last her happy thoughts faded into happy dreams . She did not know how long she had been asleep , when something suddenly woke her . She was a little startled at first by the unfamiliar sight of the tent-roof , and narrow , walled space which shut her in . The wind was sighing drearily through the forest , the distant scream of an owl had an ugly sound ; and -- why no -- but yes !  - -  another sound , more ugly than the cry of a night-bird , was distinct at the door of the tent -- the sound of a quick , panting breath ! Gypsy sat upright in bed , and listened . It grew louder , and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing of a hungry animal . Sarah slept like a baby ; there was not a movement from Tom and Mr. Hallam in the other tent ; everything was still but that terrible sound . Gypsy had good nerves and was not easily frightened , but it must be confessed she thought of those traditionary bears which had been seen at Ripton . She had but a moment in which to decide what to do , for the creature was now sniffing at the tent-door , and once she was sure she saw a dark paw lift the sail-cloth . She might wake Sarah , but what was the use ? She would only scream , and that would do no good , and might do much harm . If it were a bear , and they kept still , he might go away and leave them . Yet , if it were a bear , Tom must know it in some way . All these thoughts passed through Gypsy 's mind in that one instant , while she sat listening to the panting of the brute without . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her hand trembled a little as she touched the canvas gently -- so gently that it scarcely stirred . She held her breath , she put her eye to the partition , she looked out and saw --  --  Mr. Fisher 's little black dog ! Tom was awakened by a long , merry laugh that rang out like a bell on the still night air , and echoed through the forest . He thought Gypsy must be having another fit of somnambulism , and Sarah jumped up , with a scream , and asked if it was n't an Indian . The night passed without further adventure , and the morning sun woke the girls by peering in at a hole in the tent-roof , and making a little round golden fleck , that danced across their eyelids until they opened . They were scarcely dressed , when Tom 's voice , with a spice of mischief in it , called Gypsy from outside . The girls hurried out , and there he sat with Mr. Hallam , before a crackling fire over which some large fresh trout were frying in Indian meal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too ? " said Gypsy . " We took the time while you were asleep , on purpose , " said Tom , in his provoking fashion . " Nobody can do any fishing while girls are round . " " Tom does n't deserve any for that speech , " said Mr. Hallam , smiling ; " and I shall have to tell of him . It happens that I caught the fish while a certain young gentleman was dreaming . " " O -- oh , Tom ! Well ; but , Mr. Hallam , ca n't we go fishing to-day ? " " To be sure , you can . " " How long do you suppose you 'll stand it ? girls always give out in half an hour . " " I 'll stand it as long as you will , sir ! " Tom whistled . The trout were done to that indescribable luscious point of brown crispness , and the breakfast was , if possible , better than the supper . After breakfast , they started on a fishing excursion down the gorge . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no winds from the valley were ever so sweet and pure as those winds , and no lowland sunshine so golden . The brook foamed and bubbled down its steep , rocky bed , splashed up jets of rainbow spray into the air , and plunged in miniature cascades over tiny gullies ; the wet stones flashed in the light upon the banks , and tall daisies , peering over , painted shifting white outlines of themselves in the swelling current and the shallow pools ; here and there , too , where the water was deep , the fish darted to the surface , and darted out of sight . " Is n't it beau -- tiful ! " cried Sarah . " Pretty enough , " said Gypsy , affecting carelessness , and trying to unwind her line in as au fait and boyish a manner as possible . " You girls keep this pool . Mr. Hallam and I are going a little ways up stream , " said Tom . " Now do n't speak a word , and be sure you do n't scream if you catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all away . " " As if I did n't know that ! Here , Sarah , hold your rod lower , " said Gypsy , assuming a professional air . Mr. Hallam and Tom walked away , and the girls fished for just half an hour in silence . That is to say , they sat on the bank , and held a rod . Sarah had had one faint nibble , but that was all that had happened , and the sun began to be very warm . " I 'm going out on those stones , " said Gypsy . " I believe I see a fish out there . " So she stepped out carefully on the loose stones , which tilted ominously under her weight . " Oh , you 'll fall ! " said Sarah . " Hush -- sh ! I see one . " Up went the rod in the air with a jerk , over went the stone , and down went Gypsy . She disappeared from sight a moment in the shallow water ; then splashed up with a gasp , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Sarah . Tom came up , undecided whether to laugh or scold . " Well , Gypsy Breynton , you 've done it now ! Now I suppose you must go directly home , and you 'll catch cold before you can get there . This is a pretty fix ! " " N -- no , " gasped Gypsy , rubbing the water out of her eyes ; " I have dry clothes up in the tent . Mother said I should want them . I guess I 'll go right up . I'm -- rather -- wet , I believe . " Tom looked at his watch , as Gypsy toiled dripping up the bank . The temptation was too great to be resisted , and he called out ,  --  " Precisely half an hour ! Gypsy , my dear , I 'd stay all long , as the boys do , by all means ! " It was a very good thing about Gypsy , that she was quite able to relish a joke at her own expense . She laughed as merrily as Tom did , and the morning 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained from a string of perfectly respectable fishes , properly and scientifically caught , with dry feet and a warm seat on the bank under a glaring sun . Mr. Hallam and Tom brought up plenty for dinner ; so no one went hungry . That afternoon , it chanced that the girls were left alone for about one hour . Mr. Hallam had taken Tom some distance up the stream for a comfortable little fish by themselves , and left the girls to prepare supper , with strict injunctions not to go out of sight of the tents . They were very well content with the arrangement for a while , but at last Gypsy became tired of having nothing but the trees to look at , and suggested a visit to the brook . She had seen some checker-berry leaves growing in the gorge , and was seized with a fancy to have them for supper . Sarah , as usual , made no objections , and they went . " It 's only just out of sight of the tent , " said Gypsy , as they ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be gone but a minute . " But they were gone many minutes . They had little idea how long the time had been , and were surprised to find it growing rapidly dark in the forest when they came panting back to the tent , out of breath with the haste they had made . " They must be back by this time , " said Gypsy ; " Tom ! " There was no answer . " Tom ! Thom-as ! Mr. Hallam ! " A bird chirped in a maple-bough overhead , and a spark cracked out of the smouldering hickory fire ; there was no other sound . " I guess they 're busy in their tent , " said Gypsy , going up to it . But the tent was empty . " They have n't come ! " exclaimed Sarah . " It 's real mean in them to leave us here , " said Gypsy , looking round among the trees . " You know , " suggested Sarah , timidly , " you know Mr. Hallam said we were to stay at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and could n't find us , and have gone to hunt us up . " " Oh ! " said Gypsy , quickly , " I forgot . " She turned away her face a moment , so that Sarah could not see it ; then she turned back , and said , slowly ,  --  " Sarah , I 'm very sorry I took you off . This is rather a bad fix . We must make the best of it now . " " Let 's call again , " said Sarah , faintly . They called again , and many times ; but there was no reply . Everything was still but the bird , and the sparks that crackled now and then from the fire . The heavy gray shadows grew purple and grew black . The little foot-paths in the woods were blotted out of sight , and the far sky above the tree-tops grew dusky and dim . " We might go to Mr. Fisher 's ,  - -  do , Gypsy ! I ca n't bear to stay here , " said Sarah , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We ca n't go to Mr. Fisher 's , because that would mislead them all the more . We must stay here now till they come . " " I 'm afraid ! " said Sarah , clinging to her arm ; " it is so dark . Perhaps we 'll have to stay here alone all night ,  - -  oh , Gypsy ! " " Nonsense ! " said Gypsy , looking as bold as possible ; " it would n't be so dreadful if we did . Besides , of course , we sha' n't ; they 'll be back here before long . You go in the tent , if you feel any safer there , and I 'll make up a bright fire . If they see it , they 'll know we 've come . " Sarah went into the tent , and covered her head up in the bed-clothes ; but in about ten minutes she came back , feeling a little ashamed of her timidity , and sat down by Gypsy before the fire . It was a strange picture -- the ghostly white tents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest stretching away darkly beyond ; the fitful shadows and glares from the flickering fire that chased each other in strange , uncouth shapes , among the leaves , and the two children sitting there alone with frightened , watching eyes . " I 'm not a bit afraid , " said Gypsy , after a silence , in a tone as if she were rather arguing with herself than with Sarah . " I think it 's rather nice . Tom left his gun all loaded , and we can defend ourselves against anything . I 'm going to get it , and we 'll play we 're Union refugees hiding in the South . " So she went into Tom 's tent , and brought out his gun . " Look out ! " said Sarah , shrinking , " it may go off . " " Go off ? Of course it ca n't , unless I pull the trigger . I know how to manage a gun ,  - -  hark ! what 's that ? " " Oh dear , oh dear ! " said Sarah , beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Hush ! Let 's listen . " They listened . A curious , irregular tramping round broke the stillness . Gypsy stood up quickly , and put the gun into position upon her shoulder . " It is n't Tom and Mr. Hallam ,  - -  then there would be two . This is only one , and it does n't sound like a man , I declare . " " Oh , it 's a bear , it 's a bear ! We shall be eaten up alive ,  - -  oh , Gypsy , Gypsy ! " " Keep still ! I can shoot him if it is ; but I know it is n't ; just wait and see . " The curious sound came nearer ; tramped through the underbrush ; crushed the dead twigs . Gypsy 's finger was on the trigger ; her face a little pale . She thought the idea of the bear all nonsense ; she did not know what she feared ; the very mystery of the thing had thoroughly frightened her . " Keep still , Sarah ; you hit me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , it 's coming , it 's coming ! " cried Sarah , starting back with a scream . She clung , in her terror , to Gypsy 's arm ; jerked it ; the trigger snapped , and a loud explosion echoed and re-echoed and reverberated among the trees . It was followed by a sound the most horrible Gypsy had heard in all her life . It was a human cry . It was Tom 's voice . CHAPTER X THE END OF THE WEEK Gypsy threw down the gun , and threw up her hands with a curious quick motion , like one in suffocation , who was trying to find a voice ; but she did not utter a sound . There was an instant 's awful stillness . In that instant , it seemed to Gypsy as if she had lived a great many years ; in that instant , even Sarah 's frightened cries were frozen . Then the bushes parted , and some one sprang through . Gypsy knew the face all blackened and marred with powder -- the face dearer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So she had not killed him -- thank God , thank God ! " Gypsy , child ! " called the dear , familiar voice ; " what ails you ? You have n't hurt me , but why in the name of all danger on this earth did you touch --  --  " But Tom stopped short ; for Gypsy tottered up to him with such a white , weak look on her face , that he thought the rebound of the gun must have injured her , and caught her in his arms . " You 're not going to faint ! Where are you hurt ? " But Gypsy was not hurt , and Gypsy never fainted . She just put her arms about his neck and hid her face close upon his shoulder , and cried as if her heart would break . It was a long time before she spoke ,  - -  only kissing him and clinging to him through her sobs ,  - -  then , at last ,  --  " Oh , Tom , I thought I had killed you -- I thought -- and I loved you so -- oh , Tom ! " Tom choked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding her in his lap . " Why , my little Gypsy ! " Just then footsteps came crashing through the underbrush , and Mr. Hallam ran hurriedly up . " Oh , you 've found them ! Where were they ? What has happened to Gypsy ? " " Let me go , " sobbed Gypsy ; " I ca n't talk just now . I want to go away and cry . " She broke away from Tom 's arms , and into the tent , where she could be alone . " What has happened ? " repeated Mr. Hallam . " We came home in less than an hour , and could n't find you . We have been to Mr. Fisher 's , and hunted everywhere . I was calling for you in the gorge when Tom found you . " Sarah was left to tell their story ; which she did with remarkable justness , considering how frightened she was . She shared with Gypsy the blame of having left the tents , and insisted that it was her fault that the gun went off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom from the tent-door , and he went to her . She was quiet , and very pale , " Oh , Tom , I am so sorry ! I did n't think I should be gone so long . " " It was very dangerous , Gypsy . You might have been lost , or you might have had to spend the night here alone , while we were hunting for you . " " I know it , I know it ; and Sarah was so frightened , and I was too , a little , and Sarah thought you were a bear . " " I have told you a great many times that it is never safe for you to touch my gun , " said Tom , gravely . He felt that Gypsy 's carelessness might have brought about too terrible consequences , both to herself and to him , to be passed by lightly ; and he had an idea that , as long as her mother was not there to tell her so , he must . But Gypsy dropped her head , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart to say any more . Gypsy was sure all the pleasure of her camping-out was utterly spoiled ; but there was a bright sun the next morning , and Tom was so kind and pleasant , and the birds were singing , and the world did n't look at all as if she had nearly killed her brother twelve hours before , so she found she was laughing in spite of herself , and two very happy days passed after that . Mr. Hallam made a rule that he or Tom should keep the girls constantly in sight , and that , during the time spent in excursions which they could not join , they should remain in Mr. Fisher 's house . He said it was too wild a place for them to be alone in for any length of time , and he was sorry he left them before . Gypsy did not resent this strict tutelage . She was very humble and obedient and careful as long as they stayed upon the mountain . Those few moments , when she clung sobbing to Tom 's neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget them as long as she lives . At the end of the fourth day , just at supper time , a dark cloud sailed over the sky , and a faint wind blew from the east . " I wonder if it 's going to rain , " said Mr. Hallam . They all looked up . Gypsy said nothing ; in her secret heart , she hoped it would . " What about sending the girls to Mrs. Fisher 's ? " asked Tom , when they were washing the dishes . " Oh , no , no , it wo n't rain , I know -- let us stay , Mr. Hallam , please . Why , I should feel like a deserter if I went off ! " pleaded Gypsy . The dark cloud seemed to have passed away , and the wind was still . After thinking a while , Mr. Hallam decided to let them stay . In the middle of the night , Gypsy was awakened by a great noise . The wind was blowing a miniature hurricane through the trees , and the rain was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canvas roof , and drop from the poles , and gurgle in a stream through the ditch . She could hear , too , the loud , angry murmur of the trout brook and the splashing of hundreds of rivulets that dashed down the slope and over the gorge into it . She gave Sarah a little pinch , and woke her up . " Oh , Sarah , it 's come ! It 's raining like everything , and here we are , and we ca n't get to Mr. Fisher's -- is n't it splendid ? " " Ye-es , " said Sarah ; " it 's very splendid , only is n't it a little -- wet ? It 's dropping right on my cheek . " " Oh , that 's nothing -- why , here I can put my hand right down into a puddle of water . It 's just like being at sea . " " I know it . Are people at sea always so -- cold ? " " Why , I 'm not cold . Only we might as well wear our water-proofs . The leaves are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloaks , and Gypsy listened to the wind , and thought it was very poetic and romantic , and that she was perfectly happy . And just as she had lain down again there came a great gust of rain , and one of the rivulets that were sweeping down the mountain splashed in under the canvas , and ran right through the middle of the tent like a brook . Sarah jumped up with energy . " O -- oh , it 's gone right over my feet ! " " My shoes are sailing away , as true as you live ! " cried Gypsy , and sprang just in time to save them . The dinner-basket and a tin pail were fast following , when Tom appeared upon the scene , and called through the wall of shawls ,  --  " Girls , you 'll have to go to Mrs. Fisher 's . Be quick as you can ! " " I do n't want to a bit , " said Gypsy , who was sitting in a pool of water . " Well , I 'm going , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very nice , but drowning is another thing . " " Well -- I -- suppose it would be a -- little -- dryer , " said Gypsy , slowly . The girls were soon dressed , and Tom lighted a lantern and went with them . A few peals of thunder growled sullenly down the valley , and one bright flash of lightning glared far through the forest . Sarah was afraid she should be struck . Gypsy was thinking how grand it was , and wished she could be out in a midnight storm every week . It was after midnight , and every one at Mr. Fisher 's was asleep ; but Tom knocked them up , and Mr. Fisher was very much amused , and Mrs. Fisher was very kind and hospitable , and built up a fire , and said they should be perfectly dry and warm before they went to bed . So the girls bade Tom good-night , and he went back to Mr. Hallam , and they , feeling very cold and sleepy and drenched , were glad enough to be taken care of , and put to bed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sarah , " said Gypsy , sleepily , just as Sarah was beginning to dream . " A feather-bed , and -- and pillows ! ( with a little jump to keep awake long enough to finish her sentence ) are a little better -- on the whole -- than a mud -- pud --  --  " Just there she went to sleep . The next day it poured from morning till night . That was just what Mr. Hallam and Tom liked , so they fished all day , and the girls amused themselves as best they might in Mr. Fisher 's barn . The day after it rained in snatches , and the sun shone in little spasms between . A council of exigencies met in Mr. Hallam 's tent , and it was unanimously decided to go home . Even Gypsy began to long for civilized life , though she declared that she had never in all her life had such a good time as she had had that week . So Mr. Fisher harnessed and drove them briskly down the mountain , and " from afar off " Gypsy saw her mother 's face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to see her back . CHAPTER XI GYPSY 'S OPINION OF BOSTON Just at the end of the vacation , it was suddenly announced that Miss Melville was not going to teach any more . " How funny ! " said Gypsy . " Last term she expected to , just as much as anything . I do n't see what 's the reason . Now I shall have to go to the high school . " It chanced that they were remodelling some of the rooms at the high school , and the winter term , which would otherwise have commenced in September , was delayed till the first of October . Gypsy had jumped on all the hay-cocks , and picked all the huckleberries , and eaten all the early Davises , and gone on all the picnics that she could , and was just ready to settle down contentedly to school and study ; so the news from Miss Melville was not , on the whole , very agreeable . What to do with herself , for another long month of vacation , was more than she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the clovers and swung on the gate , in a vague , indefinite sort of way , for two weeks ; then one morning Mrs. Breynton read her a letter which set her eyes on fire with delight . It was an invitation from her aunt to spend a fortnight in Boston . It so happened that Gypsy had never been to Boston . It was a long day 's journey from Yorkbury , and Mr. Breynton was not much in favor of expensive travelling for the children while they were very young ; arguing that the enjoyment and usefulness would be doubled to them when they were older . Besides , Gypsy 's uncle , though he was her father 's brother , had seldom visited Yorkbury . His business kept him closely at home , and his wife and daughter always went to the seaside in summer ; so the two families had seen very little of each other for years . Mrs. Breynton , however , thought it best Gypsy should make this visit ; and Gypsy , who had lived twelve years in a State which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as she would have considered going to Paradise . It took a few days of delightful hurry and bustle to get ready . There was much washing and mending and altering , sewing on of trimmings and letting down of tucks , to be done for her ; for Mrs. Breynton desired to spare her the discomfort of feeling " countrified , " and Yorkbury style was not distinctively a la Paris . She told Gypsy , frankly , that she must expect to find her cousin Joy better dressed than herself ; but that her wardrobe should be neat and tasteful , and in as much accordance with the prevailing mode as was practicable ; so she hoped she would have too much self-respect to be troubled by the difference . " I hope I have , " said Gypsy , with an emphasis . The days passed so quickly that it seemed like a dream when she had at last bidden them all good-by , kissed her mother just ten times , and was fairly seated alone in the cars , holding on very tightly to her ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although she was so little used to travelling , having never been farther than to Burlington or Vergennes in her life , yet she was not in the least afraid to take the journey alone . Her mother felt sure she could take care of herself , and her father had given her so many directions , and written such careful memoranda for her , of changes of cars , refreshment stations , what to do with her check , and how to look after her baggage , that she felt sure she could not make a mistake . Being a bright , observing child , fearless as a boy , and not in the least inclined to worry , she had no trouble at all . The conductor was very kind ; an old gentleman , who was pleased with her twinkling eyes and red cheeks , gave her an orange , and helped look after her baggage ; two old ladies gave her fennel and peppermints ; and before she reached Boston she was on terms of intimacy with six babies , a lapdog , and a canary-bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she was almost sorry when they reached the city , and the train rolled slowly into the dark depot . The passengers were crowding rapidly out , the lamps were lighted in the car , and she felt a little lonely sitting still there , and waiting for her uncle . She had not waited but a moment , however , when a pleasant , whiskered face appeared at the car-door , and one of those genial , " off-hand " voices , that sound at once so kindly and so careless , called out ,  --  " O -- ho ! So here 's the girl ! Glad to see you , child . This way ; the hack 's all ready . " She was hurried into a carriage , her trunk was tossed on behind , and then the door was shut , and they were driven rapidly away through a maze of crooked streets , glare of gaslights , and brilliant shop-windows , that bewildered Gypsy . She had a notion that was the way fairy-land must look . Her uncle laughed , good-naturedly , at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Yorkbury , I suppose ! How 's your father ? Why did n't he come with you ? Is your mother well ? And that boy -- Linnie -- Silly -- what do call him ? " " Winnie , sir ; and then there 's Tom . " " Winnie -- oh , yes ! Tom well , too ? " Before the ride was over , Gypsy had come to the conclusion that she liked her uncle very much , only he had such a funny way of asking questions , and then forgetting all about them . The driver reined up at a house on Beacon Street , and Gypsy was led up a long flight of steps through a bright hall , and into a room that dazzled her . A bright coal-fire was glowing in the grate , for it was a chilly evening , and bright jets of gas were burning in chandeliers . Bright carpets , and curtains , furniture , pictures , and ornaments covered the length of two parlors separated only by folding-doors , and mirrors , that reached from the floor to the ceiling , reflected her figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magnificence , in her Yorkbury hat and homemade casaque . " Sit down , sit down , " said her uncle ; " I 'll call your aunt . I do n't see where they are ; I told them to be on hand ,  - -  Kate , where 's Mrs. Breynton ? " " She 's up-stairs , sir , dressing , " said the servant , who had opened the door . " Tell her Miss Gypsy has come ; sit down , child , and make yourself at home . " Gypsy sat down , and Mr. Breynton , not satisfied with sending a message to his wife , went to the foot of the stairs , and called ,  --  " Miranda !  - -  Joy ! " A voice from somewhere above answered , a little sharply , that she was coming as fast as she could , and she told Joyce to go down long ago , but she had n't stirred . Gypsy heard every word , and she began to wonder if her aunt were very glad to see her , and what sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't obey her mother unless she chose to . Just then Joy came down stairs , walking very slowly and properly , and came into the parlor with the manners of a young lady of eighteen . She might have been a pretty child , if she had been dressed more plainly and becomingly ; but her face was pale and thin , and there was a fretful look about her mouth , that almost spoiled it . Gypsy went up warmly , and kissed her . Joy had extended the tips of her fingers to shake hands , and she looked a little surprised , but kissed her politely , and asked if she were tired with the journey . Just then Mrs. Breynton came in , with many apologies for her delay , met Gypsy kindly enough , and sent her up-stairs to take off her things . " Who trimmed your hat ? " asked Joy , suddenly . " Miss Jones . She 's our milliner . " " Oh , " said Joy , " mine is a pheasant . Nobody thinks of wearing velvet now -- most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to wear just what everybody else did , " Gypsy could not help saying . She hung the turban up in the closet , with a little uncomfortable feeling . It was a fine drab straw , trimmed and bound with velvet a shade darker . It was pretty , and she knew it ; it just matched her casaque , and her mother had thought it all the more lady-like for its simplicity . Nevertheless , it was not going to be very pleasant to have her cousin Joy ashamed of her . " Oh , oh , how short they wear dresses in Yorkbury ! " remarked Joy , as Gypsy walked across the room . " Mine are nearly to the tops of my boots , now I 'm thirteen years old . " " Are they ?  - -  where did I put my bag ? " said Gypsy , carelessly . Joy looked a little piqued that she did not seem more impressed . " There 's dinner , " she said , after a silence , in which she had been secretly inspecting and commenting upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's go down . Mother scolds if we 're late . " " Scolds ! " said Gypsy . " How funny ! my mother never scolds . " " Does n't she ? " asked Joy , a little wonder in her eyes . " It seems so queer to have dinner at six o'clock , " said Gypsy , confidentially , as they went down stairs . " At home they are just sitting down to supper . " Joy laughed patronizingly . " Oh , yes ; I suppose you 're used to country hours . " For the second time , Gypsy felt uncomfortable . She would very much have liked to ask her cousin what there was to be ashamed of in being used to country hours , when you lived in the country . But they had reached the dining-room door , and her aunt was calling out somewhat fretfully to Joy to hurry , so she said nothing . After supper , her uncle said she looked very much like her father , hoped she would make herself at home , thought her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to view , for the evening , behind his newspaper . Her aunt inquired if she could play on the piano , was surprised to find she knew nothing more classical than chants and Scotch airs ; told Joy to let her hear that last air of Von Weber 's ; and then she took up a novel which was lying partially read upon the table . When Joy was through playing , she proposed a game of solitaire . Gypsy would much rather have examined the beautiful and costly ornaments with which the rooms were filled , but she was a little too polite and a little too proud to do so , unasked . " What do you play most ? " she asked , as they began to move the figures on the solitaire board . " Oh , " said Joy , " I practise three hours , and that takes all the time when I 'm in school . In vacations , I do n't know ,  - -  I like to walk in Commonwealth Avenue pretty well ; then mother has a good deal of company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk , and sit still in the parlor ! " exclaimed Gypsy ; " dear me ! " " Why , what do you do ? " " Me ? Oh , I jump on the hay and run down hills and poke about in the swamp . " " What ? " " Push myself round on a raft in the orchard-swamp ; it 's real fun . " " Why , I never heard of such a thing ! " said Joy , looking shocked . " Well , it 's splendid ; you ought to come up to Yorkbury , and go out with me . Tom would make you a raft . " " What do the people say ? " said Joy , looking at her mother . " Oh , there are n't any people there to see . If there were , they would n't say anything . I have just the nicest times . Winnie and I tipped over last spring ,  - -  clear over , splash ! " " You will ruin your complexion , " remarked her aunt , laying down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veil . " " A veil ? Dear me , no ! I ca n't bear the feeling of a veil . I wore one in the cars through , to keep the cinders off . Then , besides that , I row and coast , and ,  - -  oh , I forgot , walking on the fences ; it 's real fun if you do n't tumble off . " " Walking on the fences ! " " Oh , yes . I always go in the fields where there 's nobody round . Then I like to climb the old walls , where you have to jump when the stones roll off from under you . " Mrs. Breynton elevated her eyebrows with a peculiar expression , and returned to her novel . Gypsy was one of those happy people who are gifted with the faculty of always having a pleasant time , and the solitaire game was good enough , if it had n't been so quiet ; but when she went up to bed , she looked somewhat sober . She bade Joy good-night , shut herself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the floor , and winked hard several times . She would not have objected at that moment to seeing her mother , or Tom , or pulling her father 's whiskers , or squeezing Winnie a little , or looking into the dear , familiar sitting-room where they were all gathered just then to have prayers . She began to have a vague idea that there was no place like home . She also came to the conclusion , very faintly , and feeling like a traitor all the time , that her Aunt Miranda was very fashionable and very fretful , and did not treat Joy at all as her mother treated her ; that Joy thought her countrified , and had never walked on a fence in all her life ; that her uncle was very good , but very busy , and that a fortnight was a rather long time to stay there . However , her uncle 's house was not the whole of Boston . All the delights of the great , wonderful city remained unexplored , and who could tell what undreamed-of joys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back after their usual punctual fashion , and she fell asleep as soon as her head touched the pillow , to dream that she was sitting in Tom 's lap , reading an Arabic novel aloud to Winnie . It might have been about half an hour after , that she woke suddenly with a terrible feeling in her lungs and throat , and sat up in bed gasping , to see the door burst open , and her aunt come rushing in . " Is the house on fire ? " asked Gypsy , sleepily . " House on fire ! It might have been . It 's a wonder you 're alive ! " " Alive , " repeated Gypsy , bewildered . " Why , child , you blew out the gas ! " said her aunt , sharply , throwing open the windows . " Did n't you know any better than that ? " " I 'm so used to blowing out our lamps , " said Gypsy , feeling very much frightened and ashamed . " Country ways ! " exclaimed her aunt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  - -  go to sleep , like a good girl . " Gypsy did not relish being told to go to sleep like a good girl , when she had done nothing wrong ; nor did her aunt 's one chilly kiss , at leaving her , serve to make her forget those few sharp words . The next morning , after breakfast , Joy proposed to go out to walk , and Gypsy ran up to put on her things in great glee . One little circumstance dashed damply on it , like water on glowing coals . " How large your casaque is about the neck , " said Joy , carelessly . " I like mine small and high , with a binding . " Gypsy remembered what her mother said : and , because her casaque happened to be cut after Miss Jones 's patterns instead of Madame Demorest 's , she did not feel that her character was seriously affected ; but it was not pleasant to have such things said . Her cousin did not mean to be unkind . On the contrary , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little thoughtless and a little vain . Joy is not the only girl in Boston , I am afraid , who has hurt the feelings of her country visitors in that careless way . " You 've never seen the Common , I suppose , nor the Public Gardens ? " said Joy , as they started off . " We 'll walk across to Boylston Street , dear me ! you have n't any gloves on ! " " Oh , must I put them on ? " said Gypsy , with a sigh ; " I 'm afraid I sha' n't like Boston if I have to wear gloves week-days . I ca n't bear the feeling of them . " " I suppose that 's what makes your hands so red and brown , " replied Joy , astonished , casting a glance at her own sickly , white fingers , which she was pinching into a pair of very tight kid gloves . " Here are the Gardens , " she said , proudly , as they entered the inclosure . " Are n't they beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Yorkbury . We 'll go up to the Common in a minute . " Gypsy looked carelessly around , and did not seem to be very much impressed or interested . " I 'd rather go over into that street where the people and the carriages are , " she said . " Why ! " exclaimed Joy ; " do n't you like it ? See the fountains , and the deer and the grass , and all . " " I like the deer , " said Gypsy ; " only I feel so sorry for them . " " Sorry for them ! " " Why , they look so as if they wanted to be off in the woods with nobody round . I like the rabbits better , jumping round at home under the pine-trees . Then I think the trout-brook , at Ripton , is a great deal prettier than these fountains . But then I guess I should like the stores , " she said , apologetically , a little afraid she had hurt or provoked Joy . " I never saw anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they came to Tremont , and then to Washington Street , Gypsy was in an ecstasy . She kept calling to Joy to see that poor little beggar girl , or that funny old woman , or that negro boy who was trying to stand on his head , or the handsome feather on that lady 's bonnet , and stopped every other minute to see some beautiful toy or picture in a shop-window , till Joy lost all patience . " Gypsy Breynton ! do n't keep staring in the windows so ; people will think we are a couple of servant girls just from down East , who never saw Washington Street before ! " " I never did , " said Gypsy , coolly . But she looked a little sober . What was the use of Boston , and all its beautiful sights and busy sounds , if you must walk right along as if you were going to church , and not seem to see nor hear any of the wonders , for fear of being called countrified ? Gypsy began to hate the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gardens , " said Mr. Breynton to Joy , at dinner . " Oh , I 'm tired to death of the Aquarial Gardens , " answered Joy ; " none of the girls I go with ever go now , and I 've seen it all so many times . " " But Gypsy has n't . Try the Museum , then . " " I ca n't bear the Museum . The white snakes in bottles make me so nervous , " said Joy . " A white snake in a bottle ! Why , I never saw one , " said Gypsy , with sparkling eyes . " Well , I 'll go with you , child , if Joy has n't the politeness to do it , " said her uncle , patting her eager face . " Mr. Breynton , " said his wife , petulantly , " you are always blaming that child for something . " Yet , in the very next breath , she scolded Joy , for delaying her practising ten minutes , more severely than her father would have done if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy the next day , and forgot all about Gypsy ; but the day after he left his store at an early hour , and took her to the Museum , and out to Bunker Hill . That was the happiest day Gypsy spent in Boston . The day after her aunt had a large dinner company . No one would have imagined that Gypsy dreaded it in the least ; but , in her secret heart , she did . Joy seemed to be perfectly happy when she was dressed in her brilliant Stuart plaid silk , with its long sash and valenciennes lace ruffles , and spent a full half hour exhibiting her jewelry-box to Gypsy 's wondering eyes , and trying to decide whether she would wear her coral brooch and ear-rings , which matched the scarlet of the plaid , or a handsome malachite set , which were the newer . Gypsy looked on admiringly , for she liked pretty things as well as other girls ; but dressed herself in the simple blue-and-white checked foulard , with blue ribbons around her net and at her throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother had taken so much pains , and which had seemed so grand in Yorkbury ,  - -  hoped her aunt 's guests would not laugh at her , and decided to think no more about the matter . The first half hour of dinner passed off pleasantly enough . Gypsy was hungry ; for she had just come home from a long walk to Williams &; Everett 's picture gallery , and the dinner was very nice ; the only trouble with it being that , there were so many courses , she could not decide what to eat and what to refuse . But after a while a deaf old gentleman , who sat next her , felt conscientiously impelled to ask her where she lived and how old she was , and she had to scream so loud to answer him , that it attracted the attention of all the guests . Then the dessert came and the wine , and an hour and a half had passed , and still no one showed any signs of leaving the table , and the old gentleman made spasmodic attempts at conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half became two hours , and Gypsy was so thoroughly tired out sitting still , it seemed as if she should scream , or upset her finger-bowl , or knock over her chair , or do some terrible thing . " You said you were twelve years old , I believe ? " said the old gentleman , suddenly . This was the fifth time he had asked that very same question . Joy trod on Gypsy 's toes under the table , and Gypsy laughed , coughed , seized her goblet , and began to drink violently to conceal her rudeness . " Twelve years ? and you live in Vermont ? " remarked the old gentleman placidly . This was a drop too much . Gypsy swallowed her water the wrong way , strangled and choked , and ran out of the room with crimson face , mortified and gasping . She knew , by a little flash of her aunt 's eyes , that she was ashamed of her , and much displeased . She locked herself into her own room , feeling very miserable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been sent for , after the company had returned to the parlors . She did not dare to disobey , so she went , and sat down in a corner by the piano , where she hoped she should be out of sight . A pleasant-faced lady , sitting near , turned , and said ,  --  " Do n't you play , my dear ? " " A little , " said Gypsy , wishing she could have truthfully said no . " I wish you would play for me , " said the lady . " Oh , I should n't like to , " said Gypsy , shrinking ; " I do n't know anything but Scotch airs . " " That is just what I like , " said the lady . " Mrs. Breynton , ca n't you persuade your niece to play a little for me ? " " Certainly , Gypsy , " said her aunt , with a look which plainly said , " Do n't think of it . " Gypsy 's mother had taught her that it was both disobliging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matter how simple her music might be . So , not knowing how to refuse , and wishing the floor would open and swallow her up , she went to the piano , and played two sweet Scotch airs . She played them well for a girl of her age , and the lady thanked her , and seemed to enjoy them . But that night , just as she was going to bed , she accidentally overheard her aunt saying to Joy ,  --  " It was very stupid and forward in her . I tried to make her understand , but I couldn't -- those little songs , too ! Why , with all your practice , and such teachers as you have had , I would n't think of letting you play before anybody at your age . " Gypsy cried herself to sleep that night . Just a week from the day that she came to Boston , Gypsy and Joy were out shopping in Summer Street . They had just come out of Hovey 's , when they met a ragged child , not more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken . " Oh , dear ! " cried Gypsy ; " see that poor little girl ! I 'm going to see what 's the matter . " " Do n't ! " said Joy , horrified ; " come along ! Nobody stops to speak to beggars in Boston ; what are you doing ? " For Gypsy had stopped and taken the child 's two dirty little fists down from her eyes , and looked down into the tear-stained and mud-stained face to see what was the matter . " I -- I do n't know where nobody is , " sobbed the child . " Have you lost your way ? Where do you live ? " asked Gypsy , with great , pitying eyes . Gypsy could never bear to see anybody cry ; and then the little creature was so ragged and thin . " I live there , " said the child , pointing vaguely down the street . " Mother 's to home there somewhars . " " I 'll go with you and find your mother , " said Gypsy ; and taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulsive fashion , without a thought beyond her pity . " Gypsy ! Gypsy Breynton ! " called Joy . " The police will take her home -- you must n't ! " But Gypsy did not hear , and Joy , shocked and indignant , went home and left her . In about an hour Gypsy came back , flushed and panting with her haste . Joy , in speechless amazement , had looked from the window and seen her running across the Common . Her aunt met her on the stairs with a face like a thunder-cloud . " Why , Gypsy Breynton , I am ashamed of you ! How could you do such a thing as to go off with a beggar , and take hold of her hand right there in Summer Street , and go nobody knows where , alone , into those terrible Irish streets ! It was a dreadful thing to do , and I should think you would have known better , and I really think I must write to your mother about it immediately ! " Gypsy stood for a moment , motionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she passed her aunt quickly on the stairs , and ran up to her room . Her face was very white . If she had been at home she would have broken forth in a torrent of angry words . Kate , the house-maid , was sweeping the entry . " Did you know there was going to be another great dinner to-day , miss ? " she said , as Gypsy passed her . Gypsy went into her room , and locked her door . Another of those terrible dinner-companies , and her aunt so angry at her ! It was too much -- she could not bear it ! She looked about the room twice , passed her hand over her forehead , and her face flushed quickly . One of Gypsy 's sudden and often perilous resolutions was made . CHAPTER XII NO PLACE LIKE HOME No one came to the room . After a while the front door opened and shut , and she saw , from the window , that her aunt and Joy were going out . She then remembered that she had heard them say they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle was at the store , and no one was now in the house besides herself , but the servants . " All right , " she said , half aloud ; " I could n't have fixed it better . " For half an hour she stayed in her room with the door locked , and any one listening outside could have heard her moving briskly about , opening drawers and shutting closet doors . Then she came down stairs and went out . She was gone just about long enough to have been to the nearest hack-stand and back again . A few minutes after she returned , the door-bell rang . " I 'll go , " she called to Kate ; " it 's a man I sent here on an errand , and I shall have to see him . " " Very well , miss , " said Kate , and went singing down the back-stairs with her broom . " This way , " said Gypsy , opening the door . She led the way to her room , and the man who followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out to a carriage which stood at the door . Gypsy went into her aunt 's room and left a little note on the table where it would be easily seen , threw her veil over her face , felt of her purse to be sure it was safe in her pocket , and ran hastily down stairs after him , and into the carriage . The man strapped on her trunk , slammed the door upon her , and , mounting his box , drove rapidly away . Kate , who happened to be looking out of one of the basement windows , saw the carriage , but did not notice the trunk . She supposed Gypsy was riding somewhere to meet her aunt or uncle , and went on with her dusting . The carriage stopped at the Fitchburg depot , and Gypsy paid her fare and went into the ladies ' room . The coachman , who seemed to be an accommodating man , though a little curious , brought her a check , and hoped she 'd get along comfortable ; it was a pretty long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gypsy thanked him , and going up to the ticket-master , asked him something in a low tone . " In just an hour ! " said the ticket-master , in a loud , business-like voice . " An hour ! So long as that ? " " Yes , ma'am . " Gypsy drew her veil very closely about her face , and sat down in the darkest corner she could find . She seemed to be very much afraid of being recognized ; for she shrank from every new-comer , and started every time the door opened . " Train for Fitchburg , Rutland , Burlington ! " shouted a voice , at last , and the words were drowned in the noise of hurrying feet . Gypsy took a seat in the rear car , by the door , which was open , so that she was partially concealed from the view of the passengers . Just before the train started , a tall , whiskered gentleman walked slowly through the car , scanning the faces on each side of him . " You have n't seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and red cheeks , have you ? " he asked , stopping just in front of Gypsy . Several of the passengers shook their heads , and one old lady piped out on a very high key ,  --  " No , sir , I hai n't ! " The gentleman passed out , and shut the door . Gypsy held her breath . It was her uncle . He looked troubled and anxious . Gypsy 's cheeks flushed ,  - -  a sudden impulse came over her to call him back , she started and threw open the window , but the engine-bell rang , the train puffed slowly off , and her uncle disappeared in the crowd . As she was whirled rapidly along through wharves and shipping and lumber , away from the roar of the city , and out where woods and green fields lined the way , she began , for the first time , to think what she was doing , and to wonder if she were doing right . Her anger at her aunt , and the utter disappointment and homesickness of her Boston visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her power of reasoning . To get home , to see her mother , to hide her head on her shoulder and cry ,  - -  this was the one thought that had turned itself over and over in her mind , on that quick ride from Beacon Street , and in that hour spent in the dark corner of the depot . Here she was , running like a thief from her uncle 's house , without a word of good-by or thanks for his hospitality , with no message to tell him where she had gone but that note , hastily written in the first flush of her hurt and angry feelings . And the hurrying train was whirling her over hill and valley faster and farther . To go back was impossible , go on she must . What had she done ? She began now , too , to wonder where she should spend the night . The train went only as far as Rutland , and it would be late and dark when she reached the town -- far too late for a little girl to be travelling alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a strange place . What should she do ? As the afternoon passed , and the twilight fell , and the lamps were lighted , and people hurried out at way-stations to safe and waiting homes , her loneliness and anxiety increased . Just before entering Rutland , a young man , dressed in a dandyish manner , and partially intoxicated , entered the car , and took the empty seat by Gypsy . She did not like his looks , and moved away slightly , turning to look out of the window . " No offense , I hope ? " said the man , with a foolish smile ; " the car was full . " Gypsy made no reply . " Travelling far ? " he said , a moment after . " To Rutland , sir , " said Gypsy , feeling very uneasy , as she perceived the odor of rum , and wishing he would not talk to her . " Friends there ? " said the man again . " N -- no , sir , " said Gypsy , reluctantly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town ? What hotel do you go to ? " " I do n't know , " said Gypsy , hurriedly . The car was just stopping , and she rose and tried to pass him . " I will show you the way , " he said , standing up , and reeling slightly as he tried to walk . Gypsy , in despair , looked for the conductor . He was nowhere to be seen . The crowd passed out , quite careless of the frightened child , or regarding her only with a curious stare . " It 's only a little way , " said the man , with an oath . " Why , sakes a massy , if this ai n't Gypsy Breynton ! " Gypsy turned , with a cry of joy , at hearing her name , and fairly sprang into Mrs. Surly 's arms . " Why , where on airth did you come from , Gypsy Breynton ? " " I came from Boston , and that man is drunk , and ,  - -  oh , dear ! I 'm so glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a hotel , and I did n't know what mother would say , and where did you come from ? " said Gypsy , talking very fast . " I come from my sister Lucindy 's , down to Bellows Falls , and I 'm going to Cousin Mary Ann Jacobs to spend the night . " " Oh ! " said Gypsy , wistfully . " I do n't see how a little gal like you ever come to be on a night train alone , " said Mrs. Surly , with a keen , curious look at Gypsy 's face ; " but I know your ma 'd never let you go to a hotel this time o ' night , and Mary Ann she 'd be delighted to see you ; so you 'd better come along . " Gypsy was so happy and so thankful , she could fairly have kissed her ,  - -  even her , Mrs. Surly . Cousin Mary Ann received her hospitably , and the evening and the night passed quickly away . Mrs. Surly was very curious , and somewhat suspicious on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such peculiar circumstances . Gypsy said that she left Boston quite suddenly , that they were not expecting her at home , and that she took so late a train for several reasons , but had not thought that it went no further than Rutland , till she was fairly started ; which was true . More than this , Mrs. Surly could not cross-question out of her , and she soon gave up trying . Cousin Mary Ann wanted Mrs. Surly 's company another day ; so Gypsy took an early train for Yorkbury alone . Gypsy never took any trouble very deeply to heart , and the morning sunlight , and the sight of the dear , familiar mountains , drove away , to a great extent , the repentant and anxious thoughts of the night . As the train shrieked into Yorkbury , she forgot everything but that she was at home ,  - -  miles away from Boston , her mother near , and Tom , and the dear old days of paddling about on rafts , and having no dinner-parties to disgrace herself at , and no aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one she knew were at the station . Mr. Surly was there , under strict orders from his wife , to watch for her every train till she came ; and Mr. Fisher was there , just down on an errand from the mountains ; and Mrs. Rowe and Sarah were walking up the street ; and Agnes Gaylord was over at the grocer 's , nodding and smiling as Gypsy stepped upon the platform ; and there , too , was Mr. Simms , who had been somewhere in the cars , and who stepped into the coach just after she did . " Why , Miss Gypsy !  - -  why , really ! You home again , my dear ? Why , your father did n't expect you ! " " I know it , " said Gypsy . " Are they all well ? " " Oh , yes , yes , all well ,  - -  but to give them such a surprise ! It is so exactly like you , my dear . " " I do n't like Boston , " said Gypsy , coloring . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly . " " Do n't like Boston ? Well , you are a remarkable young lady ! " exclaimed Mr. Simms , and relapsed into silence , watching Gypsy 's flushed and eager face , as people watch a light coming back into a dark room . " We have missed you up at the store , my dear , " he said , after a while . " Have you ? I 'm glad . Oh ! who 's that with Miss Melville out walking under the elm-trees ? " " I guess it 's Mr. Hallam . " " Oh , to be sure , " interrupted Gypsy , looking very bright . " I see ,  - -  Mr . Guy Hallam . Now I guess I know why she would n't teach school ! " " They are to be married in the spring , " said Mr. Simms . " Just think ! " said Gypsy . " How funny ! Now she 'll have to stay at home and keep house all day ,  - -  I think she 's real silly , do n't you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever said , Mr. Simms thought this capped the climax . Now the coach had rattled up the hill , and lumbered round the corner , and there was the old house , looking quiet and pleasant and dear , in the morning sunlight . Gypsy was so excited that she could not sit still , and kept Mr. Simms in a fever of anxiety , for fear she would tumble out of the coach windows . It seemed to her as if she had been gone a year , instead of just one week . She sprang down the carriage-steps at a bound , and ran into the house . Her mother was out in the kitchen helping Patty about the dinner . She heard such a singing and shouting as no one had made in the house since Gypsy went away , and hurried out into the front entry to see what had happened . Tom ran in from the garden , and Winnie slid down on the banisters , and Mr. Breynton was just coming up the yard , and Patty put her head in at the entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody must be kissed all round , and for a few minutes there was such a bustle , that Gypsy could hardly hear herself speak . " What has brought you home so soon ? " asked her mother , then . " We did n't look for you for a week yet . " " Oh , I hate Boston ! " cried Gypsy , pulling off her things . " I did n't like anything but the Museum and Bunker Hill ; and Joy wore silk dresses , and would n't let me look in the shop-windows , ' n I took a poor , little beggar-girl home , and you ca n't run round any , and Aunt Miranda told me she 'd tell you , and I hate it , and she 's just as cross as a bear ! " " Your aunt cross ! " said her mother , who could make neither beginning nor end of Gypsy 's excited story . " I guess she is , " said Gypsy , with an emphasis . " Oh , I am so glad to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace Maythorne and everybody , and Winnie has a new jacket , has n't he ? " Mr. and Mrs. Breynton exchanged glances . They saw that something was wrong ; but wisely considered that that time was not the one for making any inquiries into the matter . Mrs. Breynton thought , also , that if Gypsy had been guilty of ill-temper or rudeness , she would confess it herself . She was right ; for as soon as dinner was over , Gypsy called her away alone , and told her all the story . They were shut up together a long time , and when Gypsy came out her eyes were red with crying . All that Mrs. Breynton said does not matter here ; but Gypsy is not likely soon to forget it . A few words spoken , just as the conversation ended , became golden mottoes that helped her over many rough places in her life . " It is all the old trouble , Gypsy , you ' did n't think . ' A little self-control , a moment 's quiet thought , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it ! " sobbed Gypsy . " That 's what always ails me . I 'm always doing things , and always sorry for them . I mean to do right , and I can not remember . What shall I do with myself , mother ? " " Gypsy , " said her mother , very soberly , " this will never do . You can think . And Gypsy , my child , in every one of these little thoughtless words and acts God sees a sin . " " A sin when you did n't think ? " exclaimed Gypsy . " You must learn to think , Gypsy ; and He will teach you . " Her mother kissed her many times , and Gypsy clung to her neck , and was very still . Whatever thoughts she had just then , she never told them to any one . The afternoon passed away like a merry dream . Gypsy was so happy that she had had the talk with her mother ; so glad to be kissed and forgiven and loved and helped ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and home so dear , and the mountains so blue and beautiful , and the sunlight so bright , that she scarcely knew whether she were asleep or awake . She must hunt up the kitten , and feed the chickens , and take a peep at the cow , and stroke old Billy in his stall ; she must see how many sweet peas were left on the vines , and climb out on the shed-roof that had been freshly shingled since she was gone , and run down to the Kleiner Berg , and over to see Sarah Rowe . She must know just what Tom had been doing this interminable week , just how many buttons Winnie had lost off from his jacket , and what kind of pies Patty had baked for dinner . She must kiss her mother twenty times an hour , and pull her father 's whiskers , and ride Winnie on her shoulder . Best of all , perhaps , it was to run down to Peace Maythorne 's , and find the sunlight golden in the quiet room , and the pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , when the door opened , say , " Oh , Gypsy ! " in such a way , as no other voice ever said it ; and then to sit down and lay her head upon the pillow by Peace , and tell her all that had happened . " Well , " said Peace , smiling , " I think you have learned a good deal for one week , and I guess you will never unlearn it . " " I guess you 'll be very sorry you went to Bosting , " remarked Winnie , in an oracular manner , that night , when they were all together in their old places in the sitting-room . " The Meddlesome Quinine Club had a concert here last Wednesday , and we had preserved seats . What do you think of that ? " This is a copy of the letter that found its way to Beacon Street a few days after :  --  " My dear Uncle and Aunt Miranda : " I am so sorry I do n't know what to do . I was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then auntie was displeased about the beggar-girl ( I took her home , and her mother was just as glad as she could be , and so poor ! ) and so I felt angry and homesick , and I know I ought n't to have gone to such a place without asking ; but I did n't think ; and then I came home in the afternoon train , but I did n't think when I did that either . Mother says that was no excuse , and I know it was very wicked in me to do such a thing . Mrs. Surly met me in the cars at Rutland , and took me to spend the night with her cousin , Mrs. Mary Ann Jacobs ; so I got along safely , and nothing happened to me , but one drunken man that kept talking . " Mother says I have done a very rude and unkind thing , to leave you all so , when you had invited me there , and been so good to me . I know it . I had a real nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum with uncle ; and , of course , it was my own fault that I did n't like to wear gloves , and choked so at dinner . " Mother says you will never want to see me there again ; and I should n't think you would . Seems to me I never did such a thing in all my life , and you have n't any idea how badly I feel about it . But I know that does n't help it any . " I 've made up my mind never to do anything again till I 've thought it all over as many as twelve times . Mother says two or three would do , but I think twelve would be safer . " I wish you 'd let Joy come up here . I 'd take her boating and riding , and up to Ripton , and down to the swamp , and everything , and try to make up . " I do n't suppose you will ever care anything more about me ; but I wish you 'd please to excuse me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " P. S. -- Winnie 's cat has the cunningest little set of kittens you ever saw . They 're all blind , and they have such funny paws . "
