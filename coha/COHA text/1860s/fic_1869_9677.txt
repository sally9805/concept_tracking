A personification of six of the principal virtues , by as many young ladies , in the form of a dialogue ; 1st , Charity ; 2nd , Mercy ; 3rd , Humility ; 4th , Modesty ; 5th , Patience ; 6th , Temperance . The young ladies enter , and form a semi-circle . They may dress in costume to suit their tastes . It would be well to give to each a distinct color of dress . Thus : Charity , white ; Mercy sky-blue ; Humility , drab ; Modesty , pale pink ; Patience , brown ; Temperance , green . Main text CHARITY .  --  Fair sisters , it were fortunate for our fallen race if our dominion were universal . MERCY .  --  True , sister Charity , and it would be thy province to warm the world 's cold heart , and open the fountain of benevolence , to cause plenty to visit the abodes of penury and want , and drive hunger and misery away . HUMILITY .  --  And thine , good sister Mercy , to stay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plead the cause of the erring , and cause it no longer to be said . " Man 's inhumanity to man , Makes countless thousands mourn . " MODESTY .  --  And thine , gentle sister Humility , to worship in the ear of the proud , that man is " like the morning cloud and early dew ; to check the car of vaulting ambition , and teach pompous vanity to bow at some other than a selfish shrine . PATIENCE .  --  And thou , sweet Modesty , daughter of Meekness , art among the brightest relics of Eden ! It should be thy province to banish impudence , hold the mirror to the face of egotism , and learn the meritless pretender to see himself as others see him . " TEMPERANCE .  --  Gladly , quiet sister Patience , should the world hail thee Queen ! For thou wouldst drive despondency from the child of affliction , cheer the weary and well-doing , and hold the lamp of hope along the path of enterprise . CHARITY .  --  Hail , beautiful sister Temperance ! Of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would bless mankind more than thine ! ALL .  --  Hail , Temperance ! Thou art among the fairest and best of the daughters of Virtue ! ( The young ladies should pronounce these two lines in full , measured tones in accord . ) CHARITY .  --  Time , patience and perseverance accomplish all things . Let us , my good sisters , this hour resolve to cease not our efforts until we bring the world under our dominion . Until all the wayward sons of earth shall bow at our shrines , and submit to our peaceful reigns . ALL .  --  Most cheerfully , kind sister , do we so resolve , and from this hour will set about the good work . TEMPERANCE .  --  I will break the sceptre of old Bacchus , demolish his throne , and banish his ugly majesty to the dreary empire of Night , from whence he came . The inebriate shall be clothed in his right mind , bow at the shrine of Temperance , and his sorrowing wife shall cease to lament his folly . I will woo the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take them by the hand , and lead them along the walks of virtue . The voice of riot shall be hushed , strife and tumult shall cease to wrangle , and reason shall hold universal dominion over the minds of men . PATIENCE .  --  I will visit the chamber of affliction , and bid the sufferer hope , will trim the midnight lamp of the student , and point him to the temple of fame , and the chaplet that is weaving for his brow . Mountains shall be removed from the paths of enterprise , the shores of ocean shall shake hands together , and the world shall learn that patience and perseverance conquer all things . Woman shall contest the palm of science of boasting man , and her brow shall bloom with unfading wreaths , gathered by her own toil from the gardens of literature . MODESTY .  --  I will bestow upon woman a brighter gem than ever sparkled in Castalia 's fountain . The son of song shall find inspiration in its beams , and the tongue of eloquence glow with rapture in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eden , and admiring angels claim again a sisterhood on earth . HUMILITY .  --  I will teach the proud to become as little children , and the boasting to bow meekly at the feet of wisdom , and learn the vanity of earthly possessions ; will point them to the heavens and the earth , to the vast suns that blaze , beautiful stars that twinkle , and stupendous comets that revolve through the wide empire of space , and ask them what is man that he should boast when the vain oppressor is revelling in his hall , receiving the flatteries of dependents , and dreaming of an increase of power and magnificence , I will startle him from his dreams by writing in mysterious characters upon the wall : " Thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting ; " thy throne is tottering to ruins , and liberty is now preparing thy grave , oh , tyrant . MERCY .  --  I will remind man that Heaven was merciful to him , when the flaming sword of justice would have cut him down , and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the side of the judge , and mysteriously incline the scale to the side of mercy rather than of vengeance : and will visit the gloomy prison-house , unbar its massive doors , and unclose the chains of the fettered . The strong shall cease to oppress the weak , and the obdurate heart of cruelty shall be melted into tenderness . CHARITY .  --  And I will not be idle , fair sisters . I will dry up the tears of the sorrowing one , hush the cry of the orphan for bread , cause the rose of plenty to bloom upon the pale cheek of want , and illuminate the desolate dominions of misery with the smiles of hope . ALL .  --  Hail , sister Charity , brightest star that illuminates our fallen earth , may universal dominion soon be thine . And may this intelligent audience fall in love with Charity , Mercy , Humility , Modesty , Patience and Temperance , and submit to their happy reigns .
