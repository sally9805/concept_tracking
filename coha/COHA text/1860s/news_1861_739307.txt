txt Men of business have little difficulty in understanding the pleasure of having a mean , dishonest and unscrupulous sneak for a nextdoor ? neighbor , or a business competitor . Those who lack opportunities for appreciating the full delights of such a situation , will do well to consider the case of newspaper Editors who are condemned to , maintain a sort of business rivalry with " the bewhipped and bekicked " old vagabond of the Herald . Without the slightest regard for truth , utterly ignorant . of the meaning of personal honor , ? incapable even of understanding the degradations and ignominies that have been heaped upon him so long that he would miss a congenial stimulus if they were ever to be withheld , unscrupulous in Iris choice of means as in the ends he proposes , and ready to listen at a keyhole , purloin a private letter , betray business confidence , or commit any other outrage which might stab a rival or feed for a moment his own malignity , he makes himself as a business competitor very much what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be as a play-fellow . Partly from instinct , and partly from choice , he has copied his style of professional warfare from the military strategy of the Chinese . So long as those weapons will serve his turn , he relies on lying and treachery ; ? when these fail , and the contest waxes desperate , lie resorts to stink-pots . In this style of warfare , he certainly manifests great skill ,  --  but his supremacy , such as it is , is due mainly to the fact that he uses weapons which , from the necessity of the case , leave him the whole field to himself . Nine-tenths of his infamous calumnies pass without notice , simply because it is more disagreeable to have anything whatever to do with tarn than it is to submit to his slanders . For the last few weeks the Herald has assailed the TIMES and Tribune with as mucl and as reckless vehemence as if its existence depended on their destruction . It tried for t long time to stir up a mob against them b : the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them with . shameless impudence , its own favorite scheme of stirring up an insurrection amon the slaves : . By a few quotations from it ; columns , we spiked that gun very effectually It , opens its batteries of abuse now on on private business . It assures the public da : after day that . the TIMES and Tribune are " ox their last legs , " ? that they are losing mone very rapidly , and must . soon die out . It proba bly makes a few fools believe it , ? for a lie however preposterous , will by dint of repetitior make some impression on a certain class co : readers . The Herald repeals these day after day with perfect impunity , for it knows very well that our disgust in noticing them is far greater than any damage they can inflict ,  - -  and that we have not the slightest regard for any man whom they can mislead . We allude to them now , not to complain of them  --  still less to refute them , but simply to brand afresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the miserable caitiff who resorts to this mode of professional warfare . So far as the TIMES is concerned , these statements are wholesale falsehoods , ? sheer fabrications , ? without one particle of truth even to make them plausible . In spite of the War and the general dullness of the season , the business of the TIMES was never more prosperous or more promising . Our cash receipts have been $50,000 more this year than they were last up to the same time : ? our circulation has very nearly doubled : ? our advertising is steadily and rapidly increasing : ? all through the dullest of the Summer months we have had a balance of from $15,000 to $20,000 in the . Bank : ? we have no notes afloat which we are not prepared to cash on presentation : It is amusing to note the shifts into which the Herald has been driven by the failure of this scheme . As its advertising fellsbff , it set it linedeleted advertisement occupies half more space in the Herald than in the TIMES . Thereupon the Herald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of its advertising patronage The Herald heard the other day that there was some talk among the printers of reducing the rates of composition -- which have been steadily advancing for the last ten years , until they are now at a point which has compelled many printing establishments to suspend operations , and others greatly to reduce their amount of work . In spite of the fact that a thousand printers have thus been thrown out of work and have no prospect of support , for themselves and their families , for the coming Winter , the Herald denounces the movement as " a war on journeymen printers , " ? an " interference with the rights of labor , " intended to save the TIMES and Tribune from destruction ! Such drivel would be simply ludicrous if it were less malignant . BENNETT 'S professions of tender regard for the printers will pass for an excellent joke among them . It is of the same kind as his regard for the reading public  --  upon whom he wanted our help to levy additional black-mail for his sheet . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his face at any profession of regard for his welfare . We have wasted a good deal more space or this matter than we had intended . We heat it constantly urged that the mendacity of tin Herald is so thoroughly understood that it car do no harm  --  and we certainly do not appre bend any injury from its incessant and malev olent misrepresentations . We take it , indeed as a decided compliment that it can maintair a successful rivalry with the TIMES in no other way  --  that it has failed utterly in the race fot public favor , and now seeks in falsehood ark defamation solace for its ignominious defeat in the legitimate competition of business . ? OUT profits have been larger thus far this year than the Herald 's :  --  and our business is in all respects in a perfectly prosperous and satisfactory , . condition . The outside public may find it difficult to imagine a motive for the Herald 's mendacity . As a general thing it needs no motive . The pleasure of lying ,  --  the bare satisfaction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reward . In this ease , however , he has another motive . We have stood in his way . For a long time BENNETT has been trying to force the public to pay three cents for his sheet instead of two . When the war first broke out he thought . the time had come ,  --  and proposed the scheme to the TIMES amt Tribune . It was impossible , he said , to make any money at two cents ; - the public must have the news and would be compelled to pay three cents , if the three leading journals would only combine and insist upon it . The TIMES refused to come into the arrangement ,  --  and the Herald did not dare attempt it without our assent . We insisted that the great mass of the reading community would feel an increase of fifty per cent . in the cost of their newspapers very sensibly ,  --  and that we should not join in any conspiracy to inflict it upon them . From that day to this the Herald has been unceasing in its false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foiled one of its pet plans for plundering the public . It seeks its revenge by the daily assaults which the public tolerate , on our private business .
