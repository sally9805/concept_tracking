Hiram Aunt Dinah , I 'm delighted to see you , and you , too , Edgar . Come , let us set to ; I 've a sharp appetite , they sit and shall do justice to your excellent fare . By Jove , this coffee is magnificent ; you might make a fortune , Aunt Dinah , if you were to open a coffee saloon in Boston , This is perfect . Dinah ' Spect the good cream helped to make it ; hut I'se gwine to fetch little Charley ; ' spect you wants to see him . Hiram Certainly , bring him in at once . Exit DINAH , L. H.

Mira An elegant present ! Hiram I have not forgotten you , my daughter ; here is one for you , and to-morrow there will arrive a box , filled with books , which will make quite an addition to your library . Mira Oh , father , you are too good . Hiram Impossible to be too good to a kind and dutiful daughter , and , Aunt Dinah , I 've not forgotten your kindness to my poor motherless children  --  here 's a little purse for you . Dinah ' Spect this yere 's more'n enough to pay me ; them children 's no trouble to me ; but I wants you to let my boy Edgar alone Hiram Your boy ! Why , I have not troubled him , Aunt Dinah . I think so much of you that last time I was here I offered him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston . Dinah That 's just what I do n't want you to do . I does n't want no chile o ' mine , going up to dat place , to l'arn to drink , and smoke hell fire and destruction to his soul . Hiram Why , Dinah , there 's not much danger of hell fire and destruction by his being with me ; my place is patronized by the first-class solid men of Boston . Dinah Do n't know nuffin ' bout dat , but I do n't want my boy to go thar . Hiram Just as you say , Aunty . I 'm willing to oblige you any way Mira , I will take a stroll . The evening is delightful , and while here . I intend to enjoy the country air . DINAH exits , L. H. , with tray . Albert Takes out cigar-case . Meantime , I 'll enjoy a cigar . Come , Charley , have you smoked your first cigar yet ? It is time you were beginning to learn some of the manly habits . Mira Interposing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that manner ; he will never be a man if one of the requisites is to Exit R. with CHARLEY . Hiram You must let the boy alone , Albert . It annoys Mira and displeases me . Al Albert No harm done , I guess ; he might as well learn to smoke now as any time . Hiram I wish he might never learn . Al Albert Surprised . I thought you believed in smoking . This is the first time I ever heard you speak against it ; you had no objection to my learning . Hiram Perhaps I did n't ; but you were not a baby . Al Albert I see the difference ; I suppose my father loved me as well as you love Charley . If he had lived , I might have been better . But I shall get through the world soon  --  a short life and a merry one for me . No use for us to quarrel  --  here , take a cigar . Hiram Not at present . I am going to join Mira , and she objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't do less than respect my daughter 's prejudices . Exit HIRAM , R. H. Al Albert Prejudices ! ha , ha , ha ! If my parents were living , my prejudices would most likely have been respected also ; but Uncle Dempster , though he has encouraged me to drink and smoke  --  me , his only sister 's only son  --  discourages the same things in his son , my cousin . No matter  --  here comes Edgar , and now for some fun . Enter EDGAR , L. H. Hallo , Edgar , my buck ; why , you 've grown to be a perfect giant . Take a cigar . Ed Edgar No , thank you , Mr. Albert ; this chile never smokes . Al Albert Never smoked in your life ? Ed Edgar Never tried it but once , and then it made this chile so sick , I thought my insides was Long Island Sound in a gale o ' wind , an ' dat I was a dismasted oyster-boat tryin ' to get out . That answered for me ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't give it up so ; try again . One loses half the pleasure in life if he do n't know how to enjoy a good cigar . Come , take one . Ed Edgar No , siree ; dis chile neber goin ' to use tobacco while he lives . Guess I can find somethin ' better to do than turn my mouth into a smoke-stack , like a dirty ole steamboat funnel . Exit R. Al Albert We shall see , Darkey . There 's more ways than one to bring a fellow like you to terms . Exit R. H. SCENE II .  --  A landscape in first grooves . Enter MIRA , R. H. Mira The temptation that I feared has come at last , in the shape , too , of one whom I should love , for his dear mother 's sake  --  but must avoid for my own and that of my dear brother Charley . Poor Charley ! I promised our sainted mother , when she lay upon her dying bed , to watch over  --  to guard and protect you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have hitherto most faithfully kept and , with heaven 's kind aid , I will still adhere to  --  but , with a cousin , who brings his intemperate habits into this calm retreat , where all is peace and joy  --  countenanced , too , by my father , whose daily business is the dealing out of the accursed poison ; which brutalizes the mind , and reduces man to a degradation inferior to that of the lowest animals , the task , I fear , is hard ; but it is noble , and I will not shrink from the difficulty . Here I vow to use my soul 's endeavor to rescue my father and my cousin from the besotting sin of drunkenness . Enter ALBERT , R. H. Al Albert What , ruralizing , Cousin Mira ? I 've been seeking you to ask you to take a ride with me . You must not mope alone , now that I 'm here . Mira You must excuse me , Albert . I am too busy . Al Albert Too busy ! If you do not wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm in speaking the truth . Mira To be plain with you , then , cousin , I do n't wish to go riding with you . ALBERT is going . Stay , Albert ! Al Albert Why should I remain ? I know you hate the sight of me , but I am what your father has made me . I tell you , Mira Dempster , there will come a day of reckoning for us all . I do n't blame you . I am not fit to come into your presence , but I am better than your father ! Mira Oh , Albert , that may be . My heart is almost broken when I think of the wrong there is , and has been , in our family . Mother hoped I would try and save you  --  she loved you , Albert . Oh , for her sake , be persuaded to act differently ! Al Albert I wish I could , Mira ; I hate and despise myself , more than you can , but I am bound for a goal , and shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had better not tell you . It might have an unpleasant effect upon your nerves . I am bound now for a ride with you , or without you  --  which shall it be ? Mira Without me . I can do you no good ; so , good-by . Al Albert ' Spect not , as Aunt Dinah says ; so , good-by ! Exit , MIRA , R. H. She 's gone , and I am left alone , to despise myself , even as she despises me , for the folly I have committed in becoming a slave to the bottle . Well , Well , it 's no use my grieving ; what 's done can not be undone ; and if I am going headlong to ruin , Uncle Dempster is the cause . He it was that first taught me to taste of the syren cup that lures me on to that ruin I feel that I am fast approaching , and which I can not avoid  --  destruction ! death !  --  stares me in the face . Well , let them drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus defy the world ! Drinks from flask . So , that puts courage in my heart , and I feel a man once more . Enter EDGAR , R. H. Ed Edgar Massa Albert , de horse is already put in the light wagon , but I tell you what , sir , you best be mighty careful o ' that critter ; he 's awful rumbustious ; he 's been skitting ' round like mad , he has . Al Albert Oh , never fear . I 'm not afraid of any horse I ever saw . Are you afraid of him , Edgar ? Ed Edgar Well , no , sir , no ; I'se not afraid , not exactly afraid , dis chile is n't , but just a leetle scared o ' that skittish horse . Al Albert Well , here 's something to put courage in you , my boy ; I 've a bottle of cider here . Taking out wine-flask . Ed Edgar Nice looking cider that . Al Albert Smiling . Nice tasting cider , too , Edgar . Drinks . Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dis chile , thank ye . Al Albert Angrily . You shall drink it . Are you better than I , that you refuse my hospitality ? You refused a cigar from my hands this morning , but you sha n't be such a fool as to refuse a drink . Ed Edgar Massa Albert , I is a fool , and I has refused . Al Albert No matter ; you shall drink it , for all that . Ed Edgar No , I wo n't ! Al Albert Come , take it ; there 's no harm in drinking cider . Ed Edgar You are sure that 's cider ? Al Albert Yes ; do you doubt it ? Ed Edgar No , sar ; I would n't doubt a gemman 's word at all , but I was gwine to observe dat dat cider 's got de biggest smell of New England rum I ever seen !

Hear me , oh , Heavenly Father , and grant my prayer , that my poor orphaned cousin may be restored to health and strength . And here I devote myself , from this moment , to the holy cause of Temperance . Never will I relax my exertions till my father resigns the accursed trade of rum-selling , and of dram-drinking .

Hiram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most happy to meet with you at my home upon this very interesting and joyful occasion . You must know , Doctor and friends , that a great wrong has been done to my nephew , Albert . The wealth left by his parents , in my trust , I have used in my business . Nay , do not start ; though I have made use of it , I have not lost it ; but on this , his wedding day . I am rejoiced to say that every cent of that money , with interest , is now at his disposal . But what I do regret is the business in which I have used that money ; it has been in the keeping of a gambling and drinking house , and though not a gambler or immoderate drinker myself , I have encouraged both in others . The terrible accident which nearly deprived Albert of his life , and the exemplary conduct of that poor , devoted , humble colored woman , Dinah Freeman , has opened my eyes to the sinful life I have , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this assembled presence , I make the statement that I have closed my liquor and gambling house forever ! And to you , Albert , I now return all bills , checks , and other documents , which will at once put you in full and undisturbed possession of the property left you by your parents ; and now but one thing is left me to insure my perfect happiness ; and that , Albert , remains for you to grant ! Al Albert my dear uncle , ' t is granted , before you speak . Mira Oh , father , name it . Hiram It is forgiveness , Albert , from you , for having led you into the paths of vice , and teaching you to be a drinker ! Al Albert Say no more , my dear uncle . Heaven , I am sure , will pardon all human errors ; and my forgiveness you have , most fully . Hiram Thanks , my poor , wronged nephew . I now can lay me down to sleep in calm and comfort . Come , my children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I resign you to each other . Bless you ! bless you . AUNT DINAH peeps in , L. H. , 1 E.
