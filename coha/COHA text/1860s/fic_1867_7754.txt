Piatt , John James , 1835-1917 : LEARNING PRAYERS . from Learning prayers ( 1867 ) The sweet pure mother , wearing through the dust Her heaven-white garment of fresh Christian love Silent about her , while her patient trust O'er cloudland sings  --  one sunlit bird above  --  Through twilight 's hushing gold bends sweet and lowly Down on her little children , making prayers Grow in their hearts , while their low voices slowly Send little angels heavenward unawares : So Nature , a sweet mother , o'er us bends , Through this dim eve of an eternal day ; Whispers love-words , till gushing light ascends ,  --  Prayer 's hidden fountain in the heart that lay ; And heaven 's mild dew into our dream descends , While , flame-like , close tired eyes , waiting morn 's golden ray .
