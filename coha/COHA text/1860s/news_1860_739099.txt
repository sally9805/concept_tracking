txt The Star of the West arrived at this port , yesterday , with the Havana mall and passengers , and $75,000 in silver from New-Orleans . The receipt of the news of the capture of the steam .. ers Gen. Miramon and Marquez at Vera Cruz , by the United States steamer Saratoga , created great excitement in Havana . The following letter of our correspondent gives all the intelligence of importance : HAVANA , Friday , March 23 , 1860 . The steamer Isabel , from Charleston , bringing mails and passenger s destined for Mexico , to proceed as usual from here by English steamer to Vera Cruz , arrived here with her accustomed regularity yesterday P. M. But as the object of the English steamers , running between St. Thomas and Vera Cruz , calling at this port , is not particularly the promotion of American interests  --  certainly not the furtherance of American commerce with Mexico  --  the Directors of the line have suddenly seen fit to change the time of their arrival at and departure from this place in such manner that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now broken up , and the only means of regular communication between the United States and Mexico , which our supineness and want of enterprise had left to us , is thus destroyed .. The consequence is that the English steamer for Vera Cruz having arrived and left on the 21st , three days before her usual time , the mails and passengers brought by the Isabel will have to lie here until the 17th of next month , when the Spanish steamer Mexico leaves for Vera Cruz , touching at Sisal , and making a seven days ' passage ; or until the 21st , when the English steamer will leave again . This its an ? cowrence which by no care or inquiry , of these , passengers in the United States could have been:avoided . The United States Government , nor the eriterpritOg people of the United States , had provided- airjrritteans of communication direct from the ' United States10 Mexico , and only this circuitous , and expensive route through a foreign country and by a foreign line of steamers was open to them ; and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available by taking a steamer from New-York which will bring them here many days , probably a week or ten dale , in advance of the English steamer 's departure . The present mails to Mexico , brought by the Isabel , are most important in a commercial and politiCal point of view , important dispatches from our Minister there , Mr. , based upon intelligence of the highest moment , received subsequent to his departure from Washington , having been made up at the State Department , and forwarded by this conveyance . A pretty pass we have come to when our Government and our business community have to depend at this critical moment , in our business and political relations with Mexico , upon such roundaoout facilities as dispatching the mail for that country by such uncertain and insecure modes as this , and which , as now , have failed , at a moment when such failure is so embarrassing , and perhaps fraught with political danger of the gravest importance . Never was certain and speedy communication with Mexico of more importance than at the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government can send neither a Minister , a courier nor a letter , unless a vessel ? of-war is specially detailed for the service ? and the business community , not being allowed to avail themselves of that even , when such a vessel leaves , can not send at all . No wonder our ? business relations with that country are diminishing . The Isabel reports the United States steam slobp-ofwar Brooklyn at Key West on the 20th , to leave at day-break on the 22d , for Vera Cruz . Minister kicLAsin and Cot . PICKETT well . The news received here last evening , per Star o West , from New-Orleans , of the capture of the squadron sent from here to blockade Vera Cruz and aid Maalox , by our gallant Commodore TUNIS and the Saratoga , and the arrival of the prizes at that place , has created a great sensation here , and has convinced all that the United States has at last really entered in earnest upon its work of intervention in Mexico . You will get the tone of feeling here upor1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other foreign residents the news is received with . great satisfaction , and is hailed as a good omen .
