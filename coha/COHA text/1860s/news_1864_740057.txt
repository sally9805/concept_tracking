txt An advertisement appears requesting the Alumni of Yale College , in this City , to meet " to devise and adopt a method of mutual in ? surance against the draft . " Et tu , Brute ! Educated men , too , plotting evasion and desertion . The Republic calls upon her sons to defend her . Unless she has that defence , her destruction is inevitable . And yet everywhere there ifia disposition to get clear of the duty . How to escapa the draft , is the leading question of the day . All devices are resorted to . The gutters are dragged for substitutes . Traps are set in Europe . Negro slaves , who owe to the Republic nothing but curses , are driven to the rescue . Anything , anything but a straightforward , personal response to patriotic obligations . The scathing words of Maj.-Gen . SHERMAN , from the front the other day , against the prevailing shifts , were deserved . This shirking is a disgrace to the cause , or rather it is a disgrace to the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salvation of the Republic is as sacred as ever ; no conduct of ours can make it a whit the less righteous or glorious . But such a way of sustaining it as is fast becoming general throughout the North , is a shame to Northern manhood . It is particularly a shame in Northern educated men . If we Piave a right to look anywhere for an unselfish and unflinching devotion to the cause , it is among the men who have had that training and discipline by which the soul ought to grow into every form of moral worth as well as intellectual force . " That is a complete and generous education , " says old JOHN MILTON , " which fits a man to perform justly , skillfully and magnanimously all the offices , both private and public , of peace and war . " By as much as it makes men better observers and thinkers , it should make them better patriots and citizens . It should give them not only a clearer ken , but a , stauncher heart and a stronger arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this crisis of the nation , hear a cry just as pitiful as from any for some method of insuring themselves " against the draft . " There is classic heroism here with a vengeance . ? These men have.dined with DEoxus and supped with Cams , and this is what comes of it . This is sickening . In the name of liberal education , we protest against this effort to connect it with draft-shirking . It is an , ? out- ; rage upon all decency to make a diploma of good stout Latin a signal for desertion and a rallying rag for cowards . If this war is ever to be fought through successfully , the high education of the country must perform its own high part . Its influence is above all other influence . ? It has more power than elsewhere exists to inspire the high senti- , ments meet for this terrible crisis , and to rouse the people to all noble daring and doing : But its persuasions are worthless without example . We are thankful that the example has been freely given . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more soldiers gone to the war than from the undergraduates of our colleges . Very nearly the same thing may be said of the alumni of our colleges . ** recognize this with pride .. It is this veryfeeling which impels us to put the brand upon the recreancy that has publicly advertised itself . Venerable Yale herself , must crimson with shame al such action among those who oall themselves her sons !
