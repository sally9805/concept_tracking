THERE were two ways of getting to South Carolina in Colonial times . The first immigrants , many of whom were men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fertile low country along the coast , became prosperous planters of rice , indigo , and corn , before a single white inhabitant had found his way to the more salubrious upper country in the western part of the Province . The settlers of the upper country were plain , poorer people , who landed at Philadelphia or Baltimore , and travelled southward along the base of the Alleghanies to the inviting table-lands of the Carolinas . In the lower country , the estates were large , the slaves numerous , the white inhabitants few , idle , and profuse . The upper country was peopled by a sturdier race , who possessed farms of moderate extent , hewn out of the wilderness by their own strong arms , and tilled by themselves with the aid of few slaves . Between the upper and the lower country there was a waste region of sandy hills and rocky acclivities , uninhabited , almost uninhabitable , which rendered the two sections of one Province separate communities scarcely known to one another . Down almost to the beginning of the Revolutionary war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Legislature of South Carolina , though they were then as numerous as the planters of the lower country . // Between the people of the two sections there was little unity of feeling . The lordly planters of the lower country regarded their Western fellow-citizens as provincial or plebeian ; the farmers of the upper country had some contempt for the planters as effeminate , aristocratic , and Tory . The Revolution abased the pride , lessened the wealth , and improved the politics of the planters ; a revised Constitution , in 1790 , gave preponderance to the up-country farmers in the popular branch of the Legislature ; and thenceforth South Carolina was a sufficiently homogeneous commonwealth . Looking merely to the public career of Calhoun , the special pleader of the Southern aristocracy , we should expect to find him born and reared among the planters of the low country . The Calhouns , on the contrary , were up-country people , farmers , Whigs , Presbyterians , men of moderate means , who wielded the axe and held the plough with their own hands , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap and savage called new , because fresh from Africa . A family party of them ( parents , four sons , and a daughter ) emigrated from the North of Ireland early in the last century , and settled first in Penn* sylvania ; then removed to Western Virginia ; whence the defeat of Braddock , in 1755 , drove them southward , and they found a permanent abode in the extreme west of South Carolina , then an unbroken wilderness . Of those four sons , Patrick Calhoun , the father of the Nullifier , was the youngest . He was six years old when the family left Ireland ; twenty-nine , when they planted the " Calhoun Settlement " in Abbeville District , South Carolina . Patrick Calhoun was a strong-headed , wrong-headed , very brave , honest , ignorant man . His whole life , almost , was a battle . When the Calhouns had been but five years in their forest home , the Cherokees attacked the settlement , destroyed it utterly , killed one half the men , and drove the rest to the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 17G3 . Patrick Calhoun was elected to command the mounted rangers raised to protect the frontiers , a duty most heroically performed by him . After the peace , the settlement enjoyed thirteen or fourteen years of tranquillity , during which Patrick Calhoun was married to Martha Caldwell , a native of Virghila , // but the daughter of an Irish Presbyterian emigrant . During this peaceful interval , all the family prospered with the settlement which bore its name ; and Patrick , who in his childhood had only learned to read and write , availed himself of such leisure as he had to increase his knowledge . Besides reading the books within his reach , which were few , he learned to survey land , and practised that vocation to advantage . He was especially fond of reading history to gather new proofs of the soundness of his political opinions , which were Whig to the uttermost . The war of the Revolution broke in upon the settlement , at length , and made deadly havoc there ; for it was warred upon by three foes at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cherokees . The Tories murdered in cold blood a brother of Patrick Calhoun 's wife . Another of her brothers fell at Cowpens under thirty sabre-wounds . Another was taken prisoner , and remained for nine months in close confinement at one of the British Andersonvilles of that day . Patrick Calhoun , in many a desperate encounter with the Indians , displayed singular coolness , courage , adroitness , and tenacity . On one memorable occasion , thirteen of his neighbors and himself maintained a forest fight for several hours with a force of Cherokees ten times their number . When seven of the white men had fallen , the rest made their escape . Returning three days after to bury their dead , they found upon the field the bodies of twenty-three Indian warriors . At another time , as his son used to relate , he had a very long combat with a chief noted for the certainty of his aim , - the Indian behind a tree , the white man behind a fallen log . Four times the wily Calhoun drew the Indian 's fire by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last , could not refrain from looking to see the effect of his shot ; when one of his shoulders was slightly exposed . On the instant , the white man 's rifle sent a ball through it ; the chief fled into the forest , and Patrick Calhoun bore off as a trophy of the fight his own hat pierced with four bullets . This Patrick Calhoun illustrates well the North-of-Ireland character ; one peculiarity of which is the possession of will disproportioned to intellect . Hence a man of this race frequently appears to striking advantage in scenes which demand // chiefly an exercise of will ; while in other spheres , which make larger demands upon the understanding , the same man may be simply mischievous . We see this in the case of Andrew Jackson , who at New Orleans was glorious ; at Washington , almost wholly pernicious . For these Scotch-Irishmen , though they are usually very honest men , and often right in their opinions , are an uninstructable race , who stick to a prejudice as tenaciously as to a principle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when they are only wreaking a private vengeance or aiming at a personal advantage . Patrick Calhoun was the most radical of Democrats ; one of your despisers of conventionality ; an enemy of lawyers , thinking the common sense of mankind competent to decide what is right without their aid ; a particular opponent of the arrogant pretensions of the low-country aristocrats . When the up-country people began to claitn a voice in the government , long since due to their numbers , the planters , of course , opposed their demand . To establish their right to vote , Patrick Calhoun and a party of his neighbors , armed with rifles , marched across the State to within twenty-three miles of Charleston , and there voted in defiance of the plantation lords . Events like this led to the admission of members from the up-country ; and Patrick Calhoun was the first to represent that section in the Legislature . It was entirely characteristic of him to vote against the adoption of the Federal Constitution , on the ground that it authorized other people to tax Carolinians ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like a narrow , cranky , opinionative , unmanageable Calhoun . Devoid of imagination and of humor , a hard-hea4ed , eager politician , he brought up his boy upon politics . This was sorry nourishment for a child 's mind , but he had little else to give him . Gambling , hunting , whiskey , and politics were all there was to relieve the monotony of life in a Southern back settlement ; and the best men naturally threw themselves upon politics . Calhoun told Miss Martineau that he could remember standing between his father 's knees , when he was only five years old , and listening to political conversation . He told Duff Green that he had a distinct recollection of hearing his father say , when he was only nine , that that government is best which // allows to each individual the largest liberty compatible with order and tranquillity , and that improvements in political science consist in throwing off needless restraints . It was a strange child that could remember such a remark . As Patrick Calhoun died in 1795 , when his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been very young when he heard it , even if he were mistaken as to the time . Whether Patrick Calhoun ever touched upon the subject of slavery in his conversations with his children , is not reported . We only know that , late in the career of Mr. Calhoun , he used to be taunted by his opponents in South Carolina with having once held that slavery was good and justifiable only so far as it was preparatory to freedom . He was accused of having committed the crime of saying , in a public speech , that slavery was like the " scaffolding " of an edifice , which , after having served its temporary purpose , would be taken down , of course . We presume he said this ; because everything in his later speeches is flatly contradicted in those of his earlier public life . Patrick Calhoun was a man to give a reason for everything . He was an habitual theorizer and generalizei ' , without possessing a hundredth part of the knowledge requisite for safe generalization . It is very probable that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inheritance . John Caldwell Calhoun - born in 1782 , the youngest but one in a family of five children - was eighteen years old before he had a thought of being anything but a farmer . His father had been dead five years . His only sister was married to that famous Mr. Waddell , clergyman and schoolmaster , whose academy in North Carolina was for so many years a great light in a dark place . One of his brothers was a clerk in a mercantile house at Charleston ; another was settled on a farm near by ; another was still a boy . His mother lived upon the paternal farm ; and with her lived her son John , who ploughed , hunted , fished , and rode , in the manner of the farmers ' sons *in that country . At eighteen he could read , write , and cipher ; he had read Rollin , Robertson , Voltaire 's Charles XII. , Brown 's Essays , Captain Cook , and parts of Locke . This , according to his own account , was the sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father 's decided republican opinions . // He shared to some degree his father 's prejudice , and the general prejudice of the upper country , against lawyers ; although a cousin , John Ewing Calhoun , had risen high in that profession , had long served in the Legislature of South Carolina , and was about to be elected United States Senator on the Jeffersonian side . As late as May , 1800 , when he was past eighteen , preference and necessity appeared to fix him in the vocation of farmer . The family had never been rich . Indeed , the great Nullifier himself was a comparatively poor man all his life , the number of his slaves never much exceeding thirty ; which is equivalent to a working force of fifteen hands or less . In May , 1800 , Calhoun 's elder brother came home from Charleston to spend the summer , bringing with him his city notions . He awoke the dormant ambition of the youth , urged him to go to school and become a professional man . But how could he leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money be raised to pay for a seven years ' education ? His mother and his brother conferred upon these points , and satisfied him upon both ; and in June , 1800 , he made his way to the academy of his brother-in-law , Waddell , which was then in Columbia County , Georgia , fifty miles from the home of the Calbouns . In two years and a quarter from the day he first opened a Latin grammar , he entered the Junior Class of Yale College . This was quick work . Teachers , however , are aware that late beginners , who have spent their boyhood in growing , often stride past students who have passed theirs in stunting the growth of mind and body at school . Calhoun , late in life , often spoke of the immense advantage which Southern boys had over Northern in not going so early to school , and being so much on horseback and out of doors . He said one day , about the year 1845 : " At the North you overvalue intellect ; at the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a collision that shall test the strength of the two sections , you will find that character is stronger than intellect , and will carry the day . " The prophecy has been fulfilled . Timothy Dwight , Calvinist and Federalist , was President of Yale College during Calhoun 's residence there , and Thomas Jefferson , Democrat and freethinker , was President of the United States . Yale was a stronghold of Federalism . A // brother of the President of the College , in his Fourth-of-July oration delivered at New Haven four months after the inauguration of Jefferson and Burr , announced to the students and citizens , that " the great object " of those gentlemen and their adherents was " to destroy every trace of civilization in the world , and to force mankind back into a savage state . " He also used the following language " We have now reached the consummation of democratic blessedness . We have a country governed by blockheads and knaves ; the ties of marriage , with all its felicities , are severed and destroyed ; our wives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast into the world from the breast forgotten ; filial piety is extinguished ; and our surnames , the only mark of distinction among families , are abolished . Can the imagination paint anything more dreadful this side hell ? " These remarkable statements , so far from surprising the virtuous people of New Haven , were accepted by them , it appears , as facts , and published with general approval . From what we know of President Dwight , we may conclude that he would regard his brother 's oration as a pardonable flight of hyperbole , based on truth . He was a Federalist of the deepest dye . Transferred to a scene where such opinions prevailed , it cost the young republican no great exertion either of his intellect or his firmness or his family pride to hold his ground . Of all known men , he had the most complete confidence in the infallibility of his own mind . He used to relate , that in the Senior year , when he was one of very few in a class of seventy who maintained republican opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimate source of power ? " " The people , " answered the student . Dr. Dwight combated this opinion ; Calhoun replied ; and the whole hour of recitation was consumed in the debate . Dr. Dwight was so much struck with the ability displayed by the student , that he remarked to a friend that Calhoun had talent enough to be President of the United States , and that we should see him President in due time . In those innocent days , an observation of that nature was made of every you1*g fellow who showed a little spirit and a turn for debate . Fathers did not then say to their promising offspring , Beware , my son , of self-seeking and shallow speaking , // lest you should be consigned to the White House , and be devoured by office-seekers . People then regarded the Presidency as a kind of reward of merit , the first step toward which was to get " up head " in the spelling-class . There is reason to believe that young Calhoun took the prediction of the Doctor very seriously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his life . He was totally destitute of the sense of humor . It is doubtful if he was ever capable of unbending so far as to play a game of football . The ardent political discussions then in vogue had one effect which the late Mr. Buckle would have pronounced most salutary ; they prevented Dr. Dwight 's severe theology from taking hold of the minds of many students . . Calhoun wholly escaped it . In his speeches we find , of course , the stock allusions of a religious nature with which all politicians essay to flatter their constituents ; hut he was never interested in matters theological . A century earlier , he might have been the Jonathan Edwards of the South , if there had been a South then . His was just the mind to have revelled in theological subtilties , and to have calmly , closely , unrelentingly argued nearly the whole human race into endless and hopeless perdition . His was just the nature to have contemplated his argument with complacency , and its consequences without emotion . Graduating with credit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Litchfield in Connecticut , where he remained a year and a half , and won general esteem . Traditiou reports him a diligent student and an admirable debater there . As to his moral conduct , that was always irreproachable . That is to say , he was at every period of his life continent , temperate , orderly , and out of debt . In 1806 , being then twenty-four years of age , he returned to South Carolina , and , after studying . a short time in a law-office at Charleston , lie went at last to his native Abbeville to complete his preparation for the bar . He was still a law student at that place when the event occurred which called him into public life . June 22d , 1807 ' , at noon , the United States frigate Chesapeake , thirty-eight guns , left her anchorage at Hampton Roads , and put to sea , bound for the Mediterraiiean . The United States being at peace with all the world , the Chesapeake was // very far from being in proper man-of-war trim . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cables , and animals . The guns were loaded , but rammers , matches , wadding , cannon-balls , were all out of place , and not immediately accessible . The crew were merchant sailors and landsmen , all undrilled in the duties peculiar to an armed ship . There had been lying for some time at the same anchorage the British frigate Leopard , fifty guns ; and this ship also put to sea at noon of the same day . The Leopard being in perfect order , and manned by a veteran crew , took the lead of the Chesapeake , and kept it until three in the afternoon , when she was a mile in advance . Then she wore round , came within speaking distance , lowered a boat , and sent a lieutenant on board the American ship . This officer bore a despatch from the admiral of the station , ordering any captain who should fall in with the Chesapeake to search her for deserters . The American coinmander replied that he knew of no deserters on board his ship , and could not permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . The lieutenant returned . As soon as he had got on board , and his boat was stowed away , the Leopard fired a full broadside into the American frigate . The Amen can commodore , being totally unprepared for such an event , could not return the fire ; and therefore , when his ship had received twenty-one shot in her hull , when her rigging was much cut up , when three of her crew were killed and eighteen wounded , the commodore himself among the latter , he had no choice but to lower his flag . Then the search was made , and four men , claimed as deserters , were taken ; after which the Leopard continued her course , and the crippled Chesapeake returned to Hampton Roads . The American commander was sentenced by a court-martial to five , years ' suspension for going to sea in such a condition . The English government recalled the admiral who ordered , and deprived of his ship the captain who committed , this unparalleled outrage , but made no other reparation . No words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which this event excited in the people of the United States . For a time , the Federalists themselves were ready for war . There were meetings everywhere to denounce it , and especially // in the Southern States , always more disposed than the Northem to begin the shedding of blood , and already the main reliance of the Republican party . Remote and rnstic Abbeville , a very Republican district , was not silent on this occasion ; and who so proper to draw and support the denunciatory resolutions as young Calhoun , the son of valiant Patrick , fresh from college , though now in his twenty-sixth year ? The student performed this duty , as requested , and spoke so well that his neighbors at once concluded that he was the very man , lawyer as he was , to represent them in the Legislature , where for nearly thirty years his father had served them . At the next election , in a district noted for its aversion to lawyers , wherein no lawyer had ever been chosen to the Legislature , though many had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket . His triumph was doubtless owing in a great degree to the paramount influence of his family . Still , even we , who knew him only in his gaunt and sad decline , can easily imagine that at twenty-six he must have been an engaging , attractive man . Like most of his race , he was rather slender , but very erect , with a good deal of dignity and some grace in his carriage and demeanor . His eyes were always remarkably fine and brilliant . He had a well-developed and strongly set nose , cheek-bones high , and cheeks rather sunken . His mouth was large , and could never have been a comely feature . His early portraits show his hair erect on his forehead , as we all remember it , unlike Jackson , whose hair at forty still fell low over his forehead . His voice could never have been melodious , but it was always powerful . At every period of his life , his manners , when in company with his inferiors in age or standing , were extremely.a*reeable , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began life as a " page " in the Senate-cham* her , say that there was no Senator whom the pages took such delight in serving as Mr. Calhoun . " Why ? " - " Because he was so democratic . " - " How democratic ? " - " He was as polite to a page as to the President of the Senate , and as considerate of his feelings . " We have heard another member of the press , whose first employment was to report the speeches of Clay , Webster , and Calhoun , bear similar testimony to the frank , engaging courtesy of his intercourse with the corps of reporters . // 1865 . John C* . Calhoun . It is fair , therefore , to conclude that his early popularity at home was due as much to his character and manners as to his father 's name and the influence of his relatives . He served two years in the Legislature , and in the intervals between the sessions practised law at Abbeville . At once he took a leading position in the Legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days when the Republican members , as the custom then was , met in caucus to nominate a President and VicePresident of the United States . For Mr. Madison the caucus was unanimous , but there was a difference with regard to the Vice-Presidency , then filled by the aged George Clinton of New York , who represented the anti-Virginian wing of the party in power . Mr. Calhoun , in a set speech , opposed the renomination of Governor Clinton , on the ground that in the imminency of a war with England the Republican party ought to present an unbroken front . I-Ic suggested the nomination of John Langdon of New Hampshire for the second office . At this late day we can not determine whether this suggestion was original with Mr. Calhoun . We only know that the caucus affirmed it , and that the nomination was afterwards tendered to Mr. Langdon by the Republican party , and declined by him . Mr. Calhoun 's speech on this occasion was the expression of Southern opinions as to the foreign policy of the country . The South was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still favored Mr. Jefferson 's non-intercourse policy . In this instance , as in so many others , we find the Slave States , which used to plume themselves upon being the conservative element in an else unrestrainable democracy , ready for war first , though far from being the worst sufferers from England 's piracies . We should have had no war from 1782 to 1865 , but for them . We also find Mr. Calhoun , in this his first utterance as a public man , the mouth-piece of his " section . " He has been styled the most inconsistent of our statesmen ; but 1*eneath the palpable contradictions of his speeches , there is to be noticed a deeper consistency . Whatever opinion , whatever policy , he may have advocated , he always spoke the sense of what Mr. Sumner used to call the Southern oligarchy . If it changed , he changed . If he appeared sometimes to lead it , it was by bending it in the direction in which // it wanted to go . He was doubtless as sincere in this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his powers are enlisted . Calhoun 's mind was narrow and provincial . He could not have been the citizen of a large place . As a statesman he was naturally the advocate of something special and sectional , something not the whole . Distinguished in the Legislature , he was elected , late in 1810 , by a very great majority , to represent his district in Congress . Tn May , 1811 , he was married to a second-cousin , Floride Calhoun , who brought a considerable accession to his slender estate . November 4th , 1811 , he took his seat in the House of Representatives . Thus , at the early age of twenty-nine , he was fairly launched into public life , with the advantage , usually enjoyed then by Southern members , of being independent in his circumstances . Though unknown to the country , his fame had preceded him to Washington ; and the Speaker , Mr. Clay , gave him a place on the Committee on Foreign Relations . This Committee , considering that Congress had been summoned a month earlier than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was at once the most important and the most conspicuous committee of the House . Mr. Calhoun 's first session gave him national reputation , and made him a leader of the war party in Congress . We could perhaps say the leader , since Mr. Clay was not upon the floor . After surveying the novel scene around him for six weeks , he delivered his maiden speech , - a plain , forcible , not extraordinary argument in favor of preparing for war . It was prodigioudy successful , so far as the reputation of the speaker was concerned . Members gathered round to congratulate the young orator ; and Father Ritchie ( if he was a father then ) " hailed this young Carolinian as one of the master spirits who stamp their names upon the age in which they live . " This speech contains one passage which savors of the " chivalric " taint , and indicates the provincial mind . In replying to the objection founded on the expenses of a war , he said : " I enter my solemn protest against this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is only fit for shops and counting-houses , and ought not to disgrace the seat of power by its squalid aspect . Whenever it touches sovereign // power , the nation is ruined . It is too short-sighted to defend itself . It is a compromising spirit , always ready to yield a part to save the residue . It is too timid to have in itself the laws of self-preservation . Sovereign power is i*ever safe but under the shield of honor . " This was thought very tine talk in those simple days among the simple Southern country members . As the session progressed , Mr. Calhoun spoke frequently , and with greater effect . Wisely he never spoke . In his best efforts we see that something which we know not what to name , unless we call it Soutliernism . If it were allowable to use in this dignified periodical a slang expression , we should style the passages to which we refer effective bosh . The most telling passage in the most telling speech which he delivered at this session may serve to illustrate our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great rapidity , in a loud , harsh voice , and with energy the most intense : - " Tie down a hero , and he feels the puncture of a pin : throw him into battle , and he is almost insensible to vital gashes . So in war . Impelled alternately by hope and fear , stimulated by revenge , depressed by shame , or elevated by victory , the people become invincible . No privation can shake their fortitude ; no calamity break their spirit . Even when equally successful , the contrast between the two systems is striking . War and restriction may leave the country equally exhausted ; but the latter not only leaves you poor , but , even when successful , dispirited , divided , discontented , with diminished patriotism , and the morals of a considerable portion of your people corrupted . Not so in war . In that state , the common danger unites all , strengthens the bonds of society , and feeds the flame of ' patriotism . The national character mounts to energy . In exchange for the expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill , and a more perfect organization of such parts of your administration as are connected with the science of national defence . Sir , are these advantages to be counted as trifles in the present state of the world ? Can they be measured by moneyed valuation ? I would prefer a single victory over the enemy , by sea or land , to all the good we shall ever derive from the continuation of the Non-importation Act . I know not that a victory would produce an equal pressure on the enemy ; but I am certain of what is of greater consequence , it would be accompanied by more salutary effects to ourselves . The memory of Saratoga , Princeton , // and Eutaw is immortal . It is there you will find the country 's boast and pride , - the inexhaustible source of great and heroic sentiments . But what will history say of restriction ? What examples worthy of imitation will it furnish to posterity ? What pride , what pleasure , will our children find in the events of such times ? Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught to rely as its courage , its fortitude , its skill and virtue , for protection . These are the only safeguards in the hour of danger . Man was endued with these great qualities for his defence . There is nothing about him that indicates that he is to conquer by endurance . He is not incrusted in a shell ; he is not taught to rely upoa his insensibility , his passive suffering , for defence . No , sir ; it is on the invincible mind , on a magnanimous nature , he ought to rely . Here is the superiority of our kind ; it * is these that render man the lord of the world . Nations rise above nations , as they are endued in a greater degree with these brilliant qualities . " This passage is perfectly characteristic of Calhoun , whose speeches present hundreds of such inextricable blendings of truth and falsehood . We have the written testimony of an honorable man , stifl living , Commodore Charles Stewart , U. S. N. , that John C. Calhoun was a conscious traitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that year , Captain Stewart 's ship , the Constitution , was refitting at the Washington Navy Yard , and the Captain was boarding at Mrs. Bushby 's , with Mr. Clay , Mr. Calhoun , and many other Republican members . Conversing one evening with the new member from South Carolina , he told him that he was " puzzled " to account for the close alliance which existed between the Southern planters and the Northern Democracy . " You , " said Captain Stewart , " in the South and Southwest , are decidedly the aristocratic portion of this Union ; you are so in holding persons in perpetuity in slavery ; you are so in every domestic quality , so in every habit in your lives , living , and actions , so in habits , customs , intercourse , and manners ; you neither work with your hands , heads , nor any machinery , but live and have your living , not in accordance with the will of your Creator , but by the sweat of slavery , and yet you assume all the attributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calhoun , aged thirty , replied thus to Captain Stewart , aged thirty-four : - // " I see you speak through the head of a young statesman , and from the heart of a patriot , but you lose sight of the politician and the sectional policy of the people . I admit your conclusions in respect to ns Southrons . That we are essentially aristocratic , I can not deny ; but we can and do yield much to democracy . This is our sectional policy ; we are from necessity thrown upon and solemnly wedded to that party , however it may occasionally clash with our feelings , for the conservatioa of our interests . It is through our affiliation with that party in the Middle and Western States that we hold power ; but when we cease thus to control this nation through a disjointed democracy , or any material ohstacle in that party which shall tend to throw us out of that rule and control , we shall then resort to the dissolution of the Union . The compromises in the Constitution , under the circumstance* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the altered condition of our country from that period , leave to the South no resource but dissolution ; for no amendments to the Constitution could he reached through a convention of the people under their three-fourths rule . " Probably all of our readers have seen this conversation in print before . But it is well for us to consider it again and again . It is the key to all the seeming inconsistencies of Mr. Calhoun 's career . He came up to Congress , and took the oath to support the Constitution , secretly resolved to break up the country just as soon as the Southern planters ceased to control it for the maintenance of their peculiar interest . The reader will note , too , the distinction made by this young man , who was never youthful , between the " statesman " and the " politician , " and between the " heart of a patriot " and " the sectional policy of the people . " Turning from this loathsome and despicable exposition to the Congressional career of Mr. Calhoun , we find no indication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very active , energetic member of the Republican party ; supporting the war by assiduous labors in committee , and by intense declamation of the kind of which we have given a specimen . In all his speeches there is not a touch of greatness . He declared that Demosthenes was his model , - an orator who was a master of all the arts , all the artifices , and all the tricks by which a mass of ignorant and turbulent hearers can be kept attentive , but who has nothing to impart to a member of Congress who honestly desires to convince his equals . Mr. Calhoun 's harangues in // the supposed Demosthenean style gave him , however , great reputation out of doors , while his diligence , his dignified and courteous manners , gained him warm admirers on the floor . He was a messmate of Mr. Clay at this time . Besides agreeing in politics , they were on terms of cordial personal intimacy . Henry Clay , Speaker of the House , was but five years older than Calhoun , and in everything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men with pride and hope , congratulating each other that , though the Revolutionary statesmen were growing old and passing away , the high places of the Republic would be filled , in due time , by men worthy to succeed them . When the war was over , a strange thing was to be noted in the politics of the United States : the Federal party was dead , but the Republican party had adopted its opinions . The disasters of the war had convinced almost every man of the necessity of investing the government with the power to wield the resources of the country more readily ; and , accordingly , we find leading Republicans , like Judge Story , John Quincy Adams , and Mr. Clay , favoring the measures which had formerly been the special rallying-cries of the Federalists . Judge Story spoke the feeling of his party when lie wrote , in 1815 : " Let us extend the national authority over the whole extent of power given by the Constitution . Let us have great military and naval schools , an adequate regular army , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national bank , a national bankrupt act , " etc. , etc . The strict-constructionists were almost silenced in the general cry , " Let us be a Nation . " In the support of all the measures to which this feeling gave rise , especially the national bank , internal improvements , and a protective tariff , Mr. Calhoun went , as far as any man , and farther than most ; for such at that time was the humor of the planters . To the principle of a protective tariff he was peculiarly committed . It had not been his intention to take part in the debates on the Tariff Bill of 1816 . On the 6th of April , while he was busy writing in a committee-room , Mr. Samuel D. Ingham of Pennsylvania , his particular friend and political ally , came to him and said that the House had fallen into some confusion // while discussing the tariff bill , and added , that , as it was " difficult to rally so large a body when once broken on a tax bill , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the House together . " What can I say ? " replied the member from South Carolina . Mr. lugham , however , persisted , and Mr. Calhoun addressed the House . An amendment had just been introduced to leave cotton goods unprotected , a proposition which had been urged on the ground that Congress had no authority to impose any duty except for reveiiue . On rising to speak , Mr. Calhoun at once , and most unequivocally , committed himself to the protective principle . He began by saying , that , if the right to protect had not been called in question , he would not have spoken at all . It was solely to assist in establishing that right that he had been induced , without previous preparation , to take part in the debate . He then proceeded to deliver an ordinary protectionist speech ; without , however , entering upon the question of constitutional right . He merely dwelt upon the great benefits to be derived from effording to our infant manufactures " immediate and ample protection . " That the Constitution interposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded by observing , that a flourishing manufacturing interest would " bind together more closely our widely-spread republic , " since " it will greatly increase our mutual dependence and intercourse , and excite an increased attention to internal improvements , - a subject every way so intimately connected with the ultimate attainment of national strength and the perfection of our political institutions . " He further observed , that " the liberty and union of this country are inseparable , " and that the destruction of either would involve the destruction of the other . He concluded his speech with these words " Disunion , - this single word comprehends almost the sum of our political dangers , and against it we ought to be perpetually guarded . " The time has passed for any public man to claim credit for " consistency . " A person who , after forty years of public life , can truly say that he has never changed an opinion , must be either a demigod or a fool . We do not blame Mr. Calhoun for ceasing to be a protectionist and becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides on that question // during the last thirty years . A. growing mind must necessarily change its opinions . But there is a consistency from which no man , public or private , can ever be absolved , - the consistency of his statements with fact . In the year 1833 , in his speech on the Force Bill ,  --  Mr. Calhoun referred to his tariff speech of 1826 in a manner which excludes him from the ranks of men of honor . He had the astonishing audacity to say : " I am constrained in candor to acknowledge , for I wish to disguise nothing , that the protective principle was recognized by the Act of 1826 . How this was overlooked at the time , it is not in my power to say . It escaped my observation , which I can account for only on the ground that the principle was new , and that my attention was engaged by another important subject . " The charitable reader may interpose here , and say that Mr. Calhoun may have forgotten his speech of 1816 . Alas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . Vigilant opponents had unearthed it , and kindly presented a copy to the author . We do not believe that , in all the debates of the American Congress , there is another instance of fiat falsehood as bad as this . It happens that the speech of 1816 and that of 1833 are both published in the same volume of the Works of Mr. Calhoun ( Vol . II . pp. 163 and 197 ) . We advise our readers who have the time and opportunity to read both , if they wish to sh*e how a false position necessitates a false tongue . Those who take our advice will also discover why it was that Mr. Calhoun dared to utter such an impudent falsehood : his speeches are such appallingly dull reading , that there was very little risk of a busy people 's comparing the interpretation with the text . It was John C. Calhoun who , later in the same session , introduced the bill for setting apart the dividends and bonus of the United States Bank as a permanent fund for internal improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengths in favor of the internal improvement system , presents some amusing contrasts with his later speeches on the same subject . His hearers of 1835 to 1850 must have smiled on reading in the speech of 1817 such sentences as these : - " I am no advocate for refined arguments on the Constitution . The instrument was not intended as a thesis for the logician to exercise his // ingenuity on . It ought to be construed with plain good-sense . " " If we are restricted in the use of our money to the enumerated *5owers , on what principle can the purchase of Louisiana be justified ? " " The uniform sense of Congress and the country furnishes better evidence of the true interpretation of the Constitution than the most refined and subtle arguments . " Mark this , too - " In a country so extensive and so various in its interests , what is necessary for the common interest may apparently be opposed to the interest of particular sections . It must be submitted to as the condition of our greatness . " Well might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We may reasonably raise our eyes to a most splendid future , if we only act in a manner worthy of our advantages . If however , neglecting them , we permit a low , sordid , selfish , sectional spirit to take possession of this House , this happy scene will vanish . We will divide ; and , in its consequences , will follow misery and despotism . " With this spccch before him and before the country , Mr. Calhoun had not thc candor to avow , in later years , a complete change of opinion . He could only go so far as to say , when opposing the purchase of the Madison Papers h*1837 , that , " at his entrance upon public life , he had inclined to that interpretation of the Constitution which favored a latitude of powers . " Inclined ! He was a most enthusiastic and thorough-going champion of that interpretation . His scheme of internal improvements embraced a network of post-roads and canals from " Maine to Louisiana , " and a system of harbors for lake and ocean . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination conjured up , of the whole country rendcred accessible , and of the distant farmer selling his produce at a price not seriously less than that which it brought on the coast . On this subject he becatne animated , interesting , almost eloquent . And , so far from this advocacy being confined to the period of his " entrance upon political life , " he coiitinned to be its very warmest exponent as late as 1819 , when lie had been ten years in public life . In that year , having to report upon the condition of military roads and fortifications , his flaming zeal for a grand and general system of roads and canals frequently bursts // the bounds of the subject he had to treat . He tells Congress that the internal improvements which are best for peace are best for war also ; and expatiates again upon his dazzling dream of " connecting Louisiana by a durable and well-finished road with Maine , and Boston with Savannah by a well-established line of internal navigation . " The United States , lie said , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its treble line of sea-coast , its valleys large enough for empires , was " a world of itself , " and needed nothing but to be rendered accessible . From what we know of the way things are managed in Congress , we should guess that he was invited to make this report for the very purpose of affording to the foremost champion of internal improvements an opportunity of lending a helping hand to pending bills . Mr. Calhoun served six years in the House of ilepresentatives , and grew in the esteem of Congress and the country at every session . As it is pleasing to see an old man at the theatre entering into the merriment of the play , since it shows that his heart has triumphed over the cares of life , and he has preserved a little of his youth , so is it eminently graceful in a young man to have something of the seriousness of age , especially when his conijict is even more austere than his demeanor . Mr. Clay at this time was addicted to gaming , like most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averse to the bottle . Mr. Webster was reckless in expenditure , fond of his ease , and loved a joke better than an argument . In the seclusion of Washington , many members lived a very gay , rollicking life . Mr. Calhounnever gambled , never drank to excess , never jested , never quarrelled , cared nothing for his ease , and tempered the gravity of his demeanor by an admirable and winning courtesy . A deep and serious ambition impelled and restrained him . Like boys at school , Clay and Webster were eager enough to get to the head of the class , but they did not brood over it all the time , and never feel comfortable unless they were conning their spelling-book ; while little Calhoun expended all his soul in the business , and had no time or heart left for play . Consequently he advanced rapidly for one of his size , and was universally pointed at as the model scholar . Accidents , too , generally favor a rising man . Mr. Calhoun made an extremely // 1865 . JoI*n C. Cal7*oun. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion of his sagacity . In opposing an ill-digested scheme for a national bank , he told the House that the bill was so obviously defective and unwise , that , if news of peace should arrive that day , it would not receive fifteen votes . News of peace , which was totally unexpected , did arrive that very hour , and the bill was rejected the next day by about the majority which he had predicted . At the next session , he won an immense reputation for firmness . An act was passed changing the mode of compensating members of Congress from six dollars a day to fifteen hundred dollars a year . We were a nation of rustics then ; and this harmless measure excited a disgust in the popular mind so intense and general , that most of the members who had voted for it declined to present themselves for re-election . Calhoun was one of the guilty ones . Popular as he was in his district , supported by two powerful family connections , - his own and his wife 's , - admired throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the auspicious scene of Congressional debate , - even he was threatened with defeat . Formidable candidates presented themselves . In these circumstances he mounted the stump , boldly justified his vote , and defended the odious bill . He was handsomely re-elected , and when the bill was up for repeal in the House he again supported it with all his former energy . At the conclusion of his speech , a member from New York , Mr. Grosvenor , a political opponent , with whom Calhoun had not been on speaking terms for two years , sprang to his feet , enraptured , and began to express his approval of the speech in ordinary parliamentary language . But his feelings could not be relieved in that manner . He paused a moment , and then said : - " Mr. Speaker , I will not be restrained . No barrier shall exist which I will not leap over for the purpose of offering to that gentleman my thanks for the judieious , independent , and national course which he has pursued in this House for the last two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let the honorable gentleman co tinue with the same manly independence , aloof from party views and local prejudices , to pursue the great interests of his country , and fulfil the high destiny for which it is manifest be was born . The buzz of popular applause may not cheer him on his way , but he will inevitably arrive at a high and happy elevation in the view of his country and the world . " // Such scenes as this enhance the prestige of a rising man . Members weak at home envied at once and admired a man who was strong enough to bring over his constituents to his opinion . He was fortunate , too , in this , that a triumph so striking occurred just before he left the House for another sphere of public life . He had what the actors call a splendid exit . The inauguration of Mr. Monroe on the 4th of March , 1817 , ushered in the era of good feeling , and gave to Henry Clay the first of his long series of disappointuients . As Secretaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the appointment of Mr. Adams to that office by Mr. Monroe was regarded almost in the light of a nomination to the succession . To add to Mr. Clay 's mortification , he was tendered the post of Secretary of War , which he had declined a year before , and now again declined . The President next selected General Jackson , then in the undimmed lustre of his military renown , and still holding his Major-General 's commission . He received , however , a private notification that General Jackson would not accept a place in the Cabinet . The President then offered the post to the aged Governor Isaac Shelby of Kentucky , who had the good sense to decline it . There appear to have been negotiations with other individuals , but at length , in October , 1817 , the place was offered to Mr. Calhoun , who , after much hesitation , accepted it , and entered upon the discharge of its duties in December . His friends , we are told , unanimously disapproved his going into office , as they believed him formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . Fortune favored him again . Entering the office after a long vacancy , and when it was filled with the unfinished business of the war , - fifty million dollars of deferred claims , for one item , - he had the same easy opportunity for distinction which a steward has who takes charge of an estate just out of cliancery , and under a new proprietor who has plenty of money . The sweeping up of the dead leaves , the gathering of the fallen branches , and the weeding out of the paths , changes he aspect of the place , and gives the passer-by a prodigious idea of the efficiency of the new broom . The country was alive , // too , to the necessity of coast and frontier defences , and there was much building of forts during the seven years of Mr. Calhoun 's tenure of place . Respecting the manner in which he discharged the multifarious and unusual duties of his office , we have never heard anything but commendation . He was prompt , punctual , diligent , courteous , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation of the War Department remained in force , little changed , until the magnitude of the late contest abolished or suspended all ancient methods . The claims of the soldiers were rapidly examined and passed upon . It was Mr. Calhoun who first endeavored to collect considerable bodies of troops for instruction at one post . He had but six thousand men in all , but he contrived to get together several companies of artillery at Fortress Monroe for drill . He appeared to take much interest in the expenditure of the ten thousand dollars a year which Congress voted for the education of the Indians . He reduced the expenses of his office , which was a very popular thing at that day . He never appointed nor removed a clerk for opinion 's sake . In seven years he only removed two clerks , both for cause , and to both were given in writing the reasons of their removal . There was no special merit in this , for at that day to do otherwise would have been deemed infamous . Mr. Calhoun , as a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a national man , and supported the measures of his party without exception . Scarcely a trace of the sectional champion yet appears . In 1819 , he gave a written opinion favoring the cession of Texas in exchange for Florida ; the motive of which was to avoid alarming the North by the prospective increase of Slave States . In later years , Mr. Calhoun , of course , wished to deny this ; and the written opinions of Mr. Monroe 's Cabinet on that question mysteriously disappeared from the archives of the State Department . We have the positive testimony of Mr. John Quincy Adams , that Calbonn , in common with most Southern men of that day , approved the Missouri Compromise of 1820 , and gave a written opinion that it was a constitutional measure . That he was still an enthusiast for internal improvements , we have already inutioned. // The real difficulty of the War Department , however , as of the State Department , during the Monroe administration , was a certain Major-General Andrew Jackson , commanding the Military Department of the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's self-love by ending a disastrous war with a dazzling and most unexpected victory , was something different from the respect which we all now feel for the generals distinguished in the late war . The first honors of the late war are divided among four chieftains , each of whom contributed to the final success at least one victory that was essential to it . But in 1815 , among the military heroes of the war that had just closed General Jackson stood peerless and alone . His success in defending the Southwest , ending in a blaze of glory helow New Orleans , utterly eclipsed all the other achievements of the war , excepting alone the darling triumphs on the ocean and the lakes . The deferential spirit of Mr. Monroe 's letters to the General , and the readiness of every one everywhere to comply with his wishes , show that his popularity , even then , constituted him a power in the Republic . It was said in later times , that " General Jackson 's popularity could stand anything , " and in one sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson was likely to do . Andrew Jackson could never have done a cowardly act , or betrayed a friend , or knowingly violated a trust , or broken his word , or forgotten a debt . He was always so entirely certain that he , Andrew Jackson , was in the right , his conviction on this point was so free from the least quaver of doubt , that he could always convinee other men that he was right , and carry the multitude with him . His honesty , courage , and inflexible resolution , joined to his ignorance , narrowness , intensity , and liability to prejudice , rendered him at once the idol of his countrymen and the plague of all men with whom he had official connection . Drop an Andrew Jackson from the clouds upon any spot of earth inhabited by men , and he will have half a dozeii deadly feuds upon his hands in thirty days . Mr. Calhoun inherited a quarrel with Jackson from George Graham , his pro tempore predecessor in the War Department . This Mr. Graham was the gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despatched by President Jefferson in 1806 to the Western country to look into the mysterious proceedings of Aaron Burr , which led to the explosion of Burr 's scheme . This was enough to secure the bitterest enmity of Jackson , who wholly and always favored Burr 's design of annihilating the Spanish power in North America , and who , as President of the United States , rewarded Burr 's followers , and covertly assisted Houston to carry out part of Burr 's project . Graham had sent orders to Jackson 's subordinates directly , instead of sending them through the chief of the Department . Jackson , after due remonstrance , ordered his officers not to obey any orders but such as were communicated by or through himself . This was a high-handed measure ; but Mr. Calhoun , on coming into power , passed it by without notice , and conceded the substance of Jackson 's demand , - as he ought . This was so exquisitely pleasing to General Jackson , that he was well affected by it for many years towards Mr. Calhoun . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who stood so high in Jackson 's regard as the Secretary of War . The Florida war followed in 1818 . When the report of General Jackson 's invasion of Florida , and of the execution of Arbuthuot and Armbrister reached Washington , Mr. Calhomi was the only man in the Cabinet who expressed the opinion that General Jackson had transcended his powers , and ought to be brought before a court of inquiry . This opinion he supported with ardoi* , until it was overruled by the President , who was chiefly influenced by Mr. Adams , the Secretary of State . How keenly General Jackson resented the course of Mr. Calhoun on this occasion , when , eleven years afterwards , he discovered it , is sufficiently well known . We believe , however , that the facts justify Calhoun and condemn Jackson . Just before going to the seat of war , the General wrote privately to the President , strongly recommending the seizure of Florida , and added these words : " This can be done without implicating the government . Let it be signified to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that the possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States , and in sixty days it will be accomplished . " General Jackson dwells , in his " Exposition " of this matter , upon the fact that Mr. Calhoun was the // first man in Washington who read this letter . But he does not say that Mr. Calhoun was aware that Mr. Rhea had been commissioned to answer the letter , and had answered it in accordance with General Jackson 's wishes . And if the Rhea correspondence justified the seizure of Florida , it did not justify the execution of the harmless Scottish trader Arbuthnot , who , so far from " instigating " the war , had exerted the whole of his influence to prevent it . It is an honor to Mr. Calhoun to have been the only man in the Cabinet to call for an inquiry into proceedings which disgraced the United States and came near involving the country in war . We have always felt it to be a blot upon the memory of John Quincy Adams , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Jackson ; and we have not been able to attribute his conduct to anything but the supposed necessities of his position as a candidate for the succession . Readers versed in political history need not be reminded that ' nearly every individual in the Cabinet of Mr. Monroe had hopes of succeeding him . Mr. Adams had , of course ; for he was the premier . Mr. Crawford , of course ; for it had been " arranged " at the lass caucus that he was to follow Mr. Monroe , to whose claims he had deferred on that express condition . Henry Clay , the Speaker of the House of Representatives , and IDe Witt Clinton of New York , had some expectations . All these gentlemen had " claims " which both their party and the public could recognize . Mr. Calhoun , too , who was forty-two years of age in Mr. Monroe 's last year of service , boldly entered the lists ; relying upon the united support of the South and the support of the manufacturing States of the North , led by Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all to hope for success , shows how rapid and how real had been his progress toward a first-rate national position . If our readers will turn to the letters of Webster , Story , Wirt , Adams , Jackson , and others of that circle of distinguished men , they will see many evidences of the extravagant estimation in which he was held in 1824 . They appear to have all seen in him the material for a President , though not yet quite mature for the position . They all deemed him a man of unsullied honor , of devoted patriotism , of perfect sincerity , and of immense // 405 John C. Calhoun. ability , - so assiduously had he played the part of the good boy . How the great popularity of General Jackson was adroitly used by two or three invisible wire-pullers to defeat the aspirations of these too eager candidates , and how from the general wreck of their hopes Mr. Calhoun had the dexterity to emerge Vice-President of the United States , is related , with the amplest detail , in Parton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Calhoun 's position seemed then to combine all the advantages which a politician of forty-three could desire or imagine . By withdrawing his name from the list of candid*tes in such a way as to lead General Jackson to suppose that he had done so in his favor , he seemed to place the General under obligations to him . By secretly manifesting a preference for Mr. Adams ( which he really felt ) when the election devolved upon the House of IRepresentatives , he had gained friends among the adherents of the successful candidate . His withdrawal was accepted by the public as an evidence of modesty becoming the youngest candidate . Finally he was actually Vice-President , as John Adams had been , as Jefferson had been , before their elevation to the highest place . Triac , Henry Clay , as Secretary of State , was in the established line of succession ; but , as time wore on , it became very manifest that the re-election of Mr. Adams , upon which Mr. Clay 's hopes depended , was itself exceedingly doubtful ; and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition . Toward the close of Mr. Adams 's Presidency , the question of real interest in the inner circle of politicians was , not who should succeed John Quincy Adams in 1829 , but who should succeed Andrew Jackson in 1833 ; and already the choice was narrowing to two men , - Martin Van Buren and John C. Calhoun . During Mr. Calhoun 's first term in the Vice-Presidency , - 1825 to 1829 , - a most important change took place in his political position , which controlled all his future career . While he was Secretary of War , - 1817 to 1824 ,  --  he resided with his family in Washington , and shared in the nationalizing influences of the place . When he was elected Vice-President , he removed to a plantation called Fort Hill , in the western part of South Carolina , where he was once more subjected to the // intense and narrow provincialism of the plahting States . And there was nothing in the character or in the acquirements of his mind to counteract that influence . Mr. Calhoun was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his information on all subjects was small in quantity , and second-hand in quality . Nor was he a patient thinker . Any stray fact or notion that he met with in his hasty desultory reading , which chanced to give apparent support to a favorite theory or paradox of his own , he seized upon eagerly , paraded it in triumph , but pondered it little ; while the weightiest facts which controverted his opinion he brushed aside without the slightest consideration . His mind was as arrogant as his manners were courteous . Every one who ever conversed with him must remember his positive , peremptory , unanswerable " Not at all , not at all , " whenever one of his favorite positions was assailed . He was wholly a special pleader ; he never summed up the testimony . We find in his works no evidence that he had read the masters in political economy ; not even Adam Smith , whose reputation was at its height during the first half of his public life . In history he was the merest smatterer , though it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sparta , Athens , and Rome . The slenderness of his fortune prevented his travelling . He never saw Europe ; and if he ever visited the Northern States , after leaving college , we have not discovered any evidence of the fact . The little that lie knew of life was gathered in three places , all of which were of an exceptional and artificial character , - the city of Washington , the up-country of South Carolina , and the luxurious , reactionary city of Charleston . His mind , naturally narrow and intense , became , by revolving always in this narrow sphere and breathing a close and tainted atmosphere , more and more fixed in its narrowness and more intense in its operations . This man , moreover , was consumed by a poor ambition : he lusted after the Presidency . The rapidity of his progress in public life , the high offices he had held , the extravagant cubgiums he had received from colleagues and the press , deceived him as to the real nature of his position before the country , and blinded him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his life lie made a distinct clutch at the bawble , but // never with such prospect of success that any man could discern it but himself and those who used his eyes . It is a satisfaction to know that , of the Presidency seekers , - Clay , Webster , Calhoun , Douglas , Wise , Breckenridge , Tyler , Fillmore , Clinton , Burr , Cass , Buchanan , and Van Buren , - only two won the prize , and those two only by a series of accidents which had little to do with their own exertions . We can almost lay it down as a law of this IRepublic , that no man who makes the Presidency the principal object of his public life will ever be President . The Presidency is an accident , and such it will probably remain . Mr. Vice-President Calhoun found his Carolina discontented in 1824 , when he took up his abode at Fort Hill . Since the Revolution , South Carolina had never been satisfied , and had never bad reason to be . The cotton-gin had appeased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation of the causes which produced the stagnation of the South . Profuse expenditure , nuskilful agriculture , the costliest system of labor in the world , and no immigration , still kept irelandizing the Southern States ; while the North was advancing and improving to such a degree as to attract emigrants from all lands . The contrast was painful to Southern men , and to most of them it was mysterious . Southern politicians came to the conclusion that the cause at once of Northern prosperity and Southern poverty was the protective tariff and the appropriations for internal improvements , but chiefly the tariff . In 1824 , when Mr. Calhoun went home , the tariff on some leading articles had been increased , and the South was in a ferment of opposition to the protective system . If Mr. Calhoun had been a wise and honest man , he would have reminded his friends that the decline of the South had been a subject of remark from the peace of 178.3 , and therefore could not have been caused by the tariff of 1816 , or 1820 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as known in the Southern States , demands virgin lands , - must have , every few years , its cotton-gin , its Louisiana , its Cherokee country , its something , to give new value to its products or new scope for its operations . He might have added that the tariff of 1824 was a grievance , did tend to give premature development to a manufacturing system , and was a // fair ground for a national issue between parties . The thing which lie did was this : he adopted the view of the matter which was predominant in the extreme South , and accepted the leadership of the extreme Southern , anti-tariff strict-constructionist wing of the Democratic party . He echoed the prevailing opinion , that the tariff and the internal improvement system , to both of which he was fully committed , were the sole causes of Southern stagnation ; since by the one their money was taken from them , and by the other it was mostly spent where it did them no good . He was , of course , soon involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disentangle himself . Let us pass to the year 1828 , a most important one in the history of the country and of Mr. Calhoun ; for then occurred the first of the long series of events which terminated with the surrender of the last Rebel army in 1865 . The first act directly tending to a war between the South and the United States bears date December 6th , 1828 ; and it was the act of John C. Calhoun . It was the year of that Presidential election which placed Andrew Jackson in the White House , and re-elected Mr. Calhoun to the Vice-Presidency . It was the year that terminated the honorable part of Mr. Calhoun 's career and began the dishonorable . His political position in the canvass was utterly false , as lie himself afterwards confessed . On the one hand , he was supporting for the Presidency a man committed to the policy of protection ; and on the other , he became the organ and mouthpiece of the Southern party , whose opposition to the protective principle was tending to the point of armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they termed the bill of abominations , had excited the most heated opposition in the cotton States , and especially in South Carolina . This act was passed in the spring of the very year in which those States voted for a man who had publicly indorsed the principle involved in it ; and we see Mr. Calhoun heading the party who were electioneering for Jackson , and the party who were considering the policy of nullifying the act which he had approved . His Presidential aspirations bound him to the support of General Jackson ; but the first , the fundamental necessity of his position was to hold possession of South Carolina . // The burden of Mr. Calhoun 's later speeches was the reconciliation of the last part of his public life with the first . The task was difficult , for there is not a leading proposition in his speeches after 1830 which is not refuted by arguments to be found in his public utterances before 1828 . In his speech on the Force Bill , in 1834 , he volunteered an explanation of the apparent inconsistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his authorship of the " South Carolina Exposition " in the same year . Falsehood and truth are strangely interwoven in almost every sentence of his later writings ; and there is also that vagueness in them which comes of a superfluity of words . He says , that for the strict-constructionist party to have presented a candidate openly and fully identified with their opinions would have been to court defeat ; and thus they were obliged either to abandon the contest , or to select a candidate " whose opinions were intermediate or doubtful on the subject which divided the two sections , " - a candidate " who , at best , was but a choice of evils . " Besides , General Jackson was a Southern man , and it was hoped that , notwithstanding his want of experience , knowledge , and self-control , the advis*rs whom he would invite to assist him would compensate for those defects . Then Mr. Calhoun proceeds to state , that the contest turned chiefly upon the question of protection or free trade ; and the strife was , which of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection . The result was , he says , that the tariff bill of 1828 was passed , - " that disastrous measure which has brought so many calamities upon us , and put in peril the liberty and union of the country , " and " poured millions into the treasury beyond the most extravagant wants of the country . " The passage of this tariff bill was accomplished by the tact of Martin Van Buren , aided by Major Eaton , Senator from Tennessee . Mr. Van Buren was the predestined chief of General Jackson 's Cabinet , and Major Eaton was the confidant , agent , and travelling manager of the Jacksonian wirepullers , besides being the General 's own intimate friend . The events of that session notified Mr. Calhoun that , however manageable General Jackson might be , he was not likely to fall into the custody of the Vice-President . General Jack // son 's election being considered certain , the question was alone interesting , who should possess him for the purposes of the succession . The prospect , as surveyed that winter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupant of that lofty seat . If General Jackson could not be used as a fulcrum for the further elevation of Mr. Calhoun , would it not be advisable to begin to cast about for another ? The tariff bill of 1828 was passed before the Presidential canvass had set in with its last severity . There was time for Mr. Calhoun to withdraw from the support of the man whose nearest friends had carried it through the Senate under his eyes . He did not do so . He went home , after the adjournment of Congress , to labor with all his might for the election of a protectionist , and to employ his leisure hours in the composition of that once famous paper called the " South Carolina Exposition , " in which protection was declared to be an evil so intolerable as to justify the nullification of an act founded upon it . This Exposition was the beginning of our woo , - the baleful egg from which were hatched nullification , treason , civil war , and the desolation of the Southern States . Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he core rect*y styles " the double operation " was " pushed oii " in the summer of 1828 - " This disastrous event the passage of the tariff bill of 1828 opened our eyes ( I mean myself and those immediately connected with me ) as to the full extent of the danger and oppression of the protective system , and the hazard of failing to effect the reform intended throu , h the election of General Jackson . With these disclosures , it became necessary to seek some other ultimate , hut more certain measure of protection . We turned to the Constitution to find this remedy . We directed a more diligent and careful scrutiny into its provisions , in order to understand fully the nature and character of our political system . We found a certain and effectual remedy in that great fundamental division of the powers of the system between this government and its independent co-ordinates , the separate governments of the States , - to be called into action to arrest the unconstitutional acts of this government by the interposition of the States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . But in relying on this our ultimate remedy , we did not abate our zeal in the Presidential canvass ; we still hoped that General Jackson , if elected , would effect the necessary re // 1865 . John C. Ualhoztn. form , and thereby supersede the necessity for calling into action the sovereign an thority of the State , which we were anxious to avoid . With these views the two were pushed with equal zeal at the same time ; which double operation commenced in the fall of 1828 , but a few months after the passage of the tariff act of that year ; and at the meeting of the Legislature of the State , at the same period , a paper known as the South Carolina Exposition was reported to that body , containing a full development , as well on the constitutional point as on the operation of the protective system , preparatory to a state of things which might eventually render the action of the State necessary in order to protect her rights and interest , and to stay a course of policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destructive of liberty and the Constitution . " - Works , II . 396 . Mr. Calhoun omits , however , to mention that the Exposition was not presented to the Legislature of South Carolina until after the Presidential election had been decided . Nor did he inform his hearers that the author of the paper was Mr. VicePresident Calhoun . Either there was a great dearth of literary ability in that body , or else Mr. Calhoun had little confidence in it ; for nearly all the ponderous documents on nullification given to the world in its name were penned by Mr. Calhoun , and appear in his collected works . If the Legislature addressed its constituents or the people of the United States on this subject , it was he who prepared the draft . The South Carolina Exposition was found among his papers in his own handwriting , and it was adopted by the Legislature with only a few alterations and suppressions . There never was a piece of mischief more completely the work of one man than the nullification troubles of 1833 - 34 . The South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was brought before the public by one of the usual methods . The Legislature of South Carolina passed the following resolutions : - " Resolved , That it is expedient to protest against the unconstitutional and oppressive operation of the system of protective duties , and to have such protest entered on the journals of the Senate of time United States . Also , to make a public exposition of our wrongs , and of the remedies within our power , to be communicated to our sister States , with a request that they will co-operate with this State in procuring a repeal of the tariff for protection , and an abandonment of the princi // pie ; and if the repeal be not procured , that they will co-operate in such measures as may be necessary for averting the evil . " Resolved , That a committee of seven be raised to carry the foregoing resolution into effect . " The resolution having been c ar*ied , the following gentlemen were appointed to father Mr. Calhoun 's paper : James Gregg , ID . L. Wardlaw , Hugh S. Legar6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elliott , and II . Barnwell Smith . The duty of this committee consisted in causing a copy of Mr. Calhoun 's paper to be made and presenting it to the Legislature . This was promptly done ; and the Exposition was adopted by the Legislature on the 6th of December , 1828 . Whether any protest was forwarded to the Secretory of the United States Senate for insertion in the journal does not appear . We only know that five thousand copies of this wearisome and stupid Exposition were ordered to be printed , and that in the hubbub of the incoming of a new administration it attracted scarcely any attention beyond the little knot of original nullifiers . Indeed , Mr. Calhoun 's writings on this subject were " protected " by their own length and dulness . No creature ever read one of them quite through , except for a special purpose . The leading assertions of this Exposition are these : -1 . Every duty imposed for protection is a violation of the Constitution , which empowers Congress to impose taxes for revenue only . 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture and commerce . 3 . The whole of the advantages of protection accrue to the manufacturing States . 4 . In other words , the South , the Southwest , and two or three commercial cities , support the government , and pour a stream of treasure into the coffers of manufacturers . 5 . The result must soon be , that the people of South Carolina will have either to abandon the culture of rice and cotton , and remove to some other country , or else to become a manufacturing community , which would only be ruin in another form . Lest the reader should find it impossible to believe that any man out of a lunatic asylum could publish such propositions as this last , we will give the passage . Mr. Calhoun is endeavoring to show that Europe will at length retaliate by placing high duties upon American cotton and rice . At least that appears to be what he is aiming at . // " We already see indications of a commercial warfare , the termination of which no one can conjecture , though our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great and once flourishing agriculture must be annihilated in the conflict . In the first instance we will * be thrown on the home market , which can not consume a fourth of our products ; and , instead of supplying the world , as we would with free trade , we would be compelled to abandon the cultivation of three fourths of what we now raise , and receive for the residue whatever the manufacturers , who would then have their policy consummated by the entire possession of our market , might choose to give . Forced to abandon our ancient and favorite pursuit , to which our soil , climate , habits , and peculiar labor are adapted , at an immense sacrifice of property , we would be compelled , without capital , experience , or skill , and with a population untried in such pursuits , to attempt to become the rivals , instead of the customers , of the manufacturing States . The result is not doubtful . If they , by superior capital and skill , should keep down successful competition on our part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - selling at the prices which a single and very limited market might give . But , on the contrary , if our necessity should triumph over their capital and skill , if , inste* d of raw cotton , we should ship to the manufacturing States cotton yarn and cotton goods , the thoughtful must see that it would inevitably bring about a state of things which could not long continue . Those who now make war on our gains would then make it on our labor . They would not tolerate that those who now cultivate our plantations , and furnish them with the material and the market for the product of their arts , should , by becoming their rivals , take bread from the mouths of their wives and children . The committee will not pursue this painful subject ; but as they clearly see that the system , if not arrested , must bring the country to this hazardous extremity , neither prudence nor patriotism would permit them to pass it by without raising a warning voice against an evil of so men acing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only question which arises in the mind of present readers of such passages ( which abound in the writings of Mr. Calbonn ) is this : Were they the chimeras of a morbid , or the utterances of a false mind ? Those who knew him differ in opinion on this point . For our part , we believe such passages to have been inserted for the sole purpose of alarming the people of South Carolina , so as to render them the more subservient // to his will . It is the stale trick of the demagogue , as well as of the false priest , to subjugate the mind by terrifyino it 0 Mr. Calhoun concludes his Exposition by bringing forward his remedy for the frightful evils which he had conjured up . That remedy , of course , was nullification . The State of South Carolina , after giving due warning , must declare the protective acts " null and void " iu the State of South Carolina after a certain date ; and then , unless Congress repealed them in time , refuse obedience to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a convention called for the purpose , Mr. Calhoun would not say ; but he evidently preferred a convention . He advised , however , that nothing be done hastily ; that time should be afforded to the dominant majority for further reflection . Delay , he remarked , was the more to be recommended , because of " the great political revolution which will displace from power , on the 4th of March next , those who have acquired authority by setting the will of the people at defiance , and which will bring in an eminent citizen , distinguished for his services to his country and his justice and patriotism " under whom , it was hoped , there would be " a complete restoration of the pure principles of our government . " This passage Mr. Calhoun could write after witnessing the maneuvres of Mr. Van Buren and Mr. Eaton ! If the friends of Mr. Adams had set the will of the people at defiance on the tariff question , what had the supporters of General Jackson done ? In truth , this menace of nullification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was not yet ascertained which was going to possess and use General Jackson , - the placid and flexible Van Buren , or the headstrong , short-sighted , and uncomfortable Calhoun . Nullification , as he used daily to declare , was a " reserved power . " At the time of General Jackson 's inauguration , it would have puzzled an acute politician to decide which of the two aspirants had the best chance of succeeding the General . The President seemed equally well affected toward both . One was Secretary of State , the other Vice-President . Van I3uren , inheriting the political tabtics of Burr , was lord paramount in the great State of New York , and Calhoun was all-powerful *11 // his own State and very influential in all the region of cottou and rice . In the Cabinet Calhoun had two friends , and one tried and devoted ally ( Jugham ) , while Van Buren could only boast of Major Eaton , Secretary of War ; and the tie that bound them together was political far more than personal . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been longer in the national councils , had held offices that drew upon him the attention of the whole country , and had formerly been distinguished as an orator . If any one had been rash enough in 1829 to intimate to Mr. Calhoun that Martin Van Buren stood before the country on a par with himself , he would have pitied the ignorance of that rash man . In despotic governments , like those of Louis XlV . and Andrew Jackson , no calculation can be made as to the future of any public man , because his future depends upon the caprice of the despot , which can not be foretold . Six short weeks - nay , not so much , not six , - sufficed to estrange the mind of the President from Calhoun , and implant within him a passion to promote the interests of Van Buren . Our readers , we presume , all know how this was brought to pass . It was simply that Mr. Calhoun would not , and that Mr. Van Buren would , call upon Mrs. Eaton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President 's singular mind were nothing in comparison with this . Daniel Webster uttered only the truth when he wrote , at the time , to his friend Button , that the " Aaron 's serpent among the President 's desires was a settled purpose of making out the lady , of whom so much has been said , a person of reputation " ; and that this ridiculous affair would " probably determine who should be the successor to the present chief magistrate . " It had precisely that effect . Mr. Parton has shown , in his Life of Jackson , the successful mnanceuvres by which this was effected , and how vigorously but unskilfnlly Calhoun struggled to avert his fate . We can not and need not repeat the story ; nor can we go over again the history of the Nullification imbroglio , which began with the South Carolina Exposition in 1828 , and ended very soon after Calhoun had received a private notification that the instant news reached Washington of an overt act of treason in South Carolina , the author and fomenter of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traitor . // One fact alone suffices to prov* that , in bringing on the Nullification troubles , Calhoun 's niotive was factious . When General Jackson saw the coming storm , he did two things . First , he prepared to maintain the authority of tim United States by force . Secondly , he used all his influence with Congress to have the cause of Southern discontent removed . General Jackson felt that the argument of the anti-tariff men , in view of the speedy extiuction of the national debt , was unanswerable . He believed it was absurd to go on raising ten or twelve millions a year more than the government could spend , merely for the sake of protecting Northern manufactures . Accordingly , a bill was introduced which aimed to do just what the nullifiers had been clamoring for , that is , to reduce the revenue to the amount required by the government . If Mr. Calhoun had supported this measure , he could have carried it . He gave it no support ; but exerted all his influence in favor of the Clay Compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protective system as could be saved , and which reduced duties gradually , instead of suddenly . Rather than permit the abhorred administration to have the glory of pacificating the country , this lofty Roman stooped to a coalition with his personal enemy , Henry Clay , the champion and the soul of the protectionist *party . No mere words can depict the bitterness of Calhoun 's disappointment and mortification at being distanced by a man whom he despised so cordially as he did Van Buren . To comprehend it , his whole subsequent career must be studied . The numerous covert allusions to the subject in his speeches and writings are surcharged with rancor ; and it was observed that , whenever his mind reverted to it , his manner , the tone of his voice , and every gesture testified to the intensity of his feelings . " Every Southern man , " said he on one occasion , " who is true to the interests of his section , and faithful to the duties which Providence has allotted him , will be forever excluded from the honors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only for those who have qualified themselves by political prostitution for admission into the Magdaleu Asylum . " His face , too , from this time , assumed that haggard , cast-iron , intense , introverted aspect which struck every beholder. // 1865 . Jo/tn C. ( Icdltoum Miss Martineau , in her Retrospect of Western Travel , has given us some striking and valuable glimpses of the eminent men of that period , particularly of the three most eminent , who frequently visited her during her stay in Washington . This passage , for example , is highly interesting . " Mr. Clay , sitting upright on the sofa , with his snuff-box ever in his hand , would discourse for many an hour in his even , soft , deliberate tone , on any one of the great subjects of American policy which we might happen to start , always amazing us with the moderatiOn of estimate and speech which so impetuous a nature has been able to attain . Mr. Webster , leaning back at his ease , telling stories , cracking jokes , shaking the sofa with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect felicity of the logical part of one 's constitution , would illuminate an evening now and then . Mr. Calhoun , the castiron man , who looks as if he had never been born and could never be extinguished , would come in sometimes to keep our understandings on a painful stretch for a short while , and leave us to take to pieces his close , rapid , theoretical , illustrated talk , and see what we could make of it . We found it usually more worth retaining as a curiosity , than as either very just or useful . His speech abounds in figures , truly illustrative , if that which they illustrate were true also . But his theories of government ( almost the only subject upon which his thoughts are employed ) , the squarest and compactest that ever were made , are composed out of limited elements , and are not , therefore , likely to stand service very well . It is at first extremely interesting to hear Mr. Calhoun talk ; and there is a never-failing evidence of power in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; hut the admiration is too soon turned into regret , into absolute melancholy . It is impossible to resist the conviction , that all this force can be at best but useless , and is but too likely to be very mischievous . His mind has long lost all power of communicating with any other . I know of no man who lives in such utter intellectual solitude . He meets men and harangues by the fireside as in the Senate ; he is wrought like , a piece of machinery , set going vehemently by a weight , and stops while you answer ; he either passes by what you say , or twists it into a suitability with what is in his head , and begins to lecture again . Of course , a mind like this can have little influence in the Senate , except by virtue , perpetually wearing out , of what it did in its less eccentric days ; but its influence at home is to be dreaded . There is no hope that an intellect so cast in narrow theories will accommodate itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will break up all that it // cau in order to remould the materials in its own way . Mr. Calhoun is as fill as ever of his Nullification doctrines ; and those who know the force that is in him , and his utter incapacity of modification by other minds , ( after having gone through as remarkable a revolution of political opinion as perhaps any man ever experienced , ) will no more expect repose and self-retention from him than from a volcano in full force . Relaxation is no longer in the power of his will . I never saw any one who so completely gave me the idea of possession . Half an hour 's conversation with him is enough to make a necessitarian of anybody . Accordingly , he is more complained of than blamed by hi* enemies . His moments of softness by his titmily , and when recurring to old college days , are hailed by all as a relief to the vehement working of the intellectual machine , - a relief equally to himself and others . These moments are as touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier . " Of his appearance in the Senate , and of his manner of speaking , Miss Martineau records her impressions also - " Mr. Calhoun 's countenance first fixed my attention ; the splendid eye , the straight forehead , surmounted by a load of stiff , upright , dark hair , the stern brow , the inflexible mouth , - it is one of the most remarkable heads in the country . " " Mr. Calhoun followed , and impressed me very strongly . While he kept to the question , what he said was close , good , and moderate , though delivered in rapid speech , and with a voice not sufficiently modulated . But when he began to reply to a taunt of Colonel Benton 's , that he wanted to be President , the force of his speaking became painful . He made protestations which it seemed to strangers had better have been spared , that he would not turn on his heel to he President , ' and that he had given up all for his own brave , magnanimous little State of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashed , his brow seemed charged with thunder , his voice became almost a bark , and his sentences , were abrupt , intense , producing in the auditory a sort of laugh which is squeez9d out of people by the application of a very sudden mental force . I believe he knew not what a revelation he made in a few sentences . They were to us strangers the hey , not only to all that was said and done by the South Carolina party during the remainder of the session , bat to many things at Oharleston and Columbia which would otherwise have passed unobserved and une*cplained . " This intelligent observer saw the chieftain on his native heath - // " During my stay in Charleston , Mr. Calhoun and his family arrived from Congress , and there was something very striking in the welcome he received , like that of a chief returned to the bosom of his elan . He stalked about like a monarch of the little domain , and there was certainly an air of mysterious understanding between him and his followers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind communicating with another mind , is confirmed by an anecdote which we have heard related by Dr. Francis Lieber , who , as Professor in the College of South Carolina , was for several years the neighbor and intimate acquaintance of Mr. Calhoun . The learned Professor , upon his return from a visit to Europe , called upon him , and in the course of the interview Mr. Calhoun declared , in his positive manner , that the slaves in the Southern States were better lodged , fed , and cared for than the mechanics of Europe . Dr. Lieber , being fresh from that continent , assured the Secretary of State that such was not the fact , as he could testify from having resided in both lands . " Not at all , not at all , " cried Calhoun dogmatically , and repeated his wild assertion . The Doctor saw that the poor man had reached the condition of absolute unteachableness , and dropped the subject . There could not well be a more competent witness on the point in dispute than Dr. Lieher ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the habit and business of his life to observe and ponder the effect of institutions upon the welfare of those who live under them . Calhoun pushed him out of the witness-box , as though he were an idiot . A survey of the last fifteen years of Calhoun 's life discloses nothing upon which the mind can dwell with complacency . On the approach of every Presidential election , we see him making what we can only call a grab at a nomination , by springing upon the country some unexpected issue designed to make the South a unit in his support . From 18*O to 1836 , he exhausted all the petty arts of the politician to defeat General Jackson 's resolve to bring in Mr. Van Buren as his successor ; and when all had failed , he made an abortive attempt to precipitate the question of the annexation of Texas . Tl*is , too , being foiled , Mr. Van Buren was elected President . Then Mr. Calhoun , // who had for . ten years never spoken of Van Buren except with coiiteinpt , formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to secure his support for the succession . He advocated all the test measures of Mr. Van Buren 's administration , and finished by courting a personal reconciliation with the man whom he had a hundred times styled a fox and a political prostitute . This design coming to naught , through the failure of Mr. Van Buren to reach a second term , lie made a wild rush for the prize by again thrusting forward the Texas question . Colonel Benton , who was the predetermined heir of Van Buren , has detailed the manner in which this was done iii a very curious chapter of his " Thirty Years . " The plot was successful , so far as plunging the country into a needless war was concerned ; but it was Polk and Taylor , not Calhoun , who attained the Presidency through it . Mr. Calhoun 's struggles for a nomination in 1844 were truly pitiable , but they were not known to the public , who saw him , at a certain stage of the campaign , affecting to decline a nomination which there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have not space to show how much the agitation of the slavery question , from 1835 to 1850 , was the work of this one man . The labors of Mr. Garrison and Mr. Wendell Phillips might have borne no fruit during their lifetime , if Calhoun had not made it his business to supply them with material . " I mean to force the issue upon the North , " he once wrote ; and he did force it . On his return to South Carolina after the termination of the Nullification troubles , he said to his friends there , ( so avers Colonel Benton , " Thirty Years , " Vol . II . p. 786 , ) " that the South could never be united against the North on the tariff question ; that the sugar interest of Louisiana would keep her out ; and that the basis of Southern union must be shifted to the slave question . " Here we have the key to the mysteries of all his subsequent career . The denial of the right of petition , the annexation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - these were among the issues upon which he hoped to unite the South in his favor , while retaining enough strength at the North to secure his election . Failing in all his schemes of personal advancement , he died in 1850 , still protesting that slavery is divine , and that it // must rule this country or ruin it . This is really the sum and substance of that last speech to the Senate which he had not strength enough left to deliver . We have run rapidly over Mr. Calhoun 's career as a public man . It remains for us to notice his claims as a teacher of political philosophy , a character in which he influenced his countrymen more powerfully after lie was in his grave than he did while living among them . The work upon which his reputation as a thinker will rest with posterity is his Treatise on the Nature of Government . Written in the last year of his life , when at length all hope of further personal advancement must have died within him , it may be taken as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not live to revise it , and the concluding portion he evidently meant to enlarge and illustrate , as was ascertained from notes and memoranda in pencil upon the manuscript . After the death of the author in 1850 , the work was published in a substantial and elegant form by the Legisla : ture of South Carolina , who ordered copies to be presented to individuals of note in science and literature , and to public libraries . We are , therefore , to regard this volume , not merely as a legacy of Mr. Calhoun to his countrymen , but as conveying to us the sentiments of South Carolina with regard to her rights and duties as a member of the Union . Events since its publication have shown us that it is more even than this . The assemblage of troublesome communities which we have been accustomed to style " the South , " adopted this work as their political gospel . From this source the politicians of the Southern States have drawn all they have chosen to present to the world in justification of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in truth , Mr. Calhoun , since Jefferson and Madison passed from the stage , is almost the only thinking being the South has had . His was a very narrow , intense , and untrustworthy mind , but he was an angel of light compared with the men who have been recently conspicuous in the Southern States . This treatise on government belongs to the same class of works as Louis Napoleon 's Life of C*sar , having for its principal object one that lies below the surface , and the effect of // Oct . John a. calhoun. both is damaged by the name on the title-page . The moment we learn that Louis Napoleon wrote that Life of C*sar , the mind is intent upon discovering allusions to recent history , which the author has an interest in misrepresenting . The common conscience of mankind condemns him as a perjured usurper , and the murderer of many of his unoffending fellowcitizens . No man , whatever the power and splendor of his position , can rest content under the scorn of mankind , unless his own conscience gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day the verdict of his fellow-men will be reversed ; and even in that case , it is not every man that can possess his soul in patience . Every page of the Life of C*sar was composed with a secret , perhaps half-unconscious reference to that view of Louis Napoleon 's conduct which is expressed with such deadly power in Mr. Kinglake 's History of the Crimean War , and which is so remarkably confirmed by an American eyewitness , the late Mr. Goodrich , who was Consul at Paris in 1848 . Published anonymously , the Life of C*sar might have had some effect . Giveii to the world by Napoleon ITT. , every one reads it as he would a defence by an ingenious criminal of his own cause . The highest praise that can be bestowed upon it is , that it is very well done , considerin* the object the author had in view . So , in reading Mr. Calhoun 's disquisition upon government , we are constantly reminded that the author was a man who had only escaped trial and execution for treason by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be set on foot . Though it contains but one allusion to events in South Carolina in 18*8 , the work is nothing but a labored , refined justification of those events . It has been even coupled with Edwards on the Will , as the two best examples of subtle reasoning which American literature contains . Admit his premises , and you are borne along , at a steady pace , in a straight path , to the final inferences that the sovereign State of South Carolina passesses , by the Constitution of the United States , an absolute veto upon every act of Congress , and may secede from the Union whenever she likes ; and that these rights of veto and secession do not merely constitute the strength of the Constitution , but are the Constitution , - and do not merely // 1865 . Jcthn C. Calhoun. tend to perpetuate the Union , but are the Union 's self , - the thing that binds the States together . Mr. Calhoun begins his treatise by assuming that government is necessary . He then explains why it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than sympathetic , feeling more intensely what affects himself than what affects others . Hence he will encroach on the rights of others ; and to prevent this , government is indispensable . But government , since it must be administered by selfish men , will feel more intensely what affects itself than what affects the people governed . It is , therefore , the tendency of all governments to encroach on the rights of the people ; and they certainly will do so , if they can . The same instinct of self-preservation , the same love of accumulation , which tempts individuals to overreach their neighbors , inclines government to preserve , increase , and consolidate its powers . Therefore , as individual selfishness requiro* to be held in check by government , so government must be restrained by something . This something is the constitution , written or uiiwritten . A constitution is to the government what government is to the people it is the restraint upon its selfishness . Mr. Calhoun assumes here that the relation between government and governed is naturally and inevitably " antagonistic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man 's love of justice , and the means by which the people cause justice to be done . Government , he continues , must be powerful ; must have at command the resources of the country ; must be so strong that it can , if it will , disregard the limitations of the constitution . The question is , How to compel a government , holding such powers , having an army , a navy , and a national treasury at command , to obey the requirements of a mere piece of printed paper ? Power , says Mr. Calhoun , can only be resisted by power . Therefore , a proper constitutidn must leave to the governed the power to resist encroachments . This is done in free countries by universal suffrage and the election of rulers at frequent and fixed periods . This gives to rulers the strongest possible motive to please the people , which can only be done by executing their will . // So far , most readers will follow the author without serious difficulty . But now we come to passages which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nullification imbroglio of 1833 . A philosophic Frenchman or German , who should read this work with a view to eulightening his mind upon the nature of government , would be much puzzled after pa*sing the thirteenth page ; for at that point the hidden loadstone begins to operate upon the needle of Mr. Calhoun 's cowpass , and he is as Louis Napoleon writing the Life of Ca*sar . Universal suffrage , he continues , and the frequent election of rulers , are indeed the primary and fundamental principles of a constitutional government ; and they are sufficient to give the people an effective control over those whom they have elected . But this is all they cau do . They can not make rulers good , or just , or obedient to the constitution , but only faithful representatives of the majority of the people and executors of the will of that majority . The right of suffrage transfers the supreme authority from the rulers to the body of the community , and the more perfectly it does this , the more perfectly it accomplishes its object . Majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all others , is selfish , and will abuse his power if he can . So , we have been arguing in a circle , and have come back to the starting-point . Government keeps within bounds the selfishness of the people ; the constitution restrains the selfishness of the governiuent ; but , in doing so , it has only created a despot as much to be dreaded as the power he displaced . We are still , therefore , confronted by the original , difficulty . How are we to limit the sway of tyrant Majority ? If , says Mr. Calhoun , all the people had the same interests , so that a law which oppressed one interest would oppress all interests , then the right of suffrage would itself be sufficient ; and the only question would b* as to the fitness of diffei*ent candidates . But this is not the case . Taxation , for example : no system of taxation can be arranged that will not bear oppressively upon some interests or section . Disbursements , also : some portions of the country must receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money than they pay in taxes , and others less ; and this may be carried so far , that one region may be utterly impoverished , while others are enriched . // King Majority may have his favorites . He may now choose to favor agriculture ; now , commerce ; now , manufactures ; and so arrange the imports as to crush one for the sake of promoting the others . " Crush " is Mr. Calhoun 's word . " One portion of the community , " he says , " may be crushed , and another elevated on its ruins , by systematically perverting the power of taxation and disbursement , for the purpose of aggrandizing or building up one portion of the community at the expense of the other . " ZJIay be , l3ut will it be done ? Has not the most relentless despot an interest in the prosperity of his subjects ? And can one interest be crushed without manifest and immediate injury to all the others ? Mr. Calhoun says , That this fell power to crush important interests will be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All this would be unintelligible to our foreign philosopher , but American citizens know very well what it means . Through this fine lattice-work fence they discern the shining count*. - iiance of the colored person . But now , what remedy ? Mr. Calhoun approaches this part of the subject with the due acknowledgment of its difficulty . The remedy , of course , is Null.ification ; but he is far from using a word so familiar . There is but one mode , he remarks , by which the majority of the whole people can be prevented from oppressing the minority , or portions of the minority , and that is this : " By taking the sense of each interest or portiQn of the community , which may be unequally and injuriously affected by the a*tion of the government , separately , through its own majority , or in some other way by which its voice can be expressed ; and to require the consent of each interest , eithea* to put or to keep the government in motiou . " And this can only be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each division or interest either a concurrent voice in making ai4 executing the laws or a veto on their execution . " This is perfectly intelligible when read by the light of the history of 1833 . But no human being unacquainted with that history could gather Mr. Calhoun 's meaning . Our studious foreigner would suppose by the word " interest , " that the author meant the manufacturing interest , the commercial and agricultural interests , and that each of these should have its // little congress concurring in or vetoing the acts of the Congress sitting at Washington . We , however , know that Mr. Calhoun meant that South Carolina should have the power to nullify acts of Congress and give law to the Union . He does not tell us how South Carolina 's tyrant Majority is to be kept within bounds ; but only how that majority is to control the majority of the whole country . He has driven his problem into a corner , and there he leaves it . Having thus arrived at the conclusion , that a law , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all the States of the Union , must be concurred in by all , he proceeds to answer the obvious objection , that " interests " so antagonistic could never be brought to unanimous agreement . He thinks this would present no difficulty , and adduces some instances of unanimity to illustrate his point . First , trial by jury . Here are twelve men , of different character and calibre , shut up in a room to agree upon a verdict , in a cause upon which able men have argued upon opposite sides . How unlikely that they should be able to agree unanimously ! Yet they generally do , and that speedily . Why is this ? Because , answers Mr. Calhoun , they go into their room know .. ing that nothing short of unanimity will answer ; and consequently every man is disposed to agree with his fellows , and , if he can not agree , to compromise . " Not at all . " The chief reason why juries generally agree is , that they are not interested in the matter in dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human heart , that the fair thing is usually obvious to disinterested minds , or can be made so . It is interest , it is rivalry , that blinds us to what is right ; and Mr. Calhoun 's problem is to render " antagonistic " interests unanimous . We can not , therefore , accept this illustration as a case in point . Secondly , Poland . Poland is not the country which an American would naturally visit to gain political wisdom . Mr. Calhoun , h*wever , repairs thither , and brings home the fact , that in the turbulent Diet of that unhappy kingdom every member had an absolute veto upon ever*y measure . Nay , more : no king could be elected without the unanimous vote of an assembly of one hundred and fifty thousand persons . // Yet Poland lasted two centuries ! The history of those two centuries is a sufficient comment upon Mr. Calhoun 's system , to say nothing of the final catastrophe , which Mr. Calhoun confesses was owing to " the extreme to which the principle was carried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsafe extreme ; it is impossible for man to be too right . If it is right for South Carolina to control and nullify the United States , it is right for any one man in South Carolina to control and nullify South Carolina . One of the tests of a system is to ascertain where it will carry us if it is pushed to the uttermost extreme . Mr. Calhoun gave his countrymen this valuable information when he cited the lamentable case of Poland . Prom Poland the author descends to the Six Nations , the federal council of which was composed of forty-two members , each of whom had an absolute veto upon every measure . Nevertheless , this confederacy , he says , became the most powerful and the most united of all the Indiaii nations . He omits to add , that it was the facility with which this council could be wielded by the French and English in turn , that hastened the grinding of the Six Nations to pieces between those two millstones . IRome is Mr. Calhoun 's next illustration . The Tribunus Plebis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all laws and upon the execution of all laws , and thus prevented the oppression of the plebeians by the patricians . To show the map . plicability of this example to the principle in question , to show by what steps this tribunal , long useful and efficient , gradually absorbed the power of the government , and became itself , first oppressive , and then an instrument in the overthrow of the constitution , would be to write a history of IRoine . Niebuhr is ace*sible to the public , and Niebuhr knew more of the Tnbunus Plebis than Mr. Calhoun . We can not find in Niebnhr anything to justify the author 's aim to constitute patrician Carolina the Tribunus Plebis of the United States . Lastly , England . England , too , has that safeguard of liberty , " an organism by which the voice of each order or class is taken through its appropriate organ , and which requires the concurring voice of all to constitute that of the whole commu // nity . " These orders are King , Lords , and Commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a veto upon the action of the two others . The government of the United States is also so arranged that the President and the two Houses of Congress must concur in every enactment ; but then they all represent the same order or interest , the people of the United states . The English government , says Mr. Calhoun , is so exquisitely constituted , that the greater the revenues of the government , the more stable it is ; hecause those revenues , being chiefly expended upon the lords and gentlemen , render them exceedingly averse to any radical change . Mr. Calhoun does not mention that the majority of the people of England are not represented in the government at all . Perhaps , however , the following passage , in a previous part of the work , was designed to meet their case : - " It is a great and dangerous error to suppose that all people are equally entitled to liberty . It is a reward to be earned , not a blessing to be gratuitously lavished on all alike ; - a reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and deserving ; and not a boon to be bestowed on a people too ignorant , degraded , and vicious to be capable either of appreciating or of enjoying it . " Mr. Calhoun does not tell us who is to bestow this precious boo'n . He afterwards remarks , that the progress of a people " rising " to the point of civilization which entitles them to freedom is " necessarily slow . " How very slow , then , it must be , when the means ef civilization are forbidden to them by law ! With his remarks upon England , Mr. Calhoun terminates his discussion of the theory of government . Let us grant all that he claims for it , and see to what it conducts us . Observe that his grand position is , that a " numerical majority , " like all other sovereign powers , will certainly tyrannize if it can . His remedy for this is , that a local majority , the majority of each State , shall have a veto upon the acts of the majority of the whole country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority is to be kept within bounds . Aecording to his reasoning , South Carolina should have a veto upon acts of Congress . Very well ; then each county of South Carolina should have a veto upon the acts of the State Legislature ; each town should // have a veto upon the behests of the county ; and each voter upon the decisions of the town . Mr. Calhoun 's argument , therefore , amounts to this : that one voter in South Carolina should have the constitutional right to nullify an act of Congress , and no law should be binding which has not received the assent of every citizen . Having completed the theoretical part of his subject , the author proceeds to the practical . In his first essay he describes the " organism " that is requisite for the preservation of liberty ; and in his second , he endeavors to show that the United States is precisely such an organism , since the Constitution , rightly interpreted , does confer upon South Carolina the right to veto the decrees of the numerical majority . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this second discourse , which contains the substance of all his numerous speeches on nullification . It is marvellous how this morbid and intense mind had brooded over a single subject , and how it had subjugated all history and all law to its single purpose . But we can not follow Mr. Calhoun through the tortuous mazes of his second essay ; nor , if we could , should we be able to draw a corporal 's guard of readers after us . We can only say this : Let it be granted that there are two ways in which the Constitution can be fairly interpreted ; - one , the Websterian method ; the other , that of Mr. Calhoun . On one of these interpretations the Constitution will work , and on the other it will not . We prefer the interpretation that is practicable , and leave the other party to the enjoyment of their argument . Nations can not be governed upon principles so recondite and refined , that not one citizen in a hundred will so much as follow a mere statement of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commandments , - as plaiii as the four celebrated propositions in which Mr. Webster put the substance of his speeches in reply to Mr. Calhoun 's ingenious defence of his conduct in 1833 . The author concludes his essay by a prophetic glance at the future . He remarks , that with regard to the future of the United States , as then governed , only one thing could be predicted with absolute certainty , and that was , that the Re ' . public could not last . It might lapse into a monarchy , or it // might be dismembered , - no man could say which ; but that one of these things would happen was entirely certain . The rotation-ia-office system , as introduced by General Jackson , and sanctioned by his subservient Congress , had rendered the Presidential office a prize so tempting , in which so large a number of men had an interest , that the contest would gradually cease to be elective , arid would finally lose the elective form . The incumbent would appoint his successor ; and " thus the absolute form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a monarchical government , " and there would be no possibility of even rendering the monarchy limited or constitutional . Mr. Calhoun does not mention here the name of General Jackson or of Martin Van Buren , but American readers know very well what he was thinking of when lie wrote the passage . Disunion , according to Mr. Calhoun , was another of our perils . In view of recent events , our readers may be interested in reading his remarks on this subject , written in 1849 , among the last words lie ever deliberately put upon paper : - " The conditions impelling the government toward disunion are very powerful . They consist chiefly of two ; - the one arising from the great extent of the country ; the other , from its division into separate States , having local institutions and interests . The former , under the operation of the numerical majority , has necessarily given to the two great parties , in their contest for the honors and emoluments of the government , a geographical character , for reasons which have been fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle on the part of the stronger section to obtain the permanent control ; and on the part of the weaker , to preserve its independence and equality as members of the Union . The conflict will thus become one between the States occupying the different sections ,  --  that is , between organized bodies on both sides , - each , in the , event of separation , having the means of avoiding the confusion and anarchy to which the parts would he suhject without such organization . This would contribute much to increase the power of resistance on the part of the weaker section against the stronger in possession of the government . With these great advantages and resources , it is hardly possible that the parties occupying the weaker section would consent quietly , under any circumstances , to break down from independent and equal sovereignties into a dependent and colonial condition ; and still less so , under circum // 1865 . John C. Calhoun. stances that would revolutionize them internally , and put their very existence as a people at stake . Never was there an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquered , than is involved in that between the States which compose the two sections of the Union . The condition of the weaker , should it sink from a state of independence and equality to one of dependence and subjection , would be more calamitous than ever before befell a civilized people . It is vain to think that , with such consequences before them , they will not resist ; especially , when resistance may save them , and can not render their condition worse . That this will take place , unless the stronger section desists from its course , may be assumed as certain ; and that , if forced to resist , the weaker section would prove successful , and the system end in disunion , is , to say the least , highly probable . But if it should fail , the great increase of power and patronage which must , in consequence , accrue to the government of the United States , would but render certain and hasten the termination in the other alternative . So that , at all events , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - it must come , if not prevented by strenuous or timely efforts . " This is a very instructive passage , and one that shows well the complexity of human motives . Mr. Calhc*un betrays the secret that , after all , the contest between the two sections is a " contest for the honors and emoluments of the government , " and that all the rest is but pretext and afterthought , - as General Jackson said it was . He plainly states that the policy of the South is rule or ruin . Besides this , he intimates that there is in the United States an " interest , " an institution , the development of which is incompatible with the advancement of the general interest ; and either that one interest must overshadow and subdue all other interests , or all other interests must unite to crush that one . The latter has been done . Mr. Calhoun proceeds to suggest the measures by which these calamities can be averted . The government must be " restored to its federal character ' by the repeal of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a strict construction of the Constitution . The President 's power of removal must be limited . un earlier times , these would have sufficed ; but at that day the nature of the disease was such that nothing could reach it short of an organic change , // which should give the weaker section a negative on the action of the government . Mr. Calhoun was of opinion that this could best be done by our having two Presidents ,  --  one elected by the North and the other by the South , - the assent of both to be necessary to every act of Congress . Under such a system , he thought , - " The Presidential election , instead of dividing the Union into hostile geographical parties , the stronger struggling to enlarge its powers , and the weaker to defend its rights , as is now the case , would become the means of restoring harmony and concord to the country and the government . It would make the Union a union in truth , - a bond of mutual affection and brotherhood ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument of dominion and aggrandizement , and submitted to by the weaker only from the lingering remains of former attachment , and the fading hope of being able to restore the government to what it was originally intended to be , - a blessing to all . " The utter misapprehension of the purposes and desires of the Northern people which this passage betrays , and which pervades all the later writings of Mr. Calhoun , can only be explained by the supposition that he judged them out of his own heart . It is astounding to hear the author of the annexation of Texas charging the North with the lust of dominion , and the great Nullifier accusing Northern statesmen of being wholly possessed by the mania to be President . Webster , Clay , and Calhoun , - these were great names in their day . When the last of them had departed , the country felt a sense of bereavement , and even of self-distrust , doubting if ever again such men would adorn the public councils . A close scrutiny into the lives of either of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his contemporary reiiown , for they were all , in some degree , at some periods , diverted from their true path by an ambition beneath an American statesman , whose true glory alone consists in serving his couritry well in that sphere to which his fellow-citizeiis call him . From such a scrutiny the fame of neither of those distinguished men would suffer so much as that of Calhoun . His endowments were not great , nor of the most valuable kind ; and his early education , hasty and very incomplete , was not continued by maturer study . lie read rather to confirm his // impressions than to correct them . It was impossible that he should ever have been wise , because he refused to admit his liability to error . Never was mental assurance more complete , and seldom less warranted by innate or acquired superiority . If his knowledge of books was slight , his opportunities of observing men were still more limited , since he passed his whole life in places as exceptional , perhaps , as any in the world , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public career there was a canker in the heart of it ; for , while his oath , as a member of Congress , to support the Constitution of the United States , was still fresh upon his lips , he declared that his attachment to the Union was conditional and subordinate . He said that the alliance between the Southern planters and Northern Democrats was a false and calculated compact , to be broken when the planters could no longer rule by it . While he resided in Washington , and acted with the Republican party in the flush of its double triumph , he appeared a respectable character , and won golden opinions from eminent men in both parties . But when he was again subjected to the narrowing and perverting influence of a residence in South Carolina , he shrunk at once to his original proportions , and became thenceforth , not the servant of his country , but the special pleader of a class and the representative of a section . And yet , with that strange judicial blindness which has ever been the doom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidency . There is scarcely any example of infatuation more remarkable than this . Here we have , lying before us at this moment , undeniable proofs , in the form of " campaign lives " and " campaign documents , " that , as late as 1844 there was money spent and labor done for the purpose of placing him in nomination for the highest office . Calhoun failed in all the leading objects of his public life , except one ; but in that one his success will be memorable forever . He has left it on record ( see Benton , II . 698 ) that his great aim , from 1835 to 1847 , was to force the slavery issue on the North . " It is our duty , " he wrote in 1847 , " to force the issue on the North . " " Had the South , " he continued , " or even my own State , backed me , I would have forced the issue on the North in 1835 " ; and he welcomed the Wilmot // Proviso in 1847 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the means of " enabling us to force the issue on the North . " In this design , at length , when he had been ten years in the grave , he succeeded . Had there been no Calhoun , it is possible - nay , it is not improbable - that that issue might have been deferred till the North had so outstripped the South in accumulating all the elements of power , that the fire-eaters themselves would have shrunk from submitting the question to the arbitrament of the sword . It was Calhoun who forced the issue upon the United States , and compelled us to choose between annihilation and war .
