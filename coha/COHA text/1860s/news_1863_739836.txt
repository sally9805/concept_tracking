txt Peace upon Simple arms . On Wednesday we extracted an article from the Richmond Enquirer , st ating , at some length , the terms on which the Confederates will be willing to make " peace " with the United States . They are these : " Recognition oy the enemy of the independence of the Confederate States . Withdrawal of the Yankee forces from every foot of Confederate ground , inducing Kentucky and Missouri . Withdrawal of the Yankee soldiers from Maryland , until that State shall decide by a free vote whether she shall remain in the old Union or ask admission into the Confederacy . Consent on the part of the Federal Government to give up to the Confederacy its proportion of the nary as it stood at the time of secession , or to pay for the same . Yielding up of all pretensions on the part of the Federal Government to that portion of the old Territories which Iles west of the Confederate States . An equitable settlement on the baste of our absolute Independence and equal rights of all accounts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accruing from foreign treaties . " Further on , the writer declares that the above is the minimum of what the South will demand , and that it may possibly insist upon a complete reimbursement of all the expenses of the war . He says : " As surely as we completely ruin their armies ? and without that Is no pence or truce at all  --  so surely shall we make them pay oar war debt , though we wring it out of their hearts . And they know it well , and therefore they can not make peace except through their utter exhaustion and absolste inability to strike another blow . " We do not for a moment imagine that this statement of the case as it stands between us and the Confederacy would meet with confirmation from over one-tenth of the population of the States in revolt , if they had an opportunity to-morrow of freely and fairly expressing their opinion . But we have on the other hand no doubt whatever that at least onetenth has deliberately laid down the fbregoing string of absurdities as a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which wields all the power of the South , commands its armies , levies its taxes , forces its men into the ranks , and , in fact , holds all the resources of the country in the hollow of its hands . That there is a considerable portion of the Southern people disposed to protract the war , in the hope of reducing the North to the position of a craven suppliant for mercy , is only credible on the supposition either that they have all approached as closely to a state of lunacy as JOHN MITCHEL himself , or that they have been worked up into a kind of desperation which only shows itself on paper . But the leaders are men of a very different stamp from the mass of the population ; they are animated by much stronger hope , are fired by a much loftier ambition , and , as the mere fact of their having brought on the revolution shows , are carried along by a very much more vivid imagination , and have a far greater stake in the contest than their humbler associates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one campaign in the precise way in which the Richmond Enquirer now says they intend to close it some time or other . The success which has attended their efforts in the field has been very much smaller than they looked for ; but , on the other hand , the magnitude of these efforts must have astonished even themselves . And what is of still more importance , they have succeeded to a degree which , two years ago , must have seemed impossible , in dragging the white population under the yoke of military authority , and thus making all extensive or organized opposition to the war impossible . It is no exaggeration to say that , before the close of this year , the majority of Southern voters will be in the military service of the Confederacy , forbidden to write , speak or deliberate , and bound to execute the orders of their chiefs without remonstrance or inquiry . The influence of the civilians upon public affairs is , therefore , at this moment nil ; the Confederacy is the army , and the army is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them possessing any political value . This , of course , amounts to saying that the conditions of peace are such as JEFFERSON Davis chooses to offer , and that the war will end either when he can no longer resist , or when he chooses to close it . None of the ordinary modes of making peace are now withinreach of the civil authorities . The rebel Congress may refuse to vote him money , but he will not mind that , inasmuch as he levies supplies for the army in kind , and in what quantities he pleases . It might appoint ambassadors to go to Washington , and he need not let them pass his lines , and any treaty they would make would be waste paper ; and if a meeting were held to denounce him or his policy , he might seize and conscript the whole body , officers and audience . Now , there may be persons who suppose that JEFFERSON Des 's will let such a machine as the Confederate army out of his hands before he has tasked its capacity to the uttermost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be raoidlv diminishing in number . There is now not a doubt in the minds of all intelligent observers that h ( really means , as the Richmond Enquirer says to destroy us or be destroyed by us There is nothing extraordinary in this It is the resolve of an able and ambitious , but desperate man . The longer he protract , : the contest , the more glory he gains ; and lel him resist ever so long , he can not at the close be worse off than he would be by at immediate surrender . It is , therefore , strictly true that we shall have to ruin him , or he will us ; but we believe that there is now a general and strong determination at the North , outside Mozart Hall , that he shall be the victim , and not we . There is , therefore , so far as we can see , no possible objection , aE far as the North is concerned , to the proposi ? tion of the Richmond Enquirer , " that the Confederacy or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perdition . " ThiE is , we believe , the precise state of the case and we intend to decide which of the two ii is to be with all convenient speed . We conk have no hesitation in predicting which at this moment , but politeness forbids .
