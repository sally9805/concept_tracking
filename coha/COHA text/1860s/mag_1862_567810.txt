ARTICLE 11. - CONGRESS AND THE TERRITORIES . Bentons Thirty Years ' View ; or a History of the Working of the American Govermnent , for Thirty Years , . from ' 1820 to 1850. 2 Vols . New York : ID . Appleton &amp; Co . So much of the difficulty , under which the Nation is now laboring , has arisen out of the different views of the origin and extent of the power of Congress over the territories of the United States , and the manner of its exercise , that it seems proper that the subject should be discussed otherwise than in law reports and Congressional debates . It is well known that the United States has had the ownership and possession of territories , and has regulated and governed them , and their inhabitants , from a period anterior to the formation of the present Constitution to this present time . The first Ordinance for the government and regulation of such territories , said to have been drawn by Mr. Jefferson , was made April 23 , 1781 , and applied to all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the United States , " when the Indian title was extinguished , &amp;c . It provided for the division of the territory into States , and their admission , at a proper time , into the Union , with separate Republican Constitutions , and for their temporary govermnent in the meantime . This Ordinance remained in force till it was superseded and repealed by the more elaborate and well considered Ordinance of July 13 , 1787 , drawn by that eminent statesman , Mr. Dane , which has formed the basis of all our territorial governments to this day . These Ordinances were said by Mr. Madison to be unconstitutional , by which he probably meant nothing more than that there was no express grant of power in the old Confederation , which could be considered as an authority for such enactments . Nevertheless it was known that , from the nature of the case , the United States were liable to become , as they had become , the owners and possessors of // territory , as well as other property , which must be ruled and regulated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Congress was the only such agent then in existence , it necessarily devolved on them , and nobody else , to take care of it till other provision was made . At the time the Ordinance of 1787 was enacted , the Convention for forming the present Constitution was in session , and many of its leading members were also members of the old Congress , and acting at the same time in both capacities , for the common benefit of the United States . The defect of express power in the Confederation , to do what was absolutely necessary for governing the territories already acquired , and others known or expected to be soon afterwards acquired , was of course brought directly before them , and required to be provided for . The territory north and west of the Ohio river was the only one then actually owned by the United States , but the unsettled territory south of that river was claimed by them , and expected to be soon conceded , by the States within whose chartered limits it lay . This was done soon after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide for the case , and actually did so , by the third section of the fourth article of the Constitution , made for the express purpose . This section met the case exactly . ft made an express grant of all the power the case required , and which tIme old Congress had been compelled , by the necessity of the case , to exercise without such grant , and , as was contended , without any right at all , viz : the power of admitting new States , and the right of disposing of and governing the territory in the meantime . It did not grant the right to acquire territory , but it recognized the existence of the right , by recognizing the fact that territory had been acquired , and was then in the actual possession of the United States . It did not negative any future exercise of the right , because a further acquisition of territory was then in actual contemplation , and expected to be soon made , either by the Congress of the Confederation , or by a new Congress under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , a power // already assumed , and promised to be exercised by the Ordinance . The second and third clauses secure the integrity of the existing States , against division or amalgamation , without their own consent . The fourth clause gives power to dispose of the territory , and " make all needful rules and regulatioiis respecting " it ; both of which had been assumed and exercised in the Ordinance . The fifth clause preserved the counter claims of the United States , and individual States , each of which were then claiming the whole , or particular portions of the unsettled lands embraced within the boundaries established by the treaty with Great Britain . After the residue of the section was formed , the fourth and fifth clauses were added on the motion of Mr. Madison , who said that power ought to be given " to dispose of the unappropriated lands , " and " to institute temporary governments in the new States ; " and the committee , to whom the matter was referred , reported the provisions as they now stand in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first acts of the new government , under this Constitution , was to carry out this authority , by the adoption and reenactment of the Ordinance of 1787 . Thus we see that there was first a general agreement in Congress and in the Convention as to what should be done respecting the territories , acquired and to be acquired , and the old Congress did it , so far as respected the first . But as Mr. Madison , and probably others , said it was done without authority , the Convention provided the required authority ; and lastly the new Congress , still including many of the same men , and Mr. Madison among them , confirmed and adopted it , by reenacting the Ordinance , as it originally passed , by virtue of the authority so given in the Constitution . This Ordinance , besides providing the whole machinery of a territorial government , pm*ohibited and actually abolished slavery in all the existing territories of the United States and its validity has been admitted , acted upon , and expressly recognized by every department of the government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this , not excepting the present Court , though Chief Justice Taney says , the power by which it was authorized , was exhausted in the // act , and could not be applied to any other territory subsequently acquired . He might as well have held that the residue of the sentence , regarding " other property , " and in fact the whole Constitution , was made to provide for present exigencies only , and was never to be applied to similar purposes in the future . Thus the source and extent of the power for governing the territories under the Constitution , and the manner of its practical application , were fully recognized and established . The same necessity for Government still exists , in reference to territories subsequently acquired , as then existed in regard to the original one , and that whether they are situated within or without the treaty limits of the United States , and no other power than Congress can supply it . Their power to do it is admitted in the broadest possible terms , by the last authoritative exposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott case . But from what source do they derive this power ? It would not do to take it from the direct grant in the Constitution " to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory , " because if they did , they must not only take it subject to all constitutional restrictions and limitations , but must take along with it all the precedents and decisions which establish its ap . plicability to slavery , as well as all other subjects , as practically carried out under the Ordinance . Accordingly , the Chief Justice says that grant of power has been exhausted and become obsolete , and with it he sets aside , also , all the precedents and decisions founded upon it , and confirming the right to prohibit slavery . Some other source must be discovered , from which the power of governing the territories can be derived without admitting such unwelcome attendants . The doctrine used in the time of President Jefferson , and afterwards , was that the power was extra-constitutional altogether , arising out of the sovereign right of ownership , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they pleased , with the territories , without restriction or limitation ,  --  as they did with their own negroes ,  --  in fact , the doctrine of necessity , as claimed and used by the Congress of time Confederation in 1784 and 1787 , // before our present Constitution was made . When Louisiana and Florida were pnrchased , the constitutional power would not answer their purpose , for they wanted to transfer all the unlimited authority and jurisdiction , civil , ecclesiastical , and military , of a Spanish despotism , directly into the hands of the President and his appointees . And this they actually did , and defended themselves on the ground of this unlimited and extraconstitutional right of ownership , against the constitutional doctrine of their opponents . This continned to be the doctrine of the party , and practiced upon by the government , up to a very recent period . But it would not answer their purpose now , for if Congress have a right to do anything and everything they please with the territories , they can as well prohibit slavery as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine had been repudiated because it restricted the power of depriving any person of liberty , i. e. of establishing slavery . No person shall " be deprived of . . . liberty . . . . without due process of law . " The extra-constitutional doctrine must now , in turn , be repudiated , because it does not restrict the power of establishing liberty , i. e. of prohibiting slavery . Some new ground must , therefore , be sought out ; and the Chief Justice finds it in the power to admit new States . This , he says , implies the power to acquire territory to make them of ; and the power to acquire necessarily includes the power to dispose of , settle , and govern it in the meantime . Thus they go back to the Constitution for the power , after all ; though being strict constructionists , they choose to take it by an indirect inference , rather than by the express grant . By deducing the authority in this manner , they afl*ct to shake off the trammels imposed by the practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , entirely contradict the Jeffersonian doctrine of unlimited power . This answered the purpose well enough while it applied only to territory already devoted to slavery , before it was acquired ; because a majority of both Houses could not be found ready to abolish it . But when it came to be applied to territory received from Mexico , from which slavery was already excluded by law , it would not answer at all ; because a similar majority could not be found ready to establish it . If slavery already // existed in a territory by local law , it required an act of Congress to get rid of it , because Congress possessed the whole legislative power over it . But if slavery did not exist there , it required an act of Congress to introduce it , because no other power could make a local law authorizing it . Hence the necessity of again changing their ground . Strict constructionists never hold to any construction of the Constitution , when they can find another that will answer their present purpose better . We shall now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress over the territories , according to the present construction by the Chief Justice , is no longer an unlimited power , arising out of the fact of proprietorship , but is really a constitutional power , conferred indirectly and incidentally to be sure , but still conferred by and to be exercised under the Constitution , and , of course , subject to all the express qualifications and limitations contained in that instrument , as restrictive of this and all other powers conferred on the General Governinent . The power on its face , as the Court hold it , is broad and ample , including the right of general legislation and government , as fully as under the direct grant , or as under another grant in regard to the District of Columbia , and the forts and arsenals belonging to the United States ; iu regard to which the words of the Constitution are , that " Congress shall have power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever . " Still in none of these could Congress pass a bill of attainder , grant a title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything else expressly prohibited in other parts of the Constitution . Chief Justice Taney , after enumerating a large list of these restrictions , says : " These powers are in express and positive terms denied to the General Government are not only not granted to Congress , but are in express terms denied , and they are forbidden to exercise them . And this prohibition is not confined to the States , but the words are general and extend to the whole territory over which the Constitution gives it power to legislate , including those portions of it remaining under territorial government , as well as that covered by States . " The Chief Justice adds , " If Congress itself can not do this if it is beyond the powers conferred on // the General Government , . . . it will be admitted , we presume , that it Congress could not authorize a territorial government to exercise them . " Mr. Justice IMicLean expresses the same opinion on this point , saying in reference to this territorial legislation , " no powers can be exercised which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its spirit . " And every other member of the Court , either expressly or impliedly , sanctions the same obviously correct doctrine . Now it so happens that among these express restrictions and prohibitions is one including these words , " nor shall any person be deprived of liberty without due process of law . " This recognizes personal freedom as the original and actual right of every unoffending person within its jurisdiction , so far as it depends on any action of this Government . Blacks as well as whites , and slaves as well as freemen , whether black or white , are unitbrmly mentioned and spoken of as persons , whenever they are alluded to in the Constitution ; and never otherwise , either as property or anything else . They are " other persons " than " freemen or 9%dians not taxed , " &amp;c. - " such persons " as on migration or importation may be taxed prior to 1808 , and prohibited afterwards ,  --  and " persons " held to labor under local law , &amp;c . But persons always , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove the contrary . If any such persons are deprived of liberty on any part of our soil , otherwise than by due process of law , it must be done by some authority other than that lawfully exercised under the civil administration of the Constitution and laws of the United States . And the Chief Justice himself says , that " an act of Congress which deprives a citizen of the United *t*te8 " ( he says insidiously , but the Constitution says " ANY PER5ON " ) " of his liberty who has committed no offense against the laws , could hardly be dignified with the name of due process of law . ' ' Slavery is a status created and sustained only by local law authorizing it . If no such law exists in any territory of the United States , no power on earth can carry it there . For the whole and only legislative power over it is vested in Congress , and they are expressly prohibited from doing so-they can de // prive no person of liberty without due process of law . This prohibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chief Justice says , extends to the whole territory over which the Constitution gives Congress the power to legislate , including the territories as well as the States , and of course the States no more than the territories . To this point the new doctrine of the Court most certainly tends , and to this point it led the Chief Justice , and it is presumed every other member of the Court , who had not previously arrived there by a more direct and less tortuous way . It is exactly the doctrine of the Chicago platform , which denies " the authority of Congress , of a territorial legislature , or of any individuals , to give legal existence to slavery in any territory of the United States ; " meaning , of course , any of the present territory , in which no existing local law authorizes it . How , then , shall the Court subserve the interest of slavery , and the wants of the South ? - for in this matter they have placed themselves exactly on the footing of the organs of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor anybody else can carry it into the territories , how shall it get there ? We have seen that the constitutional doctrine that Congress should " make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory " would not answer , because it had already received a practical construction , confirmed by every department of the Government , and acquiesced in by the Nation for seventy years ; by which it not only included the power of excluding slavery , but actually of abolishing it , in all the territories of the United States . This power Congress had exercised , and , it is substantially admitted , rightfully exercised , by adopting and reenacting the Ordinance of 1787 , whereby slavery was forever banished and excluded from all the territory which now forms five States of this Union . The Jeffersonian , or extra-constitutional doctrine , would answer the purpose no better ; because , although it admitted the plenary power of Congress , untrammeled by any constitutional restrictions , it nevertheless required the direct action of Congress in favor of slavery , in order to admit it where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , if the President , or a majority // of either house of Congress , was opposed to it . The new doctrine of the Conrt , as far as already developed , would not mend the matter ; because , although it set aside the direct constitutional power to " make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory , " it nevertheless derived an equivalent power indirectly from another clause of the Constitution , thereby still making it a power under the Constitution , and to be exercised in conforniity to the Constitution , and of course subject to all the restrictions and limitations applicable to the other powers of Congress , and particularly to the one that prohibited them from depriving " any person of liberty . " So that , thus far , the Court had made no progress towards establishing slavery in free territory , with or without the power of Congress . They have , in fact , discovered that no power in Congress will answer their purpose . For if they have the power , they may refuse to exercise it , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of looking beyond the power of Congress , and basing the sacred right of slavery upon the Constitution itself far out of the reach *f any power of Congress or of the Government . The Constitution must be made a sL very instrument , adopted not " to secure the blessings of liberty , " but to establish and protect slavery , proprio *igore , wherever its jurisdiction should extend . Accordingly , Chief Justice Taney says , ( Dred Scott case , p. 451 ) , " The right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution . The right to traffic in it , like an ordinary article of merchandise and property , was guaranteed to the citizens of the United States , in every State that might desire it , for twenty years . And the Government , in express terms , is pledged to protect it in all future time , if the slave escapes from his owner . " " This , " he says , " is done in plain words-too plain to be misnuderstood , " and yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient or modern , six consecutive lines , embodying more grave , pure , and condensed errors of fact and law , undiluted by a single truth , than are set forth in the three propositions of Chief Justice Taney , contained in the above three short sentences . They constitute his own summary , and embrace the substance of his whole argument // in favor of the opinion that the Constitution carries and protects slavery , wherever its authority goes in territories or States . Let us analyze and examine them in detail . 1st . The right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed , &amp;c . This proposition he grounds , solely and exclusively , upon the first clause of the ninth section of the first article of the Constitution , which is in these words : " The migration or importation of such persons , as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit , shall not be prohibited by Congress prior to the year eighteen hundred and eight . " By that clause Congress is restricted till 1808 , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . Neither slaves nor the right of property are mentioned in it , and nothing is affirmed or denied respecting them , either distinctly and expressly or otherwise . Because Congress was thus restricted , some of the States , who always held and exercised the legal right , and refused to give it up , took occasion to continue the slave-trade  --  and that is the whole of it . 2d . The right to traffic in it ( slave propegty ) was guaranteed for twenty yearsor , as he expresses it in another place , ( lb. p. 411 ) , " The right to purchase and hold this property is directly sanctioned and authorized for twenty years . " All this , too , he positively asserts on the sole authority of the same restrictive clause . Property in man  --  the right to traffic in it  --  to purchase ithold it-first authorized , then sanctioned , and finally guaranteed-for twenty years-merely by a clause negativing the right of Congress to prevent it till 1808 . There can be no answer to such reasoning as this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect it ( the right of property in slaves ) in all time . This pledge he finds in the third clause of the second section of the fourth article , which says that fn gitives from labor shall be deliVered up on claim , &amp;c . Here it is a pledge of the Government . In another place ( lb. p. 411 ) it is a pledge of the States to each other . And in both it is to protect and maintain the master 's right of property in man  --  a subject most studiously avoided in every part of the Constitution . So easy does he find it , to manufacture sanctions , pledges , and guarantees , by one party or by another , directly , expressly , dis // tinctly , in express terms , and in plain words , for any purpose , and ont of the least possible materials . A man , whose mind is so constitnted or perverted , as to render him capable of handling law and logic after this manner , can not - be safely trnsted with the statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and a fortiori not with the much more dangerous and responsible duty of drawing a conclusion . His whole doctrine for making the Constitution a slavery instrument , recognizing and sanctioning the right of property in man , and planting and protecting negro slavery in all the States and territories in the Union , and wherever the authority of its government extends , nnchecked by the power of Congress or anybody else ; whereby he declares null and void a statute of the United States , which has been approved and sustained by every department of the Government , and practised upon for thirty years ; he distinctly sees and reads in plain words in these two clanses of the Constitntion , neither of- which says one word upon the subject , or alludes to any part of it , otherwise than as all generals must necessarily include some particulars . They speak of persons , as such , generally and exclusively , their *nigration and importation and their obligations under local law , restricting State legislation , and suggesting a single duty *of somebody without saying who ) by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evasion of those obligations . They do not purport to grant , assert , or even admit any right , or prescribe any other duty ; they guarantee nothing , and pledge nothing . They do not contain one word about negroes , in distinction from other persons-nor about slaves , in distinction from apprentices , minors , hired laborers , or others owing service ; - not one word about property of any sort , in man , or anything else . IDut the Chief Justice asserts that they expressly affirm the right of property in man-in a slave ,  --  that they gztarantee in express terms , the right to traffic in it for twenty years ,  --  and that they pledge the Government to protect the master 's right of property forever . This atrocious doctrine was invented and intended to enable slaveholders to inundate // with slavery , not only all the territories of the United States , but to authorize them to carry it , under the protection of the Constitution , into all the States of the Union , in defiance of all State Constitutions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his last official docmnents , says , that slavery is as thoroughly established in Kansas as in South Carolina , and , he might have added with the same kind of truth , as thoroughly in every other State as in either . The fiagitious enormity of the conception exceeds all precedent . It may well be doubted if even John C. Calhoun ever came fully up to it . Such are the facts , the principles , and the logic invoked by the Chief Justice endorsed and approved , without any qualification , by one other Judge only , and by no other living man , so far as the public are informed . At least no evidence has yet been laid before them , and it is to be hoped there never may be , which would sustain such a charge against any other mortal . If he had simply said that his doctrine was to be found somewhere-in the Constitution , deducible from its language , or pervading its unseen spirit in general terms , the bold and reckless assertion might have found some believers , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust their own understanding ; but when he puts his finger on the passage , and says it is there , directly , expre88ly , distinctly , in express terms , and in plain words , all the world can understand and judge of his hallucination .
