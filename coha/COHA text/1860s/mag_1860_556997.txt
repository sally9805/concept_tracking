txt ART . VIII . - Occasional Productions , Political , Diplomatic , and Miscellaneous , including , among others , A Glance at the Court and Government of Louis Philippe and the French Revolution of 1848 , while the Author resided as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary from the United States at Paris . By the late RICHARD RUSH . Edited by his Executors . With a Copious Index . Philadelphia : J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. 1860 . Royal 8vo. pp. 3*5 . " NOT a whit behind the very chiefest apostles* ' of American liberty , in all that constitutes true patriotism , was the // venerated Dr. Benjamin Rush , of Philadelphia . Inheriting from his stern ancestor , Captain John Rush , - a favorite officer of Oliver Cromwell , and a commander of a troop of horse under his eye , - an intelligent devotion to the cause of constitutional freedom , he added to his republican faith the learning of the schools , the virtues of the cloister , and the manners of the court . His services to the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was yet a student at Edinburgh , in his negotiations with Dr. Witherpoon , who was induced by his agency to accept the presidency of Princeton College ; and for the space of forty-nine years ( from the nineteenth to the sixty-eighth year of his age ) he ceased not to instruct his fellow-citizens through the press . His four voliimes of " Medical Inquiries and Observations , " his volume of " Essays , Literary , Moral , and Philosophical , " his collection of " Lectures , " chiefly introductory to his course on the " Institutes and Practice of Medicine , " his " Inquiry into the Effects of Public Punishments , " his " Essay on Capital Punishments , " his " Inquiry into the Effects of Ardent Spirits , " his " Observations upon the Study of the Greek and Latin Languages , " his " Defence of the Bible as a School-Book , " and many other publications , evinced his lively interest in the physical , mental , moral , and spiritual welfare of his fellow-men . Equally at home among the rich and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the departing , and anon one of the most resolute in the imposing convocation which decreed the Magna Charta of American liberty , - his life was full of honor , and his death was peace . When at last his career of usefulness was suddenly arrested , it was felt that his country , and especially the city long honored by his well-earned fame , had sustained no common loss . All ranks and conditions lamented his death ; but no tribute would have beeli so grateful to the departed spirit , had it been allowed to linger awhile amidst familiar scenes , as the tears of the poor and the wretched , who , rendered bold by the agony of a great grief , filled the house of mourning with their griefs , - imploring permission once more to gaze upon the face , or at least to touch the coffin , of the benefactor whom they should see no more on earth . We have briefly adverted to the excellence of his private // 493 character . " Piety to God , " one of his biographers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dr. Rush . In all his printed works , and in all his private transactions , he expressed the most profound respect and veneration for the great Eternal . " " His writings , " says Dr. Hosack , " in numerous places bear testimony to his Christian virtues ; and in a manuscript letter , written a short time previous to his fatal illness , he candidly declared that he had acquired and received nothing from the world which he so highly prized as the religious principles he received from his parents . ' It is peculiarly gratifying to observe a man so distinguished in a profession in which , by the illiberal , religious scepticism is supposed to abound , directing his talents to the maintenance of genuine piety and the enforcing of Christian virtue . To inculcate those principles which flow from the source of all truth and purity , and to impart them as a legacy to his children , was an object dear to his heart , and which he never failed to promote by constant exhortation and the powerful influence of his own example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active philanthropist , and learned physician was Richard Rush , the author of the " Occasional Productions " which have elicited this article . To be the son of such a father was no slight honor , but - fortunate on both sides of the house - he could claim as his maternal grandfather another signer of the Declaration of Independence , - Richard Stockton , of New Jersey . At the age of fourteen he became a student at Princeton College , and was there graduated in 17 ' 97 , in his eighteenth year , - the youngest of a class of thirty-three . Having determined to apply himself to the mysteries of Coke and Blackstone , he commenced his legal studies in the office of William Lewis , of whom a graphic portrait was presented by Mr. Horace Binney , in his reminiscences of " The Leaders of the Old Bar of Philadelphia , " a work reviewed in our pages for January of this year . At the age of twenty-seven he attracted the notice of the leaders of the Democratic or Republican party , by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia , convened shortly after the attack on the United States frigate Chesapeake . In 1808 he extended his reputation by his defence of Colonel Duane ( editor of the Aurora , the great Democratic paper ) , who was charged with a libel upon Governor Mckean . In *OL . XCI. - NO. 189. 42 // January , 1811 , he became Attorney-General of Pennsylvania ; and in November of the same year was appointed by Mr. Madison First Comptroller of the Treasury of the United States . During the war of 1812 - 14 Mr. IRush was a vigorous champion , in the public prints , of the measures of the Administration ; and to few writers was Mr. Madison so deeply indebted , at a time when many educated men , equally ready with the pen and the voice , considered resistance to government one of the first duties of patriotism . Early in 1814 Mr. iRush was requested by the President to take his choice between the Attorney-Generalship and the Secretaryship of the Treasury . He selected the former , and occupied the position for three years . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1816 , he was in October , 1817 , created Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of Great Britain , and he discharged the duties of this post with great reputation for no less than eight years . For the responsibilities of a diplomatist at the court of a great and polished nation Mr. Rush was peculiarly fitted . His honorable descent , his intellectual culture , his intimate acquaintance with English literature , and his courteous manners , were well calculated to command that respect and consideration which further so effectually the official agency of a resident minister . Amidst the evidences of political decadence which late years have exhibited in the United States , it is pleasant to feel that the mission to England has been , we think we can say without exception , committed to men of culture and refinement . Political partisanship may send boors and drunkards to some European courts ; but a sense of decency still reguhites the appointments to others . The personal influence , and the recollections of the personal characteristics , of Adams , Everett , Ingersoll , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baleful effects of much Congressional vulgarity and of many a freebooting foray . In 1833 Mr. Rush favored the world with his interesting " Memoranda of a Residence at the Court of London , ** of which a new edition was published in 1845 . " His journal , " remarks the Edinburgh Review , " is the evident fruit of a sensible and // virtuous mind , - a mind loving truth , and ( what it is strange should be a compliment ) desirous of being pleased . " In 1825 Mr. Rush became Secretary of the Treasury , and occupied that post during the administration of John Quincy Adams ; and in 1828 he was nominated , on the same ticket with Mr. Adams , for the Vice-Presidency of the United States . In 1836 he was appointed by General Jackson to proceed to England and receive the Smithsonian bequest , and he successfully discharged the duties of this mission . In 1847 he was appointed American Minister at Paris , and was the first foreign ambassador who recognized the new government of 1848 . After his return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , dividing his time between the studies of his library and the hospitalities of his parlor , until his decease , on the 30th of July , 1859 . An admirable summary of the principal events of his life , accompanied with reflections upon his character , was prepared by his friend , Hon. Henry D. Gilpin , late Attorney-General of the United States , ( who survived him only about six months , ) and read at a meeting of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania , August 8th , 1859 . His death was also properly noticed , and a brief sketch of his public services presented , by Senator Pearce , of Maryland , at a meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution , held January 28 , 1860 . The volume before us is prefaced by a carefully prepared " Introduction , " by Mr. Rush 's executors , giving a brief history of the " Occasional Productions " which follow . The first title which meets our eye is , " Synopsis of a few Familiar Letters of Washington , to his Private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; with some Reflections . To which are added Four Letters in full . " Of this " Synopsis , " of which a few copies were published in 1857 , the " object was to speak of Washington at home , and thus to deduce from the small facts which drop familiarly from these private letters , whether they touch upon his household economy , his friends , kindred , or servants , reflections upon his domestic character , in proof of its comprehensiveness and richness . " In this republication we have the " Synopsis " as revised by the author , some emendations , and three letters and a short note believed // to be now for the first time published . The heading of the article is sufficiently attractive , - " Washington in Domestic Life " ; and we find him here , true to himself , endeavoring to carry out the strict discipline of the camp in the cabals of the kitchen - " He is glad to hear that the affairs of his household in Philadelphia go on so well , and tells Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how foolish it would be in the servants left there to enter into any combinations for supplanting those in authority ( meaning the upper servants ) . The attempt wquld he futile , and must recoil upon themselves ; and next , admitting that they were to make the lives of the present steward and housekeeper so uneasy as to induce them to quit , others would be got , and such , too , as would be equally , if not more , rigid in exacting the duty required of the servants below them ; the steward and housekeeper were indispensably necessary in taking the trouble off of Mrs. Washington 's hands and his own , and would he supported in the line of their duty , whilst any attempt to counteract them would be considered as the strongest evidence the other servants could give of their unworthiness . A good and faithful servant , he adds , was never afraid of having his conduct looked into , hut the reverse . " ( Mount Vernon , June 15 , 1791. ) - p. 49 . Under date of June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells Mr. Lear , - " that in the fall he shall want blankets for his servants and people at Mount Vernon ; and the summer being the best time for buying them , he wishes inquiry to be made on this subject , saying he should want about two hundred . He wants to see Paine 's answer to Burke 's pamphlet on the French Revolution , and requests it may be sent to him . He says that Paris ' has grown to be so lazy and self-willed that John , the coachman , says he has no sort of government of him , as he did nothing that he was told to do , and everything he was not . " - p. 30 . And this insubordination in Washington 's household ! Washington 's " Private Life ' * indeed ! -* there was little of privacy for him . Few things give us a more vivid conception of all that he sacrificed for the public , than the following lines from a letter to Mr. Lear , of which , and of another to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume : - " Unless some one pops in , unexpectedly , Mrs. Washington and myseW will do , what I believe has not been within the last twenty years by us , - that is , sit down to dinner by ourselves . " ( Mount Vernon , 3lst July , 1797. ) // Think of that , husband or wife , whose equanimity is COInpletely destroyed by seeing an extra plate on the table , or hearing an extra voice in the parlor , provoCative of the exclamation of " Bore ! " Imagine a series of " bores " for every succeeding day of twenty years . The next article , " Washington , Lafayette , and Mr. Bradford , " contains some allusions to Washington while he held the Presidential office , and resided in Philadelphia . The following can not be read without lively emotion by those who remember Washington 's letter on behalf of Lafayette . At the fireside of the chieftain , the French iRevolution of course was a frequent theme . " No single incident among the group of events was ever called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lafayette , then a prisoner in the dominions of the Emperor of Austria . " One evening when Mr. Bradford was there , and no company ; none present but the family circle , consisting of the General and Mrs. Washington , his private secretary , with young Custis and his accomplished sisters ; and the conversation going on with the wonted dignity and ease of that illustrious circle , the sufferings of Lafayette again became the theme . Washington , as he dwelt upon them , in contrast with the former fortunes and splendid merits of Lafayette in our cause , and recalling scenes also that awoke anew the warmth of his friendship for him , became greatly affected . His whole nature seemed melted . His eyes were suffused . Mr. Bradford saw it all ; and what a spectacle to be witnessed by a man whose own bosom was open to every generous impulse ! If the great Cond* , at the representation of one of Corneille 's tragedies , shed tears at the part where Caesar is made to utter a fine sentiment , what was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voltaire has so emblazoned it , to tears shed by Washington over the real woes of Lafayette ! Washington , a nation 's founder , and Lafayette , his heroic friend , who had crossed the ocean to fight the battles of liberty by his side ! Tears , tears they were fit for the first of heroes to have shed ! " Going home in the pensive tone of mind which a scene so moving at the fireside of Washington had created , Mr. Bradford sat down and wrote the following simple but touching little stanzas , the off-hand gushin* , s from the heart of a man of sensibility and genius . - pp. 99 , 100 . " The Lament of Washington , " also published in Griswold 's " ilepublican Court " and " Lossing 's Mount Vernon and its 42* // Associations , " follows the lines referred to in the above extract . " The Character of Mr. Calhoun , " first published in 1850 , and well received in South Carolina and elsewhere , is very properly republished among the " Occasional Productions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Invitation from the District of Penn , in the County of Philadelphia , referring to the Question of African Slavery and the Compromise Act of 1850 " ; and this is followed by " A Speech at the Meeting of the Friends of the Constitution and Union , held in Philadelphia , November 21 , 1850 . " In this speech , Mr. Rush gives a spirited and vivid account of the " Federal Procession " in Philadelphia , in 1788 . Mr. Webster 's reference to this exciting occasion , though he lacked the advantage of personal inspection which Mr. Rush possessed , will be recalled by some of our readers . " More than all , " says Mr. Rush , " there was a Sun ' The name of the ship I thus beheld moving as if by enchantment was the UNION . It was the glorious name , seen waving in the air in her flags , and placed in letters of gold upon her stern . Was not this enough to make Union men of all ? The feeling ran through my boyish veins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction in riper years . At all times , fellow-citizens , under all circumstances , at home and abroad , in peace and war , under all administrators , Republican or Whig , Federal or Democratic , let us rally round the Union . " - pp. 139 , 140 . In 1849 , Mr. William II . Trescot , of South Carolina , printed for private distribution , " A Few Thoughts on the Foreign Policy of the United States " ; and a copy presented , in 1851 , to Mr. Rush , elicited from him a " Letter upon Public and Diplomatic Subjects , " dated March 31,1851 . This " Letter , " and another , to be noticed presently , excited so much interest in gentlemen to whom they were submitted for perusal , that the author was induced to print a few copies , for circulation among his friends . They are now given to the public at large in the volume before us . In the first of these Letters we are glad to find an emphatic rebuke - a rebuke deriving great weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the censor - to that tone of schoolboy petulance , that vulgar , irrational , arrogant , and ignorant spirit , which disgraces so many American politicians when they have occasion , or make occasion , to refer to England and English institutions . // " Scarcely , " Mr. Rush writes , " do I know how to portray the novel feelings to which I have alluded , but will touch upon them . In the day of our comparative weakness , we had a feeling of uneasiness towards England . It was prone to think evil ; and , from many and obvious causes , was largely a harsh feeling . It never rose to fear , but was anxious and brooding , from the sense we had of her power . At the present era , the consciousness of our own power appears to be creating an insensibility to hers . The change , so far , is intelligible , to whatever extreme it may have gone . But the new position towards her at which we have arrived in regard to that great test among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its train another new feeling , even a new doctrine , hitherto as strange . The more strange is it , as the very reverse might rather have been anticipated with the ascending influence of the American name . We would throw her off altogether as our parent stock . We would strike at the very root on which so majestic a political fabric has been raised by us in this new land ! In portions of the Middle States , in parts of the great West , and in the Northwest , a doctrine is started , yes , truly , a doctrine is occasionally started and struggles to peep upwards , that we are not of the AngloSaxon race ! This , at first blush , may seem incredible . Indications of it may not have reached yon at the South ; but so it is . How much farther the notion is to go , what new shapes take , how much more of history is to be changed into fanciful and novel shapes for its sake , and for what ends , passes my comprehension , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it may be easily read . Others I need not recount . That the English are a mixed race is true ; and so much the better for them , as Macaulay has forcibly pointed out in some of the best pages of his History . That Scotland and Ireland are of her home empire all know . That from these portions of it we had large numbers of our people during and before the Revolution , of the highest ability and merit , as well as those of German and Dutch ancestry , and of French , from the Huguenots , is also true ; and equally true that the great American family has been strengthened and enriched by subsequent incorporations into it from these and other sources . It was so that Rome attained her final grandenr . But that the charters of the thirteen original Colonies which founded this great nation were all derived from England ; that Independence was declared in the English language ; that that is the language of the nation , its laws , literature , State papers , journals of Congress ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the records of its wonderful colonial growth and importance , as Burke truly , philosophically , and gorgeously described both , // in his imperishable speeches ; the language which embalms the immortal story of our Revolution , with Washington at its head , himself of full English descent ; the language which its other heroes and sages spoke , and the rich treasures of which formed their minds , taught them to think , and supplied them with the most effective of all their intellectual weapons for arguing down the exercise by England of arbitrary power over us , more , far more , than Grecian or Roman authors , who so often side with power against right ; that it is the language in which goes the word of command to our army and navy , and embodies the general orders after victory ; - such facts belong , to the past , as well as that we inherit trial by jury from the English , the habeas corpus from the English , and the great elements of the English common law . The solid , effulgent memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . The retrospect of them is the richest that any people under heaven have ever been able to claim as establishing their origin , and stamping the causes of their stupendous advancement in so brief a period of time . England , no other race ; England , with her host of famous men , in genius , science , letters ; in hardy , persevering , and bold enterprise ; in a high-spirited sense of independence and freedom ; famous in peace , famous in war ; famous all over the globe , by sea and land , before we were founded , - this England , with her wide circle of faults , wider of glory , - is the true parent stock of this great nation , deny it who may ; and that she is , will stand out in all time as her greatest glory of all . " - pp. 150 - 153 . The second Letter , to William II . Trescot , is upon " Public and Diplomatic Subjects , with References to the Course of the United States as a Neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War of 1812 . " The writer evinces a lively interest in Mr. Trescot 's researches into our diplomatic history , - researches which , as is well known , resulted in Mr. Trescot 's two treatises , entitled , " Diplomacy of the Revolution , " and " The Diplomatic History of the Administrations of Washington and Adams . " We extract a passage from this letter , as a specimen of nervous eloquence seldom surpassed . " The very act of our going to war was heroic . No language could be too strong in describing it . We were to fight against incalculably more odds than Napoleon did . We went out upon the deep with only a sling in our hands . We went upon the deep against a foe that it might have been thought would at once consign all our ships to its dark caverns . That foe had vanquished French ships wherever to be found , // brave as the French ever are , until all their ships were captured , sunk , or had to seek shelter from destruction by running into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them could venture any more upon the ocean , singly or in fleets . Not another gun could Napoleon mount at sea , with all his vast power on laud . A similar doom had awaited the navies of Holland , Spain , and all other nations . The idea of our coping with England even elicited sarcasms in the House of Commons . Canning , in one of his speeches , alluded to our flag as that little bit of striped bunting . ' Not only did we begin our war after Napoleon had exhausted , to no purpose but disasters to himself , his resources and efforts against England ; but there was more to appall us , had that feeling been in us . He had drawn upon the whole maritime border of the Mediterranean and Atlantic , among European nations of the Continent conquered and tributary to him , ( and which among them were not ? ) to aid him in ships and seamen to go against England on the seas , or invade her in her island . All these were scattered or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or made wrecks of them . Duncan at Camperdown , Howe on the 1st of June , 94 , Nelson at the Nile , Cochran in Basque Roads , Parker at Copenhagen , Nelson again at Trafalgar , - these names recall vividly , but only in part recall , the destruction which the naval thunders of England dealt among her foes , wht*rever it was possible for her to assail them . Never before was there such havoc on the sea by one nation against all the rest . All had yielded in hopeless submission to that one . For warlike purposes , it is not too much to say that Europe was annihilated upon the seas . The banner of the United States , alone , floated in solitary fearlessness . Lastly , we began the fight with a navy which was as nothing in size to the French navy , when Napoleon first had the direction of it against England . When , then , in all time , were such odds seen as we had against us ? I am unable to remember anything like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue , of the contest upon the great highway of nations , as we maintained it , after the daring manner in which we went into it ? Instead of our ships of war , few in number as they were , being driven from the seas , as Napoleon 's were , they increased in number as the war went on . They increased in the activity of their service and brilliancy of their victories . They were in all seas . They ran down to Cape Horn . They scoured the Pacific . They were all over the Atlantic . They went into the West Indies and the East Indies . Skilfully avoiding the enemy 's fleets , they hunted up his single ships . They watched in their paths . They entered the British Channel . In all latitudes they sought this gigantic foe on his own element . They strove to be foremost in the attack . They encountered // him ship to ship , with a chivalry , with a perfection of discipline , with a constant superiority in gunnery , * and with a success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . In vain did he plead that our ships were heavier than his . Sometimes they were . In some instances it was the reverse . In others his were not merely subdued , but shot to pieces and sunk in an almost incredibly short time . Glory , then , to this young and dauntless nation , which , relying upon itself alone to vindicate neutral rights , while Europe with folded arms was waiting to see it sacrificed , speedily and triumphantly broke the terrific spell of English invincibility upon the ocean . " The result riveted universal attention . Britain had ruled the waves . So her poets sang . So nations felt ; all but this young nation . Her trident had laid them all prostrate ; and how fond was she of considering this emblem as identified with the sceptre of the world ! Behold , then , the flag which had everywhere reigned in triumph supreme , sending forth terror from its folds - behold it again , and again , and again , lowered to the stars and stripes which had risen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European expectation that we were to be crushed , was turned into a feeling of admiration unbounded . Our victories had a moral effect far transcending the number or size of their ships vanquished . For such a blow upon the mighty name of England , after many idle *xcuses , she had at last no bnhn so effectual as that it was inflicted , and could only have been inflicted , by a race sprung from herself . " - pp. 167 - 171 . The " Character of Mr. Canning , " which follows , written while Mr. Rush was Secretary of the Treasury and a member of the Cabinet of President Adams , first appeared in 1827 , in the National Intelligencer , and was confidently ascribed to the pen of the President , Mr. Rush 's immediate predecessor at the Court of St. James . It was republished in England and quoted in the House of Lords . It now appears with some corrections by the hand of the author . We are next presented with a " Letter from Paris to Benjamin F. Hallett , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Democratic Party , assembled at Baltimore , declining , as Minister of the United States , to present to the National Assembly and the Executive Government of France Resolutions of Congratulation * " This is fully admitted by Major General Sir Howard Douglass , in his Trea. tise on Naval Gunnery , ' a book of high authority , published with the approbation of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty in England . " // from that Convention , " - a refusal which redounds greatly to Mr. Rush 's honor ; two essays , entitled " Value of Early Efforts at Excellence , " and " LaJ3or Necessary to Eminence , " - from the Philadelphia Portfolio of 1803 -4 ; and three " Letters to Mrs. Rush from London , " the first " Describing a Visit in 1836 to Grove Park , the Seat of the Earl of Clarendon , " the second " Describing a Visit at Christmas , 1836 , to ilagley , the Seat of Lord Lyttelton , " and the third " On the Death of William the Fourth , and Accession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Letters will be read at the parlor table , by the female part of the household , with more interest than they are generally disposed to expend upon such historical and political matters as occupy many of the pages of this volume . Mr. Rush was so fortunate as to pass the afternoon and evening with Lord Clarendon , on the day when he had officiated in the morning , as a Privy Councillor , in the duties connected with the ceremony of the passage of the crown to Victoria . " To his narrative , fresh from the scene , " Mr. Rush writes , " we all listened , as you may imagine , from curiosity , if no other feeling . " The Lord President ( Lord Lansdowne ) announced to the Council that they had met on the occasion of the demise of the crown ; then , with some others of the body , including the Premier , he left the Council for a short time , when all returned with the young Princess . She entered leaning upon the arm of her uncle , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Council-room , but resides in the same Palace , and had been with the Princess in an adjoining apartment . He conducted her to a chair at the head of the Council . A short time after she took her seat , she read the declaration which the sovereign makes on coining to the throne , and took the oath to govern the realm according to law , and cause justice to be executed in mercy . " The members of the Council then successively kneeled , one knee bending , and kissed the young Queen 's hand as she extended it to each ; for now she was the veritable Queen of England . Lord C. described the whole ceremony as performed in a very appropriate and graceful manner by the young lady . Some timidity was discernible at first , as she came into the room in presence of the Cabinet and Privy Councillors ; but it disappeared soon , and a becoming self-possession took its place . He noticed her discretion in not talking , except as the business of the ceremonial made it proper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Melbourne , as official head of the ministry , and her uncle the Duke of Sussex // " We heard all about it before it could get into the newspapers , a rare thing in England , bis Lordship having come almost immediately from the Palace , to greet his friends expected at this dinner " The important points of the story of the day told , and the dessert course finished , our accomplished host Lord Clarendon , addressing himself to me , with his mild expression of countenance tinged with archness , blandly remarked , Ho*v sadly you in your country have departed from the example of your good old English stock ! ' How ? ' I asked . How ? ' he replied ; why , could you elect a lady President of the United States ? ' This was something of a posing question , under the event and topics of the day . I sheltered myself by saying it was a constitutional question we had not yet raised .

" - pp. 264 - 267 . " I follow up the Smithsonian legacy , " he adds , " in a way that I hope may induce the Chancery lawyers to make an end of the business the sooner , if only to get rid of my teasing . " These racy Letters are followed by the " Correspondence with the Secretary of State , Mr. Marcy , ( under an Official Call , ) setting forth the Construction placed upon the Article in Relation to the Newfoundland Fisheries , in the Convention at London of 1818 , by the Negotiators of that Treaty . With an Explanatory Letter from the Author to his Executors . " The rest of the volume is occupied by " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1847 - 1848 ; and the French Revolution which followed , while the Author resided as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States at Paris . " The interest excited at home by Mr. Rush 's prompt action in acknowledging the Provisional Government , will be remembered by many of our readers . The new government was proclaimed on the 26th of February , 1848 ; on the 27th , M. Lamartine , the Minister of Foreign Affairs , officially notified the foreign ambassadors and ministers of the fact , and on the very next day Mr. Rush formally acknowledged the French Republic , and proffered to it the congratulations of the Republic // of the United States . The Considerations which induced a diplomatist of large experience and cautious character to venture on so bold a proceeding , are well explained by himself : - " Unwilling to take it the step without the knowledge of the Diplomatic Corps , not one of whom had I seen since the Revolutionary whirlwind , I determine to inform the English Ambassador , and , after my interview with Mr. Walsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my way , I invite him to go with me . His well-trained judgment , concurring with that of Mr. Walsh in the propriety of the course I had resolved on , gives me the united voice of my legation in its favor . " I found Lord Normanby at home . On the first intimation of my object , he mentioned what the morning papers had announced , hut what I had not seen ; namely , that I had already acknowledged the Provisional Government . I told him it was not the case , but that I was about to do so ; perhaps to-morrow . It was not agreeable to me , I said , to separate myself from my colleagues of the Diplomatic Corps on this occasion , even temporarily , as would probably be the case ; but I would not place myself in that situation without giving them information , and trusted to their liberal estimate of my position for rightly viewing the step I was about to take . I was too far off from my country to wait for instructions . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fallen into undue delay . The Provisional Government proclaimed a Republic as the government of France . France was our early fPiend and ally , when we were struggling for admission into the family of nations . She had now proclaimed a government like ours ; and my belief was that my government would expect me to be prompt in acknowledging it . These were the considerations appealing to me in the present exigency . It was to this general effect I made known my intention ; adding , that I came to him first , from the great intercourse between our two countries , as well as from my personal relations with himself . " It was plain that the English Ambassador had not expected such a communication from me . He asked if I designed it merely as a communication of my intention , and nothing more ; or whether I wished the expression of any opinions from him . I said I should be happy to hear any opinions he would express . He then said , that as to my distance , it was indeed peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other considerations to which I had adverted , was it for him to offer an opinion ; it was for me alone to attach to them whatever weight I thought fit . But otherwise my course , he must say , struck him as unusual . ' .

I concluded with a repetition of the hope General Washington expressed to the French Minister , Adet , at Philadelphia , in 1796 ,  --  that the friendship of the two Republics might be commensurate with their existence .

The whole sketch should be read in connection with Lord Normanby 's " Year of Revolution , " and Louis Blanc 's " Historical Revelations . " The references to Louis Napoleon Bonaparte in Mr. Rush 's " Glance " will excite special interest . The following extract from a speech of the present Emperor of France , delivered June 12th , 1848 , may , to borrow Gibbon 's phrase , " make the philosopher smile " : " The Empire ! who wishes for it ? It is a chimerical notion ; it will remain as a // great epoch in history , but can never be revived . " But they " have changed all that now " ! In conclusion , we need hardly remark that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep and permanent interest , which must take its place in the historical library by the side of the volumes of Sparks , Everett , Bancroft , Trescot , and Wheaton . Could we be assured of a succession of American statesmen and diplomatists of the same stamp as Richard Rush , we might confidently calculate for the future upon good management at home and reputable representation abroad .
