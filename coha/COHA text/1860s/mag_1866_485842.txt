MR . W. P. TISDEL , " U. S. Diplomatic Agent to the Free State of the Congo , " is now preparing his notes of travel in that section of Africa , and the book , profusely illustrated with pictures taken from photographs , will be of considerable interest . Mr. Tisdel travelled on and along the Congo and its tributaries nearly six months , penetrating into the interior as far as Stanley Pool , and visiting several entirely unknown parts of that country . He passed the great cataracts of the Congo , so graphically described by Stanley , hunted elephants and hippopotami , and had to fight his way through the country . So far only two works on the Congo have appeared  --  one written by Stanley himself ; the other by Mr. Johnston , an English newspaper correspondent and disciple of Stanley . Mr. Tisdel 's book will be the first by an independent observer who does not share Stanley 's enthusiasm , and will make some startling revelations about the true state of affairs on the Congo . A German edition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . M. de Brazza has very recently returned to France , and is about to write an account of his ten years ' work as an explorer in the valley of the Congo . The chief results of the expedition sent out by the French Government in 1883 under his lead are summed up as follows by the Temps : A territory equal in extent to France has been acquired on the right bank of the Congo , a large part of which is high and well-watered tableland . Twenty-five stations have been founded ; over twenty-five hundred miles of river courses have been surveyed , and a regular communication between the interior and the coast , by means of the Niadi and Ogowe Rivers , has been established . The cost of this expedition to the Government has been 2,145,000 francs . An American edition of Mr. George Saintsbury 's new Specimens of English Prose Style ' will be issued at once by Jansen , McClurg &; Co. , Chicago . Evolution and Religion , ' a lecture by the Rev. M. J. Savage , will he published in pamphlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sermons Preached in the First Church , Boston , ' by the late Rufus Ellis , D. D. , is in the press of Cupples , Upham &; Co . The forthcoming report of the New York Shakspere Society cn the supposed original autograph of Shakspere now in possession of C. F. Gunther , of Chicago , will be accompanied by full detail photographs of the folio , of the autograph , and of the various memoranda , signatures , and inscriptions on the folio and its bindings . The report will be printed in the regular series of the Society 's publications . Having , in his Old Times , ' brought us to the close of the last century , Mr. John Ashton , like some panoramic showman , draws the curtain on The Dawn of the Nineteenth Century in England ' ( Putnams ) . The periodical extent of the dawn is the first decade , whose leading politico-economic events Mr. Ashton summarizes as is his wont , and then proceeds ( when the first of his two volumes is nearly exhausted ) to exhibit life on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is London he has in view more than England ) , and in society . He tells of modes of conveyance , of oil and gas lighting , of police , of cock-fighting and gambling , of hunting , of costume , of concerts , of theatres and attendant rioting , of painting , of the press , of medicine , of army and navy , of smuggling , of executions , etc. , etc . All these topics he illustrates in the usual way  --  textually by extracts from the newspapers of the time , and pictorially by his own tracings from contemporary caricatures and broadsides . Any one who has read his former works knows just what this is : like the March Hare and the Hatter at table in Alice 's Adventures , ' Mr. Ashton has " moved up " one plate for his new feast . He is not a master in this kind of historical purveying , but he has the field pretty much to himself , and his pages contain a great deal of amusement and information . We have already said our say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is enough to note here a second edition in a single volume and less expensive , but still handsomely made , by Macmillan &; Co . A Winter Holiday , ' by W imam F. Hutchinson ( printed by the Providence Press Co. ) , tells a good many interesting things about a trip to St. Augustine , Cuba , Nassau , and one or two other of the Bahamas . The style is uneven , and sometimes degenerates to something lower than the colloquial ; and the book has too much the air of an advertisement . The new Harvard University catalogue exhibits two innovations , one the fresh design for the college seal on the title-page ; the other the map at the end , on which are set down the college buildings and even the residences of the professors , together with a considerable portion of the city of Cambridge . This is a much-needed improvement . The catalogue can be had in New York of F. W. Christern , 37 West Twenty-third Street . No number of Le Francais has been a better example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and finally the editor is obliged to suspend publication . His experience has certainly shown that for such a help to the study and enjoyment of French there is not , as he says , a era ) besoin , or , as our American idiom is. a paying demand . On every account this is much to be regretted , but M. Levy has the rare satisfaction of having left nothing undone to merit success ; and if he has at last shared the fate of his predecessors , in point of achievement he greatly surpassed them all . In MOtisine for November 20 M. H. Gaidoz leads off with a paper on folk-lore in the United States , paying particular attention to Mr. W. W. Newell 's excellent work on the ' Games and Songs of American Children ' ( harpers. 1883 ) , which he praises in very high terms , and ranks among the best European writings on the subject . He pays it the further compliment of an appendix , supplementing its bibliography . Book-Lore enters on its second volume with the December number . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Astor Place , New York . The National Exposition at Buda-Pesth has naturally its Fine Arts section . of which the illustrated catalogue , in three languages , has just come to hand ( New York : F. W. Christern ) . We are assured in the introduction that this collection of paintings and statuary fairly represents the artistic impulse of the past decade in Hungary . If so , it is certainly of good omen , for . judged by these process cuts , there is very little extravagance in the artistic tendency , while the national spirit is so prevalent that there is a remarkable freshness in this catalogue as compared . say , with that of the Salon . W e see it in the landscapes . the domestic pictures , the portraits . and the historical compositions . which are not too numerous . One remarks among the portraits a fine one of Tisza . The Commission appointed to prepare a ' History of the Jews of Germany ' has determined to publish , as preliminary to this work , complete chronological lists of all documents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jews of the Frankish and German Empires down to the accession of Rudolph of Hapsburg , in 1273 . A journal will also be issued containing minor miscellaneous historical material . The plan of the Commission includes in addition the publication of translations of all works in the Hebrew language , both manuscript and printed , relating to the Jews , and as introductory to this a bibliography of all such works will be published . Reise der russischen 0 esandtschaf t in Afghanistan and Bukhara in den Jahren 1878-1879 ' ( 2 vols . ; Jena , 1885 ) is the title of the German translation of a highly interesting Russian book of travels and personal adventure by Dr. Yavorski ( in German transliteration , " Jaworskij " ) . The author was the medical attendant of General Stolietoff in the embassy to Emir Shir Ali , start , ed during the /nterval between the conclusion of the treaty of San Stefano and that of the treaty of Berlin , when Russia , exasperated by Beaconsfield 's threatened intervention in Turkey , was anxious to create for herself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India . The Emir was won over , which led to England 's declaration of war against Afghanis tan , whereupon Stolietoff hastily left Kabul , accompanied only by Dr. Yavorski , and returned to Tashkent , in Russian Turkistan . The physician was sent back to join the rest of the embassy , and met it at Massari Sherif , in Afghan Turkistan , whither it had retired with Shir Ali in his flight before the British advance . He remained at the side of the fugitive Prince till the latter 's death , in February , 1879 , and then , surrounded by turbulent soldiery , sought refuge across the Oxus , in the dominions of the Emir of Bukhara , at whose court he remained for a time , until circumstances allowed him to return to Tashkent . The narrative is uncommonly rich in particulars gained from close observation and study concerning the physical , ethnographical , and political conditions of the countries visited , to which the translator , Dr. Eduard Petri , has added an introduction and valuable explanatory notes . More pressing publications have forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we note from time to time . From B. Westermann &; Co. we have received Parts 4-7 of Prof. G. Droysen 's Allgemeiner Historischer Handatlas , ' with its fine open maps  --  this double-page one of Germany in the time of the Reformation , for example , being about 14x18 in. , and most minutely colored . Part 5 contains numerous plans of the Continental battlefields of 1864-71 on a large scale , and in one view the ground fought over by France and Germany in 1870-71 . In Part 7 Elsass-Lothringen from 1648 to 1780 is shown in one large and three small maps . A copious text accompanies each of the parts , of which three more will complete the woik , embracing ninety-six maps , at a cost of twenty marks . Of the Allgemeine Naturkunde ' ( Westermann ) . Parts 2-10 are before us , all devoted to ethnography , and all to Africa . The text is by Prof. Dr. Friedrich Ratzel , and of correspondingly high authority are the illustrations . These are very numerous , and mostly from photographs . and possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in groups and in individual portraiture , our old friend Ketchwyo ( to spell his name phonetically ) being shown hi this gallery . We must also remark the frequent colored plates of weapons , tools , ornaments , etc. , as well as of native Africans ; they are admirably executed . Of higher grade typographically ( but not pictorially , though the cuts are fine ) is the popular Allgemaine 1Veltgeschichte ' of Flathe , Hertzberg , and their associates ( Westermann ) . The new parts of this are 23-28 , and include Hertz-berg 's ' History of the Ancient Romans , ' without finishing it . The illustrations are plentiful in the text and on separate leaves . Meyer 's Konversations-Lexikon , ' in the fourth edition , has completed its second volume and begun the third with Parts 1 , 2 , ending with Bogorodizk . The leading general articles are on building and statuary , beer , Berlin , Burmah. population , and flowers ; the fullest biographical on Beaconsfield , Beethoven , and Bismarck . The illustrations to statuary are very delicate and exemplify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a page of Gutenberg 's forty-line Latin Bible of 1455 , and four pages of autographs , all European . Among the maps , we can cite two of Berlin and its environs , and also Baden , Belgium , and Bohemia . It marks the rapid changes in Oriental politics that when the article on Burma was closed , France seemed to be the Power about to bring that country into relations with Europe . The new Brockhaus 's Conversations-Lexikon ' ( L. W. Schmidt ) also shows in its new parts 172 to 177 what it can do in colored illustration , with a fine plate of polychromatic ornaments , and another of the principal orders . Austria-Hun gary and its " annexes " carry off the honors in the map series . From the ethnographic map of the Austrian Empire , which includes the larger part of the Balkan States , it appears that not only are there no Serbs in the territory claimed by King Milan as compensation for the aggrandizement of Bulgaria , but that the Bulgars are the main inhabitants of the country now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the junction of the Nishawa and Bulgarian-Morawa Rivers . If a line should be drawn from this point to the northern boundary of the Widdtn District , a large proportion of the inhabitants of the Servian territory south of it would be found to be Bulgars , the Serbs occupying only a part of the central portion . Excellent are the customary folded plates of birds , stones , plants , etc . The articles Austria , Ottoman Empire , and East Indies make a timely appearance . Paris is treated at length , and the work pauses at George Peabody . The lesser Brockhaus ( L. W. Schmidt ) has attained its thirtieth part and first volume , ending with Hensler . A correspondent informs us that two years ago at Newnham College , Cambridge , England , the girl students conducted a society analogous to the Johns Hopkins House of Commons , with a Liberal and a Conservative side , and discussions on leading Parliamentary topics . Still another calls attention to an article by the late Blanchard Jerrold in the Nineteenth Century for June , 1883 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at that date more than a hundred Houses of Commons " were in existence in England , some of them having more than a thousand members , and one of them ( in Liverpool ) being twenty-five years old . What is particularly noteworthy here is that they are not organizations of students , nor confined to young men . They are , in fact , a good deal like our debating societies , lyceums , etc . ? The January Atlantic makes no effort to astonish the New Year with the signs of its prosperity . The first chapters of a fresh serial by Miss Murfree , and another opening of the " New Portfolio , " which it is evident age is never to have a chance of withering , naturally mark the beginning of a volume , but without ostentation . The noticeable thing in the number , in a literary way , is the editor 's breaking of a long silence in fiction by a story . " Two Bites at a Cherry , " plotted with characteristic surprise , and as felicitous in its art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incessant interplay of thought , image , and wit , which is the author 's charm in prose , it carries us safely over even the pitiless comedy of its finale . A truly notable article , too , is that on " The Free Negroes of North Carolina , " instructive both as to the condition of the blacks in ante-bellum days , and as to the curious social phases of the Southern poor at present , over which light is gradually stealing . The race here discussed is the original or manumitted Negro , in distinction to that of the Freedmen , which settled in the border counties and along the then worthless coast . It will be news to some to find , what is true , that the free negroes enjoyed the right of suffrage unti11885 ; and the peculiar conditions in North Carolina which made their lot more tolerable than elsewhere , as well as the nonenforcement of the violent laws of the reactionary and terrorized period , are so treated as to throw a good deal of light on history . It seems that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the Old Issue " and the " New Issue , " as they call each other  --  and that the old race is destined to decay and extinction , in the writer 's view , partly because of their hybridity  --  the three-fold strain of white , black , and Indian  --  and partly because of " the innate indolence and shiftlessness " of a race never compelled to habits of industry , and insensible to the sthnoDec 24 1885 lus which their newly acquired freedom gave to the freedmen . ? Harper 's is distinguished by the first appearance of Mr. Howells as the occupant of the ? ' Study , " in whose atmosphere at the first rising of the curtain there is more geniality than light . An interesting literary contribution is that of Mr. Conway 's , in which he lays the wandering newspaper ghost of that " pall-bearer of William Shakspere " who was buried in Virginia . The stone seems to have been found , and the erased inscription recovered from a soldier 's diary . The date , 1618 , makes it our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funeral at Stratford . General McCiellan 's paper on the militia is the most important in the number , in public interest . That it advocates a new army and militia is a matter of course , and General McClellan gives his advice in detail as to its formation , composition , training , and disposition in the different parts of the country . The reasons with which he supports the general demand are not uncommon ones , and are certainly to be admitted as valid for a reform of some sort in our system of defence and armed national police , though perhaps so complete a system as he argues for may be a matter of army logic rather than civil necessity . One reason only we note as unusual , and it is to be observed that it is given in connection with a prophecy of a speedy restoration of our mercantile navy . Then , says General McClellan , " we will begin to ask ourselves by what right a foreign nation holds a cordon of fortified naval stations commanding so many avenues of approach to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the event of war . " He refers to Halifax , the Bermudas , Nassau , and Jamaica ; and clinches his comment by deAaring that had we possessed the Bermudas and Nassau the civil war would have been shortened " by some two years . " ? The prediction of cold waves by the Signal Service is one of the most practical and successful of their efforts . The smaller needs of the individual householder who shakes down and covers over his own furnace , as well as the larger interests of the dealers who ship cattle by the carload from the West , and the requirements of the unattractive occupation that is thought to be characteristic of Cincinnati , are all served by the timely announcement of the change from thawing to freezing weather . A recent Signal Service note on ' Cold Waves and Their Progress , ' by Lieutenant Woodruff , is therefore of more than usual popular interest . It is based on an examination of the cold waves occurring from January to June in the years 1881-84 , when eighty-eight sudden abnormal falls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the far Northwest ; 15 per cent . of them came from the Pacific , but the larger remaining portion were first detected in Montana or Dakota . It is therefore conclmied that their origin is north of our stations , in British America . They always follow an area of low barometer , and are accompanied by high pressure ; and if the movements of these latter could be definitely predetermined , the prediction of the progress of the cold waves would be made more accurate than it now is . According to their direction of advance , three classes of waves are distinguished : the first move eastward over the great lakes and across New England , not extending south of the Ohio ; the second spread southeastward and cover the whole country east of the Rockies in their progress , and this class occurs as frequently as the other two together ; the third move southward from Montana and Dakota to Texas , then eastward over the Gulf States , and finally to the Atlantic slope ? these sometimes are felt at St. Louis and Shreveport before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sixty-six reached Bismarck as soon as Helena ; Washington has to wait thirty-two to fifty-six hours later for their appearance . The cold wave that spread over the country on March 18 and 19 , 1883 , is described in some detail as a well-marked and typical illustration of the phenomena in question : from New England to Texas there extended a broad belt of country within which the temperature fell 20 ' to 40 ' , and even 4i ' , in twenty-four hours . A comprehensive table , giving the numerical elements of the eighty-eight waves , closes the note . ? Not long ago Capt . Willard Glazier succeeded in gaining considerable newspaper notoriety by reason of his alleged discovery of a new source for the Mississippi River , in he form of a lake higher up on the stream than Lake Itasca . To this lake he modestly attached his own name , while the members of his family , his sisters and his cousins and his aunts , were all remembered in the distribution of names upm the minor lakes and streams in the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest to have his preposterous claims as a geographical discoverer recognized and his names adopted by the map-makers . As is well known , the country about the head of the Mississippi is not by any means a terra incognita . In 1832 Schooleraft explored the river to Lake Itasca , which he discovered . In 1836 Nicollet extended the work , including in his area of exploration the region drained by the affluents of this lake . He describes no fewer than five small lakes or ponds which are drained into Lake Itasca , and unquestionably one of these is Lake Glazier . " In later years settlements , roads , and railroads have approached the region , lumbermen have thoroughly explored it , and finally , in 1876 , it was sectionized by the General Land Office . Lines were run at intervals of a mile , both in the direction of a parallel and of a meridian , and every lake and pond half a mile in length was surveyed by traverse . A survey of this kind leaves little room for geographical discoveries . Five years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From his map and narrative it is easy to see that his " Lake Glazier " is identical with Elk Lake , of the Land Office plat , which is situated in township 143 north , range 36 west . This lake , or rather pond , has an area of about half a square mile , and is about 200 yards distant from the extremity of the southwest arm of Lake Itasca . ? The Japanese seem determined to be in line with the other civilized nations of the world , and their seriousness and perseverance contrast sharply with that trivial view of them which is popularly held in Christendom . Americans are even surprised when told that the subjects of the Mikado do not enjoy the burlesque and caricature of him as seen on the theatre boards , and accepted as the mirror of fact and history . One of the most recent indications of progress in Dai Nippon is the formation of the Roma-ji Kai ( Roman Alphabet Association ) in TOkid . The object of this band Of scholars , which is composed of both natives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of writing and printing , borrowed from China , and to substitute the Roman letters . Most of the Japanese members are students who have studied in Europe or the United States , and are familiar with one or more of the modern languages of the West . They propose to use twenty-two of the twenty-six Roman letters , omitting 1 , q , v , and x . After much labor , the committee of forty members , adopting the standard pronunciation of the capital TC46.5 , agreed upon a simple system , and the Society is now prepared to print , in accordance with it , both books and vernacular newspapers . They accept the consonants at their usual English values , and the vowels at those of Italian ( German or Latin ) , and thus write Japanese words , discarding the usual kana spelling . Heretofore the Chinese ideographs have been employed in writing on serious subjects , and the Japanese syllabary of forty-eight sounds for phonetic transliteration , for trivial correspondence , story-books , novels . and such literature as uneducated women and children make use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and use of the system of the Roma-ji Kai , a Japanese lad may learn to read as w ell in one year as of old he was able to read in ten years . Seine go so far as to make the advantage fifty times greater  --  a week in Roma-ji being equal to a year in Shina-ji . Of course , easy practical use of books printed in Romanizad Japanese presupposes a knowledge of the spoken tongue . Already the members of the Roma-ji Kai have begun to print a newspaper ; prominent journals are devoting a column per day to matter printed in Roman letters ; and dictionaries , text-books , native literature , and the classic texts are to be thus set forth . It will thus be possible for Europeans to study Japanese without trial to the eyes , and waste of years in deciphering and remembering the so-called idea-writings of the Chinese . As matter of fact , the Chinese characters are no better fitted to express Japanese than to express Latin or English . The Roman letter is thus destined to be in eapan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seems highly probable that the Roma-ji system will prevail in Japan . The missionaries and native Christians already make use of it to an encouraging degree . The entire New Testament and specimens of the growing Christian literature are now published with twenty-two letters . Prof. Martin N. Wyckoff , who has recently prepared for the press in TOkiii a work in Japanese on English rhetoric and ! oinposition , after composing it in the Chinese character and native kana , at the last moment transliterated his MS. into Roma-ji , because , as he says , it " is now the fashion . " The pioneer and persistent advocate of the system , who must now rejoice in the flattering prospect of long-awaited triumph , is our own American scholar , Dr. J. C. Hepburn , of Kanagawa . Besides his missionary and medical labors since 1859 , Doctor Hepburn , who has made the standard Japanese-English dictionary , issued the first edition in 1867 , and the fourth is now nearly ready . In this monumental work , from first to last he has made use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in whose conferences he has taken part . As early as 1873 he issued the translated New Testament in Romanized Japanese . Much credit for the final results is also to be given to Mr. Basil Hall Chamberlain , the accomplished English translator of the Ko-ji-ki , or Japanese " Bible , " and the Rev. C. E. Eby , an American missionary .
