txt ART . I. - Uiiitvres Comple*tes d'ALExJS DE TOCQUEVILLE . Tomes VII . and VIII . Paris . 1865 . MANY among us are old enough to remember the visit of Messrs . de Tocqueville and de Beaumont , and the sensation produced throughout Christendom by the appearance of La Democratie en Am*rique , from the pen of the former of these gentlemen . Democracy in America ! Who in the year 1832 could have foretold the meaning these words would have in this year 1866 ? If it were given to any human being then living to foresee the condition and prospects of our country at this moment , that person was certainly not M. de Tocqueville . Much as he studied and well as he understood our institutions , - and he studied them deeply and with great fairness , - he signally failed , as late events have shown , to discover the real secret of their nature , or to fathom the character of our people . His book has been so much read , and has had , as we think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , as to have led to great misunderstanding in relation to the late Rebellion . Under this persuasion , we believe that a little time may be well spent in pointing out , and accounting for , a very grave mistake of the writer in a most important particular . It will be recollected that Messrs . de Tocqueville and de Beaumont were sent by King Louis Philippe expressly to study the institutions of the United States ; and certainly the task // could not have been confided to better hands . As regards M. de Tocqueville , besides his other qualifications , no one who had the pleasure of his acquaintance can have failed to notice an urbanity and courtesy of manner such as are seldom met with . A grandson of the great and virtuous Malesherbes , he had all the refinement and rational love of liberty which belonged to what was called in France Ut noblesse de robe , - a title by which the old families of the legal profession were known , - naturally coupled with the feeling of caste which belongs to such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it will tend to account for the general ton* of Mi. de Tocqueville 's opinions . The clew to that gentleman 's theories can in no way be so well given as in his own words . The Introduction to his " Democracy in America " begins thus . ( We will here premise , that , having no English copy at hand , we translate from Gosselin 's Paris edition of 1836 . ) " Among the novel objects which , during my stay in the United States , attracted my attention , none struck me more forcibly than the equality of conditions . I soon discovered the prodigious influence of this leading fact on the march of society ; it gives a certain direction to public spirit , a certain character to the laws ; new maxims to those who govern , and peculiar habits to the governed . I at once saw that this same fact extends its influence far beyond political and legal questions , and that it is no less powerful in its operation on civil society than on the government . It creates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and modifies all that it does not originate . " He then goes on to speak of Europe , and gives a most clear and interesting account of the growth of the same spirit of equality there , especially in France , and sums up as follows - " The whole hook on which the reader is now to enter has been written under the impression of a sort of religious terror , produced in the mind of the author by the prospect of this irresistible revolution , which has been marching on through so many ages in spite of every obstacle , and which we still see advancing in the midst of the ruins itself has made . " He draws a very just distinction between the result of this tendency in France and in the United States ; but it is easy to see that the dread of our example in this respect is a bugbear which perpetually haunts him . // It is moreover very important , in forming a judgment of the value of M. de Tocqueville 's work , to keep in mind the state in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his visit in 1832 . It was , as we all know , most critical . The prologue was then being recited of the great drama on which the curtain has just fallen . John C. Calhoun was then at the acme of his doleful career ; the cry of nullification was then at its loudest , to be succeeded in no long time by the more appalling watchword of Secession . State rights , the true construction of the Constitution , the Virginia Resolutions of 1T98 , tariffs , and the " fortybale " theory were the standing topics of angry discussion in all parts of the Union . While the controversy was carried on at the North with quite enough of eagerness and warmth , it was raging south of Mason and Dixon 's line with a degree of bitterness which might well cause astonishment to a foreigner newly come among us , and tend to mislead him in his estimate of the people and government . It was at such a period that M. de Tocqueville set foot on our shores , with a sincere desire to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the probable destiny of our country . What means he took to this end will be best explained by himself . " When , " he says in his Introduction , " a point could be settled by means of written documents , I have been careful to refer to the original texts or to the most authentic and highly approved works . I have in my notes pointed out my authorities , which any one may verify . Whenever it was a question of opinions , of political customs , or of the study of manners , I have endeavored to consult the best-informed persons . In respect to important or doubtful matters , I was not contented with a single witness , but decided upon a balance of authorities . " Here I must of course ask the reader to believe me on my simple word . I might often have cited , in support of what I advance , the authority of names which either are or deserve to be well known , hut I have abstained from doing so . The stranger is often made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important truths which the latter would perhaps have withheld from the ear of friendship ; with him constrained silence is relieved ; there is nothing to fear from his imprudence , for he passes on . " All these confidential communications were recorded by me as I received them , but they will never go beyond my portfolio . I prefer to weaken the effect of my statements , than to add my name to the // list of travellers who repay by mortification and embarrassment the generous hospitality they have received . " This resolution of M. de Tocqueville is no more than might have been expected from his propriety of feeling . This praiseworthy reticence locks up , however , as we suppose , the key to the true interpretation of M. de Tocqueville 's book . Could we see the authority for some of the writer 's heresies , we should probably have little difficulty in recognizing the ear-mark of their true owner . The result of M. de Tocqueville 's mode of proceeding is just what might have been looked for . So long as he discusses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets at by consulting historical and other documents , nothing can be more fair or more trustworthy than what he has to say . Not only are his facts indisputable , but his manner of stating and elucidating them is all that could be wished . Not so when he comes to deal with the questions of the day , and the future of the United States . That section of his tenth chapter which is headed , " What are the Chances of the Duration of the American Union , and what are the Dangers which threaten it , " is a standiiag example of reasoning refuted by events , as well as a warning to authors , however able , who undertake to pronounce upon the institutions of a country on the strength of a few months ' acquaintance . M. de Tocqueville fell into the mistake of attempting to decide , by a process of reasoning a priori , a question not to be s*ttled but by the crucial test , which might never be applied . He assumes at the outset that the United States are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says - " If a contest should arise to-day between the States and the Union , it is easy to perceive that the latter must succumb . I question even whether the struggle could ever he brought to a serious issue . Whenever an ohstinate resistance shall be made to the Federal government , it will give in ( on le verra c&amp;Ier ) . Experience has proved thus far , that , whenever a state has obstinately insisted upon anything , and was resolved to obtain what it asked , it has never failed to succeed ; and when it has refused point-blank to act , it has been let alone . " // ing which , though now quite worthless otherwise , is not without its use in showing how the wisest men may deceive themselves when arguing in support of a foregone conclusion . He lays down with great minuteness the distinction between the prerogatives which belong to the national government and those which belong to the separate States , and concludes that the latter must needs prevail over the former ; that the local soyereiguties are constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily more and more weak , must finally die of inanition , He follows up the argument with a cogency of logic which defies all refutation , winding up the whole with an axiom from which , he ventures to affirm , there is no escape . " It seems then certain to me , that if one portion of the Union wished seriously to separate from the other , not only would it be impossible to prevent it , but that prevention would not even be attempted . The existing government will therefore last only so long as every one of the States composing it shall continue to wish to form a part of it . " So confident is M. de Tocqueville that this position is impregnable , that he goes on in the following complacent strain : - " This point settled , we see our way more clearly ( nous voici plus *i l'aise ) . We need no longer trouble ourselves to inquire whether the confederate States actually can separate , but whether or not they will desire to remain united . " He then goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain together ; which , in the existing state of things , is , to say the least , amusing . A favorite notion of M. de Tocqueville was , that the State governments , being more immediately connected with the domestic interests and every-day concerns of men , would in time become the great objects of ambition , and would eventually gain the ascendency over the national Congress . Now , nothing is more notorious than that the fact is just the other way . As the concerns of the nation become more vast , and the offices , diplomatic and domestic , more important and desirable , a seat in Congress is the constant aim of every aspirant for political distinction ; the local legislatures being , for such men , merely stepping-stones to that object . // But we will allow M. de Tocqueville to proceed with the development of his views on the general question of the nationality of the United States . He says further : - " I have shown , in another place , that the object of the Federal Constitution was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . The Americans , in all the cases provided for in their Constitution , form but one and the same people . Upon all these points , the national will , as in all constitutional communities , is expressed by means of majorities . The majority having once decided , the duty of the minority is to submit . Such is the legal doctrine , and the only one in accordance with the text of the Constitution and the known intentions of those who established it . " The nullifiers of the South affirm , on the contrary , that the Americans , in forming the Union , had no intention of consolidating themselves into one and the same people , but that they meant only to form a league of independent States ; whence it follows that each State , having preserved its complete sovereignty , if not in action , at least in principle , has the right to interpret the laws of Congress , and to suspend , within its own limits , those which it thinks opposed to the Constitution or to justice . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1833 before the Senate of the United States by Mr. Calhoun , the acknowledged leader of the nullifiers of the South . The Constitution , ' he says , is a contract , in which the States appear in the attitude of sovereigns . Now , wherever a contract is made between parties who acknowledge no common arbiter , each of them reserves to itself the right of judging independently the extent of its obligation . ' It is manifest , " adds M. de Tocqueville , " that a doctrine like this annuls in principle the federal bond , and , in fact , brings back the state of anarchy from which the Americans had been delivered by the Constitution of the United States . " We here see Mr. Calhoun laying down the law without the least reservation , and begging the whole question in dispute ; and we have seen M. de Tocqueville coming to the same result by a logical argument in all the forms . M. de Tocqueville here declares , very justly , that Mr. Calhoun 's doctrine leads to anarchy , by annulling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved , to his own satisfaction at least , that the doctrine may be sustained by strictly logical reasoning . It follows that M. de Tocqueville himself thinks that the federal bond // 1866 . The Error of De Tocqueville. is of no virtue , being dependent on the will of any one recalcitrant State ; consequently the Americans are constantly threatened with a return of the state of anarchy from which they were delivered by the Constitution . We might go further ; but we think our readers will by this time agree with us , that M. de Tocqueville 's " religious terror " of social equality , imperceptibly to himself , warped his judgment . We propose to show presently some of the effects of his false conclusions . With his hereditary prejudices , it is perhaps unfortunate that his visit to this country took place just at the moment when the great convulsion , whose heavings have not yet subsided , was beginning to stir the minds of men . Assailed on all sides by the clashing doctrines of contending parties ; misled , or bewildered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarmed at the growth of levelling ideas which had , not long before , rent his native country , - he was but too ready to seek , in the probable preponderance of State rights , a last hope for the old conservative doctrines which were struggling at home against the two extremes of popular license and the despotism of a single ruler . He accordingly misunderstood the vacillation of the Executive when the State of South Carolina boldly put forward pretensions to a right to nullify the decrees of Congress , and asserted the sovereignty she claimed never to have parted with . He attributed the unwillingness of Congress to deal summarily with such a case to a consciousness of weakness , whereas it grew out of love of the Union , and the desire to stave off as long as possible , by temporizing and compromise , the dreaded moment when the question of nationality must be met . All men felt a dread of what many saw to be inevitable , and hoped to pass the bitter draught to another generation . The gifted author had hardly closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had pondered with such anxious solicitude was . solved . So long as there was hope of preserving the Constitution by mildness and forbearance , the people of the United States held back from the fated contest . Once convinced that the Union was seriously assailed , and the existence of the government // endangered , they sprang to their feet , and scattered to the winds the whole fabric of sophistries which had muddled the brains of political dreamers at home , and fed the hopes of the enemies of freedom the world over . Where are now the visions of Calhoun ? Where the cobweb arguments of pragmatical lawyers , who , blinded by prejudice or slaves of literal construction , could not see the difference between a traitor with arms in his hands and a political partisan in ordinary l4mes ? Where is now the godlike institution which formed the corner-stone of Alexander Stephens 's new empire ? Where the nation which , according to high English authority , Jefferson Davis founded ? It is not a little remarkable , too , that an act , passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit , in which the supremacy of the Federal government was pushed the farthest , was carried through Congress by the unanimous vote of the Southern members .. The Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 was called for by the slaveholders , as necessary for the protection of their Constitutional rights , and as the price of their continued loyalty to the Union . It is only necessary to cite the provisions of this bill to show the utter hollowness of the pretence that the States , as such ; had a right to override the enactments of Congress . The old act of 1793 provided that the runaway slave should be arrested and brought before any judge of a court of record , whether national or State , or any simple justice of the peace , who were authorized to surrender him , with no testimony but that of the claimant or his agent , while the testimony of the person claimed was not received , nor a trial by jury allowed . This would seem to be a pretty summary mode of proceeding , but it was not enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peace were not so tractable as could be wished , and the old law had nearly fallen into desuetude , when , in 1850 , what was called the Compromise was got up , of which the new law formed a part . The penalty for resisting or impeding the execution of the law , which by the old act was a fine of $500 , was by the new one a fine of $1,000 , with imprisonment not exceeding six months , besides $1,000 to be recovered in a civil suit for each slave aided or harbored . But the clause which struck at the very heart of State rights and // 1866 . The Error of De Tocqueville. nullification was that which substituted for the old courts of record and justices of the peace , who were mostly State officers , a set of commissioners , to be appointed by the government at Washington , and responsible to it only , thus disregarding or ignoring entirely the pretension of State sovereignty . Could such a clause have been passed in a body which considered itself as representing merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remonstrance on that ground ? Certainly not ; yet ghastly as the act was , and abhorrent to the feelings of many Northern members , no such objection was made , for the very good reason that there was no authority for making it in the Constitution . What would Mr. James M. Mason of Virginia , the father of this act , and now the impersonation of Secession , have said , had it been pretended that any State could nullify and refuse to enforce his frightful enactment ? No ! th** doctrine of the right of secession was brought forward as a convenient rallying-cry to help on a desperate cause and uphold a doomed institution . The fact that such an act was within the constitutional powers of Congress , coupled with a subsequent decision of the Supreme Court , roused the people of the Free States to the conviction that the institution of slavery was incompatible with the existing government ; and that , unless put an end to , it would inevitably be extended over the whole Union . The question then was to devise some constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got rid of . The plan hit upon was to begin by prohibiting it in the Territories , which were the property of the whole nation . It was on this understanding that Mr. Lincoln was nominated . To use a cant phrase , this was the Republican platform . Mr. Lincoln being carried in on this ground , the Southern slaveholders saw at once the necessary consequence . It was for them to decide whether to allow their cherished institution gradually to dwindle , and themselves to be shorn of their political power , as the existing Territories successively took their places as Free States , or to resort to the desperate step of taking up arms and defying the government . they , in an evil hour for themselves , decided for the last , and we see the result . On the subject of slavery M. de Tocqueville was more fortu // nate . He foretold that it must come to an end , but was mistaken as to the means by which its abolition was to be brought about . But let him speak for himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South to preserve slavery , they will eventually fail . Slavery , pent up in a single spot on th' earth 's surface , attacked by Christianity as unjust , by political economy as disastrous , - slavery , in the midst of democratic liberty , and of the intelligence of our age ,  --  is not an institution that can last . It must come to an end by the act of the slave himself or by that of his master . In either case great misery must be the consequence . " It has come to an end , and that by neither of the agencies predicted by M. de Tocqueville , unless it be in a very indirect manner , and there is reason to hope without any of the dismal results predicted by him . We should not have taken the pains , after so great a lapse of time , to recur thus particularly to M. 4e Tocqueville 's great work , had we nothing more in view than to show that he had failed to foresee what was perhaps beyond the reach of mortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the views therein expressed have had a great influence in Europe , and no inconsiderable share in the course taken by England and France , especiall'y the former , in regard to our national affairs at a most delicate juncture . Those whose memories go back to the first appearance of La Democratie en Am*rique can not have forgotten the almost rapturous applause with which it was received in England . It has ever since been the text-book of conservatism and the standing authority on America . The author was at once placed among the foremost writers of the age , and everywhere received as one of the lions of the day . Only a few months before his death he was returning from England to France , when orders came down from London for a national ship to take him across the Channel to Cherbourg , within a short distance of his residence . He was , in fact , the oracle in all that related to the institutions of the United States . On the strength of his opinion ; our Union was looked upon , without the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one of the partners might dissolve at will , - a fair-weather government , very well so long as all went smoothly , but which must yield to the slightest // strain . Up to the outbreak in 1861 , nothing had occurred outwardly to weaken in the least the doctrine of M. de Tocqueyule in regard to State rights ; on the contrary , Europe was filled with emissaries from the South enforcing the same notion , and quoting M. de Tocqueville in its support ; while there was nothing for it on our side but to await , with what patience we might , the great experimentum erucis which was impending . Is it , then , to be wondered at , that , when the crisis came , it found Europe prepared to hail the insurgents as already victorious ? This will account for the exultant exclamation of one Sir John Ramsden , a Tory Yorkshire baronet , that the bubble had burst , as well as for the recognition of the Rebels , a few days afterwards , as belligerents by England and France ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was imposs*ble for Mr. Lincoln 's government to make head against the seceders . Lord Brougham , a few days later still , said in his seat in the House of Lords that they had a right to bring their prizes into British ports . It would have been happy for Lord Brougham if this had been his only blunder . In the second edition of a treatise on the English Constitution , he must needs go out of ; his way to have a fling at the United States . Speaking of the British government , he says - " The participation of the people of the upper and middle classes in all the affairs of state , the complete publicity given to all the measures of government and of Parliament , and the full discussion out of doors which they undergo , knit the governors and the governed closely together , and er*able the former to call forth all the resources of the country . See the vast armies at sea and on shore which our scanty population has at different times maintained ! Mark the endless variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globe ! Above all , reckon the hundreds of millions which have been levied within the last hundred and fifty years from the people , and levied with hardly a remonstrance ! and then confess that for producing a strong government there is nothing like a popular constitution , - that no despot , be he ever so absolute , has any engine of taxation that can match a Parliament ! If it be said that the American government can as well call forth the resources of the people , I have very great doubt if the national representatives , and especially the President towards the end of his first three years , would inflict a heavy excise or a grinding income-tax upon the people , as our Parliament has so often done ; and Iliave no dou6t at all // April , that such an infliction would very speedily lead to a termination of hostilities without any very great nicety about the terms of the peace . " If his Lordship could but have stopped at the word " Parliament , " and left prophesying to others , his argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our late struggle . The Times newspaper was misled in the same way . It is now pleased to rally the Americans on their tetchiness because they had not all the sympathy they thought they had a right to expect . The Times was not altogether so amiable in the summer of 1862 . At that time General Lee was pressing General McClellan in the Peninsula , and the administration of Mr. Lincoln was hard bestead on every hand . On the 18th day of July in that year , the following sentence makes part of a very disgraceful editorial in that paper : - " There is a feeling now becoming very general , that , if we can not stop the effusion of blood by mediation , we ought to give our whole moral weight to our own English kith and kin , who have so gallantly striven so long for their liberties against a mongrel race of plunderers and oppressors . This is bow our people put it . " Th&amp; Times would never have ventured on such balderdash , had it not known the bias of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our cause was hopeless , have committed himself , a minister of the crown , by declaring , as he did , that Jefferson Davis had founded a nation . All this is harmless now , if we only lay it rightly to heart , and profit by it as we should do . As an argument the more in favor of the Union one and indivisible , it is invaluable . Had the leading men of England , instead of persisting in regarding the United States as hardly a nation at all , and its government as an ephemeral affair , which the first blast of real resistance would blow away , taken the pains to inform themselves , they would not have been led into their present awkward predicament . A very little fair and unbiassed attention would have opened their eyes to the true explanation of the sudden apparition of the great dramatis persona that has just leaped full grown upon the stage . We have attributed the blindness of Europe in regard to the // 1866 . The Error of De Tocqueville. power that was growing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the unfortunate view taken by M. de Tocqueville . That most amiable and enlightened man , having unconsciously afforded a certain support to the general misconception , it is but fair to allow him to express his own idea of what a government should be . With this view , we will close our article by quoting a passage written long after his visit to this country , and having no application to any particular community . In the eighth volume ( p. 374 ) of the Wuvres Uompl*tes M. de Tocqueville thus defines liberty : - " Liberty seems to me to hold in the political world the place of the atmosphere in the physical world . The earth is peopled with a multitude of beings differently organized ; yet all live and flourish . Alter the conditions of the atmosphere , they suffer ; remove them out of it , they die Change your laws , vary your manners , reform your creeds , modify your forms ; if you can attaia to this , that man shall have full liberty to do whatsoever is not bad in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product of what he has done , you have hit the mark . " Now this is just what the people of the Umted States claim to have attained to . Every man is here at liberty to worship God when , where , and how he pleases , so that he d*es not annoy his heiglibor , or interfere with his right to do the same thing . So in temporal affairs . He may get his living in his own way , and may change his occupation as often as he thinks best ; what he earns is secured to him by laws binding alike on the rich and the poor , and making no invidious distinctions between classes or professions . Here is the whole thing in a nutshell . This is the charm which has so puzzled the wise men of the East . This explains the ardor with which our yeomanry and artisans rushed to arms at the first insult to their national flag ; this it was which caused the hoards of the rich , as well as the lesser stores of those who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government when the look of things was darkest . The same key opens the still more astounding enigma , that an army of little less than a million of men was disbanded and mustered out of service as quietly as a gang of workmen go home to their dinner . Why not ? These same men , or the far greater part of them , go back to comfort*-able homes and the welcome of the family fireside. // Our people , in upholding , and , in case of need , defending with their fortunes and their lives , the union of the States , act on the plainest principles of common sense . We know that in securing " the greatest happiness of the greatest number " we incur great dangers , not the least of which grows out of the very exuberant prosperity we enjoy . We are quite aware , also , that we must forego much that tends to refine and embellish society in some other parts of the world . The splendors of royalty , the gorgeous vestments and imposing ceremonies of a national church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape , and fill with a solemn pleasure those who enter them , are not for us . Enough if we can be spared the squalid poverty , the gross ignorance , and the debasing servility which too often present a painful set-off to these advantages .
