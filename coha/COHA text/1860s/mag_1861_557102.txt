No . CXCI . APRIL , 1861 . ART . I. - 1 . Narratives of Remarkable Criminal Trials . By A. VON FEUERBACH. 2 . History of Trial by fury . By WILLIAM FORSYTH . THE first duty of civil government is the protection of the life , liberty , and property of the individual . All direct means for his mental , moral , and physical elevation are second to this paramount object . The most important branch of municipal law , then , is that which provides for the detection and punishment of crime . Other departments of legislation , regulating the private and public rights of the citizen , are intended to maintain and increase the temporal prosperity of each member of the community , and to aid the growth of the whole in power and political influence ; this reaches to the very foundations of social order , and preserves the entire fabric from absolute disintegration . Of necessity , Criminal Law comprises two distinct branches , - that which prescribes the methods and processes of discovering , investigating , and determining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offender ; and that which regulates and defines the classes of crimes , and the punishments adapted to each . This latter division is doubtless of far the greater im* portance , and has in England and America received the most consideration . The study and endeavor of thoughtful and good men have long been directed toward the nature and // object of punishment , and have placed it upon a rational and true basis , so that the French law , as now administered in the countries where the English Common Law obtains , would hardly be recognized as the outgrowth of the system which prevailed in England at the time when Sir Samuel Romilly commenced his attacks upon it . The idea of reformation , introduced amidst regulations purely punitive , has wrought a complete revolution in the criminal code . But , passing by this branch of the subject , interesting as it is , we propose to offer some observations upon the methods by which crimes are discovered , and criminals are condemned . Although of inferior importance to a true classification of crimes and apportionment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means to be lightly esteemed . However consonant with the lessons of experience , and the teachings of an enlightened social philosophy , the modes and gradations of punishment may be , yet if there exist such faults or disturbing forces in the operation of the judicial processes that the course of justice is unwarrantably delayed , or that the guilty escape , or the innocent suffer , then the penal code is comparatively valueless . The object of all judicial investigations is the discovery of the truth . Certain forms and methods of procedure are prescribed , in conformity with which the search after the truth must be conducted ; and these rules are necessarily generalizations from a vast number of particular instances . They can not be arbitrary , and the more firmly they are based upon reason and the general experience of mankind , the more effectual will they be in attaining the prescribed object . Every system of criminal procedure must propose to arrive at two results , - perfect certainty in condemning the guilty , and equally unerring certainty in acquitting the innocent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the highest moment , and so it is , abstractly considered . Yet in the actual administration of justice , the former far outweighs the latter in practical importance . Of all the persons arraigned and tried for crime , a very large majority are guilty . The reason of this is obvious , in the fact that no person is arrested and brought to trial until some overt act of his , or some group // of criminative circumstances , has fastened suspicion upon him , and rendered his guilt probable . Such being the conditions under which the criminal law is administered , its methods should chiefly consult the speedy detection and conviction of the guilty , and should afford him few or no opportunities of escape . He has forfeited his rights as a citizen , and his claims upon society for its protection , and can demand , and should receive , no favor , other than in endeavors for his reformation . Yet , as it is true that the guiltless are sometimes suspected , accused , and put upon trial , it is indispensable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given for innocence to be vindicated . We esteem it to be the greatest defect in the methods which we have inherited from our English ancestors , that so much care is bestowed upon the protection of the guiltless , and so many restrictions hedge in the steps of the prosecuting officers , as to put great difficulties in the way of convicting the criminal , and to allow him too many means of escape . We do not propose to examine the source or to trace the progress and gradual development of the different forms which compose the administrative machinery of the criminal law , and of the general maxims and principles which underlie and support it . They all have an historic origin . Some find their first germs in the social and neighborhood customs of the people at a period so remote that even these customs can be ascertained only by conjecture . Others were evolved by the early and severe conflicts between the people , the nobles , and the king . All have had great power in moulding the character of the English people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free opportunity for the national force to expand itself , and produce the English character . Trial by jury has certainly been a strong bulwark against the encroachments of the government , and the maxim that every person is presumed innocent until proved to be guilty has effectually prevented the continued and successful usurpation of power by the courts in the trial of persons charged with political offences . But although certain forms may be useful , even indispensable to the progress of society toward a high degree of civilization , a condition may be reached , through their aid , when // society will be retarded by retaining these old helps . And what progress has been made ? what social status attained ? The people , the governed , are no longer obliged to contend with unceasing vigilance against their rulers , for the simple reason that in England and America all political power has passed into the hands of the people , to be . by them disposed of at will . There is now no need of the constant watch over the crown officers , public prosecutors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of control has been found in the hustings , the ballot-box , and , better still , in the overwhelming power of public opinion . In short , society has advanced beyond the position in the struggle toward which the existing maxims of jurisprudence and methods of judicial procedure have been such efficient aids , and it may be that they are now useless . Without entering into detail , we will give , as preliminary to our proposed discussion , a general outline of the methods by which a criminal is brought before the court , the composition of the tribunal which determines his guilt or innocence , and the rules of procedure , and especially the general principles of criminal evidence which serve as guides to the judge and to the prosecutor in the actual trial . This outline will apply equally to England and to the American States ; for , while many and substantial changes have been made in the civil practice of the courts , criminal procedure has remained substantially unaltered for centuries . Before a person can be put upon his trial , he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is , a certain number of individuals , chosen , without reference to profession , education , or ability , from among the freeholders or the tax-payers of the county , meet in secret conclave to originate and receive complaints ; and they embody the result of their deliberations upon each case before them , in the form of a bill of indictment , which sets forth in technical language the crime for which they present the accused for trial . The prisoner being arraigned upon the charges thus exhibited in the indictment , the question of his guilt or innocence is submitted to a compound tribunal , consisting of one or more men appointed to their station for life , or for a term of years , on account of the legal learning , experience , skill , and honesty // which fit them for their office , and of twelve other individuals chosen by lot from a large number of the freeholders or the tax-payers of the county , without regard to these qualifications . The issue between the state and the criminal thus to be tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , involve the consideration of two distinct classes of questions , and their separate decision . The one class embraces the principles of law which arise in the case , and the other embraces the facts which are peculiar to each individual trial . As the consideration of the latter branch of the issue always requires care and attention , and often demands the use of the most acute intellect , the most searching investigation of motives , the weighing of nicely balanced probabilities , the reconciling of conflicting statements , and the unravelling of perplexed and intricate mazes of circumstances , by a strange perversion of reason and justice , these questions of fact are given exclusively to the twelve unlearned , unknown , chance-selected laymen , while the legal questions are assigned to learned and professional judges . And , to make the strangeness of this arrangement more apparent , although means are given to review the expositions of the law announced from the bench , the decision of the jury upon the facts is absolutely final and irreversible . This is modern trial by jury . Such is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are committed the interests of the state , and the lives and liberties of the accused . While actually at the bar of the court and before the jury , the prosecutor , representing the state , and the accused , are guided by a few maxims which are the foundation-stones of the whole fabric of criminal law . We will state these principles as concisely and plainly as possible . First and foremost is the oft-repeated rule , that every man is presumed to be innocent until he is proven to be guilty , and secondly comes the corollary , that a jury is not to convict if its members have a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the prisoner , - or , as the same doctrine is otherwise expressed , if the circumstances of the case will admit of any other reasonable hypothesis than that of guilt , a verdict of acquittal should be rendered . The jury 26* // are to deliberate and decide , in the light of these principles , after the evidence is laid before them . In presenting their proofs , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules . First , the cases , both of the prosecution and of the defence , may rest entirely upon presumption , or circumstantial evidence , and need not be proved by the testimony of eyewitnesses . To this rule there must be made the very important exception , that , in cases of homicide , the corpus delicti , or , in other words , the fact of the violent and feloniously procured death of the deceased , must be determined by absolute , direct proof . This doctrine has lately been established in the court of last resort in the State of New York , in one of the most extraordinary criminal proceedings which ever came before any tribunal , either in England or America . Secondly , the prosecution must confine itself to the very transaction which is the subject of judicial inquiry . It can not , by any evidence of the former bad character , acts , habits , or associates of the prisoner , attempt to make it appear antecedently probable that he would commit the crime . Thirdly , while the state can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may rely upon his good character to rebut the evidence of the prosecution , and remove the probability of guilt . After the prisoner has thus opened the question , the prosecution may give proof of his generally bad character , but in no case can they resort to proof of particular acts of crime or infamy . Fourthly , the accused can not testify in his own behalf ; nor , fifthly , can he be examined by the prosecution . By no possibility can any statements or confessions be forced from him ; and although the state may prove admissions made in reference to the issue , if free from objection , yet if it appear that they were obtained by offering the slightest inducement or hope of benefit , or threat of evil , they will be instantly rejected . Such is a general outline of the tribunal before which persons accused of crime are tried , and of the rules which govern the judicial process . We are now prepared to examine more particularly the separate portions of this machinery devised to ascertain by public investigation the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person accused of an offence should be clearly and distinctly informed of the nature of the charge made against him , is too evidently just to admit of a question . But we think that no one who has given the subject a careful examination , and is conversant with the actual operation of our criminal law , will contend that the method of investigating , originating , and presenting complaints by grand juries has any valid argument in its favor . These bodies are irresponsible , and can be called upon by no authority whatever to give a reason or answer for their acts . While their duties are of a delicate nature , and demand great skill and knowledge of the law , and experience in the designs and operations of depraved and criminal persons , they are composed almost entirely of men unfit to discharge these duties . In fact , they are fast degenerating into cliques for the gratification of private malice and personal revenge . When we have numerous examining magistrates , and prosecuting officers , whose special duties are to inquire into crimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiles and subterfuges of the criminal , and who from the very nature of such pursuits must become fitted for the discharge of their duties by experience and study , why should their labors be futile , until the results have been passed upon by a number of merchants , mechanics , tradesmen , and others , collected together from the people at large , to weigh the evidence of guilt , and to determine whether there be sufficient cause to put a suspected person upon trial ? We think that it will be found to be the concurring , almost universal testimony of prosecuting officers , that grand juries are really a hinderance , rather than a help , to the cause of justice . The theory of the grand jury , and at one time the cause of its efficiency , was , that good men and true were called together from different portions of the county , who , during the period which had elapsed since the last inquest , would have become personally cognizant of the various offences committed in their respective vicinages , and who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the offenders of the county to justice . This design and use of grand juries was adapted to the state of society in which // they had their origin ; when there was hardly any intercommunication , no method for the transmission of intelligence , no newspapers , no mail , no telegraph . Now everything is different . We have in our progressive Civilization far outgrown the need of these bodies , and instead of being an assistance , they are a cumbersome dead weight upon the practical working of the criminal law . They are known only to the countries where the common law of England prevails , and their duties could be far better performed if committed to prosecuting officers , who by information , instead of indictment , could bring offenders to trial . These objections to grand juries are not merely theoretical . Nay , so great a grievance have they become , that in some States of the Union they have been practically abolished . The boast of English jurisprudence , repeated by almost every writer upon the law , and so highly esteemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Constitutions of this country , is trial by jury . It may savor of impertinence to question the correctness of so many consenting opinions , and to suggest that truth and justice would be better subserved by the adoption of a different tribunal for the determination of questions of fact in judicial proceedings ; yet we think that of late years the feelings and opinions of lawyers and legislators are tending toward a practical abandonment of what Blackstone lands as the bulwark of English liberty . The fact that , in civil proceedings , so much opportunity is now given to suitors , and gladly accepted by them , of submitting their controversies to judges , or to referees , who adjudicate both upon the law and the fact , evinces in the public mind a deep feeling of distrust in the decisions of juries . We intend no historic argument . We willingly admit that , as an element in our civilization , this institution has had great and almost controlling power . We simply take society as it now exists in England and the United States , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain that it fails to fulfil the important part in judicial investigation which is assigned to it . In discussing this subject , we must have in constant remembrance the paramount object of all criminal trials ; namely , to ascertain the truth with as much certainty as possible ; to // vindicate the law and protect the state by the punishment of the offender ; and to discharge and restore to society those wrongfully accused . Courts are not designed for the protection of our liberties any further than as society is preserved from anarchy , and thereby rational freedom is sustained , by control over the vicious , and the punishment of crime . Now , if , guided by these considerations , we were constructing a judicial system , unaffected by the bias derived from our English ancestry and habits , would the purpose be entertained , could it be conceived , of forming a double court , and submitting the determination of the law , which is constant and fixed , to a learned judge , and the intricate questions of fact , resting for their solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain general principles , to twelve inexperienced and unlearned citizens , chosen by lot to form a jury ? Trial by jury can not be sustained by any a priori arguments ; there is nothing in the nature of things which would lead a people uninfluenced by traditionary sentiments to adopt it . Is there anything in the character and composition of this tribunal which renders it more likely that their decisions upon controverted questions of fact would be nearer approximations to the truth than those of a single judge , who , in applying to the law the consideration of the facts , adds to his legal learning habits of mind fitted for the investigation of the motives and intent of criminal acts , and of the circumstances , from and through which the steps of the offender are traced ? It seems hardly necessary to give any reply to this question , for it contains its own answer . There are characteristics of every class of offences , and of the evidential facts by which they are established in judicial proceedings , which render it eminently fitting that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such investigations . For there is a wonderful sameness in all crime , and a wonderful likeness in the kinds of evidence by which the fact of criminality is established . Especially is this true in the higher grades of offences , such as murder , which are only to be discovered by presumptive proof . The criminative circumstances relied upon to show the guilt , and the physical and psychological facts grouped around the crime , which point to // the offender and indicate the offence , have in each separate class of crimes a general resemblance , both in outline and detail . The culprit uses the same means to effect his object , resorts to the same methods of concealing his guilt , is betrayed by the same suspicious movements and telling evidence . It is by knowledge of this truth , and by the experience gained by constant practice , that detective officers acquire such unerring certainty in tracing out the indications of crime , and following the steps of the criminal . A perusal of the reports of judicial trials on the European continent shows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis and discrimination . All this experience is lost in the jury . All this knowledge of the ways of the criminal , and of the means to which he resorts in perpetrating his designs , which would be such an invaluable aid to the judge in weighing and comparing criminatory facts , is wanting in the unskilled men who sit as triers in our courts . Does not the state , and do not the accused , suffer by the loss ? In all criminal trials , the nature of the facts given in evidence to sustain the charge or defence is always such as to require . great care in duly understanding and correctly applying them . They are often so complicated and conflicting - involving matters of science , of medicine , of anatomy , of mental philosophy , and the weighing and adjusting of nicely balanced probabilities and presumptions arising from the mute testimony of circumstances - that it is absolutely impossible for a jury to do anything but come to a general conclusion , which may as well be wrong as right , and which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will suppose that on a trial for murder the defence is insanity . The jury listen to the learned and subtile refinements of the medical witnesses , - subtile refinements because the subject is in itself subtile and refined , - they take no minutes of the examination , they must carry in their minds the testimony once heard to the consultation-room . What a tribunal to decide such a question ! Yet life hangs upon their conclusion . We should deem it laughable , were a jury of laymen to listen to the conflicting opinions of physicians , their description of symptoms , and the result of their diagnosis , and gravely to // CRIMINAL PROCEDURE . decide from such statements whether a patient were afflicted with a particular disease of the body ; but how much more exquisitely absurd is it - and the feeling of absurdity is deepened into a sentiment of horror as we reflect that they are adjudicating upon a human life - when these twelve men decide upon a disease of the mind ! So great is the difficulty of decision in intricate cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof is overwhelming in one direction , a jury almost always disagrees , or , what is far worse , renders a compromise-verdict . Instances of the latter kind occur in every criminal court , and are often so palpably absurd , and in so direct violation to a juror 's oath , that the public mind is shocked , and jury trial brought into disgrace . In a very intelligent county in the interior of the State of New York , a brother and sister were indicted for the murder of the woman 's husband . The evidence was circumstantial , but clearly implicated both , and the homicide was undoubtedly committed by both , in assistance of each other , and under circumstances of peculiar atrocity . The evidence offered in each case was the same . One jury convicted the brother of murder , and he was executed . Another jury found the sister guilty of manslaughter in the second degree , the gist of which offence is unintentional killing in the heat of passion . In the same county , and within the same year , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prosecution showed that she secretly delivered a young woman of a living child , and almost immediately drowned the infant in a pail of water . The defence , admitting the delivery , claimed that the child was born dead . Either the woman was entirely innocent , or was guilty of a most foul murder ; yet the jury , in disregard of their oaths , in the face of all the evidence , and in direct contradiction to the law , convicted the defendant of manslaughter in the second degree , and thereby found that she had killed the new-born infant in a fit of passion strong enough to cause her to use such violence as unintentionally to take life . Can there be a better comment upon the trial by jury in criminal cases ? There is another evil in the system of jury trials , common both to civil and criminal cases . As the jury are // ignorant of the law themselves , and must receive it as orally delivered by the judge , great liability exists of their mistaking and misapplying the legal rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well what a crying evil this is , and that it can have no remedy . After perhaps a long trial , extending through several days , and requiring the resolution of many questions and the application of many legal principles to the various facts , the judge rises to deliver his charge to the jury . How much depends upon the correctness with which the twelve men hear , understand , and remember these judicial dicta ! How liable are they to error and forgetfulness ! The trial of all cases demands the finding of the facts in accordance with the legal principles which control and govern the controversy . A perfect judicial system would require that those who are to determine the facts consistently with the law should know and understand that law . Our system recognizes this truth , and attempts to provide for its operation ; but it assumes the impossibility , that a body of men , chosen when ignorant and unskilled , will correctly receive and completely retain the statements which are made to them from the bench , and will accurately apply them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil inherent in the whole system , and is alone a sufficient ground for discarding it . These are some of the practical difficulties belonging to jury trials . They operate against the prisoner as well as against the state , for error in deciding upon the evidence is as likely to be made to the injury of the accused as in his favor . Indeed , the Report of the English Commissioners of the Criminal Law states that , in the year 1827 , no fewer than six persons who had been convicted of capital crimes at the Old Bailey , and left for execution , were proved to be innocent , and saved by the zeal and activity of a sheriff . English judges at the present day , in civil cases , doubtless convinced of the untrustworthiness of verdicts , practically invade the province of the jury , and instruct them what and how to decide ; and a verdict is always set aside by the court , if the judge who tried the cause states that he is not satisfied with its correctness . The English have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance , and the constant practice of their // judges is a virtual admission of the inability *f their commonlaw system to produce correct results in judicial trials . Our own judges have not as yet had the independence and strength to follow their English brethren in this inroad upon the peculiar province and function of the jury . It seems to us demonstrable that we have passed through the times when the jury trial was a necessity , and have attained such a social state that it is a burden . The duties now discharged by the court and the jury should be allotted to a single tribunal , composed of one or more persons , trained by study and practice for judicial office , and skilled in the investigation of facts . In criminal cases this professional court should be assisted by assessors specially qualified , when questions of technical science are involved in the course of the prosecution or defence . The change would undoubtedly be a great shock to our prejudices ; but we are confident , that , under our form of government , controlled as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gained by such a system would far outweigh its dangers . That questions of fact are more carefully considered by a tribunal which determines both the law and the fact , than by a jury , will be admitted by all lawyers and laymen who have carefully studied the decisions of the English and American Courts of Chancery , and especially the adjudications of the judges who have presided in the English Ecclesiastical Courts . The dangers incident to such a system are all comprised in the tendency toward judicial usurpation . But when the judge who decides , the officer who executes , and the legislator who makes the laws , are alike responsible to the governed , there can be little danger of a transgression of official power and duty . This objection of judicial usurpation is one which has been handed down through a long line of English writers , and is repeated from mouth to mouth , without any adequate consideration of the changes which have taken place in society , through which the entire force of the argument has been removed . But we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criminal law , which guide the actual course of judicial trials , than the nature of the forum itself . // The maxim , ? hat every person is to be presumed innocent until he is proved guilty , and its corollary , that conviction must proceed only upon a state of the evidence which does not admit of a reasonable doubt , are founded in the first principles of justice , and are common to all scientific codes . Yet this time-honored maxim should not be misunderstood . Although the accused is in theory presumed to be innocent , yet he is not , nor can he be , treated as such . He is deprived of his liberty , or held to bail , and required to prepare for his defence . The true and accurate meaning of the doctrine is , that the burden of proof is thrown upon the prosecution ; that when the prisoner is arraigned , his case , prior to any evidence , is clear in his favor , and that the state can not demand a conviction , unless such proof is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond a reasonable doubt , of the guilt . Tbis principle , as already said , is not peculiar to the English law . It prevails and must prevail in every civilized country , where the law is studied and administered as a branch of ethics . Whatever be the character of the tribunal which decides the facts , whether jury or judge alone , or judge aided by assessors , it must recognize this rule in reaching a just conclusion . The maxim , in short , means , that the accused shall not be convicted upon a presumption , but only upon such reasonable certainty as can be obtained from fallible evidence . The doctrine , that the prosecution and defence may rest entirely upon circumstantial proof , is common to the English and the Continental systems , with the exception that , by some of the latter , the punishment of death can not be inflicted , unless to the evidence of circumstances is added the corroboration of the prisoner 's confession of guilt . A resort to presumptive proof is a necessity in judicial trials . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very foolishly said , because it is more cogent than the direct testimony of eyewitnesses , but because in the great majority of instances it is the only species of evidence left for the prosecution to adopt . Crimes are rarely committed openly , and so true is this to ordinary human nature , that , when an offence is perpetrated in public view , this very fact is always relied upon , with much force to the defence , to establish a morbid state of mind in the accused . // As we ascend in the grade of criminality from mere assaults and petty thefts up to murder , we shall find the criminal more completely withdrawing himself from the gaze of any other eye , and more carefully obliterating all marks of his presence and agency in the deed . But it is almost impossible to commit a crime without leaving behind some traces , some criminating indicia , which , combined and grouped together , draw like a net-work around the miserable offender , who vainly thought that he could destroy all indications of his instrumentality . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so completely involves the accused that no other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt is adequate to explain the general and combined appearance . In proving the connection of the accused with the crime , and his agency in its perpetration , or , in the nomenclature of the writers on criminal evidence , the physical facts , the prosecution is allowed the utmost range of circumstantial evidence ; and the same license is given in establishing one psychological fact , namely , the motive impelling to the perpetration of the offence . But beyond this the prosecutor can not go . By an inflexible rule of the common law , the accused stands before the jury , not only as innocent of the crime under investigation , but as guiltless of all evil as a good and honest citizen of the state ; and his past life , acts , and habits can not be investigated , with a design to produce evidence of his previous character and moral traits bearing upon the issue to be tried . The argument from probabilities is entirely excluded from our judicial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criminal codes of the Continental states which derive their general principles and methods from the Roman jurisprudence . According to the European practice , inquiry is carefully made into the history of the accused from childhood . An investigation is carried into all his habits and pursuits , his associates and friends , his disposition and character , and any evidence is received which will tend to throw light upon his mental and moral peculiarities , - which will show by what motives he is , or is likely to be , swayed . These two systems thus stand in bold contrast . English and American writers are almost unanimous in lauding their own system as founded // in reason , and as calculated to protect the accused from undue and vexatious pressure from the government . But if we could divest ourselves of traditionary prejudices , if we could throw off the habit of mind induced by an exclusive acquaintance with our own practice , we should doubtless concede that the theory of evidence held by European courts is based upon a correct knowledge of human nature , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each individual , and that it is more directly instrumental in elucidating the truth . It is a strong argument against our rule thus restricting the range of judicial inquiry , that it is in direct conflict with the ordinary practice of all intelligent persons , in attempting to discover a crime , or to satisfy themselves of the guilt of one under suspicion . Should detective officers govern themselves by common-law rules of evidence in their labors , there would be few cases to be tried by our criminal courts . The most strenuous advocate for the reasonableness of the common-law restriction , if he suspected a theft by an employ*e , would not hesitate to make all possible inquiries from former employers in regard to the character and practices of his servant , and if he discovered that the person had been detected in other larcenies , or bore a bad reputation for honesty , he would consider this fact as throwing great light upon the question of present guilt , and would doubtless act upon it as convincing . All persons thus act in the concerns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our commonlaw method abandons and rejects this universal practice thus founded upon good sense and constant experience , while the Continental system is based upon it . Evidence of this character certainly does aid in arriving at a just and accurate result in criminal trials . If a man has been in the habit of robbing , the probability that he will rob again is infinitely stronger than that a person hitherto innocent will commit this offence . In fact , as a general rule , what a person will do may with strong probability be inferred from what he has done . This argument from probability is resorted to in morals and in religion . In the ordinary transactions of the world , and in conducting the affairs of common life , it is the principal method of proof , upon which every person relics as determining his acts . // But there are reasons why this species of evidence is peculiarly applicable to the judicial investigation of crimes . In jurisprudence , as well as in morals , every crime consists of two parts , the outward act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create an offence against the law , which courts can reach . The one is a physical , and the other a psychological fact ; the one is the result , and the other the cause ; the one is the fruit , and the other the root . The prosecution must convince the jury , or the judge who tries the cause , of the existence of both these elements . Our rules of evidence allow the widest scope of investigation into the physical indicia which bear upon the former of these two branches . Any circumstance , which alone , or in combination with others , tends in the least to indicate the commission of the outward act , and the agency of the prisoner in it , is allowed to be proved , and is used by the triers in arriving at their verdict . But the guilty intent , being an act or process of the mind , can not of course be shown directly : it must be inferred from circumstances . Now the species of proof which the European system allows , and the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological fact , in the same manner in which ordinary presumptive proof is resorted to in establishing the corpus delicti , and the complicity of the accused with the crime . The same arguments which support the use of such evidence in one branch of the issue , are equally cogent in requiring its application to the other . The same grounds of error which would invalidate the one , would equally weaken the other . We may be misled , if we endeavor to discover the evil design by scanning all the past incidents and mental and moral traits of the person on trial , and we may also be deceived , if we rely for proof of the outward guilty act upon the " mute testimony of circumstances . " The guilty intent , under the operation of our rules of evidence , is generally only to be presumed , from the character of the act which forms the body of the crime ; but in certain instances this restricted range of examination would tend so much to defeat the ends of justice , that courts have gradually permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad27 * // herence to the principle , should have been rejected . In showing motive to commit the crime , a general inquiry is allowed , although facts may be developed strongly affecting the character of the prisoner , if there be the slightest probability that such facts furnish any clew to the mental operations which led to the criminal deed . Now , we only ask that what has been allowed , in order to prove the single psychological fact of motive , may be permitted in all cases to aid in obtaining an insight into the mental processes which affect the intent . No system of criminal jurisprudence in those countries of Europe where the civil law prevails , allows evidence of probability to establish the corpus delicti , and , by some of their codes , much more positive and convincing proof is demanded than is required by our law . The objection most relied upon by the English and American writers in support of their rule of restriction is , that the accused is informed by the indictment of the very crime for which he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prepared to meet that single and specific offence ; that by presenting on the trial evidence of distinct acts , running back through his past life , he would be surprised at each step , and unprepared with explanations , which , if opportunity were given him , he might offer to the jury , and thus he would be placed completely at the mercy of the prosecution ; that , if the jury are told of his former bad habits and ' criminal acts , they would be rather prejudiced against him , than aided in their investigation of the offence for which he is on trial ; in short , that the jury would misunderstand and misapply such species of evidence , and convict for generally bad character , when there is no complicity shown on the part of the prisoner with the particular crime charged in the indictment . This argument has much force , but in our mind it militates against the jury system , rather than against this class of proof . It is true , that jurors would be liable to grievous error and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force , to such a range of circumstances , and it is because of the utter incompetency of this tribunal as proper judges of facts , that the English law has been so careful to narrow the issue submitted to them , and to reduce it , if possible , to the finding of // 315 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE . one single and separate fact . Herein is the whole explanation of the logical and refined methods of special pleading peculiar to the common-law courts . The necessity of discarding a range of judicial inquiry , which , to trained and experieiiced minds , is most fruitful of accurate results , because the triers who are to decide upon the facts are incompetent rightly to understand and appreciate the design and force of the evidence , is rather a reason for remodelling the tribunal than for excluding the entire class of facts . But while such circumstances as tend to elucidate the character of the prisoner are forbidden to the prosecution , in order to establish the probability of the crime , the latter , although in the theory of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may offer evidence of his general good character to rebut the probability of guilt . When he has thus opened the question and tendered an issue , the prosecution may meet it by rebutting proof , yet , absurdly enough , can not pass into particular acts , which convincingly show the real disposition , but is confined to evidence of the prisoner 's general reputation or outside appearance . Thus the law deliberately rejects the substance , and accepts the shadow . In short , it seems to us that this fundamental maxim of our criminal procedure is based upon a false generalization from facts , is repugnant alike to reason and to experience , and is inconsistent with the laws of outward human action and with recognized mental phenomena . Our penal code gives the accused the benefit of his own silence , and also deprives him of the aid of his own testimony . In this it differs from the Continental codes , and , strangely enough , this peculiarity is lauded by our writers as the perfection of reason and justice . Until a few years past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testifying in their own behalf , nor were they , except in chancery suits , liable to be examined by their adversaries . Indeed , so far was this restriction carried , that no one having any pecuniary interest in the event of the trial could be a witness in behalf of the party with which his interest was identified . The old English judges had so low an estimate of human nature , as to hold it to be an absolute presumption of the law , that not only // parties , but all persons , would commit perjury if they would derive any pecuniary advantage thereby . This ancient absurdity is now abandoned , and in the English courts , and in those of some of our States , parties , as well as all others , can freely testify in their own behalf . The result of this change is everywhere good . Is there any substantial distinction between civil and criminal actions in this respect ? Shall the litigant parties be permitted to sustain their own claims , and defeat those of their opponents by their sworn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the prisoner , upon trial fcfr reputation , liberty , or life , be allowed the same advantage ? Is the distinction due to the importance and quality of the interests at stake in the different trials ? It would seem , then , that this difference should be an argument in favor of extending the right of examination to the accused . Indeed , if we once admit the propriety of calling upon parties to disclose their knowledge of the matters at issue in civil cases , we have conceded the whole ground . So clearly does the examination of prisoners in criminal trials stand upon the same basis as the rule now adopted in England in civil cases , that a movement has been made in that country , and a bill has been introdneed into Parliament , with the sanction of some of the leading jurists and legal reformers , allowing persons on trial for crime to give evidence in their own behalf . Although it is not yet passed , a few years will certainly see this bill become the law of England . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own behalf . As the proof against him is always partly , and often wholly , presumptive , he alone of all the world has the power to explain the circumstances , if they are susceptible of explanation . In other words , he possesses the knowledge of the truth , and is best qualified to speak both for the state and for himself . If we admit the justice of allowing the prisoner to testify upon his defence , we also therein concede the reasonableness and necessity of interrogating him on behalf of the prosecution ; for the one infers the other . If it be left optional with the prisoner whether he testify in his own behalf , - if he have the privilege to use or not at will , and he decline to use it , - this very neglect will be a virtual admission of his guilt . // That he who alone knows the fact of guilt or innocence , who can explain the circumstances , account for his acts , and expose his true situation , should keep silence when he has an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his defence , and a fact of such moral weight with the court or jury as to be almost of itself convincing . If , then , an opportunity be given to the defendant , he must testify or lie is lost . We are warranted , therefore , in assuming that , after such an alteration of the law of evidence , all parties accused of crime would avail themselves of the provision . The circumstances of the case are brought out by the state , and the accused is put upon his defence . He is sworn , and tells his story . He attempts to explain and account for the inculpating facts . If he be innocent , these facts can , with great certainty , be accounted for consistently with the theory of innocence , and , in a vast majority of cases , he will be successful in so doing . But if he be guilty , and attempts by subterfuge , concealment , or downright perjury , to establish his defence , how quickly will the cloak of deceit be torn from him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer ! How clearly will his lies and contradictions be exposed , and how plainly will the truth stand forth obvious to the court and to the public ! When the prisoner is examined for himself , and meets in return the searching interrogation of the counsel for the state , we shall have the system of Continental Europe in all its essential principles , without its peculiar form . It sill not be denied that the abrogation of the rule forbidding the criminal to testify in his own behalf involves a hostile examination from the prosecution , and we think that the cause of truth and justice would thereby be promoted , the innocent would be protected , and the guilty more surely condemned . The point thus approached in a circuitous manner the European codes arrive at directly ; and if we would borrow from them their great principle of criminal trials , if we would utterly abandon our antiquated dogma , that the mouth of the accused is locked , only to be opened at his own will , - would subniit him at once to an examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to testify in his own behalf , - we should be making a great advance toward a perfect system of criminal // procedure . While thus advocating the adoption of the principle which underlies the methods of the Continental courts , we would by no means recommend their entire practice . In general their examination of the prisoner is conducted by the judge , who thus , instead of holding evenly the scales of justice , appears to the accused party rather as a prosecutor . We would confide this examination to the counsel for the state , to be made in open court , in the regular progress of the trial . We would also discard all the clap-trap machinery which still disgraces so many of the Continental proceedings , the interrogatories to the prisoner in private , the vulgar attempts to excite terror by bringing the accused to the place of the crime , or before the body of the murdered person , and other like means of frightening him into a confession . Everything in their forms which resembles the inquisitorial process , everything which works upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calm dignity and serenity of a court of justice . But when we discard these appendages , there is left the principle , which our system utterly rejects , and thereby deprives courts of the very means by which truth can be the most readily and surely discovered .
