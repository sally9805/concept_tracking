txt Our courts have hitherto been but little troubled with questions arising under the confiscation laws . Those questions would naturally be more frequent in the Border States , where there were more men who had left their property within reach of the process of the United States Courts , while they themselves had gone to take an active part in the rebellion . Still there have been some men from this City of New-York who have placed themselves in this situation , and there have accordingly been some cases before our courts , though by no means so many as there should have been , we are certain . Our readers will find in another column some proceedings in one such case . It seems that LEROY M. WILEY , a person formerly pretty well known in this City , had a large quantity of stock standing in his name in the Great Western Railway Company ; also , some $53,000 due from the company on coupons said to belong to him . WILEY betook himself to the South , and has been there ever since , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his counsel and countenance , but with money , quite possibly with a portion of the same money which he was proved to have received from the North through an agent whom he sent on to see to his property here . Proceedings were accordingly commenced by the United States District-Attorney to forfeit this property , and a libel was filed against it for that purpose . Mr. WILEY , or his friends for him , not liking to see a portion of the aid which he was enabled to give the rebellion cut off in this way , caused an answer to be filed in the cause , on which it was proposed to contest the forfeiture . This answer stated that he was " of Eufaula , Ala. , " and on this fact Judge BETTS ordered his answer to be stricken from the files , holding , as has been held repeatedly before ; that a man resident in the rebel States could not be heard in court , but had no standing there at all . The railroad company also filed an answer , not claiming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit of themselves , and as trustees of such other persons as may be entitled " to the property . And the court , with quite as much propriety as before , struck out this answer also ; holding that the intervention of the company was " virtually based on no otkr interests than those resting personally in WILEY , " and that a third person , who did not pretend to own the property , had nothing to say in the matter , These answers being stricken out , the libel was left unanswered . Now the Confiscation Act , under which the proceedings were taken , provided that the proceedings to condemn such property were to " conform as nearly as may be to proceedings in admiralty or revenue cases . " In either of those classes of cases , the mode of procedure is very clear . When no answer is interposed , the court enters a decree of condemnation against the property by-default . And , accordingly , the District-Attorney applied for such . a decree against this property . His application was yesterday denied by Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been svbmitted to the court that this property Was WILEY 'S , or that WILEY was such an alien enemy that his property nts confiscable . . But he allowed tote District-Attorney to o take such further steps in the matter as he should be advised , with a view , doubtless , to his being able to satisfy the court on these points . It would seem as if on the question of WILEY 'S character , the fact that the Judge had stricken out his answer because he was an alien enemy , might have obviated the necessity of further proof on this point . But , as we understand it , further proof was given , showing beyond question that he was an active rebel , furnishing money and provisions , and helping to raise troops for the rebel cause , We are at a loss to see what would prove that he had given aid and comfort to the re hellion , if the facts stated in our report of the case do not show it . Unless he could be proved to have been in actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Governmeni on this point could be strengthened . As to his ownership of the property , evidence o that can probably be obtained here ; and if he is proved to be the owner , it would be very extraordinary if the property of such a rebe should he allowed to escape confiscation , by such stringent requirements of evidence al to his being a rebel .
