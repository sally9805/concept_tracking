ARTICLE V.-DR . HEDGE 'S ADDRESS TO THE ALUMNI OF HARVARD . Address to the Alumni of Harvard at their Triennial Festival , July 19th , 1866 . Printed in the Atlantic Monthly for September , Th66 . THIS address of Dr. fledge has been so widely diffused , by being published in the Atlantic Monthly , that we may assume that it has been read by a considerable portion of our readers . We notice it , not on account of its intrinsic excellence , for it is hardly equal to the occasion and the principal theme , but for the purpose of briefly discussing one or two of the subjects brought forward in it , which are of especial interest . The first of these is the new form given to the Board of Overseers of Harvard , by a recent change of the charter , in virtue of which the classes of Overseers annually elected by the General Court of the State , are hereafter to be elected by the ballot of Bachelors of five years ' standing , of Masters of Arts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballots are to be cast on Corn inencement Day , in the city of ' Cambridge , commencing with the year 1866 . From this privilege of voting , if we are to interpret the term " honorary degree " in its ordinary sense , all bachelors in law and in science , all doctors in medicine , and all graduates who may be admitted to any new degree obtained on examination , which the authorities of the University may hereafter establish , are excluded . This exclusion may have been the result of carelessness and of the habit in times past of regarding the College as the whole of the University ; if intended , we should ascribe it to a narrow spirit desirous of keeping all power within the ranks of the graduates in arts . The effect of the change will be to introduce in six years an entirely new element into the government of the university , to separate it altogether from // Oct. , Dr. Hedge 's Address . the control of the State , and to make graduates of Harvard its overseers and highest board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite unfortunate in its constitution , and more particularly in these two respects that it is governed by two boards rather than by one , and that one of these boards has been a political body . The Board of Overseers was created in the very infancy of Harvard College , and consisted of the Governor and Deputy Governor , together with all the magistrates of the Massachusetts Colony , and also of " the teaching elders of the six next adjoining towns , viz. : Cambridge , Watertown , Charlestown , Boston , Roxhury , and Dorchester , together with the President of the College . " All the law-making power and all management of the revenues were put into their hands . As yet , the College was not a corporation . Tn 1650 , a corporation was created , consisting of seven persons  --  a president , five fellows , and a treasurer or bursar , having power , with the consent of the overseers , to elect a new president , fellows , or treasurer , in case of death or other removal from office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , among other things , to choose such officers and make such orders as they should think fit , provided such orders were consented to by the overseers . These members of the corporation are not necessarily resident at the College according to the charter of 1650 , or according to long usage ; but inasmuch as the tutors were called Fellows of the House , and as several of the non-resident Fellows or members of the corporation were obnoxious to a party among the Overseers and in the Colony , an attempt was made , about the year 1721 , to oust the nonresident members of that board , and to supply their places by the election of officers of the College . The quarrel which arose between the two boards , in which also the Legislature , taking the side of the Overseers , participated , is related fully , if not quite impartially , in the fourteenth chapter of President Quincy 's History . The original intention at the very origin of Harvard was , we are inclined to believe , to have a corporation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor for a long time afterwards , any Faculty or subordinate governing body under that board , their entire non-residence // would have destroyed all discipline . But the principle being settled , and the growth of a Faculty having at length rendered the necessity of a resident corporation unnecessary , no serious attempts were afterwards made , if we are correctly informed , to interfere with the corporation 's rights , and the constitution of that body has continued unchanged until the present time . In 1780 , a new practice , not involving an altcratioi* of the constitution , of electing a non-resident layman , was introduced to advantage , only non-resident clergymen having been adopted into the board before . The Board of Overseers , however , has undergone several more or less important modifications . It was necessary in 1779 , when a new constitution took the place of the royal charter , to decide who should be the successors of the former political functionaries in the board , and accordingly , with the consent of the corporation , they were made to consist of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other members remaining the same as before . Far more important was the measure of the year 1810 , by which the Senate of the State , except its President , was shut out of the board , the Speaker of the House became one of its members , and fifteen ministers of Congregational Churches , with fifteen laymen , were substituted for the ministers of the six towns . This act was accepted by both boards of the College , and yet , in 1812 , it was repealed by the Legislature , and the provisions of the charter previously in force were restored . The boards refused to submit to this legislative usurpation , and for a time there were two boards of Overseers , until , in 1814 , by a compromise between the contending parties , the Senate of the State was readmitted to its former place , the act of 1810 in other respects continuing in force . In 1834 , " any stated minister of the Church of Christ might be elected among the fifteen . " When President Quincy published his history in 1840 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but by an act of May , 1851 , to which the legal assent of the boards was given , the Senate and Council disappear from the board , which is now made to consist of seven persons , taking their places ew officio  --  the Governor , Lieutenant-Governor , President of the Senate , Speaker of the House Secretary of the Board of Education , and the President // and Treasurer of the University-together with the thirty members who belonged to it before . These members were now divided into six classes , one of which gave place annually to a new set , five in number , . elected by the General Court and holding their office for six years . Finally , by the alteration in the charter of 1865 , all the State officers who had ex qfficio belonged to the board ceased to be members of it , and the thirty were to be elected by graduates of the College , as has been already mentioned . The constitution of the governing boards at Harvard has contained , in our judgment , several pretty serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too small . Being a compact body , the members of which naturally live in the neighborhood of the University and can be easily assembled , it can not fail , we should suppose , to exercise an undue control over the Faculties , to overrule their decisions and thwart their wishes , under the impression of being intimately and personally acquainted with the state of affairs at Cambridge . Moreover , as a body capable , on account of its size , of acting with vigor , secrecy and settled policy , it would naturally excite the jealousy of the more unwieldy Board of Overseers . Still greater fault may be found with the existence of two boards , and with the constitution of the larger one . Two boards besides a Faculty , which must , in order to do any good and act with any efficiency , have the power of making by-laws , form a very cumbrous machinery , nor can we see any sufficient reason for the existence of a Board of Overseers except in the fact that the corporation is too small . One board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent action , are surely enough for healthy legislation , enough for vigorous discipline , enough for the election of the best officers , and enough to secure the confidence of the public . But apart from this , the Board of Overseers has heretofore been an unhappily constituted body . It contained the elements of strife with the corporation whenever the elections went against the political party to which they were supposed to belong ; and its members , especially the clerical portion , might easily bring with them into their official position the jealousies or animosities of religious creeds and sects . Add to this that it is a public body , // whose acts and debates are often spread abroad through the land like those of legislative assemblies , and that when the Senate and Council of the State belonged to it , it was enormously large , incapable df regular orderly action , and likely to be composed in part of persons not at all qualified by previous knowledge for the task devolved on them . We have seldom been more disgusted than when the debates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President of the university by the corporation were spread through the world by the newspapers , when the opinion of men like Mr. Everett , given no doubt with the greatest unwillingness that they should be made public , became a sort of public condemnation of one who needed all support at his entrance upon a most responsible office . Such are some of the objections we have against the board of Overseers , as it was formerly constituted , objections which are fully justified by the disputes between the two boards , of which instances can readily be found on the pages of President Quincy 's history . The recent change will remove a part of the causes of disharmony . There will be no more political nor bitter religious animosity represented in the board of Overseers . The members will , as a body , be animated by a loyal spirit of affection towards their Alma Mater . Inasmuch as persons of high standing will be elected , the University will look to them with confidence for all assistance in those schemes of enlargement which shall command the approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we regard as the radical b vices of the Harvard charter , two boards , a small corporation , and a large board of Overseers , still remain . What is there , again , under the altered charter to prevent party tickets among the graduates , with the necessary excitements before and illfeeling after the election ? Nor is it certain that the jealousies of former times between the corporation and the overseers may not yet be renewed . We are tempted at this place to turn to another College , with a very different set of governors , and inquire whether a similar plan of graduate election , can be engrafted on its charter with advantage . The charter of Yale College , until 1792 , made the ten original founders , with their successors , in perpetuity ,  --  including // also , after a time , the Rector , or President , as the charter of 1745 called him-  --  the Corporation . They were in their corporate name the President and Fellows of Yale College in New Haven . This constitution was altered in 1792 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six senior assistants in the council , into the Board ; the causes of the change being a not unreasonable jealousy on the part of civilians of a board wholly composed of ministers , a feeling that the College would have more protection from the State if more plainly under its protection , arid the prospect of a handsome endowment from the State . The change was a good one . The new board , consisting of nineteen , would not be unwieldy , even if all the members were in their place , and many questions of finance needed the counsel of the lay members . The change has worked well on the whole , and has continued , with minor alterations , until the present time . A change in the rules of doing business deserves mention , by which a quorum was made to consist of a majority both of the whole board aud of the original members of it , the rule before having been that a quorum of both parts of the board was necessary . This rule discloses to us the principal defect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary ? Because the six members of the council  --  or Senators , as they were called in the State Constitution of I 817-could not be relied upon to be present . The Governor and LieutenantGovernor have been tolerably punctual in their attendance , but the Senators in general take little interest in the proceedings , are apt to withdraw before the close of the meetings , and seem to feel that they are in a strange place . We have looked over the records of thirty-five meetings , and find that their average attendance is 2* , or less than one half . Nor is it likely that it will ever be greater , while the clerical members are seldom absent-on the average scarcely one out of eleven . In this state of things we can not but feel that the connexion between the College and the State is , as far as the deputation from the Senate is concerned , a mere form  --  a form which does no harm to the College that we know of , but which adds nothing to the efficiency and dignity of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will feel it their duty to he present , but it is idle , we conceive , to expect punctuality from the Senators , as the Senate is at present constituted . They change every year , so that the same man rarely reappears in the council of the College . Th*y have no time to learn what duties are expected from them , nor to become acquainted with the condition and wanta of the institution . They are in some cases men who take very little interest in the higher seminaries of learning , or perhaps even question their utility altogether . Neither sympathy then , nor knowledge , nor power to uphold a permanent policy belongs to them to any great extent . In this state of things , if some Senator of Connecticut should incline to advocate a change of the system-in favor of which we have already heard an opinion expressed by one membcr of that honorable body  --  the reasonableness of the measure might gmln a general-assent , and we know not why the Corporation ought to refuse to give its vote for such an alteration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arts and graduates of a higher , or an equ.al rank , together with Bachelors of all the Faculties of five years standing ; let that part of the Board now elected from the Senate of the State , and with them , if thought best , as at Harvard , the two highest magistrates of the Commonwealth give place to graduates , who shall hold their offices for at least six or eight years , and be re*ligible , when their term expires ; let the elections be held not every year , but every other year , or even less frequently ; - will not the result be greater interest , punctuality , knowledge , sense of responsibility , and devotion to the welfare of the institution on the part of the new members ; will they not , if well elected , be a new strength of their Alma Mater ; will they not bring with them views at once enlightened and conservative ? We have dwelt longer than we intended on this , which is not the main point of Dr. Hedge 's address , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the old story of reform in college studies , of a greater latitude and privilege of selection among the numerous branches of knowledge . New sciences it is said have arisen since the revival of letters , some of them within the last hundred years . New languages have drawn their life from the extinct Latin , or have grown // Oct. , into beauty and importance where the forests of Germany once stood , or upon the more northern coasts and islands , or they have been laid open to the studies of philologists since the eastern world has come into nearer contact with the western . New literatures , more noble than the Latin , and breathing the spirit of modern times , have been created . New philosophies of thought and being have arisen . H istory has assumed a new face altogether . Why should the discipline of four centuries ago be the discipline of our age and of future ages ? Why should Greek and Latin be the sole or the principal instrument for cultivating thought ? Or why should there be any common discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as the only rightful occupants of the schools ? Why not permit every parent to chose what his son shall pursue in college , or , what is the same thing , permit the youth to choose for himself ? Or if the college comes forward and point* to its catalogue , where natural science , metaphysics , some history , some criticism is interspersed among the studies in the dead languages and the mathematics , the cry now changes , and with some justice it is claimed that too much is required , a little of almost everything ,  --  instead of plain healthy beef and potatoes , a mouthful of every dish that the eating-house has on its bill of fare . But there is another consideration which the reformers of colleges urge , iDr . Hedge among the rest , the justice of which can not altogether be denied . The present system is one of coercion , and coercion is opposed to all intellectual growth . The question what a youth shall study , ought to be left to himself , how be shall behave to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have no criminal code , should inflict no * ) enalty but that of expulsion , and that only in the way of self defense against positively noxious and dangerous members . " Appeals to the honor of young men are the best method to put down " hazing " and other tricks that infest colleges . Liberty of study , liberty of conduct , abandonment of the present system of college police is then the watchword of the reform which Dr. Ifedge calls for . Experience has shown that excessive legislation creates two l ) arties , and these two parties " have always existed at Cambridge within the mnemnory // of the oldest graduate . " And if this system would meet with an obstacle in the present age or maturity o* ' college youths , Dr. hedge would advance the qualifications for admission , and reduce the college career from four years to three . Only the young men must have freedom to select their studies and their teachers , at the risk of losing their degrees , which should be conditioned on satisfactory proof that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater liberty depends , in the main , upon greater maturity of mind and capacity of self-government . If the academy is to push its preparations further than it can at present , the college can shorten its term of prescribed studies , and can introduce what Dr. Hedge wishes for . We should have no objection against such a change , or rather we devoutly desire it . As for doing away with the police and legislation of colleges , we have no doubt that , as they are at present constituted , the thing is impracticable . If you are to have chapel services and lessons or lectures , you must have decorum there . You must have order , freedom from noise on the college premises , some sort of control over moral conduct ; and this control must be in the hands of college authorities , for it is found that a municipal police can not , or will not , take this duty out of their hands . What parent is not now encouraged to trust his son in the hands of the college authorities by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is under their law and their eye . As for minute specifications of crimes and penalties , we have no great faith in them . Let there be no law except that all irreverence , indecorum , riot , and other violations of moral propriety shall be visited on the offender as the Faculty shall see fit , and this is as good as a long code . But even this involves legislation and police , or if not legislation , penalty , which may be the more effectual and formidable from its very vagueness . Yet , after all , the question turns on the capacity of young persons at college to govern themselves without law and inspection . Suppose the younger scholars to be only twelve years old . Could you apply to them Dr. Hedge 's principles of freedom from control ? When does this power of selfgovernment begin ? We should say , whun they are mature enough to // be able to choose their own studies with advantage , and to guide themselves without being subject to the control of others , whenever that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own studies implies a past discipline ; such as or better than colleges now give ; and self-control is not ordinarily reached much betbre the same period . We come then to this question whether a freer course of study , superadded to the present college system , would be desirable , and should pronounce , with Dr. Hedge , most positively in its favor , not only for the sake of the culture of such advanced students , but for the reaction of examples of higher attainments on the college classes . In what we have yet to say , on a system of free study , and in defense of some such method of college education as now prevails , we shall depart in a degree from the direct consideration of Dr. fledge 's address . There is a common ground on which he and we might stand ; but there are views of discipline and of education in the minds of some reformers which we regard as exceedingly pernicious . We will not allege in opposition to a plan of free study that a place of education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive or more richly endowed than our present schools of learning are , must have a much greater number of instructors or lecturers within the same branch , as well as a greater number of branches . How many men in this country are competent to teach Anglo-Saxon , Sanscrit , or Russian ? How many could at this moment teach Italian as it ought to be taught , in order to serve as a discipline , with a full knowledge of its grammar according to the researches of Dietz , and of its early literature and history . The teaching profession must be greatly subdivided and greatly improved throughout , and the institutions of learning he greatly increased in wealth , if a wide plan of free studies could be pursued to advantage . We will also admit that the discipline of many studies might be rendered much more rigid , and that a. simple study pursued on a broad scale might profitably occupy all the time and thought now devoted to many . even the modern languages , the study of which , as now pursued , places no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any high degree , may // be so taught that the student will not be able to pass over his task half asleep ,  --  not to say that there are some books like Dante , written before the period of ' modern style , or abounding with historical allusions or profound thought , which are as hard to interpret as ? schylus or Persius . Take the first line of the Inferno , and let a thorough philological system be pursued : nel mezzo come first , words perfectly clear , but how much lore may be gathered around them . The first presents to us , for instance , the birth of the article in the Romanic languages , and its coalescence with the preposition . The other brings before us the transition from the Latin d to the modern z effected under the influence of the succeeding i , one of the countless number of changes , extending even into our own language , to which the same representative of sound , when following many of the mutes , has given rise . Would an advocate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study of the modern languages ? If so , the discipline would be good no doubt , but it is the same which runs through our Greek , and in a measure our Latin training now , and for which that training capacitates us . If he would not , how much discipline can we expect from this class of languages ? Very little , we think , in comparison with the discipline now gained in the study of Greek and Latin . But supposing instructors of ability provided for an enlarged number of departments , and a rigid method introduced into all branches of science , there are several points to be determined before a reasonable man can abandon a system which has been on the whole somewhat successful . We are disposed in urging these considerations , not to do so with intolerance or fanaticism ; we see but partial success-often very small success-in our present college education , and would by no means stifle fair discussion ; but certain positions we are compelled to take and defend , until dislodged from themmi by considerations more weighty than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these is , that a college student is not in a condition to choose what branch of learning he shall pursue . This , we think , no one will deny , if it is asserted of students at their entrance or during the first two years of a college life . They // may indeed at their entrance have reached on the average the age of eighteen years , but very many are younger , and those who are older , as a general thing , are most completely unable to take a rational survey of the various branches of knowledge , and to say what is best fitted for their especial natures , and for the highest development of their powers . Nor are their parents competent to judge for them on any rational principles . In the end , the choice will depend on whim , or will be controlled by some officer of the college . This seems to us to be a point of no small importance . If the t*ollege could be exalted into a university proper , in such a sense that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special study , as if it were a profession for life ; if they were qualified to choose the one or two best adapted to their genius or want of genius ; if in short the preparatory school would or could carry its pupils so far forward that the discipline of the college would no longer be needed-yes , no longer be needed , even to unlearn ; if there could be a general pushing fom'ward and displacement , so that the academy could cover half or three-quarters of the college life , and the college stretch its discipline as much farther on than it does now ,  --  in a state of things like this , the college system might be altered ; but until this shall happen , we see evils that would frighten us back from such reform as is sometimes recommended . We will say , however , as we have said once before , that we should rejoice heartily if the field of the academy could be advanced , and the division of labor between it and the college be readjusted . Another consideration of no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in training for the work of life , ought to be kept under the influence of one or two studies only . This runs back to the old doctrine , unshaken as yet , we suppose , in the minds of all practical teachers , that discipline is to be mainly aimed at in the earlier years of education , while knowledge is of minor importance ; that he who has a disciplined mind can now pursue any or all knowledge with success and dispatch , while he who has not can neither acquire knowledge well nor use it to advantage ; and that several classes of studies must concur in their influences , in order to prevent the formation of a one-sided mind . Experience confirms this view . The // training of the English schools is too exclusively classical . West Point is thought to give the best mathematical training this country affords , yet there are many who think that , although the influences of other studies lend their aid in some degree , the main result is a one-sided one , as indeed in a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional aim in view . And so , when a young man goes into the study of law or medicine or theology without a good preparatory training , will he not ordinarily be found to make an incomplete or a narrow man . Is not especially the state of the medical profession such as to demand reform at once , where three years ' training converts into a doctor of medicine a youth from the plough or the woods , who knows almost nothing , who knows neither how to think , nor how to express himself , nor how to observe . A so-called reform in college study would overthrow the l ) resent predominance of the classical and mathematical studies in favor of the natural sciences and the modern languages . Here the plea is for the most part a practical one . The old system was good enough for training , but had no contents . All might be forgotten , and ordinarily was forgotten , as the boy became a man . The physical sciences , however , contain an amount of knowledge beyond measure great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of the present , and unlock the chambers where the business , the political relations-in short , all the art , taste , science of mankind are stored up . Better to read Homer in Lord Derby 's version , or Plato in Cousin 's , than to plod on through long years , catching glimpses of the antique world from half . understood Greek , at the expense of all power to catch hold of time present . We have several considerations to oppose to this over valuation as it seems to us of the exclusively modern world . Two of them are confined to the studies of the languages . Of these , the more practical one is , that a good discipline under the ancient languages , especially under the Latin , places the acquisition of the modern , and above all of the IRomanic languages within a young person 's easy reach . Suppose five years to be mainly devoted to the study of language ; we have little // doubt that if three of them are given to Latin and Greek , the three principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two years as they could have been in the five , if no acquaintance with the Latin had preceded . And the reason of this lies in the superior discipline afforded by those languages of the ancient times , more than in the fact that the vocabulary and grammar of the modern daughters of the Latin are to a considerable extent drawn from it . It is on the difference of thinking and expression between the old world and ours , that the greater discipline , the greater trial and exercise of the faculties in learning a language depends . The modern world in Christian lands thinks and writes very much in one way ; even the Germans have modern minds , although their language is harder to acquire than those of most other European nations . The difficulties to be overcome in Latin thus smooth the way afterwards , and the succeding task of learning a language of modern times is rendered far easier . Another thing worthy to be taken into account is , that the study of the ancient languages forms a connection in the mind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mathematical sciences have no connection with the world at all . The physical and natural , with the exception of geology , contain almost nothing of a historical character . We need for the highest purposes of life , for instance that we may be in a condition to judge of the evidences of religion and to understand its nature the better , to come into contact with antiquity , to be able to estimate its spirit , its wants , its actual civilization , to know something of the world betore Christ and the world without Christ . Not only is the key to this furnished by ancient literature , but the study of the works of those ages creates a conception in our minds of the state and progress of mankind which is of use for our culture in the highest sense . Not only is the judgment exercised by the continual habit of estimating probabilities in the combinations of words and of sentences , but the world itself opens to our eyes and becomes more apprehensible ; we can trace its plan better , and see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies which some would abandon for the sake of the physical , we suppose that few teachers // would consent to such a loss in discipline . Pursued by themselves , they would involve some amount of injury to the habits of thought , but the united training by means of demonstrative and probable truth prevents this evil , and the benefits of this kind of study are so great and so manifest , that they are likely to maintain their ground forever in the education of the scholar . The study of history deserves some attention by itself . To pursue merely a course of reading in this branch of knowledge we must pronounce-much as we value historical studies-to be no discipline , except so far as all knowledge is a discipline , and so far as it connects us in a poor kind of way with the remote past . To study history independently , examining testimonies and entering into the spirit of the age by the help of all its monuments and records , is a task demanding good if not high attainments in philology to begin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached . To trace the history ot civilization , to behold the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them from the beginning as on a map , with their contributions to the improvement of mankind , and the higher kingdoms of human thought , with the influences under which they grew , is a noble , but , we fear , a dry study , and one not likely to be selected by those who have the power of choice . In fine , we are of opinion that historical study would consist chiefly of reading the most accessible books , which could be done as well on a sofa as by a table . A large part o* the projected reforms in the curriculum of our schools proceeds then , if we are not deceived , from an overestimate of the value of knowledge in education , and an underestimate of the value of training . Yet we are free to confess that the results of a college education are by no means satisfactory , that few good scholars are to be found , that a large part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge even of those books and those branches to which the most time is allotted . The colleges mannot be materially improved , unless there is a reform above and below them , unless the academies are all as thorough as some few are , and unless the work of professional life and the prospects of success in professional life demand higher scholarship . If a rigid exami // nation for degrees , or some system which would test the acqui-p sitions of the students more thoroughly at the end of their course , could be adopted , and the same facilities existed as at present for the ignorant and incompetent to enter into professional life , nothing material could be gained ; or if none were admitted from the academies but scholars of the first grade , nothing again would be gained so long as there are side-cuts8/i un-pike8 , to use an expressive but monstrous word in vulgar use-which avoid a college education . All the departments of education must move forward together . If one department undertakes to go faster or in a different line from the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few scholars it is proud of , amid many who can hardly be called scholars . It is this illsuccess which discourages college men and encourages reformers , the evil lying all the while not in the studies pursued or even in the teaching , although that is often indifferent , but in the feelings and habits of the country , in its standard of excellence , in the ease with which a poor education can fit a person for and can help him to reach the best posts of society . Perhaps the reformers can remedy the evils in a slight degree . If so , let them try . They can not succeed certainly without a more rigorous training than now prevails . But let some college contract its course to three years or even to two years of enforced study , and then hold out inducements to students residing within its walls for two years after this , to attain to excellence in certain branches of knowledge , two at least of which branches shall be pursued by every such person ; let no one have the priyilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain rank of excellence in the previous stage ; let no one remain who can not show that he is faithful and successful at frequent examinations ; and let the expenses of such a voluntary course be not greater than those of the earlier course . Let this be done , and prove a success , and we will go over to the side of the reformers . Only they must promise that discipline of the mind must be placed first in their estimate of the value of education , and knowledge , with immediate ends in life be put in the background . @
