txt Maj.-Gen . BUTLER arrived in this city from before Richmond last week , and makes the announcement this morning , in the form of " General Orders , No. 1 , " that " in obedience to the orders of the President , and by the assignment of Maj.-Gen . Dix , commanding Department of the East , " he " assumes command of the troops arriving and about to arrive , detailed for duty in the State of New York , to meet existing emergencies . " Gen. BUTLER sets forth that the precautionary measure of sending troops to this State has been adopted by the Government because it has information that raids on our frontier , like that at St. Alban 's , are in contemplation by Confederate emissaries ; but that he has force sufficient to preserve the public peace , and to prevent and punish incursions upon our borders .

This last must not be taken as an idle threat ; for it is only about a year since a large business in this line was done in Western cities , as St. Louis , where millions of dollars ' worth of steamboats , etc. , were ' destroyed by rebel incendiaries . In view of these things , It would be insane not to be vigilant  --  not to be amply prepared to promptly crush any disorderly attempts of rebel incendiaries and marauders at the first moment they are discovered .
