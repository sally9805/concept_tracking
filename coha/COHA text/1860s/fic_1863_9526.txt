Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear  --  the armed rhinocerous  --  or the Hurken tiger ; take any shape but that , and my firm nerves will never tremble ; or , be alive again , and dare me to the desert with thy sword . If trembling I inhibit , then pertest me the baby of a girl . Hence ! horrible shadow ! unreal mockery ! hence ! hence ! hence ! Throws Gaily down , who scrambles up immediately .

" When in your letters you shall these unhappy deeds relate , speak of me as I am .
