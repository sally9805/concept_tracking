TuE recent literary festival at Hamilton College has awakened a new interest in the men who were specially concerned in founding that institution . Chief among these was the Rev. Samuel Kirkland , the larger part of whose life was spent in endeavors to Christianize the Indians of Central New York , and to introduce among them the benefits of modern civilization . He was not permitted to witness as large success as he had hoped ; yet few men have labored more faithfully than he , and few have achieved , under like circumstances , more important results . His life covers the period of our Revolution ; lie was officially connected with some of the leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the central college of // the Empire State were such as to merit for him an honorable record among the friends of Christian learning . At the celebration above referred to , an historical discourse was delivered by President Fisher , in which he recounts the part taken by Mr. Kirkland in founding that institution . We avail ourselves of the new interest thereby awakened in the memory of this benevolent and heroic man , to give a detailed sketch of his life . Samuel Kirkland was born in Norwich , Connecticut , iDecember 1 , 1741 . His earliest ancestor , of whom any trace remains , was one John Kirkland , of Silver Street , London . The family , for several generations , held influential posts in society and in the Church . Miles Standish was one of his progenitors . Particular mention is also made of Daniel , his father , who was pastor of a church in Norwich , and is recorded as being " a devoted minister , an accomplished scholar , a man of fine talents , of a ready wit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's childhood and youth little is known . It may be supposed , however , that he was trained , like other Puritan boys of the time , to habits of industry and self-dependence . As Cotton Mather wrote of Thomas Hooker , so it may be said of him , that " he was born of parents that were neither unable nor unwilling to bestow upon him a liberal education ; whereunto the early , lively sparkles of wit observed in him did very much encourage them . His natural temper was cheerful and courteous ; but it was accompanied with such a sensible grandeur of mind as caused his friends , without the help of astrology , to prognosticate that he was born to be considerable . " When about twenty years of age , we find him at the academy of IRev . Dr. Wheelock , at Lebanon ; Connecticut , preparing for college . Among his companions here were several Indian youth , with one of whom he studied the Mohawk dialect , and made a good degree of proficiency in it . He entered the Sophomore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a scholar . Here , if not at Lebanon , he entered upon the Christian life . At some time during his college course , he determined to spend his days in missionary service among the Indian tribes of the West ; and when this purpose was once // formed , it gave a new impulse to his mind , and inspired him with fresh ardor in study . The Senior year in college seems to have been a little too long for his fervent zeal ; since we find him starting off , several months before its close , on a tour of exploration and inquiry among the Seneca Indians in Western New York . Though not present to graduate with his class , he received the usual bachelor 's degree at Commencement . Young Kirkland was now twenty-three years of age . The Senecas were the most remote of the Six Nations , if not the most powerful and warlike of them all . His undertaking was regarded by his friends as bold and hazardous . The journey thither was toilsom* and difficult . No Protestant missionary had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enlighten and convert them had hitherto been scornfully rejected . Nothing daunted , our young apostle resolved to visit these sava6es , and , if he could persuade them to receive him , he meant to live among them as their teacher and spiritual guide . This enterprise was doubtless undertaken by the advice of his patron and friend , Dr. Wheelock , and its expenses were defrayed out of funds deposited with him by certain benevolent gentlemen in Scotland . The journey thither , in view of all its circumstances , is worthy of detailed recital . He started early in November , 1T64 , attended by a young Mohawk Indian , and arrived on the 16th at Johnson Hall , the residence of Sir William Johnson , his Majesty 's Agent for Indian Affairs , near the present village of Johnstown , N. Y. Much to his regret , he was obliged to remain here until January , for want of a suitable guide through the wilderness . But he did not spend his time in idleness or vain repining . Every day he gained some new information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senecas , and soon acquired a good general knowledge of all the leading characters in the Six Nations . At length , two friendly Senecas , passing westward , offered to conduct him to their country . On the 17th of January , the party set out . The weather was severely cold , and the snow so deep that it was necessary to walk with snowshoes . Besides this , each traveller had to carry a pack of clothes and provisions weighing upwards of forty pounds . // SAMUEL KIRKLAND . " It would have been a tine study for a painter , " says Dr. Lothrop , his grandson and biographer , " to watch his countenance , and trace its lines of high thought and holy purpose , as he turned his back upon Johnson Hall , the last vestige of civilization , and , amid the dreary desolation of winter , in company with two savages with whom he could hardly exchange a word , struck off into the forest on a journey of nearly two hundred miles . " - JVemoir , p. 24 . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had expected . His companions opened with their hatchets the path before him , whenever it was obstructed ; they halted to rest , when he became weary ; they chafed his limbs when they vere swollen by the friction and weight of the snow-shoes ; and at night they made for him soft and fragrant beds of evergreen boughs . At Kanonwarohale , the chief village of the Oneidas , and at Onondaga , they were kindly treated , and invited to tarry ; but , after a day 's rest at each place , they pressed forward until they reached Kanadasegea , the principal village of the Senecas . The day after their arrival , a council was called to receive and hear a letter brought by Mr. Kirkland from Sir William , in which , among other things , he commended the missionary to their confidence , and enjoined it upon them to treat him with kindness and respect . The head-chief and a majority of his people received him with frank cordiality , though a few were silent and looked sullen . The sachem even adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms and courtesies were truly remarkable , as the acts of savages who had learned little from the usages of civilized life . A Dutch trader , happening to stroll into the settlement the next day , acted as interpreter between the parties . It is remarkable that nearly every one who addressed the missionary began with this inquiry What put it into your mind to leave your father 's house and country , to come so many hundred miles to see Indians , and live among them ? " Did they suspect some sinister design , or were the poor creatures unable to appreciate his Christian philanthropy ? Having been domiciled in a small family near the wigwam of the sachem , Mr. Kirkland applied himself to learning the language , and acquainting himself with the habits of the people . For a time everything went on smoothly . But lo ! in // a few weeks his host died suddenly in the night . " What means this ? " inquired the superstitious red men . Some of his enemies avowed that he had cansed this death by magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had permitted the strange teacher to come among them ; and they clamored for his life . A council was called to consider this matter , and held its sessions for six days . At first the result seemed doubtful . On the third day , one of his friends , apprehensive as to the issue , put a gun into his hands , and led him into the woods , as if for hunting partridges , but , in reality , to conceal him in a distant and secret hut until the public excitement should pass over . At length , after long deliberation , the missionary was acquitted , and restored to general confidence . Several days after the dispersion of the council , the chief took Mr. Kirkland aside , and observed to him , quite naively , that " some Indians were afraid of writing , as it would speak for a great many years afterward , and that , whenever he wrote to Sir William , therefore , it would be good for him to call several of the chiefs together , and interpret to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and make their hearts glad . " The young missionary was shrewd enough to see that this speech was designed to prevent his writing to Mr. Johnson an account of the late difficulty . They were heartily ashamed of it . A speech of one of the leading men in this council ( as afterwards reported to Mr. Kirkland ) ran thus : " This white skin whom we call our brother has come upon a dark design , or he would not have travelled so many hundred miles . He brings the white people 's book . They call it God 's holy book . Brothers , attend ! You know this book was never made for Indians . The Great Spirit gave us a hook for ourselves . He wrote it in our heads . " This speech became inflammatory as it went on , and closed with a demand for the white man 's blood . The widow of the deceased was then called to testify whether this priest did not carry with him some magical powders : " Did he never come to the bedside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his face ? " " No , never , " replied the honest woman ; " he always sat or lay down on his own bunk ; and in the evening , after we were&gt;in bed , we could see him get // down on his knees and talk with a low voice . " Whether this testimony to his pious integrity , or the fear of incurring Sir William 's displeasure , had most influence upon their decision , we care not now to inquire . In March and April of the following year there was a great scarcity of food among the Senecas and the adjoining tribes . Not only was their stock of corn exhausted , but game of all sorts became scarce , and for a time nothing but roots and nuts kept them from starvation . Expeditions were sent out in various directions for supplies , one of which , to the Mohawk valley , headed by Mr. Kirkland , came back loaded with food and blankets . As soon as he had mastered the language so as to speak it , he went from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw , indeed , that many suspicious eyes were fixed upon him , and that in some breasts the old hatred was still burning ; but he hoped to outlive this prejudice , and so kept on at his work as if unconscious of danger . A single incident , illustrating the cherished malignity of some of the Indians , may not be out of place . Returning , one summer 's day , from a neighboring settlement on the lake shore , singing hymns as he went , and talking to his favorite pony , he espied an Indian skulking through a neighboring thicket , and picking the flint of his gun , as if preparing to fire . A moment 's glance showed him that this was one of his old enemies , - a vindictive and ferocious fellow , capable of any deed of savage cruelty . Assured that this man was intent on destroying his life , he yet rode on , betraying no sign of fear . " Stop ! stop ! " shouted the Indian . Mr. Kirkland replied , as if misunderstanding him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lake , " meanwhile quickening his horse luto greater speed . Shortly afterward , he turned his head enough to see that the murderer had raised his gun to his shoulder . In a moment more , he heard the snap of the lock . The gun missing fire , the savage again bade him halt ; but he pushed on , though expecting every instant to feel the bullet in his back . The click of the missing lock again reached his ear , and now he spurred his horse into a full run , and erelong reached home unharmed . What transpired subsequently we are not informed , except that this man , convinced th t the 12* // Great Spirit loved the missionary with a special love , and guarded him from impending danger , came and humbly begged his pardon , and thenceforward remained his stanch friend . After Mr. Kirkland had spent a year and a half among the Senecas , - a period full of hardship and danger , - he returned to New England to receive ordination . Arriving at Lebanon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministry , and was at the same time appointed Indian missionary under the charge of the Connecticut Board of the Scottish Missionary Society . It will be observed that he had pursued no prescribed curriculum of theological study ; his teachers in divinity had been the experiences of eighteen months among the sons of the forest . Yet he had not wholly neglected books . No small part of the load which he and his guides carried in their knapsacks through the wilderness consisted of choice treatises on Biblical learning . After his ordination , the Missionary Board decided against his return to the Senecas , and commissioned him , instead , to the Oneidas , who were somewhat central among the Six Nations , and seemed more willing than any other tribe to receive instruction . Mr. Kirkland , from first to last , regarded them as the noblest portion of the confederacy . Brave and fierce in war , they yet were generous , hospitable , and benevolent in social life . Plainly , too , they were not wanting in shrewd and nice discernment of character , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - in allusion , doubtless , to the favorite recreation of our whittling ancestors . The name of this tribe signifies the upright stone . There was standing , until recently , in the town of Stockbridge , Oneida County , N. Y. , an upright stone or rock of considerable size , which was reputed to be the national altar . For many ages - so it was believed - the people had assembled here annually to celebrate a grand festival in honor of the Great Spirit . Hence they became known as the Oncidas , or the tribe of the upright stone . This stone has lately been removed to a prominent position within the gates of Forest Hill Cemetery at Utica . In July , 1766 , Mr. Kirkland started for this new field , and erelong arrived at Kanonwarohale , the principal village of the // tribe , situated near what is now known as Oneida Castle . Intending to make this a permanent residence , he built for himself a log-house , doing much of the work with his own hands . He soon formed plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - plans and labors which were not wholly in vain . Thus occupied , he spent three years of useful activity , not sinking under bodily privations and discomforts , nor discouraged by the indifference or opposition of the natives , but toiling onward with a cheerful faith , instructing the ignorant , restraining the vicious , and declitring to all the unknown God whom they ignorantly worshipped . In the spring of 1769 , his hardships had so worn upon his health that his friends urged him to rest awhile and to visit New England . This was just what he needed . The summer 's recreation on his native hills restored him , and before the autumn set in he was ready to return to his post of duty . But is it strange that he now began to think it not good for a missionary to be alone ? Several years before this , his correspondence betrays , now and then , a touch of the tender passion . To his friend , Dr. Wheelock , he writes thus : " I thank you , reverend sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your letters , which is very agreeable in this rough , unhewn part of the world ; and I can assure you the person would be much more so , were I in a proper situation for the sweetest joy of life . But farewell to that for the present . " His circumstances having now somewhat improved , he sought and won in marriage the hand of Jerusha Biugham , a niece of Dr. Wheelock . Our narrative must not linger to follow the happy pair in their boat-passage up the Mohawk River , and their horseback tour through the woods to Oneida , his wife on a pillion behind her husband . Nor can we dwell upon his enlargement of his log-house to the dimensions of sixteen feet square , making it quite a spacious and stylish residence for the time and place . This , however , should be said , that Mrs. Kirkland 's presence among the Indians was immediately felt , diffusing a spirit of order , industry , and purity on every side , and improving the dress and manners of both men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with new energy . His schools flourished , intemperance was checked , the Sabbath was better // observed , and not a few persons appeared truly reformed in heart and life . At this very day , there are families amon the descendants of the Oneida tribe at Green Bay , Wisconsin , who trace back the respectability and virtue of their ancestors to the labors of the missionary at this period . In the year 1770 Mr. Kirkland transferred his relations from the Scottish Board of Missions to the London Society , whose correspondents resided in Boston . He also now interested himself more in the material prosperity of the Oncidas . A saw-mill , a grist-mill , and a blacksmith 's shop were built the same year , with a substantial school-house and church . Then oxen were purchased , and farming utensils in considerable variety . During the next year Mrs. Kirkland became the happy mother of twin sons , whom the parents named George Whitefield and John Thornton . The Indians were greatly rejoiced at this event : they adopted the boys into their tribe with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The following summer and winter Mrs. Kirkland spent at Stockbridge , Massachusetts , intending to return in the spring . But when that season came , such disturbances had arisen among the Six Nations , with the prospect also of war between the Colonies and the mother country , that Mr. Kirkland thought it prudent to purchase a house for her in Stockbridge , where she could remain with her children in safety . Now begins a turbulent period in the life of our missionary . Sir William Johnson having died , his son , Colonel Guy Johnson , was made Superintendent in his stead . " Another king arose who knew not Joseph . " In every possible way he showed hostility to him and the objects of his mission . A sturdy royalist , he tried to array the Indians against the colonists . A bigoted Churchman , he hated Mr. Kirkland 's Puritanism , and reviled his clerical pretensions before the natives , affirming that he and all the other " New England ministers were not true ministers of the Gospel , " and " that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he declared with much warmth , " ought to pray only according to those forms which the King has set forth in the prayer-book , and you must learn the responses . " The angry Colonel did not carry his // point . The natives summoned a council , in which they resolved to send him a belt of wampum and a messenger to make a speech defending the missionary and deprecating all interference with his work . At the same time , they paid due respect to the position and dignity of the Colonel . This firm yet temperate and reasonable course had the desired effect . During the Revolutionary war , which now began , we have no full or connected account of Mr. Kirkland 's life . His labors as missionary and teacher were much interrupted by the efforts of the royalists to enlist the Indians against the Colonists . During this period of agitation , he was often absent from Oneida , now serving as chaplain in the Continental army , and then engaged by appointment of the government in endeavors to hold the Six Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took long journeys in various directions to attend councils among the different tribes . For a time his exertions promised success , but the persistent efforts of Joseph Brant , Colonel Johnson , and other British agents , were too much for him . The Oneidas and Tuscaroras remained firm ; but the Mohawks , Senecas , and others wavered , and then fell away . Every reader of American history is familiar with that bloody page which recounts the descent of St. Leger , at this time , from Oswego , with a large body of Indians , attacking Fort Schuyler ( now Utica ) , and ravaging no small part of the valley of the Mohawk . At these scenes of violence , the Oneidas and Tuscaroras became greatly excited . Like all other savages , they delighted in war . To keep the peace , as the Colonists desired , was the hardest thing that could be demanded of them ; they wanted to fight on one side or the other . After two years of impatient neutrality , General Schuyler gratified them by allowing a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skenando , to engage in certain special services . In the years 1777 and 1778 , we find Mr. Kirkland at one time on short visits to his family ; again at Oneida , endeavoring to cheer and control his people amid the troubles of the times ; and again at various places , procuring information from friendly scouts of the movements of the enemy along our northern frontier . In 1779 he was brigade chaplain with General Sullivan , in his campaign on the Susquehanna. // On the return of peace , in 1784 , he was reappointed a missionary among the Oneidas . But he found , alas ! that war had sown desolation in its track . It left the red men poor , their habits of industry broken up , their morals depraved , and their schools and churches almost forsaken . Yet he was not discouraged . He resumed his work with hopefulness and ardor . In the course of a year the affairs of his flock looked encouraging . The natives became more intelligent , and showed a disposition to inquire into , and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Cayuga chief , who had heard favorable reports of the white priest and his Bible , came sixty miles to visit him . The origin of the Christian religion , the inspiration of the Scriptures , the law of God , the history of Christ , - such high themes were the subjects of their conversation . The sagamore admitted that Christianity was a pretty good sort of religion . But just as he was departing Satan put it into his heart to inquire why , if the Bible was so good a book , it had been so long withheld from heathen nations ; and this he followed up with other questions of casuistry , - among the rest , that old thorny perplexity , the origin of evil , - all produced for the sake of debate and fault-finding . The missionary replied to these inquiries in an able manner , but feared that the chief went back to his tribe little benefited by his visit . A happier case was that of a venerable Indian , who had been quite a Pharisee , and was accounted one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after several discussions with Mr. Kirkland , was convinced of the falsity and corruption of paganism and of the truth and purity of Christianity , and then entreated his teacher to " come and cast water on him in the name of Jesus . " The conversion of this leading man was the beginning of a general reformation . For a period of seven months not an instance of intoxication was observed . In the three villages under Mr. Kirkland 's care upwards of seventy persons were believed to have become truly religious . Not seldom did he see persons in his congregation who had walked twenty and thirty miles to hear him preach . When the troublous period of the Revolution was over , Mrs. Kirkland had hoped to return to Oneida , to share with her husband in his privations and labors . But the want of schools // and of suitable society for her children detained 11cr in Stockbridge year after year . One of her sons , John Thornton , - a name afterwards to become eminent in the Presidency of Harvard College , - was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in due time , to Cambridge . The twin brother , George , was sent to Dartmouth College . In the year 1788 , when the hopes and prospects of the family were very bright , the mother was taken away , - a blow from which the children , as well as the husband and father , were slow to recover . In the summer of this year , Mr. Kirkland was directed by the Missionary Board to perform a tour among the other tribes of the Confederacy , in order to ascertain their real numbers , and to learn their desires in reference to missionaries and teachers . In connection with this , he was requested by the State government to attend a council of chiefs and State Commissioners held at Buffalo Creek , for the transaction of important business . It was found that the Six Nations numbered about 4,850 , exclusive of the Mohawks , who had left the Confederacy and settled north of Lake Erie ; also , that they were not friendly to the proposal to send New England missionaries among them : at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only such as would baptize the children of all parents , however ungodly . It would seem that Mr. Kirkland 's services as interpreter and mediator in the council were highly valued by both parties . At the conclusion , " the chiefs unanimously returned him their thanks for his friendly aid and advice. ** The Commissioners also voted that , " in consideration of the services rendered by tile Rev. Mr. Kirkland , two thousand acres of land shall be appropriated and given gratis to the said Mr. Kirkland , for the accommodation of his sons , or for such other purpose as he may think proper . " * And at the close of this year , the State of New York and the indians conjointly made him a grant of valuable lands in Oneida County , amounting in all to about 4,760 acres . The tract , since known as Kirkland 's Patent , was two miles square , and lay on the west side of what is now styled " the Property Line , " its northeast corner being just outside the present park of Hamilton College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his appropriate work , yet not without troubles . His meetings were sometimes interrupted by noisy and drunken men . More than once plans were laid to take his life . One morning , a bloody tomahawk was found stuck in his door , an intimation that he must soon leave the neighborhood , or expect the tomahawk . French traders brought in Jesuit priests to combat his teachings and assail his reputation . But he bore his trials manfully , and his influence among the people was strengthened under every attempt to weaken it . During the summer of 1789 , several head men of the tribe came to confer kvith him in reference to the condition and prospects of their nation . Earnestly , and sometimes tearfully , they spoke of their poor people , contrasting their lot with that of the whites . They could not help seeing that the English were increasing in numbers and power , while they were becoming weaker ; and , beholding this , they exclaimed " The rivers and harbors which once received only a few canoes of ours are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where we had only a few smokes ( wigwams ) , they have now great cities and lofty houses ! Lands which our forefathers so1d for a few pence could not now be purchased of the whites for a hundred or a thousand dollars ! " A lamentation which poetry has caught up and repeated - " They waste us , - ay , like April snow , In the warm noon , we shrink away : And fast they follow , as we go Towards the setting day , - Till they shall fill the land , and we Are driven into the western sea . " As they dwelt upon this theme , their breasts would heave , and their eyes flash with sorrowful indignation . " Why this difference ? " they exclaimed , in tones of piteous despair . " Does not the curse of Heaven rest upon us for some old transgression , which we are powerless to remove , and which prevents our reformation and our prosperity ? " A strange superstition , indeed ; yet , in these lamentations over their impending fate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter wisely . He unfolded the influence of // ignorance and vice , and of knowledge and virtue , respectively , on individual and national character ; and he showed that herein , and not in any malediction of Heaven , lay the difference between the lot of the Indians and that of the whites . He endeavored to cheer and encourage them , assuring them that by diffusing intelligence , and by cultivating habits of industry and virtue , they might hope to rise to a condition of comfort and prosperity . Among the records of the following summer , we note intimations that he was then giving much thought to a system of thorough education for the Indians of the Five Nations . He even went so far as to draw out his " Plan " in writing , and to submit it to the consideration of several leading civilians . These gentlemen expressed their approbation of his scheme , but did not think the time quite ripe for its execution . In the winter of 1791 , the general government again sought his aid in conducting a negotiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to strengthen their attachment to the and secure a more oeneral introducgovernment , to tion among them of the arts of civilization . Washington felt a deep interest in this movement , and General Knox wrote to Mr. Kirkland more than once , expressing the high sense which the government entertained of his services , and urging him , if consistent with his other duties , to undertake this new labor . A hostile feeling had lately sprung up against the whites , and plans were maturing in secret to combine the whole confederacy and the Western tribes against the American government . Thanks to the missionary 's great personal influence , and to his untiring exertions , this conspiracy was nipped in the bud . The Five Nations were induced to remain firm in their adhesion to the government , and eventually adopted some of the measures proposed for their improvement . Is it surprising that Mr. Kirkland n6w desired to gather the separated members of his family under one roof and under his own eye ? With this in view , he cleared several acres of his landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The removal of his effects having been accomplished under the charge of his son John Thornton , he plied his missionary work with all his accustomed zeal . During this year some friendly // hand presented his educational scheme to Congress , and it met with such favor that a yearly grant of $ 1,500 was voted , to aid in teaching the natives agriculture and some of the useful arts . In August , 1792 , he attended the Commencement at Dartmouth College , accompanied by an Oneida chief , named Onondego , whose remarkable presence attracted much attention . The Trustees and Faculty of the College paid marked respect to Mr. Kirkland during this visit . On Commencement day , President Wheelock addressed Onondego from the rostrum . A part of his response addressed to the graduating class ran as follows : - " My young brothers , I salute you . My very heart has been gladdened by your pleasant voices . Although I understand but little of your language , I see marks of wisdom , and an enlarged mind , in many things you L @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place for enlightening the mind " My young brothers , attend . In the world , there are many things which cause the unwary to step out of the right path . Hear what I say . Be watchful . Do not forget what you have learned . Never go out of the straight path . It has been marked out by the instructions of your chief Let every step in your future life show that you love peace and the true religion ; and the Great Spirit will bless you . The light be*ins to break forth a little among us in yonder wilderness . " From Hanover they went to Boston and Cambridge . At the College , the chief became quite a " lion " to the undergraduates ; his grave and crisp remarks on what he saw and heard pleased them not a little . The library , the chemical and philosophical apparatus , and the astronomical instruments , lilled him with wonder . As to the orrery , which he called " the sun-moon-and-star machine , " he feared he should not be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridicule it as " some magic-work . " On leaving the town he " expressed great delight and surprise that the wise men at Cambridge , with their knowledge of everything about the works of God , in creation and providence , could nevertheless turn their attention to the interests and happiness of poor Indians . " Shortly after this tour in New England , Mr. Kirkland transferred his residence from Oneida to his lands near the village // 1863 . SAMUEL KIRKLAND. of Clinton . Here his children , five in number , grew to maturity . Here , too , he was married to Miss Mary Donnally , a respectable lady who had long resided in his family , and had charge of his children and household in Stockbridge . lilt was his wont to ride on horseback to his various preaching-places in the vicinity . On one of these tours through the woods , a small branch of a tree , which he was endeavoring to push aside , struck him in the eye . The blow was not so severe or painful as to prevent his going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be serious and permanent . For several months he was unable to read or write , and his nervous system was much deranged . By the advice of his physician , he went to New York and Philadelphia to consult certain eminent oculists . He was the more readily inclined to undertake this journey because , in addition to the benefit to his health which he hoped to gain , it would give him an opportunity to confer with several leading men as to a further prosecution of his educational scheme . This scheme contemplated the providing , first , of schools for young native children , in which they should be taught the rudiments of an English education . Three such schools had already been established . A second part of his plan involved the founding of a High School , or Academy , to be centrally situated , and contiguous to some settlement of whites , to which " English youth were to be admitted , bearing the charges of their own education , " and a certain number of older Indian boys , selected from the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be instructed , " we now use Mr. Kirkland 's words , " in the principles of human nature , in the history of civil society , so as to be able to discern the difference between a state of nature and a state of civilization , and know what it is that makes one nation differ from another in wealth , power , and happiness ; and in the principles of natural religion , the moral precepts , and the more plain and express doctrines of Christianity . " For the convenience of both parties , he proposed to place this institution near what was then the boundary-line between the white settlements and the Indian territory . The scheme was well approved everywhere , but perhaps it found its warmest advocates among those intelligent families which had recently emi // grated from New England , and settled in the adjoining towns ; for though they somewhat doubted its success so far as the Indians were concerned , they felt sure that it would be beneficial to the white population . On the journey of which we have spoken , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obtained subscriptions to its funds . He visited the Governor of the State , and the Regents of the University , and , with their co-operation , took the first steps toward procuring a charter , which was obtained the following year , 1793 . Alexander Hamilton afforded him invaluable aid , as did also Colonel Pickering . At Philadelphia he called upon General Washington , who expressed a warm interest in the welfare of the institution . Mr. Hamilton was one of the trustees mentioned in the petition for its incorporation , and after him it was named the " Hamilton Oneida Academy . " Mr. Kirkland 's exertions did not end here . In April , 1793 , he conveyed to the institution a valuable grant of land . This donation was made in connection with a subscription for erecting the academy building . On the table before us lies this orighial subscription-paper , now yellow and torn , on which he entered his first donation .

" This gift , with others from the friends of learning and religion throughout the State , placed the Academy on a substantial footing . A commodious building was erected on the western hillside overlooking the infant settlement of Clinton , on the spot designated by Mr. Kirkland ; an able Preceptor and an assistant were procured , and the doors opened for pupils . Hamilton Oneida Academy soon became widely known , and scholars flocked to it from every quarter . In his Historical Discourse , President Fisher , having remarked upon the time at which the corner-stone of the Academy was laid , thus pictures also the occasion - " The occasion is one of special interest . The chief statesmen of the nation , including the father of his country , have heard of and anticipated it with that peculiar pleasure which belongs to far-seeing and // patriotic minds , intent upon the production of those forces which were to mould the grand future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading minds from a large section of the State . The men who moulded these communities into their present form , with not a few of the earnest , stalwart workers whose hands were to subdue the forests , are there .

" - Jlfemorial , p. 60 . We can not now pause to trace the history of this institution further than to record , that in the year 1812 it was raised to the rank of a college , and that from that time to the present it has enjoyed a fair measure of prosperity . 13* // The establishment of this seminary of learning , which had occupied so many of Mr. Kirkland 's thoughts for the fifteen years previous , was the last important act of his life . He continued his missionary labors , but they were performed amid bodily infirmities and many increasing sorrows . He never recovered entirely from the injury of the eye . In the year 1795 , he was thrown from his horse , and received a blow which aggravate&amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his energies , by thirty years of toil and exposure , and it wer not strange that his health now broke down . And that he should slacken somewhat his labors among the Indians is not surprising , nor yet that he should neglect the details of some of the other interests committed to his keeping . Accordingly , we find that , in the year 1797 , the Board of Commissioners withdrew from him their appointment and support . They did not present full and satisfactory reasons for this summary procedure ; but they doubtless felt that , as he had become broken in health and spirits , and was somewhat engrossed in the care of his lands , a younger man could serve the society better . It is gratifying to know that his integrity was not impeached . Shortly after this , lie became involved in great pecuniary embarrassments through the failure of one of his sons ; and close upon this calamity came the death of two of his children , Samuel and George . But the brave old man bore up under his heavy and complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the year 1798 he received a visit from President Dwight of Yale College , and Jeremiah Day , then Tutor in the same institution . These gentlemen had started from New Haven for a vacation tour on horseback to Niagara Falls ; but on reaching Utica , they heard such accounts of the difficulties and perils of the journey that they were constrained to abandon it . They , however , rode out to Clinton , to visit the missionary Kirkland and his infant seminary , and then returned to New England . During the remainder of his life , Mr. Kirkland continued to cherish a deep interest in the improvenient of the town where he resided , in the prosperity of the Academy , and in the welfare of the Indians . He bestowed several other gifts upon the institution , and in his death did not forget it . // SAMUEL KIRKLAND . With or without official appointment and salary , he regarded himself as missionary and friend to the natives , and he continued to serve them while he lived . His death occurred in February , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains were carried to the village church in Clinton , where a sermon was preached by the Rev. Dr. Norton . A large assemblage of Indians , from far and near , convened on the occasion , and poured out bitter lamentations over his grave . The funeral address was interpreted to them by Judge James Dean , then resident Agent of Indian Affairs. * Mr. Kirkland seems to have been well adapted physically for the life of labor which he chose . In stature be was a little above the medium height , well proportioned , robust , and in his mature manhood inclining to stoutness . In manners he was simple , dignified , and courteous , not without a dash of bruskuess at times , yet thoroughly polite , - a true gentleman of the old school . His urbanity came partly from native endowment , and partly from his frequent intercourse with eminent and cultivated men . On all public occasions he wore the clerical gown and bands , and , thus robed , presented an imposing aspect . His portrait , prefixed both to Dr. Lothrop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents him as he appeared when about forty years of age , - erect , vioorous , of commanding presence , with a penetrating eye , and an animated , buoyant expression , as if ready for adventure or the endurance of hardship . Had he possessed a feeble constitution , he could never have made those long and toilsome journeys , often on foot , through mud and snow , and sometimes in open boats ; nor could he have submitted to the hard fare of the savages , and been brought , not seldom , to the verge of starvation . Sonic of his survivors , who saw him in their youth , tell us that , when he was about sixty years of age , he looked like a hard-worn old man , - one who had gone through the wars , and come out bronzed by Mention has already been made of his two sons , George Whitefield and Samuel Thornton . Of his daughters , the eldest , Jerusha , was married to John II . Lothrop , of Utica , N. Y. , and died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the wife of Francis Amory , of Boston . Eliza , the youngest , was married to the late Edward Robinson , then Professor in Hamilton College , and since a Biblical scholar of world-wide reputation . // exposure and well marked with bruises and scars . Only a man of great physical vigor could have endured so much and held out so long . It will not be claimed for him that he was gifted with extraordinary mental powers . We find no brilliancy of iraagination , no exuberance of wit , no philosophical profoundness . But we meet with what is of more value , - good , plain strength of intellect , ability to grasp large and small matters , solid judgment , rare executive talent , and an unconquerable will . He was a careful observer of men and of events . Early thrown upon his own resources , and disciplined by adversity , he became independent and self-sustained . His mind took on something of the freedom and rough grandeur of the scenes amid which his life was passed . It was no slight advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolution , to witness its first outbreak , to watch and help on its progress , and to greet its successful termination . In such scenes the mind often acquires a vigor and clearness which do not come from simply poring over books . He was by no means wanting in tender sensibility and generous enthusiasm , and in humor and wit , though this latter trait was only a delicate vein running through his nature , and not perceptible to every eye . It took the form rather of airy sprightliness and genial pleasantry . He possessed a large fund of memorabilia ; and the recital of these in his downright , hearty manner gave variety and raciness to his conversation . We do not hear that the Indians ever said of him , as the natives once did of a bookish Puritan , that " he could whistle Greek " ; yet he was learned enongh to be an oracle to them , and his learning was practical , and ever at their service . To use an ancient figure , he was a tree of knowledge which carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the golden fruit . He did not , like Jonathan Edwards , while missionary to the Stockbridge Indians , spend his leisure in composing theological treatises , but he gave all his time and thoughts to the well-being of his humble charge . He was made for a pioneer and for a worker in the common ways of life , and he used his talents wisely and effectively . His moral and religious character gave tone and direction // to his whole career . While yet a youth , at Dr. Wheelock 's school , his true spiritual life began , and he evinced the earnestness of his zeal by resolving at once to spend his days in missionary service among the Indians . He consorts with the dusky Seneca boys , that he may learn their manners and their strange tongue . From college halls his eyes look abroad with longing upon the Western wilderness , and he can not wait for his bachelor 's diploma before he starts upon his first adventurous journey among the Iroquois . Nor does he sink under rough toil , or quail before persecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brainerd , spend his time and exhaust his strength in torturing self-scrutiny and self-upbraiding and melancholy forebodings . No : he wisely learns that the best proof of love to God is to be found in hearty , joyous service for him . He suffers himself to be adopted into the family of an Indian , sleeps and eats in their smoky , squalid wigwams , becomes all things to them , if by any means he may save some . He imbues their children with the rudiments of education and religion , and to their sages he opens the higher wisdom of the Bible . He teaches agriculture and mechanics . He mediates between men at variance . He goes on long journeys to negotiate their affairs with the whites , and to keep them at peace with those who would embroil them in war . And does he not serve his country , too ? Indeed , as we review the history of his life during the Revolutionary war , - holding in friendly relations two savage tribes , and keeping close watch upon the movements of others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the conclusion of the war managing several difficult embassies between the natives and the whites for their mutual benefit , - he seems to us deserving of no less honor from his countrymen than many a military hero crowned with blood-bought laurels . His plan for the education of the Indians is creditable alike to his head and his heart . He doubtless foresaw that missionary labors among them would be of little permanent value without education . The half-regenerated savage would relapse into barbarism as soon as the living preacher should be withdrawn . Desirous that his work should outlast his own life , he resolved to lay a solid basis in education . He wanted , // moreover , to promote the social culture of the natives by bringing their children into daily association with those of white men . In this way he hoped to overcome the prejudices existing between the two races , and to bind them together in bonds of perpetual brotherhood . The conception of this plan must have been the fruit of those frequent and touching interviews with Indian chiefs concerning the prospects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inevitable , unless something were done to prevent it ; and they came with sad hearts to their friend and teacher , imploring his help to save them from utter extinction . It seems as if his scheme were formed in fulfilment of some secret , holy vow to make one grand and mighty effort to stay their fall , and , if possible , to restore them to prosperity . Was it not a worthy endeavor ? Had he done nothing more than this , he would be entitled to a high place among Christian philanthropists . It matters little that his plan did not accomplish all that he had hoped . A few natives only became members of his Academy , and some of these pursued their studies but a short time . The careless freedom of life in the woods and the excitements of the hunting-ground were more attractive than the confinement and dull routine of the school-room . Yet of these few , and of the larger number trained in his primary schools , a goodly proportion became intelligent and virtuous men . To this day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revere and bless no name so much as that of Kirkland . But his scheme , so far as it related to the whites , was abundantly successful . The Academy flourished , and , as he had contemplated from the first , was soon raised to the rank of a College . He saw our day afar off , and was glad . The old landmark known as " the boundary line of property " between the whites and Indians has been almost swept away with the removal of the natives ; but the College founded by his wisdom and benevolence still stands , diffusing its light far beyond the territory occupied by the Six Nations . It has trained its thousand youths for professional and commercial life , and will doubtless continue to scud forth streams of healthful influence for many generations to com e*
