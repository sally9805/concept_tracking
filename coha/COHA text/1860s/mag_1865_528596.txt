DIPLOMACY OF THE REVOLUTION . WHEN a European speaks about the American Revolution , he speaks of it as the work of Washington and Franklin . These two names embody for his mind all the phases of the contest , and explain its result . The military genius of Washington , going hand in hand with the civil genius of Franklin , fills the foreground of his picture . He has heard of other names , and may remember some of them ; but these are the only ones which have taken their place in his memory at the side of the great names of European history . In part this is owing to the importance which all Europeans attach to the French alliance as one of the chief causes of our success . For then , as now , France held a place among the great powers of the world which gave importance to all her movements . With direct access to two of the principal theatres of European strife and easy access to the third , she never raised her arm without drawing immediate attention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more powerful there than any other nation ; and even England 's superiority was often , and sometimes successfully , contested . The adoption by such a power of the cause of a people so obscure as the people of the " TJiirteen Colonies** then were was , in the opinion of European statesmen , decisive of its success . The fact of our actual poverty was known to all ; few , if any , knew that we possessed exhaustless sources of wealth . Our weakness was on the surface , palpable , manifest , forcing itself upon a$tention ; our strength lay out of sight , in rich veins which none but eyes familiar with their secret windings could trace . Thus the French alliance , as the European interpreted it , was the alliance of wealth with poverty , of strength with weakness , - a magnanimous recognition of efforts which without that recognition Would have been vain . What , then , must have been the persuasive powers , the commanding genius , of the man who procured that recognition ! Partly , also , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Franklin . Franklin was preeminently a wise man , wise in the speculative science and wise in the practical art of life . Something of the maturity of age seems to have tempered the liveliest sallies of his youth , and much of the vivacity of youth mingles with the sober wisdom of his age . Thoughtful and self-controlling at twenty , at seventy his ripe experience was warmed by a genial glow . He entered upon life with the feeling that he had a part to perform , and the conviction that his happiness would depend upon his performing it well . What that part was to be was his earliest study ; and a social temperament , combining with a sound judgment , quickly taught him that the happiness of the individual is inseparably connected with the happiness of the species . Thus life became his study as a condition of happiness ; man and Nature , as the means of obtaining it . He sought to control his passions as he sought to control the lightning , that he might strip them of their power to harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still more sagacious in tracing their con. - nection with effects ; and his speculations often lose somewhat of their grandeur by the simple and unpretending directness with which he adapts them to the common understanding and makes them minister to the common wants of life . The ambition which quickened his early exertions met an early reward . He was ambitious to write well , and he became one of the best writers in our language . He was ambitious of knowledge , and he laid it up in such stores that men sought his conversation in order to learn from him . He was ambitious of pecuniary independence , and he accumulated a fortune // that made him master of his time and actions . He was ambitious of influence , and he obtained a rare control over the thoughts and the passions of men . He was ambitious of fame , and he connected his name with the boldest and grandest discovery of his age . Living thus in harmony with himself , he enjoyed the rare privilege of living in equal harmony with the common mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyday wants and feelings as if he had never looked beyond them , and thus made himself the counsellor of the people . He appreciated the higher wants and nobler aspirations of our nature , and thus became the companion and friend of the philosopher . His interest in the present - and it was a deep and active interest - did not prevent him from looking forward with kindling sympathies to the future . Like the diligent husbandman of whom Cicero tells us , he could plant trees without expecting to see their fruit . If he detected folly with a keen eye , he did not revile it with a bitter heart . Human weakness , in his estimate of life , formed an inseparable part of human nature , the extremes of virtue often becoming the startingpoints of vice , - better treated , all of them , by playful ridicule than by stern reproof . He might never have gone with Howard in search of abuses , but he would have drawn such pictures of those near home as would have made some laugh and some blush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With nothing of the ascetic , he could impose self-denial and bear it . Like Erasmus , he may not have aspired to become a martyr , - but in those long voyages and journeys , which , in his infirm old age , he undertook in his country 's service , there was much of the sublimest spirit of martyrdom . His philosophy , a philosophy of observation and induction , had taught him caution in the formation of opinions , and candor in his judgments . With distinct ideas upon most subjects , he was never so wedded to his own views as to think that all who did not see things as he did must be wilfully blind . His justly tempered faculties lost none of their serene activity or gentle philanthropy by age . Hamilton himself , at thirty , did not labor with more earnestness in the formation of the Constitution than Franklin at eighty-one ; and as if in solemn record of his own interpretation of it , his last public act , with eternity full in view , was to head a memorial to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man should produce a strong impression upon the excitable mind of France must be evident to every one who knows how excitable that mind is . But to understand his public as well as his personal position , not so much at the French Court as at the court of French opinion , we must go back a dozen years and see what that opinion had been since the Peace of 1763 . The Treaty of Paris , like all treaties between equals founded upon the temporary superiority of one over the other , had deeply wounded , not the vanity only , but the pride of France . Humbled in the eyes of her rival , humbled in the eyes of Europe , she was still more profoundly humbled in her own eyes . It was a barbed and venomous arrow , haughtily left to rankle in the wound . For highminded Frenchmen , it was henceforth the wisdom as well as the duty of France to prepare the means and hasten the hour of revenge . It was then that the eyes of French statesmen were first opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then that they first saw how much the prosperity of the parent state depended upon the sure and constant flow- of wealth and strength from this exhaustless source . Then , too , they first . saw , that , in obedience to the same law . by which they had grown into . strength* these Colonies , in due time , must grow into independence ; and in* this , independence , in this severing of ties which they foresaw English pride*would cling to long after English avidity-had stripped them of their natural *tr*ngth , there was the prospect of full and . sweet revenge . - Scarce a twelvemonth had passed from the signing of the Treaty of Paris* 577 // when the first French emissary , an officer of the French navy , was already at his work in the Colonies . Passing to and fro , travelling here and there , moving from place to place as any common traveller might have done , his eyes and his ears were ever open , his note-book was ever in his hand , and , without awakening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which the Duke of Choiseul looked forward as the crowning glory of his administration were wisely and surely taken . They were promptly followed up . The French Ambassador in England established relations with Colonial agents in London which enabled him to follow the progress of the growing discontent and anticipate the questions which must elaborate despatch , harmonizing with the report of his secret agent , and opening a prospect which even the weary eyes of Louis XV . could not look upon without some return of the spirit that had won for his youth the long forfeited title of the Well-Beloved . It was not the first time that the name of the great philosopher had been heard in the council chamber of Versailles . But among the secret agents of France we now meet for the first time the name of De Kalb , a name consecrated in American history by the life that he laid down for us on the fatal field of Camden . Scarce a step was taken by the English Ministry that was not instantly communicated by the Ambassador in London to the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often profound , upon its probable results . Scarce a step was taken in the Colonies without attracting the instant attention of the French agent . Never were events more closely studied or their character better understood . When troops were sent to Boston , the English Ministry was not without serious apprehensions of resistance . But when the tidings of their peaceful landing came , while the English were exulting in their success , the French Ambassador rejoiced that May , the wisdom of the Colonial leaders had withheld them from a form of opposition for which they were not yet ready . The English Ministry was preparing to enter upon a system of coercion at the point of the bayonet . " If the Colonists submit under the pressure , " said Choiseul , " it will only be in appearance and for a short time . " Meanwhile his active brain was teeming with projects ; the letters of his agents were teeming with suggestions . Franc*s counsels caution , dreads the effects of hasty measures ; for the Colonists have not yet learned to look upon France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bind them more firmly to England . Du Ch*telet proposes that France and Spain , sacrificing their old colonial system , should open their colonial ports to the products of the English Colonies ,  --  thus inflicting a fatal blow upon England 's commerce , while they supplant her in the affections of the Colonists . A clerk in the Department of Commerce goes still farther , advocating a full emancipation of the French Colonies , both to throw off a useless burden and to increase the irritation of the English Colonies by the spectacle of an independence which they were not permitted to share . There is nothing in history more humiliating than to see on what small hinges great events sometimes turn . Of all the disgraceful intrigues of a palace filled with intrigues from the day of its foundation , there is none half so disgraceful as the overthrow of the Duke of Choiseul in 1770 . And yet , vile as it was both by its motive and by its agents , it marks an important point in the progress of American independence . A bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of a man whose deep-rooted hatred of England was fast hastening to its natural termination , an open rupture ; and a premature rupture would have brought the Colonists into the field , either as the subjects of England or as the allies of France . To secure the dependence of the Colonies , England would have been compelled to make large concessions ; and timely D*plomacy of ike Revolution . // concessions might have put off the day of separation for another century . To secure the alliance of the Colonies , France would have been compelled to take upon herself the burden of the war ; a French general might have led our armies ; French gold might have paid our troops ; we might have been spared the sufferings of Valley Forge , the humiliation of bankruptcy ; but where would have been the wise discipline of adversity ? and if great examples be as essential to the formation of national as of individual character , what would the name of independence have been to us , without the example of our Washington ? French diplomacy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years . England , unconscious how near she had been to a new war with her old enemy , held blindly on in her course of irritation and oppression ; the Colonies continued to advance by sure steps from resistance by votes and resolves to resistance by the sword . When Louis XVI . ascended the throne in 1774 , and Vergennes received the portfolio of Foreibn Affairs , domestic interests pressed too hard upon them to allow of their resuming at once the vast plans of the fallen minister . Unlike that niinister , Vergennes , a diplomatist by profession , preferred watching and waiting events to hastening or anticipating them . But to watch and wait events like those which were then passing in the Colonies without being drawn into the vortex was beyond the power of even his well-trained and sagacious mind . In 1775 , a French emissary was again taking the measure of American perseverance , French ambassadors were again bringing forward American questions as the most important questions of their correspondence . That expression which has been put into so many mouths as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in substance by Vergennes to the Battle of Bunker Hill , - " Two more victories of this kind , and the English will have no army left in America. ** And while**hus tempted by this proof Dz*lomacy of //ic Revolution . 579 of American strength , his wavering mind was irritated by the apprehension of some sudden outbreak of English arrogance ; for the Ambassador wrote that Whigs and Tories might yet unite in a war against France in order to put an end to the troubles in the Colonies , - and no Frenchman had forgotten that England began the War of 1755 by an open violation of international law , by seizing three hundred French merchant ships and casting into prison ten thousand French sailors before the declaration of hostilities . Thus events prepared the way for American diplomacy , and , more powerful than the prudence of Vergennes or the pacific longings of Louis XVI. , compelled them to decide and act , when they would still gladly have discussed and waited . And , moreover , a new element had been introduced into the councils of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resisted had begun to act with irresistible force . Public opinion , speaking through the press by eloquent pens , through coffee-houses and saloons by eloquent voices , called loudly for action in the name of humanity and in the still more exciting name of French honor . Little as most Frenchmen knew about America , they knew enough about England to believe that in her disputes with other nations she was apt to be in the wrong ,  --  and if with other nations , why not with her own colonies ? The longing for revenge , which ever since the Treaty of Paris filled some corner of every French heart , grew stronger at the near approach of so abundant a harvest ; nor did it lose any of its sweetness from the reflection that their enemy himself was doing what they never could have done alone to prepare it for them . But humanity , too , was a powerful word . Men could not read Rousseau without being led to think more earnestly , if not always more profoundly , upon the laws of social organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abuses and a more vigorous contempt for the systems which had put the many into the hands of the // few to be butchered or butchers at their will . They could not read Montesquieu without feeling that there was a future in store for them for which the long past had been patiently laboring , and longing , as they read , to hasten its coming . In that future , mankind were to rise higher than they had ever risen before ; rulers and ruled were to act in fruitful harmony for their common good ; the brightest virtues of Greece , the purest virtues of Rome , were to revive in some new form of society , not very definitely conceived by the understanding , but which floated in magnificent visions before the glowing imagination . I hasten reluctantly over this part of my subject ; for the formation of public opinion in France and its action upon Government , even while all the forms of an almost absolute monarchy were preserved , is an important chapter in the history of European civilization . But hasten I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element , and reminding my reader , that , chronologically , of the two parts which composed this opinion , hatred for England had been at work ever since 1763 , while sympathy with the Colonists was rather an individual than a public feeling till late in 1776 . It was at Versailles , and not at Paris , that action began . Vergennes 's first step was to send another agent , no longer merely to observe and report , but to ascertain , though without compromising the French Government , how far the Americans were prepared for French intervention . English suspicions were already awakened . Already the English Minister had informed the French Ambassador , upon the authority of a private letter of General Lee to General Burgoyne , that the Americans were sure of French aid . It was not without great difficulty that the new agent , De Banvouloir , could find a safe conveyance . But by December he was already in Philadelphia and , though still pretending to be a mere traveller , soon in full communication with the Committee of Secret Correspondence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November , * is the beginning of the history of our foreign relations . Then began our attempts to gain admission into the great family of nations as an independent power , - attempts not always judiciously directed , attended in some instances with disappointment and mortification , but crowned at last with as full a measure of success as those who understood monarchy and Europe could have anticipated . Two of its members , Franklin and Dickinson , were already known abroad , where , at a later day , Jay also was to make himself an enduring name . The other two , Johnson and Harrison , enjoyed and ' merited a high Colonial reputation . There can be but little doubt that Franklin 's keen eye quickly penetrated the veil under which De Bonvouloir attempted to conceal his real character . It was not the first time that he had been brought into contact with French diplomacy , nor the first proof he had seen that France was watching the contest in the hope of abasing the power of her rival . While agent in London for four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events , study character , give timely warning and wise counsel be the office of an ambassador , - he had lived on a friendly footing with the French legation , and profited by it to give them correct views of the character and feelings of the Colonies . And now , reducing the question to these simple heads , he asked , - " How is France disposed towards us ? If favorably , what assurance will she give us of it ? " Can we have from France two good engineers , and how shall we apply for them ? " Can we have , by direct communication , arms and munitions of war , and free entrance and exit for our vessels in French ports ? " But whatever reliance they may have placed on the French emissary , the Committee were unwilling to confine themselves to this as the only means of opening communication with European powers . During a visit to Hol // land , Franklin had formed the acquaintance of a Swiss gentleman of the name of Dumas , - a man of great learning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sure sources of information . To him he now addressed himself with the great question of the moment : - " If we throw off our dependence upon Great Britain , will any court enter into alliance with us and aid us for the sake of our commerce ? " Such , then , was the starting-point of our diplomatic history , the end and aim of all our negotiations : alliance and aid for the sake of our commerce . But we should greatly mistake the character of the times , if we supposed that this point was reached without many and warm debates . When the question was first started in Congress , that body was found to be as much divided upon this as upon any of the other subjects which it was called upon to discuss . With Franklin , one party held , that , instead of asking for treaties with European powers , we should first conquer our independence , when those powers , allured by our commerce , would come and ask us ; the other , with John Adams , that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new nation to old ones , we ought to send ministers to all the great courts of Europe , in order to obtain the recognition of our independence and form treaties of amity and commerce . Franklin , who had already outlived six treaties of " firm and lasting peace , " and now saw the seventh swiftly approaching its end , might well doubt the efficacy of those acts to which his young and impetuous colleague attached so much importance . But in Congress the majority was with Adams , and for a while there was what Gouverneur Morris called a rage for treaties . The Committee of Secret Correspondence , as I have already said , was formed in November , 1775 . One of its first measures was to appoint agents , - Arthur Lee for London , Dumas for the Hague , and , early in the following year , Silas Deane for France . Lee immediately opened relations with the French Court by means of the French Ambas sador in London ; and Deane , on his arrival in France in June , followed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livres was placed byVergennes in the hands of Beaumarchais , who assumed the name of Hortalez &amp; Co. , and arranged with Deane the measures for transmitting the amount to America in the shape of arms and supplies . And now the Declaration of Independence came to add the question of recognition to the question of aid . But recognition was a declaration of war , and to bring the French Government to this decisive pass required the highest diplomatic skill supported by dignity and weight of character . The Colonies had but one man possessed of these qualifications , and that man was Franklin . The history of diplomacy , with its long record of solemn entrances and brilliant processions , its dazzling pictures of thrones and courts , which make the head dizzy and the heart sick , has no scene half so grand as the entrance of this unattended , unushered old man into France , in December , 1776 . No one knew of his coming until he stood among them ; and then , as they looked upon his serene , yet grave and thoughtful ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory back to the fatal year of Ramillies and the waning glories of the great Louis , - on the right hand which had written words of persuasive wisdom for prince and peasant , which had drawn the lightning from its home in the heavens , and was now stretched forth with such an imperial grasp to strip a sceptre they all hated of its richest jewel ,  --  a feeling of reverential awe came over them , and they bowed them- , selves before him as in the secret depths of their hearts they had never bowed to emperor or king . " He is at Nantes , he is on the road , " was whispered from mouth to mouth in the saloons of the capital , as his landing became known . Some asserted confidently that he had already reached Paris , others that he might be hourly expected . Then came the certainty : he had slept at Versailles the night of the 2 1st , had come to Paris at two the next afternoon , and now was // at his lodgings in the Rue de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Franklin to find himself the object of such universal attention . But no one knew better than he how to turn it to account for the accomplishment of his purpose . In a few days he withdrew to the quiet little village of Passy , at easy distance both from the city and the court , - and , without endeavoring to increase the public curiosity by an air of mystery or seclusion , kept himself sufficiently in the background to prevent that curiosity from losing its stimulant by too great a familiarity with its object . Where men of science met for the discussion of a new theory or the trial of a new experiment , he was to be seen amongst them with an unpretending air of intelligent interest , and wise suggestions , never indiscreetly proffered , never indiscreetly withheld . Where humane men met to discuss some question of practical benevolence , or philosophers to debate some principle of social organization , he was always prepared to take his part with apt and far-reaching illustrations from the stores of his meditation and experience . Sometimes he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always with a genial smile , as if in his sympathy with the enjoyment of others he had forgotten his own perplexities and cares . In a short time he had drawn around him the best minds of the capital , and laid his skilful hand on the public pulse with an unerring , accuracy of touch , which told him when to speak and when to be silent , when to urge and when to leave events to their natural progress . Ever active , ever vigilant , no opportunity was suffered to escape him , and yet no one whose goodwill it was desirable to propitiate was disgusted by injudicious importunity . Even Vergennes , who knew that his coming was the signal of a new favor to be asked , found in his way of asking it such a cheerful recognition of its true character , so considerate an exposition of the necessities which hiade it urgent , that he never saw him come without pleasure . If he had been a vain man , he would have enjoyed his position too much to make good use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been a weak man , he would have fallen under the control of the opinion which it was his office to guide . If he had not possessed a pure and genuine sympathy with human nature , he would not have been able , at the age of seventy , to enter into the feelings of a people so different from those among whom he had always lived . And if he had not been stimulated by earnest convictions , and governed by high principles , he would not have been able to withstand the frequent and insidious attempts that were made to shake his fortitude and undermine his fidelity . But in him , as in Washington , there was a rare predominance of that sound common - sense which is man 's surest guide in his relations with events , an*I that firm belief in the progress of humanity which is his best reliance in his relations with men . Congress had given him two associates in his commission to France , - Silas Deane of Connecticut , and Arthur Lee of Virginia . Deane had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and industrious ; but his judgment was not sound , his knowledge of men not extensive , his acquaintance with great interests and his experience of great affairs insufficient for the important position in which he was placed . Lee had lived long in England , was an accomplished scholar , a good writer , familiar with the character of European statesmen and the politics of European courts , - but vain , jealous , irritable , suspicious , ambitious of the first honors , and disposed to look upon every one who attracted more attention than him- , self as his natural enemy . Deane , deeply impressed with the importance of Franklin 's social position for the fulfilment of their common duties , although energetic and active , cheerfully yielded the precedence to his more experienced colleague . Lee , conscious of his own accomplishments , regarded the deference paid to Franklin as an insult to himself , and promptly resumed in Paris the war of petty intrigue and secret // accusation which a few years before he had waged against him in England . In this vile course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointing , as Commissioner to Tuscany , Ralph Izard of South Carolina , who , without rendering a single service , without even going near the court to which he was accredited , continued for two years to draw his salary and abuse Dr. Franklin . When Franklin reached Paris , he found that Deane had already made himself a respectable position , and that , through Caron de Beaumarchais , the brilliant author of " Figaro , " the French Government had begun that system of pecuniary aid which it continued to render through the whole course of the war . Vergennes granted the Commissioners an early interview , listened respectfully to their statements , asked them for a memorial to lay before the King , assured them of the personal protection of the French Court , promised them every commercial facility not incoffipatible with treaty obligations with Great Britain , and advised them to seek an interview with the Spanish Ambassador . The memorial was promptly drawn up and presented . A copy of it was given to the Spanish Ambassador to lay before the Court of Madrid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the French Government had marked out for itself a line of policy , from which , as it was founded upon a just appreciation of its own interests , it would not swerve , - that it wished the Americans success , was prepared to give them secret aid in arms and money and by a partial opening of its ports , - but that it was compelled by the obligations of the Family Compact to time its own movements in a certain measure by those of Spain , and was not prepared to involve itself in a war with England by an open acknowledgment of the independence of the Colonies , until they had given fuller proof of the earnestness of their intentions and of their ability to bear their part in the contest . Nor was be long in perceiving that the French Government was giving the Colonies money which it sorely needed for paying its own debts and defraying its own expenses , - and thus , that , however welldisposed it might be , there were certain limits beyond which it was not in its power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his just and sagacious mind , that to accept the actual policy of France as the gauge of a more open avowal under more favorable circumstances , and to recognize the limits which her financial embarrassments set to her pecuniary grants , was the only course that heE could pursue without incurring the danger of defeating his own negotiations by excess of zeal . Meanwhile there was enough to do in strengthening the ground already gained , in counteracting the insidious efforts of English emissaries , in correcting erroneous impres - sions , in awakening just expectations , in keeping up that public interest which had so large a part in the formation of public opinion , and in so regulating the action of that opinion as to make it bear with a firm and consistent and not unwelcome pressure upon the action of Government . And in doing this he had to contend not only with the local difficulties of his position , but with the difficulty of uncertain communications : months often intervening between the sending of a despatch and the receiving of an answer , and affording newsmongers abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ample scope for malicious falsehoods . It was a happy circumstance for the new state , that her chief representative was a man who knew how to wait with dignity and when to act with energy ; for it was this just appreciation of circumstances that gave him such a strong hold upon the mind of Vergennes , and imparted such weight to all his applications for aid . No sooner had Congress begun to receive money from Europe than it began to draw bills upon its agents there , and often without any certainty that those agents would be in a condition to meet them . Bills were drawn on Mr. Jay when he was sent to // Spain , and his already difficult position made doubly difficult and humiliating . Bills were drawn on Mr. Adams in Holland , and he was unable to meet them . But such was the confidence of the French Court in the representa:tions of Dr. Franklin , that he was enabled not only to meet all the drafts which were made upon him directly , but to relieve his less fortunate colleagues from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had involved them . ) And thus passed the first twelve months of his residence in France , - cloudy and anxious months , more especially during the summer of 1777 , when it was known that Burgoyne was coming down by Lake Champlain , and Howe preparing for a great expedition to the northward . Then came the tidings that Howe had taken Philadelphia . " Say rather , " said Franklin , with that air of conviction which carries conviction with it , " that Philadelphia has taken Howe . " Men paused as they repeated his words , and suspended their judgment ; and when the news of the Battle of Germantown and the surrender of Burgoyne followed , they felt deeper reverence for the calm old man who had reasoned so wisely when all others desponded . It was on the 4th of December that these welcome tidings reached Paris ; and the Commissioners lost no time in communicating them to the Court . The second day after , the secretary of the King 's Council came to them with official congratulations . Negotiations were resumed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Court of Madrid being allowed to retard them ; and on the 6th of February , 1778 , the first treaty between the United States and a foreign power was signed with all the formalities which custom has attached to these acts . On the 20th of March the Commissioners were presented to the King . Nor was it mere curiosity which filled the halls of the royal palace with an eager throng on that eventful day . These were the halls which had wit-May , nessed the gathering of powerful men and of great men to the footstool of the haughtiest of French kings , - which had seen a Cond* and a Turenne lay down their laurels at the royal feet , a Bossuet and a Boileau check the flow of independent thought to bask them in the beams of the royal smile , a Finelon retiring with saddened brow to record for posterity the truths which he was not permitted to utter to the royal ear , a Racine shrinking from the cold glance of the royal eye and going home to die of a broken heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragoons to force his Protestant subjects to the mass and the confessional ; here he had received with a smile of triumph the tidings that the Pope himself had been compelled to yield to his arrogant pretensions ; and here he had listened in haughty state , when one of the last of the glorious republics of the Middle Ages , the city of Columbus and Andrew Doria , which had once covered the Mediterranean with her ships , and sent forth her hardy mariners , as from a nursery of brave men , to impart their skill and communicate their enterprising genius to the rest of Europe , humbled herself before him through her Doge , as , bowing his venerable head , the old man asked pardon in her name , not for the wrongs that she had committed , but for the wrongs that she had borne . And now , up those marble stairs , through those tapestried halls , came three men of humble birth , two of whom had wrought for their daily bread and eaten it in the sweat of their brows , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken its place among the nations , not by virtue of the divine right of kings , but in the name of the inalienable rights of the people . Happy would it have been for the young King who sat in Louis* s seat , if he could have understood the full meaning of his act , and recognized at the same moment the claims of his own people to participate in that government which derived its strength from their labor and its security from their love ! Diplomacy of the Revolution . // Nothing could have demonstrated more clearly the wisdom of Franklin 's confidence in the sincerity of the French Government than the generous and liberal terms of the treaty . No present advantage was taken of the dependent condition of their new ally ; no prospective advantage was reserved for future contingencies . Only one condition was stipulated , - and that as much in the interest of the Colonies as of France , - that they should never return to their allegiance . Only one reciprocal obligation was assumed , - that neither party should make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . All the rest was full and free reciprocation in the future , and the assurance of efficient aid in the present ; no ambiguities , no doubtful expressions , no debatable ground for interpretation to build upon and weave the mazes of he** subtile web , - but clear , distinct , and definite , a mutual specification of mutual duties and mutual rights . Equal could not have treated more firmly with equal than this new power , as yet unrecognized in the congress of nations , with the oldest monarchy of Europe . I have already alluded to the rage for treaties which prevailed for a while in Congress . It was this that sent William and Arthur Lee upon their bootless errands to Vienna and Berlin , Francis Dana to St. Petersburg , John Jay to encounter embarrassment and mortification at Madrid , and gave Ralph Izard an opportunity to draw an unearned salary , through two successive years , from the scanty funds of the Congressional banker at Paris . Jay 's situation was peculiarly trying . He had been Chief Justice of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most eloquent state papers that were issued in the name of that body whose state papers were ranked by Chatham among the best that ever were written , and , at a personal sacrifice , had exchanged a position of honor and dignity at home for a doubtful position abroad . A clearheaded , industrious , decided man , he had to contend for more than two years with the two qualities most alien to his nature ,  --  habitual dilatoriness and diplomatic reticence . Spain , like France , had marked out a path for herself , and it was impossible to move her from it . Jay obtained some money to help him pay some of the drafts of Congress , but neither treaty nor recognition . " They have taken four years , " wrote Franklin , " to consider whether they would treat with us . I would give them forty , and let us mind our own business . " And still viewing the question as he had viewed it in the beginning , he wrote in his diary in May , 1782 , - " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt our credit and importance by sending all over Europe , begging alliances and soliciting declarations of our indepe*dence . The nations , perhaps from thence , seemed to think that our independence is something they have to sell , and that we do not offer enough for it . " * The most important European event in its American bearings , after the recognition by France , was the armed neutrality of the Northern powers , - a court intrigue in Russia , though a sober act in Spain , - and which was fob lowed , in December , 178o , by the addition of Holland to the open enemies of England . Attempts had already been made to form a treaty with Holland , - first through William Lee , with such prospect of success as to induce Congress to send Henry Laurens to the Hague to continue the negotiations . Laurens was captured by an English cruiser , and soon after John Adams was directed to take his place . At Paris , Adams had failed singularly as a negotiator , - lending a ready ear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and enforcing his own opinions in a manner equally offensive to the personal feelings of the Minister and the traditional usages of the Court . But at the Hague he found a field better suited to his ardent temperament , * Franklin 's Works , VoL IX . p. 284 , Sparks 's edition . // and , backed by the brilliant success of the campaign of 1781 , and the votes of the House of Commons in favor of reconciliation , succeeded in obtaining a public recognition in the spring of 1782 , and concluding a treaty in the autumn . All these things were more or less upon the surface , - done and doing more or less openly . But under the surface the while , and known only to those directly concerned therein , were covert attempts on the part of England to open communications with Franklin by means of personal friends . There had been nothing but the recognition of our independence that England would not have given to prevent the alliance with France ; and now there was nothing that she was not ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it adds wonderfully to our conception of Franklin to think of him as going about with this knowledge , in addition to the knowledge of so much else , in his mind , - this care , in addition to so many other cares , ever weighing upon his heart Little did jealous , intriguing Lee know of these things ; petulant , waspish Izard still less . A mind less sagacious than Franklin 's might have grown suspicious under the influences that were employed- to awaken is distrust of Vergennes . And a character less firmly established would have lost its hold upon Vergennes amid the constant efforts that were made to shake his confidence in the gratitude and good faith of America . But Franklin , who believed that timely faith was a part of wisdom , went directly to the French Minister with the propositions of the English emissaries , and frankly telling him all about them , and taking counsel of him as to the manner of meeting them , not only stripped them of their power to harm him , but converted the very measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they deemed , so skilfully prepared for his ruin , into new sources of strength . Of the proffers of mediation in which first Spain and then Russia and the German Emperor were to take so important a part , as they bore no fruit , it is sufficient to observe , in passing , how little European statesmen understood the business in which they were so ready to intermeddle , and what a curious spectacle Catharine and Kaunitz present , seeking to usher into the congress of kings the first true representative of that great principle of popular sovereignty which was to make all their thrones totter and tremble under them . It may be added , that they furnished that self- dependence of John Adams which too often degenerated into arrogance an occasion to manifest itself in a nobler light ; for he refused to take part in the discussions in any other character than as the representative of an independent power . Meanwhile events were hastening the inevitable termination . In Europe , England stood alone , without either open or secret sympathy . In June , 1779 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1778 . In July , 1780 , the " armed neutrality* ' had defined the position of the Northern powers adversely to her maritime pretensions . War was declared with Holland in December of the same year . In America , the campaign of 1781 had stripped her of her Southern conquests , and effaced the impression of her early victories . At home her people were daily growing more and more restless under the pressure of taxation ; and even the country gentlemen , who had stood by the Ministry so long in the hope of transferring their own burden to the shoulders of their American brethren , began to give evident tokens of discontent . It was clear that England must consent to peace . And yet she still stood bravely up , presenting a bold front to each new enemy : a grand spectacle in one light , for there is always something grand in indomitable courage ; but a sad one in the true light , and one from which a hundred years hence the philosophic historian will turn with a shudder , when , summing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood was shed for , he shows that the only principle at stake on her part was that pernicious claim to control the industry of the world , which , // had she succeeded , would have dried up the sources of prosperity in America , as it is fast drying them up in Ireland and in India. * Nor was peace less necessary to her rival . The social revolution which the two last reigns had rendered inevitable was moving with gigantic strides towards its bloody consummation . The last well-founded hope of reforms that should probe deep enough to anticipate revolution had disappeared with Turgot . The statesmanship of Vergennes had no remedy for social disease . It was a statesmanship of alliances and treaties and wars , traditional and sometimes brilliant , but all on the surface , leaving the wounded heart untouched , the sore spirit unconsoled . The financial skill of Necker could not reach the evil . It was mere banking skill , and nothing more ,  --  very respectable in its time and place , filling a few mouths more with bread , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one who never erred , that " man does not live by bread alone . " The finances were in hopeless disorder . The resources of the country were almost exhausted . Public faith had been strained to the utmost . National forbearance had been put to humiliating tests under the last reign by the partition of Poland and the Peace of Kainardji ; and the sense of self-respect had not been fully restored by the American War . And although no one yet dreamed of what seven swift years were to bring forth , all minds were agitated by a mysterious consciousness of the approaching tempest . In 1782 the overtures of Encrland b began to assume a more definite form . Franklin saw that the time for decisive action was at hand , and prepared himself for it with his wonted calm and deliberate appreciation of circumstances . That France was sincere he could not doubt , after all the proofs she had given of her sincerity ; nor could he doubt that she would concur heartily in pre * * can not deny myself the pleasure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this fact in his " Principles of Political Science . 587 paring the way for a lasting peace . He had the instructions of Congress to guide him in what America would claim ; and his own mind was quickly made up as to what England must yield . Four points were indispensable : a full recognition of independence ; an immediate withdrawal of her troops ; a just settlement of boundaries , - those of Canada being confined , at least , to the limits of the Act of 1774 ; and the freedom of the fisheries . Without these there could be no treaty . But to make the work of peace sure , he suggested , as equally useful to both parties , four other concessions , the most important of which were the giving up of Canada , and securing equal privileges in English and Irish ports to the ships of both nations . The four necessary articles became the real basis of the treaty . John Adams , John Jay , and Henry Laurens were joined with him in the commission . Jay was first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in October ; Laurens not till November , when the preliminary articles were ready for.signature . They all accepted Franklin 's four articles as the starting-point . But , unfortunately , they did not all share Franklin 's well-founded confidence in the sincerity of the French Government . Jay 's mind was embittered by the tergiversations of Spain . Adams had not forgotten his former disagreements with Vergennes , and hated Franklin so bitterly that he could hardly be prevailed upon to treat him with the civility which his age and position demanded , much less with the consideration which the interest of his country required . Both Jay and Adams were under the influence of that hostility to France which prevailed as extensively in the Colonies as in the mother country , - an hostility which neither of them was at sufficient pains to conceal , although neither of them , perhaps , was fully conscious of it . It was this feeling that kept them both aloof from the French Minister , and made them so accessible to English . influences . And it was a knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Revolution . // George III . that well-known insinuation about Adams 's dislike to French manners , which would have been a scathing sarcasm , if it had not been an inexcusable impertinence . The English agents availed themselves skilfully of those sentiments , - sowing suspicions , fostering doubts , and not shrinking , there is strong reason to suppose , from gross exaggeration and deliberate falsehood . The discussion of articles , like all such discussions , was protracted by the efforts of each party . to make the best terms , and the concealing of real intentions in the hope of extorting greater concessions . But England was really prepared to yield all that America was really prepared to claim ; France , in spite of the suspicions of Adams and Jay , was really sincere ; and on the 30th of November , 782 , the preliminary articles were signed . Franklin 's position was difficult and delicate . He knew the importance of peace . He knew that the instructions of Congress required perfect openness towards the French Minister . He believed that the Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentions , to be treated with perfect openness . But both his colleagues were against him . What should he do ? Refer the difference to Congress , and meanwhile hold the country in painful and expensive suspense ? What could he do but submit , as he had done through life , to the circumstances which he could not control , and give the appearance of unanimity to an act which the good of his country required to be unanimous ? He signed the preliminaries , and submitted to the reproach of personal and public ingratitude as he had submitted to the taunts of Wedderburn . History has justified his confidence , - the most careful research having failed to bring to light any confirmation of the suspicions of his colleagues . And Vergennes , though nettled for the moment , understood Franklin 's position too well to lay the act at his door as an expression of a real opinion . Much time and long discussions were still required to convert the preliminaries into a final treaty ; for the complicated interests of England , France , and Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party longed for peace ; each party needed it ; and on the 3d of September , i 783 , another Treaty of Paris gave once more the short-lived , though precious boon to Europe and America . During Franklin 's residence at the Court of France , and mainly through his influence , that court had advanced to Congress three millions of livres a year as a loan , had increased it to four millions in Iy8i , had the same year added six millions as a free gift to the three millions with which she began , andbecome security for the regular payment of the interest upon a loan of ten millions to be raised in Holland. * Nor will it be inappropriate to add , that , before he sailed upon his mission to France , he called in all the money he could command in specie ( between three and four thousand pounds ) and put it into the public treasury as a loan , - and that while the young men , Adams and Jay , were provided with competent secretaries of legation , he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten times their work to do , was left to his own resources , and , but for the assistance of his grandson , would have been compelled to do it all with his own hand .
