ABOUT the year 1840 , a certain " Madame " was attracting considerable attention in New York by practising in a very liberal manner the art of medicine , without having proved by any preliminary examinations or preparations her fitness for so responsible an office . The extreme repugnance many women had to consulting physicians on delicate but vital questions to themselves , together with the almost universal willingness of society to be humbugged , brought her an extensive practice . It was this fact that drew Elizabeth Blackwell to seriously consider the question of women 's receiving a thorough medical education . A friend of hers was at the time suffering from a painful disease , of such a nature that she felt a competent physician of her own sex would be the greatest boon to be desired . She expressed herself strongly on the subject to Miss Blackwell , who was thereby the more impressed with the duty and propriety of educating women to be physicians . So it was no love of eccentricity or desire to make herself conspicuous that inclined her toward the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bristol , England , to this country when she was about ten years old . The reverses of her father , and his subsequent death , left the mother in straightened circumstances , with a family of nine children to support . During the years of mutual toil and help , Elizabeth and a younger sister . Emily , had abundant reason to speculate on the narrowness of woman 's field of labor in comparison with man 's . But elucidating a theory by actual practice is vastly different from simple theorizing . In her early girlhood , Elizabeth was , habitually , so silent and timid that her father called her his " little hermit . " At the first glance no one would have imagined that the little rosy-faced girl , with clear grey eyes , blonde silken hair , and with a voice strong , but of infinite sweetness , would develop into an unique , or even superior woman . A vigorous education , long walkg across the country , in sun or rain , snow or wind , gave her a physique proof against ordinary demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support herself under the almost insurmountable obstacles that bordered her subsequent career . In 1842 , when the younger children of her mother 's family had arrived at a state of self-help , Elizabeth resolved to pass from theory to practice . In order to supply her personal needs , she accepted the position of governess in the family of Dr. John Dixon , of Asheville , N. C. , where she remained one year , hating , meanwhile , access to his medical library . Dr. Dixon gave some direction to her reading , but no encouragement . At the end of the year , she removed to Charleston , S. C. , where she was engaged as a teacher of music , drawing , and modern languages . Practising the strictest economy , she contrived to save most of her earnings . She purchased some books on medicine and anatomy , and devoted her leisure to the study of those two sciences , and also undertook // the study of Latin , which she deemed indispensable in the career before her . Although she could only study during intervals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attract the attention of one of the most eminent physicians of the city , Dr. S. H. Dixon , a brother of the Dr. John Dixon in whose family she had previously resided . He took so lively an interest in her that he aided her with his counsels in the choice and order of the works she should read , admitted her among the number of his students , and procured for her all possible facilities for commencing regular medical studies . In May , ISz*4 , she left Charleston and came to Philadelphia . Here she passed six months in study under Drs . Allen and Warrington . Although she progressed sensibly , she felt that her studying would result far more profitably if she pursued the course of some special school . And , moreover , her aim being a diploma , it was necessary she should pass through some school to obtain it . In vain she asked admission of one and another of the medical schools of Philadelphia . The presidents of these schools , vexed and irritated at such a request , repelled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and the doors of the colleges and hospitals were most emphatically closed against audacious women who dared to aspire to a career so unquestionably consecrated to men . At this stage of affairs , one of the physicians under whose advice she had been studying , advised her to adopt male attire and gain eutr6e under the guise of a man . The idea was so repulsive as to be harbored for never a momentfor she was not laboring simply for her individual self . Had this been so , she might have been thoroughly disheartened . But she renewed and fortified her courage in the determination to open the career of medicine to women , who , in the future , would feel themselves capable of entering upon , and accepting it as a profession worthy their best efforts . She next obtained a list of medical colleges in different parts of the country , and applied by letter for admission , accompanying her requests by certificates from doctors under whose direction she had studied . She then wrote to her friends , " I send my arrows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her request was refused by twelve faculties . Some of these refusals were based upon " the dependent position assigned to woman , as much by nature as by society , and upon the unheard-of presumption which had inspired the author of this request with the desire and hope of taking rank in a profession reserved and consecrated to the nobler sex . " Others refused because " it would be unbecoming and immoral to see a woman instructed in the nature and laws of her organism . " For several months Elizabeth Blackwell pondered over the seeming impenetrableness of her future . Finally , the barriers yielded , and the way was opened to her by the Faculty of Geneva Medical College in Western New York . Her request having been received by the faculty , it was laid before the students of the college . A consultation was held by them , and they decided to let her be admitted . They also pledged themselves to so act the part of gentlemen , that she would never regret the step she had taken . They drew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the faculty , were forwarded to her . She immediately repaired to Geneva , and the month of November saw her name inscribed in the registry under the number 417 . From this time she pur // sued the necessary studies with an ardor proportioned to the difficulties she must vanquish in order to gain a place among the students . In spite of all her courage and strong will , she suffered much , both mentally and physically , during the first months of her studies . Sensitive and reserved , she had to sustain a hard warfare against herself in order to remain tranquil before the sufferings of the patients , as well as under the eyes of the professors and her fellow-students . She had so fully comprehended that she would be regarded not merely as a woman , but as a student associated with five hundred others , acquainting herself with the truths of science and the magnificence of the laws of nature , that it was not strange she made some almost superhuman efforts . Feeling conscious that her natural youthful freshness would only aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjected herself during the long days before entering school to a most rigid and severe diet . Had this been known , one might have attributed to this her paleness and immobility . We simply record it as an illustration of her determination and will , rather than as an act to be commended . From the time of her admission to the school to the time of her final examination , she entered and departed without appearing to see any one around her . Going directly to her seat , she would sit down , and seem wholly oblivious to everything about her , save the professor , and copy-book in which she wrote her notes . That she had good reason to act thus , the following incident will show : A little time after her admission , the subject of the lecture was of a somewhat delicate nature . In the midst of the demonstration by the professor , to which Elizabeth listened quietly and attentively , a folded paper , evidently a note , was thrown by one of the students behind her , and fell upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some gross raillery , and that all eyes were fixed upon her . Although it might not be possible for her to continue the course , she felt that justice should be done the intended insult , that it might not be renewed . She made no movement , not even raising her eyes from her note-book , but continued to write away as if nothing had happened . When the professor had finished his lecture , she closed her book , then slowly raising her arm on which rested the billet , so that all present might see her movement , she caused it to fall to the floor with an expression of dignified scorn and disdain . This manner of acting was altogether a protestation as well as an appeal . From all ranks of the students came enthusiastic plaudits for the conduct of the young woman , and of hisses for that of the base aggressor . During this scene , Elizabeth took no more notice of the kind demonstration than she had of the intended insult . It need hardly be added that from this time forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary , her classmates tendered her a sincere and respectful friendship , and all the services in their power . This did not , however , influence her to depart from her habitual reserve toward her fellow students , several of whom are to-day reckoned among her most valued friends . But her annoyances were not confined to the college . The epithet of " shedoctor " greeted her from all sides in the little village of Geneva . Notwithstanding the respectable position she held in the college , the proprietors of boardinghouses refused to admit her , on the ground that it would be a direct insult to their guests . When she passed along the streets , the shopkeepers would call to each other to look at her , and following the example thus shown , not only the g*vuzbzs and nurse-girls , but fine gentlemen and ladies , would gather in groups to // stare at her as she passed , as if she were some monstrous creature fallen among them from some planet . Even the newspaper world took up the refrain , and a Miss Jessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to Elizabeth Blackwell 's studying medicine . At length it became an old story , and they ceased to so attentively regard the petite woman who , invariably clothed in black , passed and repassed every day with an air so calm and possessed as if she were unconscious of aught around her . After a time she was invited to the homes of some of the professors , which kindness modified , to a great extent , the feeling of society , and the best boarding-houses were opened to her . The interim between lectures at the college she passed in Blockley Hospital , in Philadelphia . Desiring to be in no way indebted to her family , and to make the furthest possible use of her money , she was obliged to practise close economy . Consequently , her attire was always very plain , as the following extract from a letter written to her mother will show : I have been obliged to get for myself a black silk dress . It was impossible for me to do without this , an expense too great indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take place in public , and as it will be necessary for me to appear upon the rostrum with the President and professors , for the honor of my sex and my family , I should appear in as appropriate a costume as I can . On the day of commencement , the church in which the exercises were to take place was filled to suffocation . From all parts of the State , for miles around , people came to see the title of Doctor of Medicine conferred upon a woman . When Elizabeth appeared upon the stage , the assembly hushed itself to silence . After having received from the hands of the venerable Dr. Lee , President of the College , the diploma so longed for and so difficult to obtain , Miss Blackwell turned to address some words of thanks to the President . The silence became so profound that the words she uttered , in a voice hardly elevated , were neard in all parts of the church . " I thank you , Mr. President , " said she , " for the sanction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the chief . All the moments of my life shall be employed to do honor to the diploma you have conferred upon me ; and with the help of God I hope to accomplish it . " In his closing address , the President alluded to the lady student who had completed the course of study , and said it had been truly a good fortune to the school , and they had only to congratulate themselves for the innovation-that the zeal she had exhibited , and the intelligent application of Miss Blackwell , had exercised a salutary influence upon the students ; that since he had been at the head of the college , the conduct of the students had never been so remarkably good . Finally , that the progress in medical science had never before , in that school , reached so high a point as during that past year . He closed by assuring the young recipient of college honors that the most sincere wishes of her tutors would follow her in her new career , upon which she entered under such happy and flattering auspices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine a production that it was solicited for publication and published at the expense of the faculty . No words are needed to suggest what were her own feelings , when , after the close of the exercises , alone in her little room , she sat down with the dearlyearned parchment in her hand . The dullest fancy can picture something of that hour of her triumph . Her medical education had cost her two hundred pounds . She was the first // woman who had received , legally and officially , the degree of Doctor of Medicine . In 1849 , shortly after her graduation , she went to Europe with the aim of pursuing her studies . She spent six months in the Hospital of Maternity in Paris , * and was afterward admitted as a physician to walk the Hospital of St. Bartholomew , in London . About this time the medical director of the Berlin Hospital besought her , in the most flattering terms , to come and pursue her studies in his hospital , and every department should be open to her . She refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , where she thought the prospects better than elsewhere for a prompt development of the practice of medicine by women . She knew , also , that a number of women were already endeavoring to follow in her footsteps , and she felt how much they needed encouragement . She had also been invited , previous to this , to fill professional chairs in two medical schools for women , which were in a state of organization in America , but her studies prevented her accepting the positions . In 1851 she returned to America , bearing with her most honorable testimonials from such distinguished physicians as Dubois , Burrows , and Paget . After her return to America , Miss Blackwell established herself in New York . At first , physicians refused to receive her in consultation . Household proprietors either would not lease her apartments , or would ask her an exorbitant price , under the pretext that a woman doctor in their dwellings would be prejudicial to their interests . Some would send away the sick who came and asked for her ; others would neglect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her friends , she passed the few years of her life in New York in cruel isolation . Finally , her indomitable perseverance and self-control again triumphed over obstacles . Two of the most celebrated physicians of the city , having learned to appreciate her worth and the extent of her medical learning , declared they would meet her in consultation whenever an occasion offered or demanded . Thenceforth her situation was greatly modified . It seemed best for her to place herself in a permanent position ; and her practice increased largely . In the meantime several of her friends came to New York , assuring her the presence and sympathy she so much needed . In 1852 she delivered a series of lectures to women , upon hygiene and gymnastics , which were subsequently published in book form . In 1853 , by the aid of a subscription , a dispensary was founded for women and children . In 1854 a charter was obtained for the New York Infirmary and Dispensary , at No. 126 Second avenue , which dispenses medical charities to thousands of poor women and children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blackwell . In addition to an extensive practice among the best people in the city , she fills the chair of hygiene in the Medical College for Women of the New York Infirmary . Although past the freshness of youth , she retains her youthful vigor and energy . She is neither eccentric in her dress nor manners , although she would rarely fail to impress a beholder as being a remarkable woman . It is wholly * In many of the continental countriec of Europe , schools are provided in which women are trained for midwives at the expense of the government . According to a late census , in Austria alone there were nearly twenty thousand midwives , and in Great Britain nearly three thousand . Perhaps in no country Isas this office heen so monopolized hy men as in America . In France , the a ge-femmes are systematically educated and employed . In the Hospital of Maternity , in Paris , Mesdames Boivin and La Chapelle superintended shove twenty thou md hirsha each , and with nneqoalled success . These women were skilful and educated , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best works on ohatetrics. // the result of une mani ? re-quite indescribable . Her manner is fully dignified , but gracious , and her voice retains its old-time infinite sweetness . She is somewhat stout , like most English women , which is one of the compensations Nature sometimes is good enough to bestow when she withdraws the blandishments of youth . Her hands are models for a sculptor , and accompany her speech in an eloquent manner . Her hair , plentifully streaked with silver , is worn plainly from her face and gathered up simply at the back of her large but shapely head . When she smiles , one sees that her teeth are very white and regular , and are natural . She is reverenced by the whole medical sisterhood ; and if profound regard and esteem from all classes of society can add to the store of earthly happiness , this woman , who has talked little , but done so much for women , should be content . In passing from her to other early " innovators " in the medical realm , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the fact that the same " evil spirit " which had possessed Elizabeth Blackwell had taken lodgment in the hearts of others of her sex . In the year 1844 , Sarah R. Adamson , of Chester County , Pa. , a girl of Quaker parentage , was impressed with the responsibilities of womanhood at the early age of fifteen . The buoyant , merry , frolicsome spirit of her childhood had failed to be subdued by the strict regime of Quaker training . But now a quiet , thoughtful dignity possessed her , as day after day she was asking herself , " What can woman do to secure for herself a livelihood in a way in which hitherto she has never been accustomed ? " And how many women have asked themselves that question , and failing to find an answer , have submitted themselves to the inevitable sewing or teaching ? It was an easy matter for Sarah to see that the sons of a family were provided with congenial and profitable employment , while the girls were left quietly at home , to bide the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little world of their own . About this time , Grace Anna Lewis , of the Society of Friends , and a woman who always acted nobly in a quietly daring manner , opened a select school in the vicinity , and Sarah was enrolled among her pupils . Ever remembering that a long time of study must intervene before she should enter upon her future work , she applied herself most faithfully . For a time she copied legal papers for a relative , but such purely mechanical work was unsatisfactory . She turned her attention toward mechanics , and wondered why women could not adjust the delicate machinery of watches with equal skill and perfection as when done by men . But as each new plan and idea was considered , it found no response from her heart , which was asking for a just , true , and rightful position , which would develop the whole being . One day her teacher , ever awake to the interest and advancement of her pupils , inquired if she would not like to study physiology . This was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so she took the book home with her to decide . That evening , in the quiet of her room , she opened the book and began to read . The chapter on digestion absorbed her ; then that on the circulation of the blood . She react on and on , the book fascinating her like some splendid romance , until , in her enthusiasm , she exclaimed " Eureka , " and sought her pillow with the peacefulness that comes from a solved problem . The study of medicine was to be her work , the practice of it her ambition , and suffering humanity her household . // From this decision she never wavered ; but although thoroughly bent upon this career , she kept her own course , for , like a true Quaker as she was , she talkcd little , thought much , and acted more . After the close of Miss Lewis 's term of school , in which Sarah had completed the work on physiology , she was sent to the Friend 's Central School of Philadelphia to pursue her academic studies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch of medicine , procured from the public library " Wistar 's Anatomy , " in two volumes , to which she devoted herself after her other studies for the day were over . This large work , unilluminated and unexplained by a single plate or diagram , she attentively read and studied . On another occasion she discovered , in a worn and antiquated library of a friend , a work on midwifery , and another on diseases of women , which , at her request , were loaned her , and which she most thoroughly perused . During the three years thus passed away , she found time to read other medical works , while her enthusiasm steadily increased . At eighteen , the desire to study medicine was so great , that she could no longer conceal it from her parents . Upon returning home , she informed them of her desire , and begged their approval . The matter was taken into anxious consideration , and with less of prejudice , less of fear of public opinion than if her parents had been other than Quakers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This came from her father , and was , " Sara/c , thee must not fall . " Application was now made to her uncle , Dr. Hiram Corson , to receive his niece as a student of medicine . His reply was the following : Mv DEAR NIECE : I would have written sooner if my mind had been made up upon the subject of thy studying . It is , without any controversy , a new step . We must , there . fore , look to the motives and objects . It is not easy for me to arrive at the secret motives , and perhaps the real ones . The end , or object , is professedly to practise . But for what ? Money ? honor ? a name ? If so , will the end be attained , and in a way that would be desirable ? Or is it rather to introduce a new custom , one more consonant with common sense , and which will be to the mutual advantage of the sexes , and of course of general society ? This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy studying . //zat is perhaps the strongest inducement , for one who loves her kind , to engage in a new pursuit in which she will most certainly meet with obstacles of great magnitude , and contempt and scorn in abundance . For succeed as she may , in the practice of the profession , it will only be after many years have passed , and she has gathered a crowd of followers in her train , that she will rise above the character and name of midwife . It was so with Mesdames Boivin and La Chapelle , who surpassed all competitors in the practice of obstetrics , although they were not more exclusively confined to that branch than were ifiany males . But I expect to see thee soon , and will talk all about it . In the meantime , pursue thy stndies with zeal . I will bring thee a work on psychology . Very truly thine , HIRAM CoRsoN . This letter was written , not so much to quench the ardor of his niece , as to become satisfied of her stability of purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ridicule , contempt , and opposition which his experienced physician s eye saw she must meet and encounter . After a full discussion of the subject , finding that she was inflexible , he gave her every encouragement , and , as her preceptor , soon had the satisfaction of seeing that her zeal was untiring and her ardor unabated . Her work now began in earnest , and it was a custom with her mother to go // to her room daily to look after the fire , for so absorbed was Sarah in her studies , that she forgot it was winter , or that fire was needed . The season for study passed , and the long-looked-for day arrived when collegiate advantages were to be enjoyed . The first application was made in July , 1849 , to the Philadelphia College of Medicine . After some correspondence , the following refusal was received : DEAR DR . CoRsoN : The chief ground of objection appears to be the restraint it would impose on some of the lectures . Dr. McClintock says he could not lecture upon many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman . The same difficulty would present itself to many other professors . Moreover , a young institution like this can not afford to incur injury by declaring itself independent of public opinion . That women should be taught the science of medicine , and that they should practise , especially in obstetrics , I have long insisted . But the propriety of young men and young women attending lectures together , on all branches , is another question , etc . The second application was made the following mouth to the Pennsylvania Medical College , with a similar result . The Jefferson Medical College also received an application , which elicited a trifle more attention , but with no more favorable result . The Dean went on to say : I think it would be impossible in this country for a lady to mingle with five hundred young men , gentlemen though they be , in the same lecture-room , without experiencing many annoyances . A little of this was seen last winter . A lady who had graduated at Geneva College , accompanied Professor Lee , of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present at some of the lectures of the two large schools . Dr. Wood , I am told , shrank from taking her into his lecture , and although Dr. Chapman performed that act of gallantry , he accompanied the introduction with sundry witticisms , that must have tried the nerves of his fair guest ; and still a considerable sensation was produced . She attended one lecture also at our college ; but the veteran professor to whom she listened deemed it prudent that she should not appear before the class , but placed her in a small room adjoining , where she could hear the lecture without being observed . One and another of the medical schools were applied to , but in vain . That at Geneva alone remained , and an application was made to this . The college which had honored itself in conferring the degree of M. D. upon Elizabeth Blackwell now replied in the negative . " Miss Blackwell 's admission was an cx*erime ; zf , not intended as a i5recedenl , " wrote the Dean , Dr. James Hadley . Disappointment hovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible as to look forward . Finally it was determined that she should continue her studies in Philadelphia under a private tutor , where she could receive instruction in practical anatomy . In pursuance of this object , she was received into the family of Dr. Edwin Fussel , who afterward became Professor of Anatomy in the Woman 's Medical College of Philadelphia . Scarcely had her studies begun in this direction , when her uncle 's attention was directed to an advertisement of the Central Medical College of New York , at Syracuse , with the remarkable announcement that a class of ladies would be received . This was an institution of which her uncle knew nothing , but upon writing to the Dean , he received a most favorable reply and satisfactory references . But not until Miss Adamson arrived in Syracuse , accompanied by another uncle , Dr. William Corson , did she ascertain that the college was eclectic . Miss Adamson having studied under tutors of the regular school of medicine , had grave objections to matriculating in an irregular one . But the regular schools were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept this as the only one available . Eclecticism was then in its infancy , and the text-hooks used in the institution were the same standard works as those used in universities of the regular stripe . In 1851 Miss Adamson finished her course with honor , and received the degree of doctor of medicine  --  the second one conferred upon a woman . In April of the same year she returned to Philadelphia , with the hope of spending a year in Blockley Hospital . Through the magnanimity of Dr. Elder she obtained the requisite political references , which assured her admission to the hospital , as political as well as medical references were needed to operate successfully on the board of managers . Durinb her year in that hospital she received uniform courtesy and kindness from the board , as well as from Dr. Haines , chief resident physician . As she was the only representative of her sex , it could hardly be expected that her presence would be tolerated without bitter Opposition from some of the students . Be it recorded , however , that only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outrage done to their honor as physicians by admitting a woman to the hospital . Their protestations , however , operated greatly in Miss Adamson 's favor ; and when , at the close of the year , she sent a letter of thanks to the board , thanking them for their kindness and generosity , she received in return the same certificate from this body as that awarded to the male physicians . Soon after leaving Blockley Hospital , she was united in marriage to Dr. L. C. Dolley , to whom she had long been affianced ; and Rochester , N. Y. , was fixed upon as their future home , and where it continues to be . The reader is not for a moment to entertain the idea that in marriage the medical career of this brave woman culminated , or rather terminated . For sixteen years she has enjoyed a wide and extensive practice , full of interest and usefulness . We need only add that Mrs. Dolley has exemplified her fitness for wife and motherhood as fully as she did her fitness for a medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily , a younger sister of Elizabeth Blackwell , determined to follow in the footsteps of her sister . Endowed like her , with perfect health , and possessing rare intellectual faculties , she exhibited the same remarkable perseverance , and overcame in equally as admirable a manner , similar difficulties and obstacles . Her facility for acquiring languages was such that she learned , almost unaided , French , Spanish , and Latin . She then studied Greek and the higher mathematics , of which she acquired a sufficient knowledge in a short time . In 1848 , shestudied and dissected with Dr. John Davis , Demonstmz.ator of Anatomy in Cincinnati Medical College . In the summer of i8** and 52 she visited Bellevue Hospital in New York . At this time she hoped the college from which her sister graduated would grant her the same favor . But her application was refused upon the ground that in receiving Elizabeth , the " faculty of that college had not intended to establish a precedent for all women who might want to study medicine . " From nine other faculties she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the autumn of 1852 , the Rush Medical College , of Chicago , admitted her . After the completion of the first year 's course of lectures , she returned to New York to study chemistry during vacation . In the meantime , the Faculty of the Rush Medical School , censured by the medical society of the State for having admitted a woman into the institution , refused to receive her again . This was , of course , a great disappointment . After numberless // and most wearying efforts , she finally obtained from the Faculty of Cleveland Medical College , admission into that school , from which she graduated in 1354 . Her examination was marked by great brilliancy , and her diploma was conferred , accompanied with the most flattering encomiums . Returning in the same year to New York , she assisted Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell in organizing the New York Infirmary . She then went to England , and studied for a year with Dr. Simpson of Edinburgh , being the first woman-student ever admitted into his lying-in-hospital . Meantime , there had been a decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited Europe . Most of the hospitals were opened to all foreign physicians who were legally graduated . Dr. Emily went from Scotland to Paris , and spent six months in the Maternit* . She visited at the Hotel Dieu , Beaugon , Enfans Malades , and St. Louis Hospitals with Jobert , Huguier , and others of eminence . In London , she visited at St. Bartholomew 's , Children 's Hospital , and Fever Hospital , with with Fenner and Southwood Smith . For a time she thought of remaining in London in order to introduce the practice of medicine by women , but the ideas prevalent at that time threatened to insure her only a partial success , and she returned to New York at the close of i8*6 , bringing with her the most flattering testimonials from leading physicians of London , Paris , and Edinburgh . After her return , she associated herself with her sister in practice ; and in 1857 went to Albany , and succeeded in getting the Infirmary for Women and Children put on the list of State charities . Aside from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Obstetrics and Diseases of Women and Children " in the Woman 's Medical College of the New York Infirmary . In personal appearance , Emily Blackwell is eminently pleasing . Taller than her sister , she is symmetrically developed , and has a youthful and cheerful count tenance , which , combined with her frank and cordial manners , render her charming . Her hands are of exquisite symmetry , and her teeth like pearls . The sisters usually wear a costume of some neutral shade of silk , serviceable , but tastefully fashioned . They retain many of their English tastes and habits , and are so closely associated , that the inscription on their door-plate of " Drs . E. and E .. Blackwell " might puzzle a stranger to know which " E. " he is in search of . In 1856 , the corps of medical women was re-enforced by the Western Reserve ( Cleveland , 0 . ) Medical School conferring the degree of Ddbtor of Medicine upon Marie E. Zakezewska , * whose history has been made public through the medium of Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Berlin , Prussia , on the 6th of September , 1829 . She was the eldest of a family of five sisters and one brother . In childhood she displayed extraordinary imaginative powers , and a remarkable memory . She was cheerful and active , and with boys she was merry , frank , and self-possessed ; with girls , quiet , shy , and awkward , and never endured one long enough to have her for friend , until she was eleven years old . When seven or eight years old , she visited her maternal grandfather , who was at the head of a charitable institution in which were a hundred invalid soldiers , as many old women , and two hundred and fifty orphans . The sufferings of the Pronounced Zak-shef-ska. // poor creatures made a great impression on her , firing her young heart with philanthropic zeal and a desire to ameliorate their wretchedness . Also , about this time , a cousin became suddenly blind and was sent to an ophthalmic hospital , where Marie was her companion during her hours out of school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the defective system in the care of the sick , and wished some day that she might become head nurse and introduce a better r4gime . At the end of a year , reverses overtook her father , on account of his political views , and he was dismissed from his position as a military officer . That involved the family in great pecuniary trouble . In the emergency Marie 's mother petitioned the city government for admission into the school of midwives in Berlin , in order in this capacity to aid in the support of the family . She was admitted , and Marie was at the time ten years old . The education for the office of midwife in Berlin requires a two years ' course of study , six months of which time must be spent in the hospital . Her mother went to live in the hospital in 1840 , and Marie went to live with an aunt . In a few weeks her eyes became so affected with weakness that she could neither read nor write , and she obtained permission , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the physicians of the hospital , Dr. Muller , fancied the little girl so much that he made her his constant companion during his visits in the wards , calling her his " little blind doctor , " her eyes being covered with a bandage . Being deprived of her sight , what she heard impressed her all the more . One afternoon , when the bandage was for the first time removed from her eyes , Dr. Muller told her that the body of a young man was lying in the deadhouse , which had turned completely green from some poison he had eaten . Waiting until the room was cleared of visitors , she went in alone and looked at the corpse as long as she liked ; she then examined the contents of the adjoining rooms , where were lying bodies for dissection , and upon coming back t othe entrance door , found it locked , and knew that the prosector had gone away and locked up the whole establishment for the night . She knocked at the door for some time , hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sat down on the floor and went to sleep . Her mother thinking she was with Dr. Muller , gave herself no uneasiness , until after nine o'clock , the child failing to return , she instituted a search , and , after much inquiry and alarm , found her in the dead-house quietly asleep on the floor . A few days after this she recovered the use of her eyes , and it being her summer vacation out of school , she asked Dr. MOller to give her something to read , saying she wanted some " Books about History . " He gave her two large volumes- " The History of Midwifery " and " History of Surgery . " She read them through during the six weeks of her vacation . From this time she dates her study of medicine . She was eleven years old . She continued in school for two and a half years longer , when she was obliged to leave , and never entered it again . Upon her return home , in helping her mother and attending to to the household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . At the end of this time she went to visit a great-aunt and her daughter . The aunt had a cancer , and the daughter suffered from a peculiar nervous affection , which rendered her painfully sensitive to every sound , which , of course , kept her in a state of complete invalidism . The aunt , eight weeks later , consented to the operation of having her cancer removed . The operating surgeon found Marie so good a nurse that he entrusted her oftentimes with the dressing of the wound . For six weeks she was sole nurse for the two , going from one room to the other , // night and day , besides attending to household cares and being bothered by boys with their torn clothes and lost buttons . Shortly after the death of the aunt , which occurred six weeks subsequent to the surgical operation , her physician introduced Marie to Dr. Arthur Lutze , a homceopathist and something of an ismist . He , too , lived in Berlin , and inquiring Marie 's residence , promised to visit her there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring her health failed , and she returned home . She was ill for a long time with brain fever . After her recovery she set herself to work industriously to find out information respecting the human system . Dr. Lutze kept his word , gave her books and directed her studies . Her father was opposed to hoinceopathy and to Dr. Lutze ; and threatened to turn him out of the house , and burned up all Marie 's books , except one she snatched from the flames . Of course this proceeding only increased Marie 's determination to study medicine , and she read all the scientific books she could obtain . At length she determined to fit herself for the practice of obstetrics . With this idea her father was satisfied , but her mother displeased-practising the art herself only from necessity . Marie , however , persisted in her determination , and made a personal application to Dr. Schmidt , Professor of Midwifery in the university and schools for midwives , and director of the Royal Hospital Charit* . Dr. Schmidt approved of her course and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was refused on the grounds of her being too young-ez*AteeNand ze ; iuzarried . " The latter fault I made no effort to remove , " she used to say , " while the former I corrected daily . " Again at twenty she was for the third time refused on the same grounds . Dr. Schmidt . who saw in Marie the possibilities of a second La Chapelle , went to the King and gave him the reasons upon which the board had refused to admit her . The King granted the doctor 's wish , and Marie became legally his student . On the third day after her admission to his class he introduced her as his future assistant teacher ; which announcement naturally created much surprise . Her advance in learning , her clear , practical sense , and her remarkably peculiar aptness , all combined to render her a woman so popular that she was almost incessantly the creature of envious intrigues . Her examination was of the most severe character ; but she bore it in a most admirable manner , and received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ambition to make Marie chief accoucheuse in the hospital , as well as to surrender into her hands his position as professor in the school of midwives , as his health was sadly impaired . This met opposition of every kind and from every side . The idea of placing " a prepossessing young woman like Miss Zakezewska in that position would be disastrous ! From coming in contact with so many gentlemen , some one would fall in love with her , marry her , and thus end her career . " Her mother , having over come her repugnance , encouraged Marie ; but her father , wearied with the troubles the discussion involved , resolved to marry her to a man whom she had never seen . Matters came to a crisis by the increased ill-health of Dr. Schmidt . On the 15th of May , 1852 , Marie received her legal instalment to the position for which Dr. Schmidt had designed her . She was twenty-two years old , and stood at the height of her ambition . She was the German La Chapelle ! She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her enthusiasm . The doctor told her to come next morning to the hospital and enter upon her duties . She had the afternoon to prepare herself . The morning // came-she went to the hospital . Dr. Schmidt was dead ! She trembled , staggered , and fell upon a chair . From the pinnacle of joy and happiness she had fallen to the profoundest depths of despair . She , however , entered upon her new position . In a short time it was rendered so disagreeable by the spying , plotting , and intriguing of those around her , that she resolved to leave the hospital , and resigned her position on the 15th of the following November . Having heard of the efforts making in this country for the medical education of women , she resolved to come to America ; and on March 13 , 1853 , sailed for America in company with a younger sister . She had one hundred dollars , just enough to pay her passage . Her sister had the same amount above her passage money . She knew not a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beginning the practice of medicine . She showed her testimonials to one of the physicians of the city , who received her cordially , but told her that womendoctors in America were of the lowest rank . She made up her mind to hold her testimonials in reserve , and begin practice as a stranger . Patients were rare in their application . The sister 's stock of money was nearly exhausted . The middle of July came , and starvation was staring them in the face . They were too proud to send home for money . In this emergency , Marie visited the shops on Broadway and Canal street , came home , and turned her rooms into a tassel factory . They worked in worsteds and embroidery , sometimes earning no more than thirty-six cents a day  --  a day sixteen hours long , in which a dozen caps were finished at three cents each , until the 13th of May , in 1854 , when she heard of Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell . On the i ; th  --  the anniversary of her greatest joy and deepest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her new life in America . Very soon Dr. Blackwell obtained admission for her in the Cleveland Medical College , and on the most liberal terms , the faculty giving her credit for the lecture fees for a sufficient length of time . In the spring of 1856 , she graduated . After her graduation , the dean of the college , Dr. Delamater , called upon her , congratulated her , blessed her paternally , and handed her back the note of one hundred and twenty dollars which she had given for the lecture fees . The faculty had voted unanimously to return it to her as a gift . Returning to New York , Dr. Blackwell associated her with herself in l ) ractice . Marie aided efficiently in establishing the New York Infirmary for Women and Children , giving her services for two years gratuitously , as her contribution toward its support . In 1859 , she went to Boston , and took charge of a hospital in connection vith the New England Female Medical Collere and remained there until i86i , when she opened an independent hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the New York Infirmary . Her practice has become one of the best in Boston , and she spreads enthusiasm and a love for her profession wherever she goes . In personal appearance , Marie is tall , with a slender , dark face , black eyes , and , as Mrs. DalI beautifully expressed it , has " a broad , clear brow , upon which faithful unto death'is bound like a phylactery . " In talking , privately or publicly , her listeners have no fears that she will fail to be equal to any emergency , and no sublimer proof of triumph over obstacles , of victory out of the gloom of apparent defeat , aye , of what a woman , in herself has done , can be found than in the Berlin woman whom we call Dr. Marie E. Zakezewska. // After the graduation of Elizabeth Blackwell , a number of philanthropic individuals in Philadelphia met together to discuss the opening of a medical school for women . The idea was a novel one , but sensible to the farthest degree . The organization was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State Legislature on March II , 1850 . Its first session opened October 12th of the same year , with a faculty of six professors , regular practitioners , graduates of regular schools , and men , of necessity . Subsequently , a woman 's hospital was founded in connection with the college . It went into operation in i86i . More than two thousand patients are treated annually in the several departments of the hospital . The resident physician , Dr. Emeline Horton Cleveland , after graduating in the college , added to her experiences a year 's residence in the Maternitd at Paris . Mrs. Cleveland also fills the chair of " Obstetrics and Diseases of Women and Children " in the college , and is eminently superior as a practitioner . As a lecturer , she is lucid , eloquent , and earnest . In her social and in her domestic relations as wife and mother , she is every way admirable . Her manner is so gentle , and so purely womanly , that the coarsest and most hardened creatures are refined in her presence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her dark eyes of the " almond shape " one so often reads of and so rarely sees . She is also most happily free from any professional mannerism , and a stranger from conversing with her would hardly dream of her being a " scientific " woman , although ready to admit her very clever and cultivated , and endow her charms with that very excellent thing in woman  --  a low , sweet voice . The chair of physiology and hygiene is filled by Dr. Ann Preston , one of the first graduates from the college . Naturally of a frail and delicate constitution , her object in studying medicine was to fit herself as a teacher of physiology and hygiene-subjects in which she was greatly interested . For some years after graduation she made no effort to enter upon practice , but gradually practice gathered around her , and her labors as a sanitary teacher became subsidiary to the practice of medicine . She is of Quaker parentage , and the influence and training from such a birthright , added to the liberal advantages of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intellectual activities that have since distinguished her . Eighty-one women have graduated from the Women 's Medical College of Pennsylvania , while about three times that number have matriculated and attended its lectures . Among the number of graduates not a few have attained to eminent positions , and are filling offices of great usefulness . Mary J. Scarlett fills the chair of anatomy and histology with marked ability . Nancy M. Sewell is demonstrator of anatomy . Among those eminent in the sisterhood are Drs . Hannah and Jane Longshore , and Dr. Sartain , each of whom is the happy recipient of a very liberal professional income in Philadelphia . Elsewhere are Mrs. Gleason , of Elmira ; Mrs. Hunt , Oneida ; Amelia Tompkins , Hamilton ; Mrs. Cook , Buffalo ; Miss Nivison , Ithaca ; Almira L. Fowler , of New York ; Jane Payne , of Mt . Vernon , Ohio ; Laura E. Ross , Milwaukee ; Sarah Entricken , Westchester , Pa. ; C. A. Buckell , Boston ; Anita E. Tyng , Providence , R. I. , and Lucy M. Abbott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable for her energy , her straightforwardness and quickness of perception . Miss Mary C. Putnam , who graduated in 1864 , is now in Paris pursuing her studies . She was the first woman admitted to visit the School of Medicine in that city , and has recently , after a brilliant examination , been admitted // as a student . She is the " P. C. M. " correspondent of the New York " Medical Record , " who sends that journal such racy and graphic accounts of the medical world in Paris . In 1856 , the New England Medical College was chartered by the Massachusetts Legislature , to be located in Boston . So far back as 1844 the subject of employing female attendants for women had engaged the attention of George Gregory , and in 1848 , his brother , Samuel Gregory , opened a medical school for women . The college has steadily progressed . Over fifty thousand dollars have been bequeathed to it from different sources . Some remarkably proficient students have received the degree of M. D. , among whom may be mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physiology and hygiene for the past nine years in the college . Also Anna Monroe , demonstrator of anatomy ; Dr. Haynes ; Dr. Morton , who spent four years in Paris , two in study and two in practice ; Dr. Sewall , now in London ; Dr. Avery , professor of physiology and hygiene in Vassar College ; Dr. Webster , of New Bedford , and Mary H. Thompson , who graduated in 1863 and went to Chicago in the same year , organized a woman 's hospital , and displayed a deal of energy , tact and good sense . The New York Medical College for Women was chartered in 1863 , since which time one hundred women have matriculated in it , and twenty-nine completed its course of study . Anna Inman , M. D. , fills the chair of obstetrics Mrs. C. S. Lozier that of diseases of women and children , and is also dean of the college . The Woman 's Medical College of the New York Infirmary was chartered in i86* , and its first college session opened November , i868 . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its head , is sufficient prestige of its success . Among other aids , it may be mentioned that the large Eclectic Medical College of Ohio was one of the first to welcome women as students . In Cleveland , the regular and hommopathic have received them , as also the Chicago Medical School . In 1850 , the Rochester Eclectic School opened its doors to women , and when merged in the Syracuse school , continued so to do . In 1853 , the Penn Medical University was started in Philadelphia , with separate departments of instruction for men and women . It was discontinued in 1864 . The New England Hospital for Women and Children , which was organized in i86i , furnishes essential help to medical students . Dr. Marie E. Zakezewska is attending physician , and Dr. Horatio R. Storer attending surgeon . Over five thousand patients are annually treated , without regard to nationality or color , furnishing an almost infinite variety of diseases . The New York Infirmary , under charge of the Drs . Blackwell , has , since i8*6 , given relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand were recipients of its charity during the past year . More than thirty students have enjoyed'its advantages , and twenty nurses have been trained and established in the city . There are now over three hundred graduated women physicians in the United States , some of whom have professional incomes of ten thousand dollars per annum , which certainly must be quite as pleasant to a woman as to eke out a pittance over a wash-tub or cambric needle . So far as the observation of the writer has extended  --  and it has been quite comprehensive  --  the majority of women in the medical profession are gentle , mode * and womanly . That there // are some bold , bad women among the number is undoubtedly true , and what is equally obnoxious , some who try to be as much like men as possible . These are invariably the normal characteristics of such individuals , and not the result of the profession . Badness and coarseness ingrained in the very bone and marrow of an individual can be eradicated by no amount of educational culture . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found only on the woman side of the professional fence , we might lift up our voices in a great shout of thanksgiving . In giving a hurried glance at the Old World , we find that the dispensary of Miss Garrett in London is in full activity , and that Miss Garrett herself is fully realizing the brilliant career that her extraordinary examination a few years ago so richly promised . In 1864 , a ladies ' medical college was opened in London under the auspices of a female medical society . In Paris , a Frenchwoman having passed the Baccalaureate , recently requested permission to study medicine as a w/*ole , in France . This the faculty at Montpelier refused . She then sent her request to the Ministre de lInt6rieure at Paris . He acceded , but on the condition that she should practice only in Algeria , from whence she came . It was believed that her medical knowledge might be of great benefit to the Arab population , as she might be able to penetrate the harem , to which male doctors are not admitted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian service visited the New York Infirmary for Women and Children to obtain information in reference to the medical education of women . He had been requested to institute the inquiry by the Czar , in consequence of the application of a dozen or more respectable Russian women for admission into the Medical College of St. Petersburg . Two Russian women have recently been admitted into Medical University in ZUrich , Switzerland , which is one of the best universities in Europe . The necessity of medical education for missionary women is commanding considerable attention , in England , as well as in America . Dr. David H. Nutting , for many years a medical missionary of the American Board in Asiatic Turkey , has been urging the necessity of such missionaries , with the eloquence of personal experience . In London , a female medical mission to Delhi has been sent out , under the guidance of a benevolent association . Every candidate for the position must be a lady by birth and education . In Paris , an educated and influential lady , Madame de Gael , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sex , and in her appeals she pays an eloquent tribute to the pioneers in this country .
