txt I have been about ten days in Washington . My business was not urgent , but my curiosity was intense ; and for the first week it had ample food in watching the coolness with which a great Government participated in'squabbles about spoils , while the thunders of armed rebellion were rousing the echoes of the Capital . But the best three days were spent in the midst of panic . The City of Baltimore had interposed between the Government and its military succors a mob power , backed by an overwhelming public sentiment , and had shed in its streets the first blood of the new Revolution ; and the great question at Washington was whether an Administration , strong in resources and popular support , but having permitted its officers to be hemmed in by foes , could indeed draw to itself in time the needful succors to prevent the capture of the Capital and the possible extin3tion of the Government , by one bold stroke on the part of the conspirators . I had been for day or two studying the possibilities of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some business that could not be longer delayed ; and on the morning of Tuesday , the 23d day of &mil,; Mil , I jolted the great caravan of flight , and took the train for the North . Through Baltimore it was known to be impossible to pass without great trouble and delay ; and a review of the whole ground had determined my mind in favor of the route by Frederic , Hagerstown and Ilarrisburgh , as the quickest , cheapest and safest . I was with friends , too , whose destination was Chembereburgh and thus a social argument was added to the others . We left Washington at 7 o'clock , and arrived about tin ' , at the ' Relay Rouse , six miles from Baltimore , to learn that the mornix g Western train had been discontinued , and that we should be detained there till 4 or 5 o'clock P. M. But the day was fine and the company good ; and the secession feeling in the neighborhood just enough evident to give piquancy to the tone of conversation . The train for Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have seen since the Baltimore emeute ; and I derived decided comfort from the evidence they furnished of a North , not only united , but resolute and powerful in defence of the Government and the punishment of its foes . I was amused also by an amicable argument with mine hostess of the Relay House , whose cuisine is incomparably better than her 1ogi3 ; and I must question gravely , too , the integrity of her facts , since she asserted and insisted , with a resolution and persistency that no proofs could affect , that the Mayor of Baltimore was not present in the city during the riot . I mention this as a fair illustration , showing the astounding capacity of . Southern people for misconception and error . The train for Frederic was large , and - the passengers mainly fugitives from the land o ! Dixie . The conversation , during our two hours ' ride , was kept studiously down to the level of the political zero ; except in the case of a youngster or two who were setting up us apostles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emblems ; one gentleman , whose political feint was strikingly symbelized by a card in his bat , on which were pictured t no of JEFFEREON DAvis 's new flags . On the whole , however , the ride was marked by great quiet , as well at the stations as on the train . We arrived at Frederic about sunset  --  an old and suhs'antial city of several thousand people , and deri%ing a great share of its business from the iron interest . We found a crowd at the station ; all quiet , however , and well behaved , and drawn together apparently by the novelty of the sudden growth of travel on their somewhat obscure route . I do not recollect to have heard in Frederic a single political remark , except from one person ; but hotel keepers , stage owners and livery men were thoroughly interested in the exigencies of the occasion . Carriages were leaving constantly for Hagerstown . During my stay in the place , which was till about 8 o'clock , two military companies marched through the streets , both : dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were evidently independent companies , of no recent origin , and drilling for service  --  on which side it was impossible to determine . On entering the ladies ' parlor , while its inmates were mainly at tea , I was somewhat surprised to receive from an elderly lady seated there , a pantomimic invitation to approach her , which , with some trepidation , I obeyed . She requested me to be seated , and this done , inquired , with the greatest apparent anxiety , if I was not from Washington , and whether or no the city was likely to be destroyed , and the Government broken up , ? at the thought of which catastrophies she seemed greatly affected . Having given my opinion , and learned that she lived in the vicinity of Frederic , I made inquiries as to the state of feeling there among the people . She professed to be , herself , very strongly for the Union , as indeed the people of that section had generally al ways been ; but she said that defections were becoming so common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Frederic County might secede . I thought her patriotism a little suspicious , and so directed the conversation as to touch the key note of secession ? namely , coercion ; whereat she seemed to manifest much feeling in favor of the notion that an attempt to execute the laws would be an attack on the rights of the South . I inquired about the companies I had seen marching in the streets ; she shook her bead and feared that they were for secession . " But , " said I , " they march under tha Union flag . " " Oa l " she replied with evident warmth , " that is because the captains are for Union ; but the men are all right . " I set the old lady down for a spy , and scent to look after my baggage ; and my suspicions were certainly confirmed on learning afterwards that she had drawn several strangers into conversation , and that her profession of faith varied in accordance with those of the persons whom she addressed . I left Frederic about 8 o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by four horses ; the load consisted of twelve persons , all ladies but four . The accompaniment of baggage was frightful . It was leaded on the top of the vehicle , and gave to it a waving motion that kept up a constant fear of upsetting . The road  --  twenty six miles  --  was mountainous , but well graded , and our progress was so slow that we did not reach Hagerstown till past 4 o'clock . The night was brilliant with moonlight and as balmy as June ; and the discomfort of the ride could not repress our admiration of the beautiful scenery through which we passed , aid just enough of which was revealed to make us long for intervals of sun-light to illuminate the whole . Hagerstown has a large and very well-appointed hotel ; but we found it filled to overflowing . As the train was not to start till seven o'clock , I was thinking of sleep . As I had a lady in charge , I placed her in the car e of the lanclady , who ? gave her a pillow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was forced to be content with a snooze on the settee . From 53e o'cleek till 7 , the activity of the guests was wonderful  --  breakfast and baggage seemed equally to divide their attention . The cars were insufficient to contain them , and freight- cars , with board seats , were added to the train . The whole city was astir to see us off , and a good deal of interest was manifest in the crowd . I did not catch the popular tone very distinctly , though I think it was Southern . The clerk of the hotel thought that matters had gone too far for a peaceful solution , and that nothing would end the trouble , till the North should march an army South , and get a good whipping . Nine mules brought us to the State lines between Maryland and Pennsylvania . The Change in tone , as well as in the appearance of the  --  people , was striking . The stars and stripes were everywhere ' flying , and crowds of people inquiring about the progress of the treason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pith : of the " matter ' at Once , aud call things Squarely by their ' right names . The tone of our travelers changed equally ; contact with free institutions seemed to relieve all from a great load of ? aoxiety . Women were ready to hurrah for freel-soil ; and children seemed to recognize some protecting power of which they bad before been deprived . ? " We arrived at Harrisburgh in time for dinner ; and at Philadelphia . a little too late for the evening train . Everywhere in the free States the Union feeling was not only dominant , but apparently unanimous ; but in no place have I seen the patriotism of the people assume so enthusiastic , so devoted , so heroic a character , as in the great city of the continent  --  Nelw-York . Had I left Washington in the afternoon train , the Vine consumed would have been about thirty-six hours , nearly six of which were lost in Philadelphta . The ft re through is about fourteen dollars , and the incidental expenses not heavy . I should apprehend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the people of Maryland not disposed , in that section , to molest quiet travelers . One word as to Washington . The feeling among Northern people there is , that the Administrant " ' is , in general , a little behind the events which it should Influence by its energy . We were amazed at its inertia . There is no queslion that millions of dollars are being lost , in arms , ammunition and other property , by a negligence that no geod government should manifest . That the property re cently destroyed at Norfolk could have been saved , is certain ; but : he Government , rather than offend Yin gthie , per sisted in neglecting the precautions that common sense would dictate . A number of the officers left in charge there were Southerners , who resigned at the critical moment . By the blow at Norfolk , we lose several ships ; the rebels gain from us a large store of powder , and several bunitr , cannon ! They get , too , the dock , mainly uninjured . Nor are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is an epidemic , tainting the air like the plague , and communicated by contact . The people of Weshington are strongly Southern in sympathy , and they have for years been ruled and fed by embryo traitors . They are for Washington , and whichever Government proves strongest . They do n't want the city destroyed , and will fight for its defence ; but when the struggle comes for its possession they will divide , and 1 shall he surprised if the traitors do not get the larger moiety.
