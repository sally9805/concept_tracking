ART . V. - The Old R*gime and the Revolution . By ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE , of the Acad6mie Fran*aise , Author of " Democracy in America . " Translated by JOHN BONNER . New York : Harper and Brothers . 1856 . AMONG the many great names which the year 1859 added to the scroll of the departed , is the author whose name stands at the head of this article , - one whose works deserve to be better known than they yet are to Americans . Having travelled in America and studied our institutions , having d*scussed the reigns of the two successors of Louis XIV. , and having participated in the legislation of his country , M. de Tocqueville devoted the closing years of his life to what he designed to make a thorough and comprehensive treatise on the unprecedented Revolution of 1789 . His design was splendid . By means of contemporary documents and records , he would " visit and examine in its grave the civilization which had passed away , " a work which no man had ever performed ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of terror which it produced had been removed , while its appearance was not forgotten , he would study the living form which had arisen from the sepulchre , and assign to it its place and character among the phenomena of history . This design , in accordance with a sad foreboding of his own , he was not permitted to finish . He reached , but did not cross , " the tl*reshold of that memorable Revolution . " His work is thus , in strictness , only a treatise upon " the Old R6gime . " Incomplete as it is , however , it is of the highest value , both on account of the sources from which it is drawn and the style and spirit in which it is composed . The contemporary documents which the author employs are such as others have lacked either the opportunity or the desire to consult . They consist chiefly of state papers , or more properly papers preserved in the archives of the state , which are of such a character as to reveal the most secret and most intricate movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These materials he has combined in such a way as to give in the small volume before us a complete // and comprehensive view of the whole system , from the moving power in the will of the monarch down to the suffering of the humblest peasant , whose blood and toil were the price of that magnificent supremacy . On this latter point he is peculiarly full and satisfactory , giving an ample statement of that condition of things , so graphically depicted in the " Tale of Two Cities , " " which rendered the leanness of a Frenchman a proverb in England for a century after the cause had passed away. ** We have referred to the style and spirit of the work . The spirit is that of calm , impartial , philosophical inquiry , pervaded by profound religious sentiment , and evincing a clear perception of the distinction between right and wrong . Though many of the author 's sentiments were opposed to those of the majority of his countrymen at the time , they are expressed without any appearance of bitterness . His suppressed feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general his opposition is determined rather than defiant . His style is clear , forcible , and vivacious ; his reasoning cogent ; his arrangem ' *nt unsurpassed . The great merit of his system , besides the primary one of lucidity , is its compendiousness . A great extent of territory is passed over with amazing rapidity , yet without leaving any portion unexplored . This is accomplished chiefly by leaving out of view all preliminary processes , and presenting only a summary of results . Where this s not done , as it can not always be , he has abbreviated his work in another way , by leaving out of view all futile investigations . Led by no vain ambition of displaying his own industry , he wearies his readers with no negative results , presenting only what in the last analysis proved sound and conclusive . Thus his work is like specie in sealed packages . We have only to count the parcels , without being obliged to number and test their contents . The work is divided into two parts or books , of which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipation some of the topics more fully discussed in the body of the work . Having thus presented a general notice of the work , we propose to devote the remainder of this article to a more particu // lar examination of its contents , including a comparison of the author 's opinions with those of Burke , as expressed in his papers upon the same subject , chiefly in his " Reflections on the French Revolution . " On comparing the treatises composed at so widely different periods , the other a French philosopher writing sixty years later , - the attention is at once arrested by their remarkable agreement with reference to facts , and these , too , the central , fundamental facts , of which the special events of the Revolution are only the accidental accompaniments . Its reforms , at the same time radical and instantaneous ; the perversion of abstract truth that was its basis ; the unexampled combination of intolerance and infidelity which distinguish it ; the universality of its doctrines , rendering it , fearful as it was , unique , - are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . Concerning the society which was destroyed , their agreement is scarcely less complete . The generally high character of the aristocracy , including the clergy , the power and isolation of the middle class , such as was never seen before or elsewhere , the political preponderance of men of letters , the prevalent prosperity of the kingdom , the benignity of the government , are testified by both . A careful comparison gives only one important discrepancy in their presentation of facts . This is with reference to the condition of the lower classes . In treating of the inequality of taxation , Burke undertakes to show that the contributions of the privileged classes formed a considerable proportion of the whole amount . He dwells upon the fact , that they paid a capitation or land tax , or its equivalent , and necessarily paid also their portion of the customs or indirect taxes . That this did not prevent a great and oppressive inequality of burdens , is evident from the facts brought forward by De Tocqueville . He shows , with respect to the direct state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that " the increase of the taille , tenfold in two centuries , fell wholly upon the poor that corv6es , or compulsory personal services , particularly in repairing roads , were pitilessly exacted , until " their amount // began to frighten the receivers of the taille " ; and that , under this double infliction , " the French peasant of the eighteenth century was led to imitate the Jew of the Middle Ages , and to feign poverty , if he happened to be in easy circumstances . " On a question of this nature , De Tocqueville 's statements must be preferred , as resting on superior evidence . This must , therefore , be deemed a correction of Burke , and a very important one , as the degree of oppression which the people endured is of the first consequence in determining the rightfulness of the Revolution . This has been said to be the only important discrepancy . A cursory reading of IDe Tocqueville , however , would give a widely different impression . He is constantly charging Burke with some misrepresentation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters upon in his first chapter , and persistently maintains throughout the volume . In the passage alluded to , he says : - " Burke 's mind was illumined by the hatred he bore the Revolution from the first . Still he doubted for a time . His first inference was , that France would be weakened , if not annihilated . France is at this time , ' he said , to be regarded as expunged out of the system of Europe . Whether she can ever appear in it again as a leading power is not easy to determine ; but at present I consider France as not politically existing , and unquestionably it would take up much time to restore her to her former active existence . Callos quoque in beiis floruisse audivimus , may be the remark of the present generation , as it was of an ancient one . " ' To this criticism we are inclined to reply , that France , as Burke anticipated , was weakened , and barely escaped annihilation . Under the first frenzy of newly acquired freedom and citizenship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was past , under the fear of the insatiable guillotine , her generals still gained unexpected victories , preferring a soldier 's death on the field of battle to the fate of felons and traitors in Paris . But such spasmodic exertion , though terrible to other nations , was ruinous to France , as her condition when Napoleon appeared sufficiently proves . Unpitied decimation of her armies in the field , and promiscuous slaughter of her citizens *t home , were combining to lay her // 1861 . THE FRENCH REVOLUTION . helpless at the feet of her enemies . But for the astounding victories of that commander , it may well be questioned how long France could have avoided the fate of Poland . The tendency of the Revolution was , as Burke " inferred , " to destroy France ; the advent of a military despot , in the providence of God , saved her from its natural effect . In the fifth chapter , again , our author quotes Burke 's appeal to the French : " Had you but made it to be understood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had gone further than your wise ancestors ; that you were resolved to assume your ancient privileges , while you preserved the spirit of your ancient and your recent loyalty and honor ; or if you had but looked to your neighbors in this land who had kept alive the ancient principles and models of the old common law of Europe " Here De Tocqueville makes the following strange comment : " Burke can not see that the real object of the Revolution is to abolish that very common law of Europe ; he does not perceive that that , and nothing else , is the gist of the movement . " To this it is to be answered , that Burke was defending the common law of Europe , and not giving a history of it . He was endeavoring to show what the French should have done , not to discover what they meant to do . That they were bent on destroying that " old common law of Europe he knew only too well , and a great part of his argument in his " Reflections " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such statements of discrepancies , in almost every instance untenable , are to be found scattered through the whole volume , and constitute one of its most singular features . In almost every case it might be shown that upon the very point in dispute there is more agreement in opinion than difference in expression . From a careful examination of them all , we are forced to conclude that De Tocqueville misconceived Burke , and applied to his political arguments principles of criticism which properly relate only to history or philosophy , where neglect of one side of a question is evidence of ignorance or insincerity . Of course such principles do not apply to political articles , where commonly the only reason for writing at all is the presumption that the opposite side is well supported , and where the writer , therefore , appears not as an investigator , but as an advocate . // We perceive , also , that our author frequently makes the mistake of confounding the result of the movement with the tendency of its action and the aims of the actors , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce the effect which it actually accomplishes . This is especially prominent in the fifth chapter of the first book , where the words " tendency , " " design , " and " effect " seem to be used interchangeably . Whether we have given the true explanation or not , it is certain that the points on which De Tocqueville insists are not important discrepancies , and , further , that scarce any such are to be found between him and Burke from first to last . This will better appear upon a closer examination . We notice , first of all , a broad distinction between the works of the two authors with reference to their design , De Tocqueville being occupied almost entirely with the origin , and Burke with the character , of the Revolution . The difference is natural . Burke was dealing with a living system , speedily embodying itself in the institutions of a great country , and endeavoring to find footing in every other . It was of little consequence to him or to any one else at that period to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest the means for its advancement or destruction . The situation of De Tocqueville was wholly different . It did not require the interval of sixty years between the Revolutionary period and his own for that violent system to accomplish its destruction . It had become already an historical phenomenon . Men 's ears still tingled , it is true , at the story of its deeds , but it had itself long ceased to be an object of hope or fear to any . At such a period , an author would naturally be more inclined to discuss the causes of the outbreak , though , had De Tocqueville completed his design , his work would undoubtedly have been more nearly parallel to the writings of Burke . As it is , there is a noticeable difference between them . Burke is constantly laboring to prove that the course of the Revolutionists was wrong ; De Tocqueville , to show that it would naturally be such as it was . The two methods are by no means repugnant . For as certain as it is that human actions have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predisposing causes , and a statement of // the temptation by no means precludes a deiiunciation of the crime . The purpose of Burke has been variously represented . On . the publication of his " Reflections , " many with the gravest assurance charged him with madness ; less charitable opponents accused him of " despotic predilections , " and of " belying the tenor of his whole life " ; and it is still customary to speak of his " anti-Gallican mania , " and to treat his great work as a splendid curiosity , but something not to be resorted to for attack or defence . It is certainly unfortunate , so far as any immediate effect is sought , that this treatise was made so magnificent . If ever an author wreathed his sword in flowers so as to destroy its power , it was done in this instance . Blows which should be mortal are only irritating , and numbers handle and admire . the casing without once suspecting that it conceals a weapon . The argument is literally buried beneath magnificent imagery . A chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage which at first view seemed to consist only of overwrought declamation . He who would read the work with profit should often turn back , and , disregarding all the beauties of the style , draw out a continuous abstract of the argument it enfolds . Thus read , it will be found to be an irresistible refutation of the system it attacks ; thus read , it will be the best vindication of its author . Such a perusal and thorough appreciation of it is of the utmost importance in our own time and country . It is to be wished that its sentiments were much more generally diffused among us ; for , rightly understood , it is a bright beacon placed over that lee-shore of democracy toward which many causes combine to urge our American Republic . Burke 's design was to refute all apologists for the French Revolution , to show that it was wrong in principle and practice , and utterly " unworthy of imitation . " His argument is special and circumstantial throughout . He does not deny the right of revolution . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks that particular movement , the principles on which it proceeded , and the practices it adopted . If revolutions are good in themselves , intrinsically beneficial , and if every exercise by a nation of this power is necessarily right , VOL . XCIII. - NO. 193. 34 9 // then the course of Burke in this matter did " belie the tenor of his whole life , " and was utterly inconsistent with his condemnation of tyranny in America and in the East . If , however , we hesitate to adopt these sweeping propositions , and are willing to admit that such a movement , while it may be good , may , like all other human proceedings , be also evil ; that there are times when opposition to it may be evidence of the most judicious love of country and devotion to freedom ; in a word , that the question of its lawfulness is to be determined by the same considerations by which other acts are tested , - of time , place , circumstance , and motive , according to the highest rules of expediency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the English statesman falls to the ground , and he is to be judged only according to the right or wrong of that particular revolutionary movement which occurred in France in 1789 . This is a point which can not be too strongly insisted on in this and in all similar cases . There is so much that is noble in the rising of an oppressed people against their oppressors , so much that gratifies our love of justice in seeing tyranny foiled and tyrants punished , so much sublime self-devotion frequently in the leaders of such a movement , such renewed vigor and prosperity are often seen in a people who have just shaken off their fetters , that we rightly admire an instance of " resistance to tyrants , " and may without irreverence pronounce it " obedience to God . " But there is great danger lest we allow our admiration to lead us too far . We are too apt to generalize , and apply to all revolutions what is true of but a few . We come unconsciously to confound names with things . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the ground that a revolution must be a lawful resistance to tyranny . Thus we alter our motto , and virtually proclaim , instead of " resistance to tyrants , " that " resistance to rulers " is " obedience to God . " A principle so contrary to Divine precept and human reason has been abundantly proved false by history . Let it once be generally held to be more manly , virtuous , and praiseworthy to resist than to obey authority , and all responsible government is at an end . Rulers must either act in perpetual peril of martyrdom , or administer the laws with a tender hand , ready to abandon their posts on // the first symptom of popular disaffection . The principle applies to every individual citizen , who resists according to his inclination and ability . There are some in every community who can be brought to the position of living to fight . Such find a paradise in this time of license . There are more , however , who at most only fight to live , who feel that life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirlpool of unrestrained passion . These are at once desirous of peace and unable to gain it , as it must then be procured , by the sword . They therefore support any government which promises to be strong and stable , though it takes away that freedom whose abuse they have found so pernicious . Such a government is a military despotism . Where that exists , there may be contests for change of masters , but the people are still very sure to be slaves . So happy a consummation , however , is not always reached . Nations may struggle on for generations in constant anarchy , existing by the sufferance of their neighbors or protected by their own worthlessness . Thus those who claim the unlimited exercise of the right of revolution are in the end deprived of the power , or of all that makes it worth possessing . The principle so completely refuted by experience might be seen to be false by a simple inspection of the terms . IRevolution is so far from being intrinsically good , that it may be shown to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm against each other , breaks up many of the most valuable pursuits of civilized life , relaxes the restraints and therefore the protection of wholesome laws , and puts the prosperity of a country , and to a great extent its future destiny , into the hands of untried men , is in itself so open to censure that it can never be justified , except as a refuge from greater evils . A principle so evidently false as the one alluded to would seem scarcely to need elaborate refutation ; but it will be found , avowed or concealed , in most of the strictures upon the criticisms of Burke . It is because this is pressing upon their minds , that so few can read with patience twenty pages of his great work . Feeling that a censure of one revolution involves a censure of all , and being unalterably persuaded that some // revolutions have been blessings to the race , they forthwith condemn the author of the attack as " a bigoted opponent of progress and reform . " Let it but be generally perceived that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1789 and extol that of 1776 , or censure that which in England dethroned Charles I. , while he approves that which a little later deposed James II. , - that a patriot may with no change of principles expose his life for a revolution in one year , and against a revolution the next , - sound reasoning on this subject would be much more easily applied . In continuation of this very argument is Burke 's first charge against the French Revolutionists . He resists them because their aim was to destroy . That this was their purpose , their acts show beyond dispute . They swept away all the old dignities and administrative powers of their country . They attempted to confound its territorial divisions . It is notorious that they changed the very names of the commonest things . Even what they attempted to retain was culled out of the ruin they had made . In order to maintain their hereditary monarchy , they first altogether overthrew the old government of their country . So far from attempting to preserve what they found , they seem rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the old system did not need nor deserve to be thus totally destroyed , is generally admitted . No one has yet appeared bold enough to maintain that in all the ancient system of French polity there was not one portion worthy to be preserved . Yet , as we have seen , the Revolutionists destroyed all . Acting thus in disobedience to the primary presumption that lies always against all revolution or change , it is evident that their course was fundamentally wrong . They were in error from the very beginning . Hence , in Burke 's first utterance upon this subject ( Speech on the Army Estimates , February , 1790 ) , he declares , " that he thought the French nation very unwise . What they valued themselves on was a disgrace to them . They had gloried ( and some people in England had thought fit to take share in that glory ) in making a revolution , as if revolutions were good things in themselves . " In opposition to this , " in his opinion anything // which unnecessarily tore to pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real reformation , but introduced evils which would call , but perhaps call in vain , for new reformation , " - an opinion which , though uttered thus early , the course of the Revolution abundantly verified . It was not the expression of a momentary feeling , but of a fixed and controlling principle of his life , by which most of its apparent anomalies can be explained . He states the same conviction elsewhere in a different form , when he avows , " A disposition to preserve and an ability to reform , taken together , would be my standard of a statesman . " This may be regarded as a succinct statement of his own political creed . The " disposition to preserve " was in him always strong , sometimes excessive . Yet we may well be cautious how we censure it . In comparison with those whose only distinction is a genius for destruction , such a statesman is one of the best gifts of Providence . It is comparatively an easy matter to destroy . In some states of mind it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " can do this as well at least as your assemblies . The shallowest understanding , the rudest hand , is more than equal to that task . Rage and frenzy will pull down more in half an hour than prudence , deliberation , and foresight can build up in a hundred years . The errors and defects of old establishments are visible and palpable . It calls for little ability to point them out ; and where absolute power is given , it requires but a word wholly to abolish the vice and the establishment together . " " At once to preserve and to reform , " on the contrary , " is quite another thing . When the useful parts of an old establishment are kept , and what is superadded is to be fitted to what is retained , a vigorous mind , steady , persevering attention , various powers of comparison and combination , and the resources of an understanding fruitful in expedients are to be exercised ; they are to be exercised in a continual conflict with the combined force of opposite vices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the levity that is fatigued and disgusted with everything of which it is in possession If circumspection and caution are a part of wisdom when we work only upon inanimate matter , surely they become a part of duty too when the subject of our demolition and construction is not brick and timber , but sentient beings , by the sudden alteration of whose state , condition , and habits multitudes may be rendered miserable Tbe true lawgiver ought to have 34 * // a heart full of sensibility . He ought to love and respect his kind , and to fear himself . It may be allowed to his temperament to catch his ultimate object with an intuitive glance ; but his movements towards it ought to be deliberate . " In view of the vast results which may follow from action , it is surely not too much to require of legislators that no important change in government should ever be made , unless its advantage , according to the wholesome maxim of criminal law , is evident beyond a reasonable doubt ; that they should approach the faults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with pious awe and trembling resolution . " Even on the lowest ground of expediency , present prosperity and security is the " bird in the hand " ; the problematical advantage of innovation is one often far " in the bush . " We have little respect for those practitioners who would , according to another simile of Burke , " cut up the infant for the sake of an experiment . " Pursuing the argument of his " Reflections , " he proceeds to take up the course of the Revolutionists more in detail , and to show that it was not only unauthorized , but intrinsically wrong . In order to do this , he undertakes first to prove that the theory of government known as the " rights of man , " which lay at the foundation of the French system , is utterly false . His chief argument against it is in fact only a special application of the now universally admitted rule , that abstract reasoning can never determine matters of fact . " The pretended rights of these theorists , " he declares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are metaphysically true they are morally and politically false . " " These metaphysic rights entering into common life , like rays of light which pierce into a dense medium , are refracted from their straight line , " so that " it becomes absurd to talk of them as if they continued in the simplicity of their original direction . " For " the nature of man is intricate , the objects of society are of the utmost possible complexity , and therefore no simple disposition or distribution of power can be suitable to man 's nature and the character of his concerns . " By the reasoning thus clearly stated , we are driven to his conclusion , that " the science of constructing a commonwealth , or renovating it , or reforming // it , is like every other simple science , not to be taught a priori . " A system which thus violates one of the fundamental laws of reasoning , of course involves serious absurdities in its application . These he has pointed out with wonderful minuteness and accuracy , as we shall presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these doctrines , as shown in their effects . It has been a favorite method of the apologists of the Revolution to discriminate between the shocking events of that period and the system that tolerated them . This distinction , once allowed , shuts out all allusion to the excesses of the mob and the legalized atrocities of its agents . These acts being no part of the system , of course all that can be said about them in such a connection is mere sophistical declamation . As such it has been customary to regard many of the most splendid passages of Burke 's " Reflections " - his impassioned denunciation of the massacres in Paris , of the wretched spectacle of the march of women to Versailles , of the ferocious sacking of the palace , and of the brutal " triumph " with which the royal family were conducted to the capital . His touching and beautiful passage respecting Marie Antoinette is too frequently viewed in the same way . This distinction , which has been so generally admitted , should not for a moment be allowed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were either independent or dependent , able or unable to restrain the impulses of the people . Whichever alternative we adopt is equally fatal to the system according to which they proceeded . If they were independent in their action , they become themselves responsible for the excesses which they tolerated or decreed . In that case their system is false , for it assumes that the people will select its best men to be its rulers . But during a period of more than six years , under the operation of this system , the best men of France went to the scaffold or into exile , and the vilest were exalted into power . This was not for want of a change of measures or of men , for these were made with ridiculous frequency ; but through all changes there was a steady process of degradation , until property rose against numbers , and under the jeunesse dor6e commenced the reaction which was completed by the cannon of Napoleon . // If we take the other alternative , more in accordance with history and th' theory of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will of the people , acting , as Burke has it , only " the farce of deliberation , " and " obliged to adopt all the crude and desperate measures suggested by clubs containing men in comparison of whom Catiline would be thought scrupulous and Cethegus a man of sobriety and moderation . " According to this view , their theory of human rights in its practical operation furnished no restraint upon the action of the people . The people , acting without restraint , committed excesses shocking to humanity . Therefore , since the great object of government is to prevent such deeds , this system fails to answer the great object of government , and is practically false . It may be objected , that this is drawing a universal conclusion from a single instance . Such a course , which is illegitimate for proof , is allowable for refutation . A universal proposition is fairly refuted by an instance . We are told , " The immediate rule of the people will always be beneficial . " But the immediate rule of the people was not beneficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The very admission of an exception is fatal to a theory so universal in its nature as " the rights of man , " even if we are willing to admit that its terrible working in the only instance of its complete application formed an exceptional case . But to admit this would be to stop far short of the truth . Three fatal objections lie against any theory of government which does not provide for a restraint at times upon the immediate action of the people . The first is , that , in many crises of national history , the worst part of the community will infallibly gain the ascendency , unless some external restraint is imposed upon good and bad alike . He who cares nothing for life , and has no property or reputation to preserve , will ordinarily be more than a match for him who is concerned for any or all of these . The action of the most abandoned has on many occasions a directness , fearlessness , and vigor with which no other can compete . Thus for a time a forcible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the community may gain time to reflect and // courage to act . Again , there are many deep questions of state policy , which it is impossible that the majority of any people should readily comprehend . Experience may give them a sort of practical knowledge , by teaching them the actual relation between antecedent and consequent . But , as IDe Tocqueville remarks in his " Democracy in America , " " a nation may sometimes forfeit its existence while awaiting the consequences of its errors . " Hence it is important that those whose education enables them best to meet such questions should be in places of trust , and armed with such power as may enable them , on some occasions , to act in defiance , for the time being , of public opinion , and to resist the immediate will of the people for its ultimate good . Besides these dangers , men as we know them are liable to be influenced by sudden passion , large bodies of men eminently so . It can not be maintained that their action under such circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves will not subsequently regret . At such times , unquestionably , a temporary restraint , however unpopular , will be a permanent benefit . But the " rights of man " recognizes no necessity of any such restraint . The powerlessness of the French authorities was their legitimate condition upon the theory of their government . Hence the atrocities of the period are to be charged , not indeed upon its leaders , but upon the system of which they were at once the authors and the victims . Upon this view of the case , those portions of the writings of Burke which dwell upon the excesses of the movement obtain a legitimate and overwhelming power . The pity and indignation they excite need no longer be repressed or turned aside from their legitimate aim . We may not expend our censure upon the misguided men who first devised and instituted the system . " They found , " as Burke well remarks , " their punishment in their success . " Let these rightful emotions only point our words and direct our actions against any future professors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other land . When we reflect upon the unprecedented horrors of that former period , and remember that they were no extraneous accidents , but the natural effects of the system they accompany , we see no trace of madness , // only the expression of a clear understanding and patriotic determination , in the words of Burke , when he declared in Parliament , of the new government of France , that " it was a plundering , ferocious , bloody , tyrannical democracy , without a single virtue to redeem its numerous crimes ; and so far from being , as his honorable friend Fox had said , worthy of imitation , ' he would spend his last breath , and the last drop of his blood , he would quit his best friends and join his worst enemies , to oppose the least tittle of such a spirit or such an example in England . " These are the three chief objections which its most able and determined opponent has to allege against the system upon which the French government was based . He concludes his treatise with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical fallacies involved in its application according to the Assembly 's Constitution . The folly of composing their legislature of a single house , the futility of their scheme of a subordinate monarchy , the insufficiency of their plans for controlling their armies or enforcing the laws , the absurdity of dividing a country according to geometrical , without regard to natural boundaries , the deceitful nature of their revenue system , are strongly maintained , and their necessary results predicted with such exactness , that only a change of tense is necessary to convert many passages into a graphic narration of the decline and fall of the newly-constituted government . Especially noticeable is his description of the career of some future military despot who should establish order upon the ruins of liberty , written before the name of Napoleon Bonaparte was known even to France . Such an extended argument , leading to results so completely verified by subsequent facts , sets a seal upon the whole work , establishing a very strong presumption that even some of the most distasteful portions may contain much important truth . A careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculative reformers , as showing that the limitations they despise in the formation of their theories may appear again in their application with a ruinous , instead of a restrictive power . Summing up the whole argument of Burke , the great faults of the French Revolutionists seem to have been that they were actuated by a 4 // 4 morbid eagerness for destruction , and that they were so ignorant of the true theory , and even of the practical working of political institutions , that they sought to found a government upon abstractions , thus rendering it equally irrational and powerless . Turning now again to the work of Be Tocqueville , we find an explanation of the circumstances which led them to such a course . We have seen that the lower classes of French so ciety , which formed , of course , the bulk of the population , were pressed down under an almost intolerable burden of tax ation ; that taille and corve'es were pitilessly exacted , until there was danger that their united weight would disable their victims from paying either . This must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constant and fruitful source of discontent . We find , upon further examination , that while this existed there were no counteracting influences " to attach the feasant to the government under which he suffered , so that in many re spects his condition was worse in the eighteenth century than it had been in the thirteenth , notwithstanding the progress of civilization . " His condition was one of submission without protection , and suffering without sympathy . A body of in tendants and sub-intendants , under the immediate control of the Royal Council , administered the government throughout the kingdom . They were responsible only to the Council , and through it to the crown . The Parliament at Paris could in terpose an occasional restraint , and an independent , because permanent , judiciary could sometimes uphold the ancient laws against the edicts of the king ; but , with these limitations , the will of the monarch was the law of the land . The people had come to consider the royal power " in the place of Provi dence , " and were in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , with all the benignity of its last days , it was too distant , and with all its power it was too fee ble , to retain the affections of the people . Its power over its subjects was , as has been said , irresistible ; but it succeeded to an inheritance of misgovernment , and was surrounded by circumstances of perplexity and distress against which no mortal force could then avail , and its only resource was the merciless oppression of those whom it dared to oppress , that // is , the people . Its distance from them was a necessity . Any such central power must of itself be too far removed from the people rightly to appreciate their wants or to administer relief . Hence the people could only look upon it as a taskmaster , instead of a protector . At the same time , all those intermediate authorities to which they might have been attached by tradition and habit had become at once powerless , useless , and oppressive . The nobles had so completely lost their feudal power , that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had supplanted them ) were careful to remind their sub-agents that the seignior was nothing more than the first peasant in the parish . " But though their civil power was thus destroyed , we should suppose that their learning and refinement would still have commanded the respect of the people , and that the material advhntages they would secure to them would have won their gratitude . This , however , had long ceased to be the case . When the nobles lost the substance of their feudal power , and could win distinction only at the court or in the armies of the king , they naturally resorted to the capital in pursuit of that consequence and consideration which they failed to find at home . This was the course of events from the beginning of the seventeenth century , until at length " no men of rank were left in the rural districts but those whose means did not allow them to move . " But though their feudal power was gone , their feudal privileges were mostly retained , rendering them a burden to the people whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this class was , " says IDe Tocqueville , " strangely situated among the peasantry . He was no longer their ruler , and had no reasons for conciliating or aiding or guiding them , while , on the other hand , he did not share their burdens , and consequently felt no sympathy for sufferings , which did not afflict him , or for wrongs to which he was a stranger . Though they had ceased to be his subjects , he had not become their fellow-citizen . The position is without a parallel in history . " They had by this means become not only careless , but ignorant of the necessities of the people , and failed to do them the good they would willingly have done . One who was " exiled " // two years on his own estate found numerous means of improving the district which had not before occurred to him . Thus the peasantry were not only oppressed by the crown , but deserted by their natural guardians among the aristocracy . Their relations with the clergy were very similar . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of education and refinement , " the parish curate would have become the master of the rural classes , in spite of Voltaire , had he not been so notoriously connected with the political hierarchy , whose odium he shared together with its privileges . " Even he thought it necessary to isolate himself from the people he might have governed , and in his zeal for empty privileges lost substantial power and usefulness . Things standing thus with the nobility and clergy , there remained still one class , which might have conferred some benefits upon the people , and formed for them a nucleus of attachment to the society in which they were placed . This was the powerful middle class . What were its relations to the people we may show in De Tocqueville 's own words . " Interest , to a still greater extent than locality or habits of life , drew a line between the middle classes and the peasantry . Complaint is made of the privileges of the nobles , and very justly ; but what must be said of those of the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this or that impost The number was so great , in fact , as to produce at times a sensible falling off in the product of the taille These wretched privileges excited the envy of those who did not enjoy them , and filled their possessors with selfish pride . " Both in town and country , the middle classes had contrived to make of the lower classes strangers and enemies ; their most striking characteristic " was their fear of being confounded with the lower classes , and their violent desire to escape in some way from popular control . " Such were the relations of the lower classes with those above them . On examining these superior classes in their mental connection , we find a most unfortunate separation and hostility between the nobles and the middle class . " With the disorganization of the seignorial governments , the increas // ing infrequency or total cessation of meetings of the States General , and the ruin of national and local liberties together , the middle classes ceased to associate in public life with men of rank . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mutual understanding . They became daily more independent of each other and more complete strangers . By the eighteenth century the change was accomplished ; the two classes only met accidentally in private life . They were not only rivals , but enemies . " Such was the general condition of society . We have still to consider the agent which was to be most prominent in its renewal . The literary portion of French society was not then recogiiized as a political division , but history has been compelled to acknowledge it as such , and perhaps the most important of all . Struck by the many perversions and absurdities , which appeared everywhere in the state , men of letters had long , by a natural tendency , been led to indulge in speculations upon politics . In the numerous treatises to which this tendency gave birth , one element of agreement may be noted , that , namely , which was the cardinal fault of the Revolution . " They all started with the principle that it was necessary to substitute simple and elementary rules , based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional customs which regulated society in their time . " The reason for this fatal delusion is said to be , that " they had constantly in view a host of absurd and ridiculous privileges , whose burden increased daily , while their origin was growing more and more indistinct ; hence they were driven toward notions of natural equality . They beheld as many irregular and strange old institutions , all hopelessly jarring together , and unsuited to the time , but clinging to life long after their virtue had departed ; and they naturally felt disgusted with all that was traditional , and - each taking his own reason for his guide - they sought to rebuild society upon some wholly new plan . " " Having no share in government themselves , and seeing nothing that was done by those who had , noble birth being the passport to office , these writers lacked the superficial education which the habit of political freedom imparts even to those who take no part in politics . They were hence bolder in their projects of innovation , fonder of theory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching of antiquity and to rely on individual reason , than is usually the case with speculative writers on politics . " Hence their eagerness to destroy , their preference of reconstruction over amendment , their confidence in abstract reasoning , at once so censurable and so fatal . Almost the same causes which made them visionaries in politics rendered them infidels in religion . The speculative tendencies to irreligion , which literary men so frequently display , were confirmed by the fact that the Church was out of place like all things else . " It had become a political body , in defiance of its vocation and its nature ; it shielded vice in high places , while it censured it among the people ; it threw its sacred mantle over existing institutions , and seemed to demand for them the immortality it expected for itself . Attacks upon such a body were sure of popular sympathy . " A kind of " personal hostility " was added to this from the fact that " the Church , specially intrusted with the superintendence of ideas and the censorship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It opposed them when they stood forth on behalf of the general liberties of mankind , and consequently they were driven in self-defence to attack it , as the outwork of the place they were assaulting . " But the final reason assigned , and one most important to notice , is that the utter absence of political freedom had prevented their perceiving and feeling the importance of religion to liberty and social order . In proof of this , we are called to observe " how each class in turn learned in the rough school of revolutions the necessity of respecting religion . The old nobility were the most irreligious class of society before 1789 , and the most pious after 1793 ; the first attacked , they were the first to recover . When the middle classes were stricken down in the midst of their victory , they in turn drew toward religion . Respect for religion gradually made its way in the breast of every one who had anything to lose by popular disorders , and infidelity disappeared or lay hidden in the general dread of revolution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found without some religious observances , and we are here plainly taught that it can not safely divest itself of all . Toward the close of the Old R6gime " political // cians were out of practice , and were so ignorant of the part which religion plays in the government of empires , that infidelity found proselytes among those who were most vitally interested in the maintenance of order and the subordination of the people . Nor yet proselytes alone , but propagandists , who made an idle pastime of disseminating impiety . " When such doctrines , political and moral , could be tolerated by the higher classes , which still possessed many advantages , what must have been their reception among a people oppressed as we have seen the peasantry to have been ? This then was the society into which , in the latter half of the eighteenth century , a Frenchman found himself born . It contained an ancient , but decayed nobility , possessing innumerable uncompensated privileges ; a Church in league with oppression , producing in the minds of French patriots a prejudice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle class more than all others detesting and detested ; below all these , a people taxed almost beyond physical endurance to support them ; above them all , a monarchy exacting and ubiquitous , but unable , when not unwilling , to reform the abuses of the state ; external to all , a coterie of philosophers , who offered a simple , and seemingly , to those not versed in statesmanship , a wise and equitable system , free from all the abuses of the time , - a speculative political paradise . Of all which it may be said , in brief , that while men shall be able to conceive such a society as the latter , they can never be made to rest in one so irrational and oppressive as the first . As the sum of De Tocqueville 's investigation , we find French society in 1789 full of absurdity , weakness , and injustice , imposing the necessity of revolution on those who knew nothing of the dangers of reform . A knowledge of this state of things would almost have enabled one skilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to be such as Burke has condemned . Smarting as its authors were under the oppression of the old complicated system , they had little disposition to preserve where it was in their power to destroy . Ignorant as they were of the practical difficulties of government , they were unable to construct an equitable and efficient system in place of the one they overthrew . // The combined effects of ignorance and oppression had led them to hate and discard religion . Men of strong passions and slight information , thirsting for revenge and without religious principle , were those into whose hands the destinies of France were to fall . The character of their action might have been easily predicted , though the degree of atrocity which they reached could scarcely have been thought possible for humanity , until it was actually seen . From such a period , which called all the passions of a great nation into tumultuous action , numerous lessons may be drawn for all characters and conditions of men , and for almost every period of history . Many of these have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better enforced from other sources . There are three , however , which are taught with special power , and which it especially concerns us to develop . The first is the necessity of religion to the security of nations . On this the quotations we have made leave us little to say . There must be some restraint upon the ferocious passions , the sordid self-interest , the destructive ambition and rapacity of men , if we would have peace and security under any government , and most of all under one where the body of the people are free to act . Under a despotism coercion may to a great degree take the place of principle ; but in a popular government the character of the people is stamped directly upon the acts of the state , and the legislation and administration will seldom be purer than the fountain from which it flows . Even a corrupt form of religion is better than infidelity ; for infidelity can impose little restraint except by external force , while religion operates in the absence of any such physical control . Adams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would show where the law-abiding but patriotic New England men of his day were made . We may well shudder at the consequences which would follow the extirpation to-day of that religion which still rules the men of New England and of all the American States . In France , the destruction of even the perverted religion which she held was a greater calamity than all the evils she was enduring from its existence . Again , no one can rightly study the history of the French Revolution without becoming convinced that arbitrary power 35* // is not good for man , either for the individual or the race . In these days of democracy there is little need of proving its evil character in the hands of rulers ; but we need to remember that it is not more lawful or expedient for the people at large . To quote Burke again : " By these theorists the right of the people is almost always sophistically confounded with their power . The body of the community , whenever it can come to act , can meet with no effectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the whole body of them has no right inconsistent with virtue . " And again , after stating that " All persons possessing any portion of power ought to be strongly and awfully impressed with an idea that they act in trust , and that they are to account for that trust to the one great Master , Author , and Founder of society , " he proceeds to show that " This principle ought to be even more strongly impressed upon the minds of those who compose the collective sovereignty , than upon those of single princes . " If we do not subscribe to these opinions in all their extent , we must agree with their author so far as to admit that a democracy may become as shameless , as pitiless , as rapacious , as unjust , as any single tyrant or coterie of tyrants . This the history of the great French Revolution shows , and it is confirmed by many occurrences among the democracies of ancient Greece . Hence we must conclude , with Burke , that , not only as a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinite importance that they should not be suffered to imagine that their will , any more than that of kings , is the standard of right and wrong . " Let us put beside these strictures upon the action of the multitude a few well-known sentences from Burke 's impeachinent of Hastings , where he denounces the claim of arbitrary power by a single ruler . " Arbitrary power is a thing which neither any man can hold , nor nny man can give . No man can lawfully govern himself according to his own will , much less can one person be governed by the will of another . We are all born in subjection , - all born equally , high and low , governors and governed , in subjection to one great , immutable , pre-existent law , prior to all our devices , and prior to all our contrivances , paramount to all our ideas and all our sensations , antecedent to our very existence , by which we are knit and connected in the eternal frame of the universe , out of which we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our conventions or compacts ; on the contrary , it gives to our conventions and compacts all the force and sanction they can have , - it does not arise from our vain institutions . Every good gift is of God ; all power is of God ; - and He who has given the power , and from whom alone it originates , will never suffer the exercise of it to be practised upon any less solid foundation than the power itself . If , then , all dominion of man over man is the effect of the Divine disposition , it is bound by the eternal laws of Him that gave it , with which no human authority can dispense , - neither he that exercises it , nor even those who are subject to it ; and if they were mad enough to make an express compact that should release their magistrate from his duty , and should declare their lives , liberties , and properties dependent upon , not rules and laws , but his mere capricious will , that covenant would be void " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iNor can any sovereign have it by succession , for no man can succeed to fraud , rapine , and violence Those who give and those who receive arbitrary power are alike criminal ; and there is no man but is bound to resist it to the best of his power , wherever it shall show its face to the world " Law and arbitrary power are in eternal enmity . Name me a magistrate , and I will nam&amp; property ; name me power , and I will name protection . It is a contradiction in terms , it is blasphemy in religion , it is wickedness in politics , to say that any man can have arbitrary power . In eve*y patent of office the duty is included . For what else does a magistrate exist ? To suppose for power , is an absurdity in idea . Judges are guided and governed by the eternal laws of justice , to which we are all subject . We may bite our chains if we will ; but we shall be made to know ourselves , and be taught that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he that will substitute will in the place of it is an enemy to God . " It is on this point that the theory of the Revolutionists was most radically wrong . They had suffered so much from arbitrary power in the hands of one man , that they rightly dreaded any such exercise of it . Their great error was in failing to see that it might be evil in the hands of the multitude . They perceived it to be both wise and just to place some power in the hands of the people ; but they went to an extreme most unwise and unjust , when they claimed for them arbitrary power . As all things are in subjection to the King of kings , so are all nations in subjection to the God of nations . And as // his high position will not screen the ruler , neither will their numbers protect the people , if they venture to transgress the requirements of that " great immutable , pre-existent law , " which He has imposed upon all mankind . The will of the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of national action ; but it is not , and never can become , the standard of right . We desire , finally , to revert to the first charge advanced against the Revolutionists , that they sought rather to reconstruct than to amend . We would simply inquire what they gained by their precipitate and remorseless destruction of the institutions they found existing , which , in spite of all their defects and perversions , were not without great advantages . The answer to this question occupies the first eight chapters of the Second Book of De Tocqueville . In his Preface he writes : - " The French made , in 1789 , the greatest effort that has ever been made by any people to sever their history into two parts , so to speak , and to tear open a gulf between their past and their future " I have always fancied that they were less successful in this enterprise than has been generally believed abroad , or even supposed at home . I have always suspected that they unconsciously retained most of the sentiments , habits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by whose aid they achieved the Revolution ; and that , without intending it , they used its ruins as materials for the construction of their new society . " In accordance with this view the author proceeds to prove that " Administrative Centralization , " " Guardianship of the State " ( Tutelle Administrative ) , " Administrative Tribunals " ( la Justice Administrative ) , and " Official Irresponsibility " ( Garantie des Functionnaires ) - the boasted conquests of the Revolution - were in reality institutions of the Old R6gime . From his survey he concludes that , " When the Revolution is disengaged from the extraneous incidents which imparted a temporary coloring to its complexion , and is examined on its own proper merits , it will be seen that its sole effect was to abolish those institutions which had held undivided sway over Europe for several centuries , and which are usually known as the feudal system , in order to substitute therefor a social and political organization // marked by more uniformity and more simplicity , and resting on the basis of the equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old social edifice would none the less have fallen , though it would have given way piecemeal , instead of breaking down with a crash . The Revolution effected suddenly , by a convulsive and sudden effort , without transition , precautions , or pity , what would have been gradually effected by time had it never occurred . That was its achievement . " That was no less its crime . To hack the frame to nieces in order to remove a diseased or foreign body , which in process of time will be thrown out by the regular action of the system , is the surgery of madmen . It is as if the French had let loose the incalculable forces that lay sleeping in the hundred and twenty tons of powder in the magazine of the Bastile , in order to rid themselves in a moment of their ancient prison . It would have accomplished the work . It would have accomplished it speedily and completely , and would have required but a momentary exertion of that foolhardy daring which was not wanting in Paris in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide . In one point even this comparison fails . The people of Paris might have removed beyond the reach of the effects of that explosion ; but when they as recklessly tore asunder their government , they had no place to flee to , and no choice but to abide the consequences of their folly . They preferred to break down their prison piecemeal , by incessant labor , %ut with little danger to any , and to form the stones into a different structure for the permanent benefit of the people . Well would it have been for them if equal wisdom had guided them in dealing with the edifice of a vitiated government .
