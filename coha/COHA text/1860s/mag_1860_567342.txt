ARTICLE II. - TIIE POWER OF CONTRARY CHOICE . THE question whether the soul has the " power of contrary choice " is one of the utmost importance in its bearings upon theology , and all moral science . It is high time that the subject was thoroughly understood . The orthodox faith has lost much by its dullness of apprehension and its incompleteness here , and entirely failed of that " vantage ground " which it would have held but for its unwillingness to concede what is intuitionally true at this point , and what the common sense of men concedes in all the relations of life . Happy the day , for the cause of truth generally , and for the power and spread of the gospel , when our metaphysics on this and other subjects shall agree with the acknowledged principles of common sense , and be but the philosophic and comprehensive statement of them ! Ask any man of a thousand you may meet , whether he thinks he could have done right yesterday when he did wrong , and he will say " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of humanity , for all time , everywhere . Not whether he acted freely and with consent of will in doing wrong . That of course . But whether situated as he then was , he could have refrained from the wrong and done the right , and he will still say " Yes , " if his conscience is tender , and bad theology does not come in his way . And he will sustain his position by asking further , " If I could not , how then was I responsible for my sin ? If it was inevitable , ' situated as I was , how am I answerable for it ? If the temptations to it took away my power to the contrary , I feel absolved for what I could not help ; " and the conscience of mankind will go with him in this , philosophize about it as we may . It is not to be expected that a great mind of any given age should see all sides of all subjects , for all time . The error of the colossal " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point un // der review . No man has proved that choice is always as is the greatest apparent good , and it is not an intuitional idea . Edwards found it in the dialectics of previous periods , and accepted it without special investigation , we may hope . It was , too , a link in a chain and scheme of doctrine . It was not investigated on its intrinsic merits as a psychological question . It stood in the light of a consequence , and was for its sake . It was deemed needful to Divine government , though without good reason . The argument was , that God could not be supreme , or secure results , unless he had sovereignty of all youtions and made them but modifications of the infinite cause . But there never can be more than the " petitio principii " here . You can only beg the question . Who knows that I always do what I think is best ? It seems to me far otherwise . The sense of the inquiry is not altered if I add the phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All volition is in the present tense . The statement , however expressed , must be tantamount to this , that all men always act from the conviction of what is the greatest good . And can this be said of all the foolishness , and lust , and wickedness of earth and hell ? The expression is a misnomer . It does not characterize the act . It has credence for the sake of an end to be gained by it , and yet that end , when thus reached , falsifies a moral government and ignores the distinction between nature and the supernatural . If motives govern choice , with no power to the contrary , then " the is " is the exponent of " the can be . " Then the past could be only as it has been ; the present can not be otherwise than as it is , or the future than as it will be . The forces are all " ab extra . " We have no power to alter them , or their effects . The stream is from the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change its course . All is a Divine programme , and must be fulfilled in this way or the reins , are taken out of the hands of God , and he has no way left to be supreme . It is an outside pressure on us , or one " ab extra " to ourselves , which is only to be yielded to , and which can only be yielded to freely , you may say . But even that you get not from the doctrine , or the scheme it serves , // but in spite of ; and in exception to , them . These would be complete , with this element left out . The whole subject is viewed theologically , and for a theological result . It is a mere matter of cause and effect , to enable God to govern mind and secure results in the moral , as he does in the physical world . That the mind is free in the process , at the point of contact with it , is intuitionally learned indeed , but it does not belong to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make one hair white or black , in the matter of results . All is from God , and resistless as the lightning , and all a Divine method to gain a Divine end . And in gaining that end , the mind is no real factor . It has no discretion , no power of resistance , no sovereignty over the issue . At any given point of wrong it could not hold up , for it has no power to the contrary . It goes as it is led , and because it is led . You say freely , " Yes , " as the wheel on its axle , or the joint in its socket , or the door on its hinges , and by subsidizing this foreign element to your doctrine you relieve thus empirically the unutterable repulsions of it . But in all this you do not describe the conscious intuitions of the mind in its free acts . The view is not authentic . More is wanting to it . It lacks vitality . It does not give object or character to the freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no power of discrimination , no election as to what the act shall be in the given circumstances . You have not got up into the region of personal cause . There is no self-origination of conduct , or character , or destiny . You have not risen into the region of the " supernatural . " You have not stept from the tread-mill policy of mere physics into the appropriate sphere of the will . The man as yet is but a mere tool in the hands of another  --  a thing acting as it is acted on  --  a means , worked by another for the sake of something beyond itself And the picture is unmeaning . The view is lame and inadequate . It fails integrally to complete the intimations of consciousness in our free acts , and tantalizes us with the name of freedom , while it takes its gist and import , aye , its real life away , and makes it at once without significance or value . We never did wrong without the conviction that , at the // 310 The Power of Contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was needless and avoidable . Could we , one of the sharpest pangs of remorse would be extracted , if not all remorse effectually quieted and removed . No man was ever placed where he could not do right . A virtue that is " inevitable , " is no virtue . The plea , " I could not help it , " is always in bar of imputed wrong , and equally excluding merit , in action formally right . Of course we would guard against the predisposing tendencies to existent wrong , which are found in habits and propensities formed and resultant of the earlier history of the individual or the race , and our friends , in controversy , will , we judge , agree with us in this . But if I have no power against an existing temptation and array of motives , how have 11 against a previous habit ? Such a habit is nothing to me now , in the matter of a current responsibility , except as a present influence . And if I have no capabilities concerning it , but only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and under any circumstances , arrest and throttle it and deliver myself from it , and proclaim the freedom of eternal victory over it , from the force of the very elements of the intelligence that is in me , and of me as a creature of God , and more especially now as aided and encouraged by the assurances of the gospel , then indeed am I " led as an ox to the slaughter , and like a fool to the correction of the stocks . " But it has been objected " cui bono , " " What is the use of claiming the power of contrary choice-it never is exercised ? " But are you sure of that ? We believe that the power of contrary choice is , and is exercised in thousands and thousands of instances every day . Indeed , not a sinner turns to God without it . Let a great revival of religion sweep through the city , and . over the land , and you have it everywhere . We see not how any one gets to Christ without it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation , under God , upon it . He must summon it to the work of resistance and counteraction . He must contravene the prevalent propensities , and temptations , and habits of a whole life of impenitence and alienation from God . He must encounter the cherished lusts of a life time , and go right abreast of all he has ever been , to resist all , and against the pleadings , and pretensions , and tyranny of all , and turn // unto God and live . And in this he needs the power of contrary choice , and uses it . So that for all the purposes of this discussion this power to the contrary is , under God , the life of the world , and is seen wherever a sinner is converted from the error of his way , or a soul saved from death . flow can you break away from a dominant propensity , or change a course of action , without calling up an element of being like that for which we here contend ? The objector will not surely take shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opposite choices , or go two ways at once ; for what does this amount to , reduced to the last analysis ? It is just equivalent to the iiisignificant , identical proposition , that we do ac we do-that personality is a unit , and not a duad . A given volition or exercise may be no measure of the powers of its author . Powers may lie dormant , or await the occasion for their use . We should be sorry to conclude that one who is only doing wrong , is exercising all the powers he has , or that we ever lose the power of right action , whatever , in fact , our conduct may be . The poor deceit practised on the mind of such an objector , and which he would doubtless hold as a conceded and legitimate postulate , and which has been the occasion of more discussions and logomachics since its invention than almost anything else , is that of two sorts of necessity-physical and moral  --  the last always retiring , on the analysis of its friends . into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain a correlate of the possible ? Only by begging the question again , in view of the theological nece&amp;sities of the scimenie . A certainty may be no more allied to a necessity than an uncertainty , unless , as before , you restrict the thought to the mere inanity , that what will be , will be . But much will be that need not be , and that ought not to be , and that is under no necessity of being whatever . Shall we use a nomenclature , in dealing with abstract truth , which obliges us to say that that is necessary which God has forbidden , and which he is opposed to , and all good agencies in the universe , and the constituent elements of our own being ? Temptation is one thing , but the necessity of compliance quite another . I may be greatly tempted , but the greater is the resistance , and the // use of my power to the contrary , which I can and should make ; and if I foolishly comply , the fact would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to the forms of conventional speech , found in or out of the Bible , and for popular use , where great temptation or a perpetuated depravity is correllated with , or expressed by the words * can , " and " can not ; " as , the brethren of Joseph hated him *o badly that they " could not speak peaceably to him ; " when *every one knows they could and should* The error lies not in accepting this metaphoric language of the Orient and of common life , as implying hardened iniquity , oi ' in reference to hereditary propensity , or great , overt wickedness , as when it is said that such an one is so great a liar that he " can not " speak the truth , and the like phrases that are well enough understood among men-not this , but in running this phraseology into a universal dogma of Occidental inetaphysics , and constituting it a battery in the discussions of exact truth and science behind which to screen the exigences of a theological system . But the doctrine is vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure a Divine government in the moral sphere . And to secure this , it is deemed needful to give to God the sovereignty of all volitions , that they may thereby be as on the whole he would have them to be , and as will best promote his great end in creation . And as this can be done only in the way of influence " al extra " to the mind , ( proper , ) there is established from the very demands of the system this doctrine of necessity , and the coalescence of the " is " and the " can be . " The error lies in bringing in this idea of necessity at all within the sphere of the will , and in taking this way of securing a Divine moral government . It is inherently vicious as a method , and can but subvert the superstructure it would raise . What , in the convictions of any man , would be the value of ; or what would 1e that moral government or universe which absorbed into the Deity all the sovereignty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretionary movements of mind ? A thing , it might be ; more than that , it could not be . The doctrine of cause is as legitimate and appreciable in derived as underived being . God made man in his own image , // and after his own likeness . Intelligence is cause " per . *e , " dependent for its being , but with a full and unrestricted personality as to its voluntary and responsible acts . Where would be the personality of God without the sovereignty in himself of his voluntary states and acts , and if we might suppose them to be in another , and to be caused by any other than himself , we could no longer see in him the element of personal cause ; nothing would remain but irresponsible effect . He must have the control of his forthgoing volitious , or he is no person ; he has no discretion in respect to what lie is , or will be ; he is without individuality or accountableness , to himself or to another . Such is all intelligence . It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in respect to its voluntary states-be itself the sovereign , and have the control over them , and say what they shall be , and whether or not they shall be . Without this you do not get a personality into the intelligence , an.d abstracting this you destroy it as intelligence , and convert it into a mere effect , moved by causes from without , either material or immaterial . They shall say what it shall be and do , and not the intelligence itself ; and theirs should be the responsibility of its course . It is no longer a " cauca ectu8anS , " but merely a " cau*a caucata . " But God deals with derived intelligence as if it were a " cauca cau8ans , " and could put forth voitilons without his influence therein , or with his influence therein , or against his influence therein . " Ye stiff necked and rebellions , ye do alway resist the Holy Ghost . " What mean those exhortations , and promises , and comminations , and eventual retributions , which are everywhere propounded in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrine that underlies them , or what relevancy in them , if the sovereignty of our voluntary states is not in ourselves , but in God ? Does one exhort another to that over which he has not the control and jurisdiction , but which , after all , is with himself ? We are aware of indicating here , but what is well nigh common-place in philosophy , that all moral influence is inherently resistible , and that individual mind would be without selfrespect , if it were without self-control . We prize as highly as any the work of the Spirit in the repentance and sanctification of men ; but we would not thereby take from and absorb away the // responsible personality of the soul . Much is resistible that will not be resisted . Men will repent when they could hold out in sin , as others will continue to hold out in sin when they could and should repent ; and God knows all results in both kingdoms of his empire , and has indicated them , so far as he has thought best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8me qua non " and a cause . Intelligence acts in the way of intelligence . If there were nothing to choose , there would be no occasion for choosing . The mind determines itself in view of considerations present to it ; but these are not the causes of its acts , nor the exponents of its power . The atmosphere is not the cause of breathing , though indispensable to it . The mind has laws of thought and principles of action . It dwells in a sea of motive influences , variant often and contradictory , and from all the sources of truth within its range ; and it selects its course among them without being commanded by any . It is itself the real and sole agent in the matter of volition , from the inherent " nisus " of its own interior sphere , with power to accept any or refuse any . It can act foolishly or wickedly , or wisely , in the same circumstances . All the motives in creation may surround and press upon it to do right , and yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deeper than any external appliances can master . We present them , and leave them , and must leave them short of the result desired , and let that go to the sovereign arbitrament of the respondent mind , from its own interior sphere , in compliance or rejection , on an election and responsibility all its own . Motives do not secure choice , or necessitate it . They present its grounds , but give not its actuality , and are often doomed to bitter disappointment there . The voluntary activities of the will are inherently contingent , and so we reason in all the intercourse of life . We do in the pulpit , and in personal appeal . We are not sure of results till we get responses . Other principles of mind , and the facts of history and experience , help us to calculate results , but with much imperfection and many failures . The necessitated faculties and well known laws of mind show the ordinary range of its voluntary being , but do not necessitate its volition , in any given instance . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in its voluntary history , abide in the extravagant , and ludicrous , and unreasonable , and wrong , is to be attributed to other reasons than a limit of power . The doctrine of necessity is , then , out of place in the sphere of the will , and the position that motives necessitate choice , with no power to the contrary , is fairly open to the following objections , which , with these preliminary suggestions , may be now more formally stated . 1st . It can not lie proved . Froni the nature of the case it can be but an assumption , and ask the point in debate . How prove this coalescence of the " is " and the " can be , " in respect to any given volition , and that it is the measure and limit of the powers of the mind , at the time , and that it can not be arrested , or diverted , or changed and countermanded at any and every stage of it ? We can only say that what is , is-only make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all saying what might or might not be in its place . It takes for granted that we must will what we do will , and that we have no power against present consent of will , but only in its direction and fulfillment . And there is , there can be no psychological stand-point from which to maintain the position which can make it more than a " petitio principii , " in behalf of some theological necessity supposed to demand it . 2d . Its definition of choice is logically incomplete and defective . Its claim for choice is freedom in merely one direction , whereas the true import of it is freedom to either . It is liberty to accept or decline a given object . It implies a freedoin , and of course a power , to either . The object can be received or rejected . The mind is sovereign over the issue , and is competent to a decision either way . It can act wisely or foolishly in the premises-choose life or death-act right or wrong-according to the light it has , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hold out in impenitence-follow Christ or the world . What would that choice be , which presented no alternative-which involved the liability of but one issue , and made only that possible in the premises , and necessitated that ? The element and the object of choice has now evaporated out of it , and it settles down into a fatality or a farce . The logical demands of the subjec // involve the principle and the power of contrary choice . " Choose ye this day whom ye will serve , " says the Christian preacher ; and does he not know that each one of his people , under every possible presentation of the subject , can at any time say , " Yes " or " No , " to his plea ? What would compliance be worth , but for this ; or what vitality , or value , in character or destiny ? And hence , 3d. it gives no real election in choice , and no true personality to the intelligence . All personality claims discretion over the issues presented , and as presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it must have codrdinately the power of refusal . That consent must not be , because it could not be withheld . It must be with liberty to the contrary , or there is no virtue in it , no dignity of manhood , no prerogative of one , made in the image of God . Carry the opposite view to the marts of business , to the subject of religion or morality in the common walks of life , or even to the sports of childhood , and let the umpire be the common sense and sentiments of men , and the dogma would scarcely fail of ridicule and contempt . The conviction of a practical and competent jurisdiction over influences brought to bear upon us , to say what we will do and what the act shall be in view of them , is everywhere , and is everywhere essential to all acknowledged responsibility . With its abandonment would go all sentiment of personal accountableness , and all idea of the characteristic difference between a person and a thing . 4th . It does not meet the demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame which attend it . Suppose the volition be a sin . Does it describe the conviction of him who committed it , to say that it was in any sense necessary and unavoidable ? - that certain influences were imposed on me , and I complied , of conise , without power to the contrary ? Something approaching this was attempted in behalf of the primeval sin ; but our first parents broke down with shame in giving it . They had courage only to say , " The serpent beguiled me , and I did eat ; " " The woman which Thou gayest me , gave unto me audji did eat . " Not that we could not help it , or avoid it , and that it was " inevitable . " The // conviction in sinning , is , that it is needless as well as wrong ; avoidable as well as blameworthy , and that unless it were the one , it would not be the other . I am assailed with temptation in the streets . Until 11 comply , I have the power not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose it ? Does the consent to sin abolish it ? Does the act of compliance abnegate the power of resistance , and necessitate my sin ? This but confounds cause and effect , and gives an excuse beside . It makes the success of crime its apology . This would be a wonderful opiate to administer to those in sin  --  a wonderful relief to the pangs of remorse . A child shall say , " I could not help it , " and you will accept the excuse ; while with perfect consistency society will inflict a severer punishment on the second or third or fiftieth offense , even up to a hardened iniquity , than on the first ; showing indubitably that in the convictions of all men there is no relation between the indulgence of sin and its necessity . Consent , merely , does not , then , exhaust the conscious convictions of the soul , in respect to its volitions . It is consent when it might be withheld ; compliance when it could have been resistance ; wrong , perhaps , when it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that voluntariness that can not be withheld , that compliance which can not be refused , that acceptance of a poeition or a boon which can not be resisted ? So that consent itself implies a power to the contrary ; and hence , 5tl*. ftc theory of the intelliqence is fmtndarnentally incompetent and uncound . It constitutes the mind a mere effect , in nature , moving as it is moved upon , by something else . It does not rise to the dignity of the supernatural , in its view of mind . The intelligence according to this scheme is not cause " per ee , " - originating its own thoughts ,  --  acting from the principles of its own constituent being , as inherently cause with selfcontrol and jurisdiction over its voluntary movements to say what , and whether they shall be ,  --  to comply or not comply with any motive influences that may be brought to bear upon us from any quarter , and to stand erect in the rectitude and dignity of our personal being , whatever the currents of adverse influence may be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that which may be deemed the strongest , and be // alike at the mercy of any and every xvave that comes . Mind has no power in itself No element of simple cause inheres in it . It may arrest no movement , debate no question , counteract no issue , prevent no conclusion . It is only a " causa causata . " The real cause is elsewhere ,  --  it is " ab extra " to the mind , which is mere effect , differing from the water-wheel in the feature of consciousness , but not in the relations of cause and effect . Just this is the demand of the scheme . It is an indispensable link in the chain , without which the whole would be valueless . If the sovereignty of volitions was of the personality , and one might at any time say yes or no to any amount of temptation that might be on him , who could predict its uniform success , according to any preconcerted programme that might be laid down , or know but that he did in thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its line of things , and thus vitiate this method of moral government , whether human or divine ? It must then deny all real cause to the finite , and with it all actual control over its voluntary history or jurisdiction and sovereignty in respect to what at any given point it shall be , and demand as the content of the mind 's experience and its power , that it move contentedly and freely in the grooves marked by another 's hand , in obedience to influences ab extra to itself . That this leaves little to the mind that is really intelligent in itself or of the nature of a bona fide personality , and that it is utterly aside from all the dictates of our conscious being , we need not here repeat , and pass therefore to the consideration , that , 6th . It supplies no valid basis of MORAL GOvERNMENT . Such a government always submits a question to the respondent under it , and gives him the jurisdiction over that question . It acknowledges a discretion on his part ,  --  a power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requisitions proposed . It furnishes a test ,  --  it presents an alternative , and presumes him competent to either course . It holds him responsible for the right , but capable of the wrong . This is the language of all law , of all character and destiny ,  --  the doctrine of all promises and exhortations , all rewards and punishments , all probation and retribution . It defers to a personality , in the subject under it , that is always equal to the test given , and // to the alternative proposed , to avoid the evil and choose the good ,  --  a competency that is not compromited by the actual facts of the case ,  --  a competency that sits president among them and over them , and abides inherently in the personal being of the soul . It is a power to will or not will in any given case ,  --  to will as he does or otherwise ,  --  to will as he does or as he should , at any and all times , and that , too , whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sufficiency of soul for all right action , and all the intelligent responsibilities of moral government , lies inherent in the personality and back of all influences made to bear upon it . Without it , such a government is a mere pageant , and personal being a mere thing . Without this you could not have an intelligent accountability . You could never charge that an act was needless and could have been avoided . You could only say to the subject under it , " you could if you would . " And he must reply " inasmuch as I would not , I could not , " and the act is of nece&amp;sity , a part of my integral life and history  --  and any government in heaven or on earth would break down on this issue and at this point . You must divorce the " is " from the " can be " under moral government , and account the one to be no necessary exponent of the other . A power to do right is a power to do wrong . Moral government has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grounds of an intelligent electivity , but does not constrain or necessitate it . From the nature of the case it could not , and it never will . Its methods are inherently resistible , and must be so . It can not necessitate its moral issues . There may be that under it which it doec not design or want . There may be that which is like rebellion to the strategy of a state , which is no part of that strategy or of its normal working , and which it can not prevent , or dispose of , but in the way of a resultant retribution , which takes on the element of physical power . Thus there is that under Divine Government , which God in no respect sympathizes with or would have , and which all the prerogatives of time Infinite combine to prohibit and resist , and overcome and cure . Probation from its very nature may not see the will of God fully met , and there may be no other way of controlling the spirits of lost men , than that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Their moral state is not such as God would have it , or such as it would have been , if he had control of it , and never will be , and their condition will be a dernier resort under moral government , from the ininherent liabilities of it . Such a government must be where God is , and creatures in his image , and it is the dignity and glory of creation . But this is necessarily of it too , and without which neither could virtue , or character , or moral excellency , or intelligent destiny , or heaven , be . All thewealth of character and destiny , of morality and religion , of likeness to God and companionship with angels , lies in this catagory of thought . Indeed what would that virtue and obedience be , which could not be withheld , hut which was necessitated and " inevitable . " Change the terms of the problem as you will , and that which takes from the intelligence the essential control of its voluntary states , and gives its volitions into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that distinguishes moral government in its methods and results from one of brute force . The resistibility of moral means is their excellency and glory , as well as of all moral action in view of them . If they were otherwise they would not be moral , nor would action be in view of them . Tth. like po8ition here cantrover*ed is not taken for its own sake . We certainly intend no disrespect , . and think we do no wrong in saying this . The historical relations of the question show this , and the effort of its friends now , as already intimated , is ulterior , and with a view to a theological position . They would find here the basis of Divine government , and of the supremacy of God , and build on this pedestal the doctrine of decrees , and their fulfillment , and the security of the plans and purposes of God , and of his great end in creation . The line of argument is , that all is by a Divine decree and according to a Divine programme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transpiring of each particular is essential to the grand result which is God 's great end iu his works , and that this necessary fulfillment in the moral sphere and its relations to the physical , can not be secured unless motive governs choice and necessitates it , and that as God has the supreme direction // The Power of Contrary Choice . of motive influences , he can and does determine all volitions in accordance with the prescribed plan , and thus effectuates mid secures his end . Now , without stopping to inquire whether it is quite authentic to solve a purely psychological problem by a theological formula , and taking up the question on its merits , and assuming that what is theologically true is true every way and everywhere , which we admit ; are we sure that this is the only , or the best , or the true way at all , to constitute a Divine moral government ? Would such a government be able to redeem itself from the simple pageantry of its movement as a Divine fatality , with really but one cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all else reduced to mere effect ? But how is this ? Does uot moral government imply a commerce of forces ?  --  a commingling of different and variant and it may be antagonistic personalities and agencies ? Must there not be the reciprocities of governor and governed ? The mutual consilience of distinct , individual personalities , each with its own agency and scheme of things , and will there not of necessity be as many plans of action as there are agents to enact them ? Is it not so among men , as by all confessed , and how does the scale of the infinite change the terms of the problem ? God " worketh all things according to the counsel of his own will , " but we are not quite so sure that sinners do . At least God says they do not . Besides , it is mmphilosophical to say that one being purposes the purposes of another . This is not the way of securing from others our own ends . We present considerations and inducements , but we do not invade their agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may coalesce in the same result , but the plans are distinct and peculiar to each , and each is his own plan and not another 's , and his decrees and purposes are but the mental condition of his own acts . We see this everywhere . It is of the individuality and responsibility of all personal intelligence . And we see no need of disturbing the law of these well known principles and facts , in our reference of the subject to its divine relations . Indeed , in the li*rht of revealed truth we have them in their perfection there . // God is in the infinite and in the right , and we are intelligent beings . The constituent being of man is a plea for the truth , and righteousness , and course of God . Much that is resistible will not be resisted . The resources of the Infinite are with God , to bring light out of darkness and order out of confusion . " Better is the end of a thing than the beginning . " Moral means , though inherently resistible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spirit of God will yet gain a glorious and permanent triumph over the tempter , death , and sin . Men will give heed to that Spirit , and all right agencies and influences , when they could hold out against them , and their repentance will be afreedorn and not a necessity . Though none will repent without the Spirit , yet multitudes will with . Kations will be born in a day , and earth become a type of heaven . " God sees the end from the beginning . " He sees it . It is in-tuitional with him everywhere and always , and He has intimated results to ns , for our encouragement , in the use of means . Probation will do much in behalf of " God 's great end in all things , " though it will witness much that He would not have , and fail of much that He would have . He would " have all to be saved , " but they will not be . His own chosen methods will not be attended with universal success . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will resist his will and his Spirit with its array of means and influences , and have to be turned over , to the dernier and less acceptable , but necessary retributions of moral government . " For he must reign until he hath put all his enemies under his feet . " A supreme governor does not in the moral sphere always have all things subdued to him . There may be rebellion , and in it much that he does not will or wish , and it may bring disturbance into the physical relations of his subjects , and there may be a process of things , before the issue comes . But he will maintain himself against that rebellion , and succeed in putting it down , if not in one way , then in another . If mercy fails in anything , then retribution will take up the work , and the principles of his government will be vindicated ,  --  " the righteous shine as the stars , " and his great end be attained in all honor , and justice and mercy and truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is infinitely // happy in himself and in the prosecution of his great end , though all are not saved and though " he has no pleasure in the death of the wicked . " And this style of moral government is legitimate , and appreciable , and satisfactory . It is moral government , and free from the insuperable objections , which must forever attend the view above referred to ,  --  and to which we now present the still more serious and ultimate disclaimer , that , 8th . It 8anct ? fles 8ifl . It constitutes sin the Divine method of the universe ,  --  as integral in the Divine economy ,  --  as a Divine strategy and expedient , introduced therein with a view to the glory of God and his great end in creation . As such he decrees it , its time , and manner , and amount , and all the concomitants of it , so that there shall be just as much sin as God has decreed , without power to the contrary . All sin is a Divine method , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and without the ability on our part of preventing it . We state the case sharply , but truly . However stated , it comes to this . All this , and much more indeed , in the same direction , is the logical sequence of the position we controvert and its theological adjunct and reason . Any form of thought which takes sin into the Divine economy , obliges us to give a good reason for it . The doctrine of any strategic , propositional relation of God to the introduction of sin , commits us for the whole , and we must view all the wrong of earth and hell , as comprehensively according to the mind and will of God , and must hold him responsible for all there is of it , and then the doctrine of " no power to the contrary* ' is legitimate and necessary . And thus its friends understand it . Not to go further back , Dr. Hopkins of Newport wrote a volume to justify God as the proponent of moral evil , in which , with other language equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and choose that sin should exist , ( which he maintains , ) this necessarily implies , as has been before shown , all that energy , exertion and disposal of things that is necessary , previous to the existence of sin , in order that it may actually take place , and without which it could not have existed . For there is an infallible connection between the will of God that // sin shall exist , and the actual existence of it , and this will of God is the cause or reason why it has taken place rather than not. * ' * Dr. Bellamy , in a more apologetic tone , writes a volume on the " wisdom of God in the permission of sin , " while Dr. Emmons , with his sturdy and unflinching logic , carries the subject up to its only legitimate conclusion , in his " Divine efficiency scheme . " For surely if God ordains sin , and causes and controls sin in accordance therewith , " without power to the contrary , " how on any other scheme does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed in this matter , flies to the extreme , that " God is above morality , " and that " no rule reaches him , " t while others , better posted , if not less unscrupulous , run the whole subject into mystery , and frankly acknowledge that the " rationale " of wrong , a matter in respect to which we have had and must have more practical experience and constant responsibility than on any other , is incapable of being understood . And so it is on the principle here objected to . The great Keander so esteemed it , and so it ever must be esteemed , as an element in a Divine economy . The future will be further from appreciating it than the past . Ko man will ever again write about it as did Hopkins , or with Emmons assume the logical sequences of the " efficiency scheme . " The maturity of the study of moral science forbids it . No one , on that side , will again encounter a discussion of the subject on its merits . With a stand-point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an insoluble mystery , and must ever remain so . Time studies of eternity will not reconcile us to the doctrine that God is the proponent of sin in a scheme of things , and as such has decreed it and its accomplishment , and then , as an indispensable adjunct , necessitated it in the volitions of his creatures . It would be far wiser to take a lesson or two from conscience here , as this is essentially a moral question , and the solution of it practically in and of our convictions every time we sin . No one has ever introverted his attention at such a time , without the * System of Divinity-Decrees. // unequivocal conviction that , in this , he is outside of a Divine economy , and counter to all Divine will and purpose respecting him . He would himself be shocked to think that he was then fulfillino ' a Divine decree concerning him , and obeying a b Divine arrangement for its execution , and , moreover , that this was all he could do in the premises . If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprehend that this is it . For ourselves we prefer one that can be preached , and to take counsel of that of " the fteling8 , " it that of the " intellect " must be so lame and nngodlike . We scarcely know how to sympathize with those who find so much difficulty with the theology of sin . Perhaps we have had more experience of sin than they have . We would hope so for their sake . For ourselves we view it as wholly a wrong seed - that it stands out in a plan of its own , and a plane of its own , and has about the relation to the economy of God , that rebellion has to the strategy of a state , and that while intelligence is and must be capable of it , and moral government inherently liable to it , as its abuse and perversion , it is no way of God , that it is in no sense according to the will of God , or has his consent or purpose in its behalf , or that it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the contrary , " His will is our sanctification , " and that God sustains none but antagonistical relations to sin and wrong in every respect , and that he is taking the best methods of the Infinite to subdue and overcome it and instruct the universe out of it as a real dualism in finite cause . We have here the first truths of reason as well as the gist and spirit of Revelation , and we get a theology that can be preached , that the conscience endorses , and that does not outrage its convictions of what must be the being , and perfections , and work , and way of God . Whatever else is true , we think this is , and that , based on the principles of truth , it will be found to justify itself in the light of all well balanced investigation that may be made respecting it in the future , while it is free from the insuperable objections of the scheme which makes God the proponent of wrong , and constitutes sin an integral element in the Divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view we oppose is virtually snrrendered in tke explanations of its friends concerning it . Its " necessity " is resolved into a mere " certainty , " but how the one becomes a correlate or synonym of the other is not so well shown , and though this seems to be an advance in the right direction , yet its meaning is not fully obvious . It can not be intended to refer to an existent volition and reduce itself to the insignificant proposition that what is , is . It is prospective in its aim , and would make sure the future of our voluntary history and describe its law , and constitute that law , in the doctrine of motive influences on the will . And then to make that doctrine efficacious for its theological intent , that influence must be a Divine method , in the interest of and to insure a Divine government , and the carrying out of a Divine programme , in our voluntary history , and to give a Divine control in it , as being that which God has ordained , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the aim of the distinguished men already quoted , and it is necessary to the validity of the scheme . We regret to say that it was an integral element in the great work of " Edwards on the Will . " But it forgets that the mind is a " causa causans , " - that it has in itself a real personality and control of its voluntary states ,  --  that it is a power in itself and capable of resisting any force of motives thus imposed , and , of course , of breaking up any scheme of thin&amp;*s thus devised ,  --  that Propensity is no authorized law of choice , and that no constraint of wrong can apologize for it , or place us beyond the power awl obligation of right action . Derived intelligence is made in the image of its author , capable of originating its voluntary states , on a plan of movement and progress which is its own and not another 's . Self-origination of plan and style and parts of voluntary movement is essenial to all personality . God has his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we shall be slow to conclude that the converse of this is true , and that the plan of each is that of all , and that the plans of all the apostate spirits of earth and hell are , also , that of God for them . " For my thoughts are not your thoughts , nor your ways my ways , " saith the Lord . But if only a certain futuri // tion of volition is intended by the necessity scheme , then what is to be understood by that ? Of the future we know very little , and with all the power of forecast , that the experience of the ages or our own has given , we are often sadly disappointed in respect to the conduct and course of men . God knows all , always from the intuitions of his own infinite mind , and is competent from the resources and prerogatives of his own infinite being to bring out , in mercy and in judgment , a final result , glorious to himself and to the principles of all righteousness , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a step further , and acknowledge that derived iutelligence is a power in its sphere in the sense that its author is ,  --  that it is self-acting from the resources of its own interior and essential being , in view of the elements and grounds of choice , within its reach , competent always for right action , and intelligently responsible for its course ,  --  self-sustamed and approved in all right action , and self-convicted and self-humiliated for all sin , as that which is needless and unnecessary as well as hurtful and wrong ,  --  that the method and government of God is a perfect righteousness , and his influence and will and purpose for a perfect rectitude and virtue , in those " created in his image , " and his end , a holy , happy universe in his love and likeness-that all other and else than this in the moral sphere is not of him-that he is filling the universe with motives and incentives to love and obey him , and furnishing none to the contrary , and no excuse for sin , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all into subjection , in mercy and judgment and will , " until all his enemies be put under his feet , "  --  the " righteous shine as the stars in the firmament , " and " God be all in all . " Doing this , we should not feel much disposed , as we certainty should be under no nece88ity to complain . But our limits are up and we here close , comurnending this whole subject to the careful study of those who would seize on the true hineamnerits of the Divine government , mind of the intelligent accountability of man .
