NEW MONTHLY MAGAZINE . No . CXJX. - APR1L , 1860. - VoL . XX . * , , THE IRON REGION OF NEW JERSEY . OF the thousands who annually traverse the State of New Jersey between Jersey City and Trenton , and pass hundreds of miles farther by rail or boat in search of the picturesque and beautiful , few are conscious that they are passing by , and leaving behind them , one of the most charming and attractive regions of our country range . Form- Entered according to Act of Cougres* , in the year 1800 , by Harper awl llrothers , in the Clerk 's Office of the District Court for the Southern District of New York . // ing their ideas of the whole State from that tame and uninteresting portion of it through which they ride by rail , they are excusable , perhaps , for the thought that Nature has done but little for her in the way of adornment . Beyond that low range of hills , however , which hounds the tourist 's western horizon for nearly the entire distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all those charms which , at the cost of so much time and toil , lie seeks in other States and Territories far away . To such as are content to bask in the glorious beauties of Nature 's own domain , without regard to the luxurious adjuncts of fashionable life , the Highland region of New Jersey presents a field whose harvests are ample and wide-spread , and will richly repay the garnering . The student of Nature may here find her in all her wild sublimity , as well as in her gentler moods , wooing him to enjoy her various phases . Here , too , for the contemplative man , are relics of a by-gone prosperity , and foot-prints of the ' great men who have left their names upon our country 's page . To the practical man of science the vast ore-beds and mineral deposits of this region afford a rich fund of interesting and profitable research , while he of the rod and gun , the lover of a jolly laugh , will find his reward in the game and fish which abound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stud the valleys on every hand , and in the " characters " he meets among the natives . Into this attractive region plunged , in last October , one Neutral Tint , a tired artist in search of relaxation from a long period of close applica tion . We find him , at seven o'clock in the morning of the first day of that beautiful autumn month , on the piazza of a tavern in the town of Paterson , seeking information concerning the stage-coach which was to take him and his companion to Newfoundland and the mountains . His comrade was a younger brother , who , although a bit of an artist in his way , was a still more ardent disciple of Izaak Walton . Tint hustled Snell out of his warm bed early this frosty morning , and after a walk about the Falls returned to the tavern in time to find the coach just ready to start , and every seat , both inside and outside , taken . They were constrained , therefore , to take up their position on the top , surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apples , a side of pork , boxes both great and small , strings of onions , baskets and baudhoxes , with a long and tedious ride of five hours before them . They solaced themselves , however , with the idea that their elevated perch would enable them to enjoy the scenery , and made themselves as comfortable as the circumstances would admit , determined to extract sweetness from the bitterest root . The road lay through a very interesting country , diversified into bill and plain , lake and river , attractive to the eye but perhaps monotonous in the description ; and we hasten forward to the termination of their trip at Brown 's hospitable tavern at Newfoundland , where they arrived about three o'clock in the afternoon , tired and hungry . A bountiful dinner served to refresh their inner man and put them in good-humor ; and casting about for wherewithal to employ the ON THE ROAD . // balance of the day , they were informed by " mine host " that " at Clinton , about a mile up the road , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who had seen it . " Following the direction given them , they soon found themselves in a by-road or lane , which led through the woods to the old forge . It was one of those glorious autupmal days which are peculiar to our northern climate . The clouds , piled up in fleecy masses , were driven athwart the heavens as though they were the chariots of the gods engaged in an Olympian contest of speed , and their ragged shadows , gliding over the vales and climbing the hill-sides with a silent , yet steady march , produced an ever-varying succession of brilliant effects , and heightened the gorgeous colors in which Nature had arrayed the forests and fields . The song of birds , the monotonous hum of insects , the lowing of cattle , or the " watch-dog 's honest bark , " were the only sounds that disturbed the silence of the woods . Pursuing their way along the narrow road , which was almost shut in by the growth of saplings on either side , our companions became conscious of a new note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had increased to more than a hint of its presence they came out upon an open space where stood a number of dilapidated buildings on the border of a calm little lake or pond . Hastening forward with rapid steps , they leaped out upon an old flume , and found themselves standing at the edge of a precipice of some thirty or forty feet in height , over which the water was pouriug into a gloomy gulf below . Here was Nature in all her wild magnificence , with just enough of art to show the superior beauty of the former , and heighten the interest of the scene . On either side the rocks towered up with precipitous faces , showing , by their lines of stratification , that in some terrible convulsion they had been rent asunder , leaving at the upper end of the gorge thus made a detached mass of an irregular shape , over which the water must at some time have poured in immense volume , carrying in its embrace huge boulders , which now lie supine in the bed of the stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both above and below , are numerous " pockets , " or natural basins , which have been worn by boulders that have lodged in seams , and after having been whirled about for centuries perhaps , by the rush THE UPPEE FAaL , AT CLINTON . // of waters , have worn their way thr6ugh or been carried over the dam . The old dam and flume , long since fallen into disnse and decay , serve to render the scene more picturesque and interesting . After enjoying the view from their elevated stand-point for a time , our friends sought a position from which to inspect it from below . This , from the nature of the ground and the position of the buildings , they found was no easy matter , and in making the wide circuit necessary to accomplish their object they stumbled upon another fall , more , artificial than the one they had just seen , but little less picturesque . This was situated at a point where the stream dashed and foamed over the upheaved ends of the underlying rocks , across which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decay , served rather to scatter the water into several channels than to concentrate it into an unbroken sheet . Here also was evidence , in huge pieces of timber and trunks of trees , that at times the waters had flowed over the dam with irresistible force and power . Not more than a hundred feet further down the stream was another fall , by far the most interesting and picturesque of the three . To obtain a view of this they were compelled to make another wide circuit , and , forcing their way through a dense underbrush , clamber down the face of the rocks . Now slipping on the soft , yielding bed of leaves with which they were covered , now aiding each other , and , swinging from branch to branch , and springing from shelf to shelf , not without difficulty and danger , they found themselves at length upon the broad face of a shelving rock at the lower side of a basin some fifty or sixty feet across , and in view of n most charming cascade . It seemed that Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those little gems of beauty so attractive Tea aowau FALL , AT CLInTON . // antly bade it adieu , determined to renew the visit at a future time . As they turned to depart they became conscions of the presence of a third party , who , perched upon a spur of projecting rock , was quietly contemplating them with much apparent curiosity . He was a tall , gaunt specimen of humanity , measuring upward of six feet in length-had he stood erect-and , although of a powerful frame , every particle of sap in his system had been dried up by the combined effect of the weather and " Jersey lightning , " giving him the appearance of a pine knot , gnarled and tough . His costume was as singular as his figure , and hung upon him " like a shirt upon a bean-pole . " Hank-for that , our friends afterward discovered , was the sobriquet of their new acquaintance-was curious and inquisitive , and , in his own estimation , very shrewd and cunning . His curiosity had been excited by seeing two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forge and the adjacent water-power , and his mind jumped at once to the conclusion that they had ulterior objects in so to the eye of the poet and painter , and hidden it away in the woods to preserve it sacred to her worshipers . It was indeed a shrine worthy of her , and he who could gaze upon it without emotions of delight must he insensible to the first elements of beauty . To Tint there was something of an old acquaintance in its features , and it was not long ere he recognized in it one of those cabinet pictures which have made the name of Cropsey so familiar and so famous . The basin , which seemed scooped out expressly to receive the water which poured over the precipitous face of a perpendicular wall of rock some twenty-five feet in height , was semicircular in form , and shut in on all sides by a dense growth of underbrush , interspersed with tall trees , whose majestic forms leaned over to admire their own wild and rugged shapes in the calm mirror below . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spattering and sparkling over its rocky bed into a gloomy ravine , hastening to regain the time lost in dalliance with the sunlight , and eventually windjn* throurh soft meadows to lose itself in the hroader*hut less romantic Pequannock . Our friends lingered over the quiet charms of this attractive spot until the lengthening shadows warned them to return , when they reluct // doing . He therefore saluted and entered into conversation with them , and-thanks to his own happy method of drawing out a secret and Tint 's communicative disposition-he soon learned that they were looking about the place with the view of purchasing and re-establishing the mills on an enlarged scale , which would , of course , give employment to a great number of hands , and make the country round about " bloom and blossom like the rose . " Hank 's mind was immediately filled with visions of the good time coming , in which he saw himself at least foreman of the rolling-mill-in which , by-the-way , he had been formerly employed  --  and his obsequiousness to his prospective employers increased in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelers learned that , in times hy-gone , the neighborhood , now so silent and gloomy , was the seat of a thriving business and an industrious population . Nature had afforded an invaluable power which had been turned to use , and forges and mills gave employment to numerous families , residing in the vicinity , who , in turn , benefited the farmers by using their produce ; and thus , in manufacturing the ore from the neighboring mountains , Clinton forge was the source of general prosperity in a considerable tract of country . Alas ! the day came when the Government saw fit to pursue a " more liberel policy ; " iron from abroad could be sold at Clinton cheaper than it could be manufactured there , and work ceased , lawsuits came , the property changed hands , and what was once the seat of a thri*y establishment is now nothing more than an interesting ruin , the abode of bats and owls . The few families who remain in the neighborhood eke out a miserable subsistence by tilling the inhospitable soil and burning charcoal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our friends did not get rid of their new acquaintance until they arrived at the door of their inn , and then only on a promise to come , bright and early in the morning , to guide them to Green Pond , Snell having dropped a hint in GREEN POND . suowmme. muPpiNe. // regard to fish and fishing-that subject being ever uppermost in his thoughts . They were destined to be disappointed , however , as the day proved stormy , and the forenoon was whiled *way in that most gloomy of all gloomy places , the bar-room of a country tavern on a rainy day . Tint finished up his sketches , while Snell flayed back*ammon with a dummy . " Euchre " and " seven up " were essayed and voted a bore , conversation flagged , and when every resource failed Such vowed he was " going fishing . " Hunting up Hank , who was lounging around the stable confiding to Pete the hostler the important information which he had acquired the day previous , he ascertained from him that a small stream ran through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might find some brook trout . Acting upon this hint , the trio were soon on their road up the valley , armed with all the implements for such occasions made and provided , and attired in a costume which would have defied the scrutiny of the most lynx-eyed of New York detectives , even Walling himself ; said costume having been mainly furnished by " mine host " Brown . They followed the course of the stream down the valley , occasionally adding to the contents of their baskets , until they found themselves encompassed with thick woods , with underbrush so compact and matted together as to preclude the possibility of making a cast , even if any tempting holes had presented themselves . The stream , however , now ran over a bed of soft , oozy mud , and the soil beneath their feet was of the same unctuous character . Still they struggled on , hoping to find better ground , hut becoming more and more entangled . Tint finally declared his intention to " strike for the upland . " In doing so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , and in a few moments found themselves in an open space of bog meadow containing about three acres , and completely surrounded by the woods . To cross this it was necessary to leap from hog to hog , balancing themselves with their rods like tight-rope dancers , a performance not so very easily accomplished , clothed as they were . Occasionally one or the other would slip and sink knee-deep into the mud between the bogs , and scramble up again to renew the effort to reach the other side of the meadow . Their disgust was intense to find the same soft , slimy soil before them at the farther boundary of the swamp . Three times they crossed and recrossed this space , in as many directions , in their efforts to find an egress-a work of no small labor when we consider that the bogs were breast-high , and were covered with a dense growth of bog grass equally as high . They were obliged to feel their way with their poles ; and just as Tint , for the third time , THE KINO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had reached the confines of their prison-for such it seemed to be-Such , in making a leap , slipped and broke his in twain . Scrambling up again to a sound footing , they stood for a moment gazing upon each other with countenances upon which despair was written in capital letters . To add to the interesting nature of their situation , it was now raining in torrents , and they recalled the fact that they had been cautioned against getting into the swamps , as the deadly rattlesnake , and still more fatal " pilot , " were frequently found in those localities . Finding no encouragement in each other 's 1u guhrious countenances , like rats driven into a corner , they simultaneously , and with a desperation which frequently accomplishes what we would not under other circumstances undertake , made a dash through a group of dense alder bushes and briers , which offered the only feasible way , and after a few moments ' struggle had the satisfaction of standing upon firm ground again , not , however , without many an envious rent in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wet to their skins . The highway was soon gained , and then commenced an exciting race for the tavern , over a mile distant . Greater feats of pedestrianism were performed on that da.y than ever Gilderslceve or Staunard attempted , and were rewarded by the plaudits of fair ladies who , from the windows of the parlor , witnessed the struggle for nearly the 1&lt; whole distance . Imagine the feelings of our * friends as they stood once more on the piazza , F looking as though they had been drawn through * . hosse-pond , covered with mud , their garments in tatters , every fold discharging a stream of wrytei , which gathered in puddles at their feet , and a hevy of bright eyes criticising their appearance f I cau not describe them . The next morning dawned bright and beautiful and our friends were early astir , enjoying the ich landscape with which they were surrounded on every side . The location of the tavern was indeed a charming one , being at the entrance of a valley which was hounded on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commencement of what is called the Green Pond Mountain , while a lower range of wooded hills shuts it in toward the south . Between lay the valley , checkered with patches of cultivated land , meadows , and woods , which , under the influence of the coming sunlight , presented a scene replete with beauty . Behind the house the valley sank into rich meadow-land , through which ran a sparkling stream , crossed here and there by rustic bridges , the plain being bounded , right and left , by gently undulating hills , while the dim distance was marked by the outlines of rolling mountains whose tops were bathed in sunlight . By the time that Tint had made a sketch of some of the most attractive features of the view from the top of the bluff in front of the tavern , they were recalled to the house by the resounding breakfast bell , and descended from their lofty eyrie to satisfy the cravings of the inner man . After breakfast they were introduced by mine host to two new-comers , who had arrived the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their future plans . The first was a Doctor C , of Rockaway , whose professional avocations bad called him into the neighborhood , and who , being belated , had stopped overnight . The second was a young German friend of his , who had accompanied him for a ride , and whose name , here , is Fritz . A short drive of three miles brought them to the " Green Lake House , " on the borders of Green Pond , and as the day was a delightful // qwq IETELhIOIL OF AnIT-swEan 's MINE .

The atmosphere of this mountain region is delightfully bracing ; and on this charming October morning there was a crispness about it which gave a joyous elasticity to the spirits , and our friends enjoyed its invigorating influences to the fullest extent . The trees and shrubs were clothed in all the hues of the rainbow , and their leaves , still covered with frost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparkled in his rays as though they were loaded with gems . The greater portion of the landscape was covered with a dense foliage , with just a sufficient amount of cultivated land to prevent monotony ; and the bright scarlet hues of the buckwheat fields , the rich yellow tones of the shocks of corn contrasting with the sombre shadows of some of the hill ranges , with here and there a sheet of water reflecting the light and looking like a mirror in a parterre of flowers , presented altogether a scene calculated to fill the mind with pleasurable emotions , and wake the soul to songs of joy , praise , and thanksgivings to the great and beneficent Author of so much beauty and splendor . A drive of some four or five miles brought the party to a secluded and romantic valley , in which they passed several rude cabins , constructed , in the most primitive style , of logs and slabs chinked with mud , and each surrounded by a cabbage garden , in which a doubtful struggle for supremacy was going on between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge that spanned the Hibernia brook , the Doctor called attention to the ruins of an old mill whose blackened and worm-eaten timbers proclaimed its antiquity , as the forge which was worked by Lord Stirling during the Revolutionary war , where many of the Hessian prisoners taken at Trenton were employed in casting balls for the use of the army . Just as the Doctor had pointed out , on the face of the mountain to the leit , the various openings of the ilibernia mines , an individual was seen approaching from one of the log-cabins hy the side of the road , holding up his right hand , which was hound up with cloths , to attract their attention . He proved to he one of the miners who had met with an accident the day previous , hywhich he had crushed three of his fingers so badly as to render amputation necessary . The poor wretch had given himself up to drink , and was hut one step removed from delirium tremens . This was an unlooked-for episode , hut the Doctor yielded to the calls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend to the case , Tint occupied himself in sketching the old forge and other points of interest . In the course of an hour the poor miner 's hand had been duly doctored , the horses were secured to a neighboring tree , and our friends had scramhled up the mountain to the entrance of one of the mines which are now in operation . Before entering the mine let us sit down here upon this huge boulder with the Doctor , and from this elevated stand-point get an intelligible idea of the location and nature of the metalliferous deposits , the working of which we are about to witness . If you consult a map of the State of New Jersey , you will find that the highland region is composed of a series of mountain ranges , which are a continuation of the highlands of the lower portion of the State of New York . The ridges are not continuous and parallel , but are of short duration , rising at their northeastern terminations with a gentle ascent , while their southwestern terminations are abrupt and sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an elevating power in the direction of northeast to southwest , together with a lateral power acting from the southeast to northwest , are apparent throughout the entire // region . Take a large volume , and , laying its back upon the map in the diraction of the mountain ranges , inclining it at an angle of 450 toward the northwest , imagine some twenty leaves in the centre of the hook to he iron ore , and you *vi1l have a tolerably correct idea of the situation , direction , and dip of the metalliferous veins , which correspond , of course , with the direction and dip of the rocks with which they are connected . The metal lies in veins varying in thickness from three feet to eighty feet , the average ranging from six to ten feet . Oftentimes it is found in successive strata , overlapping each other and outcropping at the surface , although its exposnre is generally of a limited extent on account of its pitch beneath the superincumbent rocks . The outcrop of the ore generally occurs on the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To a person thoroughly conversant with the geology of the region , and the nature of the deposits in those localities that have been worked , the overlapping rocks-which possess the same general characteristics for a considerable distance-will serve as a guide . The surveyor 's compass is , however , the most frequent means made use of to discover the presence of a deposit of ore , which , being of a highly magnetic character , attracts the needle , and points out the spot where a bed of metal may be found . It does not always indicate the extent of the deposit , however ; for it may be deflected powerfully where there is but a small amount of ore near the surface , or but weakly where there may be a large body of it at some considerable distance beneath . A deposit of ore having been located , and its probable extent ascertained by means of trial shafts , cross cuttings , boring , etc. , the miner decides as to which of the several modes of working he will adopt to bring the ore to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mineral is in large qnantities , and not at any very great depth , open working is the most simple . In this case the superincumbent earth or rock is taken off , and he proceeds to remove the ore by successive terraces , guarding against the crumbling or falling in of the sides by giving them a proper slope , or by props of timber . Ditches are dug to conduct to the surface the water , which , in rainy weather and in the winter , would inundate the workings . From the nature of the deposit this plan can rarely be followed to any great extent , and underground mining is resorted to . This is conducted by shafts , levels , or sinks , as is found to he most convenient and economical . A reference to the diagram on the next page will convey to the reader 's mind a better idea of these several modes than any other description that could be given . The figure represents a transverse section of a mountain range , running in a northeast and southwest direction . AB is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A , and dipping at an angle of 450 toward the southeast . C is what is called an adit-level cut through the bill from the lowest point in the valley to the vein of ore . Where the distance to be cut is not too great , this is by all odds the best and most economical mode of working , because , after the vein is reached , galleries are cut right and left , and all that portion of the ore between D and A , and ranging to an indefinite extent on either side , may be brought to the surface , and the mine drained , without the use of any power whatever . The cars are run out on the slightly inclined track , and the water is conducted through the // same channel . And when that portion of the ore which lies above the adit is removed , the miner has hut to commence the use of that power which his neighbor , who works a shaft , has been compelled to use from the start . Next in point of economy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In working by this mode the miner commences at the outcrop , and drives his shaft directly down into the deposit , and at various depths makes galleries to the right and left , takes out the ore , as in the former case , and it is brought to the foot of the incline in cars , in which it is drawn to the surface . Formerly the surface ore which was removed in sinking a shaft of this kind was thrown aside as worthless , on account of its admixture with foreign substances , but it is now considered nearly as valuable as the purer ore , the foreign material serving as a flux , which , in smelting the purer ore , has to be supplied . At E is shown a perpendicular shaft , which is sunk through the overlying rock until it strikes the ore bed at D , when a similar course is pursued as in the former cases . In some instances all of these modes of working are in use in a single mine . As we shall visit different localities where these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve further details until we come to describe each . The Hibernia mining tract is situated in Rockaway township , about four miles from the Morris Canal , and embraces the " Beach , " " Lower Wood , " " Glenn , " " Upper Wood , " and " Willis " mines . It outcrops on the surface of a mountain ridge , which , commencing at Hibernia Brook , rises , somewhat abruptly , to a height of nearly four hundred feet , and runs in a northeasterly direction . It is one of the oldest mining tracts in the Highlands , having been worked long anterior to the Revolution , and is now divided into mining lots that derive their names from the persons owning or working them . There are two , and in some places three , separate layers or strata of ore , interstratifled with micaceous or hornblende schists . The location of this deposit is such that it might be most advantageously worked on a large scale by extending the adit-level , which enters at the foot of the hill , or near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the valley might be removed without the expense of machinery for hoisting and pumping ; and as the Morris Canal is fortyseven feet below the entrance of the mine , a gravity road , four miles in length , from the mine to the canal , might be constructed , by which means the cars which are loaded in the mine would discharge their contents into the canalboats destined to convey it to a market at the iron-smelting furnaces of New Jersey and Pennsylvania . Do you ask why it is not done ? " Alas ! " we answer , " the iron of other countries can be manufactured and transported to these regions cheaper than it can be mined and smelted , even with such facilities ; and this mining tract , which might give employment to hundreds of workmen , and be of incalculable benefit to the adjacent country , lapses to decay . The timbers rot , and allow the soil to cave in and fill up the levels ; the water floods the mines , and the works are deserted except semi-occasionally , when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take out a few hundred tons of ore , which are sent to marke't and manufactured ; but by the time he gets well to work the price falls , he can not compete with foreign iron , and is compelled to desist . " Our friends stood at the entrance of an adit of recent formation , and , after procuring candles , proceeded to enter the opening . For a hundred feet or more the ore has been entirely removed from the vein , and the foot and hanging walls are exposed to the light of day , forming what I have been describing as open workings . At the end of this open gallery the vein of ore is distinctly seen lying between the rocks , and dipping at an angle of about sixty degrees . A dark and dismal-looking hole , about six feet square , offered an entrance into the bowels of the earth ; and , sticking their candles into lumps of clay for candlesticks , our friends entered the dark passage . For a short distance the daylight which lighted up the opening enabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track without difficulty ; hut a slight curve soon shut off this advantage , and they found themselves surrounded by a thick , impenetrable darkness , only made more tangible by the flickering light cast by their candles and reflected by the damp walls on either side . It was only by holding their lights low down that they were enabled to pick their way ; and notwithstanding their care , they now and thea stepped into a mud-hole between the sleepers , or bumped their heads against the hanging walls , or against the timbers which stretched across their way . The faint clink of hammers was now heard , becoming more and more audible as they proceeded , until it rang and reverberated all about them , and they were told by their guide to halt and look up . For a few moments they could discern nothing but their own ghastly-looking faces by the light of the candles , and a number of faint specks of light , like glow-worm tapers , far above them . Gradually , however , their eyes began to penetrate the surrounding darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their vision . Standing upon detached pieces of rock , in a pool of water which had collected in A // a basin from which the ore had been removed to too great a ( iepth , they could discern the sombre walls t of tho cavern towerbig up before and behind them , until it was lost in solid blackness ; except in one place where the ore had been taken out too near the surface , and a faint ray of daylight struggled through an opening where the soil had caved in , but soon graduated into the surrounding darkness , as though unable to cope with the monarch which there reigned supreme . To the right was the mass of black ore , rising shelf above shelf in the form of steps , and on each shelf men were dimly seen drilling , picking and prying off the metal , which was pushed down from step to step , as it accumulated , to the bottom , wbere others were engaged in shoveling it into a car that was to A MINER . convey it out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called " stoping " by the miners ; and there are two ways of doing it-one called " overhand , " and the other " underhand stopiug . " In the former the ore is removed from below upward , and in the latter it is removed from above downward . The last is most generally practiced in this region , being considered the most economical . As the ore is removed timbers are inserted , reaching across from wall to wall , and upon these are piled the rubbish and lean ore , ** forming what are called " stulls . " In many of the mines the deposit is so pure that it is removed without leaving sufficient rubbish to support the walls , and so much stoping surface being exposed renders the mines dangerous to the workmen . After our friends had satisfied their curiosity they returned to the outer world by the path . they came , and scrambled up a series of rude steps cut in the rock to a spot where two or three workmen were engaged in getting out " surface ore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some twenty feet long by six wide , and the ore lay exposed , presenting the appearance of a laminated sandstone discolored with oxide of iron . The application of the pick showed it to be very friable , breaking up into cubical pieces about an inch square , some of which were pocketed as specimens . At various distances along the surface of the mountain openings have been made , and a greater or less quantity of ore taken out ; but our party being short of time , and having made up their min&amp; to visit other localities where the operations were carried on upon a larger scale , they did not visit them . After having enjoyed a long " sniff of the rural aspect " from the elevated position which they occupied , they started down the mountain , on their way to the Sweed 's mine , situated on OAaLEEY IN BYIIAiII MINE . // the Morris Canal , about a mile east of the village of Dover . This deposit of ore outcrops on the southeastem slope of a hill , about seventy-five feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is a valuable one , both on account of its proximity to the canal and of the immense quantity and valuable quality of the material obtained . The workings are not deep , but extend six hundred and eighty feet from the inclined plane in one direction , and nearly two hundred feet in the opposite direction . The deepest portion is about two hundred feet below the surface . The thickness of the vein varies , being at some places thirteen feet , at others ten , and again only one and a half feet through . There are two shafts and two adits open to the surface ; the shafts being respectively eighty-five feet , and one hundred and eighty-eight feet deep . They were unfortunate in not finding any one disposed to act as their guide , or explain to them the working of the mine , and were obliged to wander about the surface , picking up such scraps of information as they could gather from the workmen , some of whom they met with at the top , taking out surface ore with a kibble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welldiggers carry on their operations . A very limited idea of a mine can be formed , of course , from the operations carried on upon the surface , and they were anxious to descend into the shafts ; but the agent being absent , and a request to one of the foremen being met with a surly refusal , they were oblie , ed to content themselves with a view of the exterior , except a short trip into one of the adits . Descending the hill in the direction of the canal , they came upon a solitary miner who , with the assistance of a boy about thirteen years old , was washing lean ore at the mouth of a hole in the side of the hill which was timbered up , and out of which the water that he was using ran . Upon inquiry , they learned that this was the opening of an adit which led in to the vein of ore , and that the water was that which was pumped up from the bottom of the mine to this level , and here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to a peculiar rumbling sound that came from the bowels of the earth , and which appeared to come nearer and nearer , they were startled by the apparition of a head with a pair of long ears attached , issuing from the aforesaid hole , which head was immediately followed by the body of a jack attached to a car loaded with ore . Having *io driver , they were curious to watch his operations , and saw him proceed very methodically along the windings of the track to the dock-a distance of one or two hundred yards-where the car was discharged by workmen into a canal-boat  --  and then as methodically turn about and return into the mine . Getting the miner to furnish them with a candle , they waited the forthcoming of the mule , and as soon as he made his appearance in the outer air they started to enter . The mouth of the adit was about five feet high and about three feet wide , allowing just space enough for the car and mule to pass . The timbers looked very much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after passing in about twenty feet they came to what had been another 8TJ*FACE WOflK8 AT TU1* mcaEaBoN Mtaa . XTOL . XX. - No. 11*. -P p // adit , running off to the right , the timbers of which had been crushed in ; here they were called upon to contemplate the fate which would have befallen any unlucky wight who might have happened to be under the mass of earth and rock that now filled the opening . Hurrying along by the light of their solitary flickering " dip " to get out of the way of the returning mule , Tint suddenly became conscious of the presence of more stars than were ever supposed to exist in the firmament above , and found himself on his hands and knees in a puddle of water between the sleepers , and in total darkness . His first thought upon returning consciousness was that the mine had caved in , and that he had been hurried before his time into that region which is not to be named to ears polite ; but as no very suiphurous odor saluted his nostrils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his answering call that they were vet on , or at least near , the surface , he gathered himself up and endeavored to regain his candle . *t appeared that , in his too great haste to avoid the incoming team , he had forgotten the limited height of the passage , and had struck his head a severe blow against one of the overs tretching timbers , which had knocked him off his feet and extinguished the light . Here was a dilemma I The sound of the wheels of the car on the track warned them that the mule was already returning ; and to go onward seemed desperate . They , however , concluded to feel their way along , and , as a last resource , to try and stop the enemy in their rear . Fortunately they had not proceeded far before they discovered a faint gleam of light in front of them ; and in a moment more , guided by its ray , they found themselves in a space about six or eight feet square , and at the mouth of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been removed from the vein above the point where they stood to apoint as near to the surfi*ce as it was safe , and it was now being taken out below the adit , and brought up to this point in cars which were drawn out by the mule . A miner stood here for the purpose of shifting the ears-sending the empty ones down the incline , and those containing the ore out of the adit . Our friends had scarcely reached their stand-point , and recognized in the dim , uncertain gloom the solitary individual whose time seemed only compnted by the transit of the cars , and whose monotonous employment was but seldom relieved by the advent of visitors , ere the mule passed them , and running his empty vehicle upon a rude turntable , in a hole which had been cut into the solid rock , turned it about and stood ready for another trip . The chain which raised the cars from the depths below ran upon rollers fixed in the foot wall up to the surface , where it was wound upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action was reversed by means of a long rod within the miner 's reach . Being informed by him that it was contrary to orders to allow visitors to descend the plane , our friends followed their long-eared guide to the surface again ; and their curiosity being satisfied for the time being , they returned to Dover . The next morning the Doctor drove them over to Lake Hopatcong , where they spent the day , returning at evening with their baskets filled with fish , trophies of their skill ; and the day following they paid a visit to Budd 's Lake , where they were equally rewarded for their time and patience . It was not until the morning of the third day after their visit to Sweed 's Mine that they were prepared to visit the Byram and Dickerson mines , which are located between two and three miles southwest of Dover , on Mine Hill , or Mount Ferrum . They had formed the acquaintance of Mr. Henry Byram , the son of the proprietor of the Byram Mine , at Dover , and were prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home . As they contemplated spending the day the horses were put out , and the party started on a prospecting tour . The Byram is one of thirty or more mines which are worked on this metalliferous belt of the IRingwood , Copperas , Split-rock , Hibernia , Mount Hope , Mount Pleasant , and Mount Ferrum mountain range , extending northeast and southwest over thirty miles of country . The dip of this vein varies in different mines , being at an angle of 50* at this one , while its thickness averages about six feet . It is more regular in this respect than most of the deposits of this belt , although it is very much dislocated by faults or " offsets . " The geologist will , of course , readily understand this term ; but to the unscientific reader it may be necessary to explain that a fault is created by a crevice or split in the body of the mountain , caused , probably , by some terrible convulsion of nature , by which the continuity of the stratification is severed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distances . The accompanying horizontal diagram of this mine will convey this idea clearly to the reader 's mind . Looking down upon a section of the mountain , there appear to be six of those crevices or faults ( a , b , c , d , e , f ) by which the ore-bed is set off to various distances-in one case fourteen feet . There are three slopes , or inclined planes , sunk into the vein , two of which are not now worked . The third is a new slope that has been sunk a distance of two hundred feet in depth , from which the ore is being taken by a horse-whim at present , although a beautiful 40-horse-power engine is in the course of erection . After visiting the engine-houses , pump-house , and the various other surface-works , extending oFFSaTs2 // over a considerable extent of ground , they approached the opening of the new slope , which they proposed to descend to inspect the operations underground . In passing over the ground Byram seemed to be at some pains to point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidental breaking of chains , by which they had been allowed to descend to the bottom of the slope with tremendous force , in one instance resulting in the death of two miners who were unfortunately in their way . This was done , however , not with any idea of inducing them to desist from going down the slope , hut simply with the view of making the descent more interesting . Arrived at the mouth of the slope , Tint looked down , and could see a faint speck of light , like a solitary star on a dark night , and could bear occasional sharp discharges , accompanied by rolling reverberations , not unlike the sound of artillery echoing among the mountains . The appearance of this hole was exceedingly " pokerish , " and Tint half regretted having expressed a wish to enter it , although he kept his thoughts to himself ; and one of the empty cars being about to descend , he prepared to enter it in company with Snell , who , whatever were his sentiments , had maintained an owl-like silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six inches wide , and as many deep . Snell entered first , and crouching down in the front of it on his knees , held on to the side with one hand , while in the other he held a dip candle stuck in n lump of clay . Tint took his position , with his heels resting on the hack end of the floor of the *ar ( that end being open ) , and held on to the sides . Just as they were about to start he inquired of Mr. B. how he was going down . " Oh ! I am going down afoot and alone , unless the Doctor will accompany me , " said he . But the Doctor was very busy examining some specimens of ore , and desired to remain on the surface . " What ! you do n't pretend to say that you are going down that plane , at an angle of 500 , two hundred and fifty feet , on foot ? " said Tint . " Certainly , " repliedByram ; " nothing is easier . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and to show how easily it was done , he ran down a short distance and returned . Tint watched him , and saw that the sleepers of the track formed excellent steps by which to ascend and descend , and concluded , as it was so easy , he would himself go down in that way . He was overruled by Mr. B. , however , who pointed out how much safer and more comfortably they would descend in the car ; and he resumed his place , squatting like a toad to keep his head clear of the timbers , and the word was given to start . For twenty-five feet or more the track curved gently from the platform on which the cars were emptied to the grade , and the vehicle moved smoothly along until it reached a point where the actual descent began , when , as if preconcerted , the driver chirruped to the horse , who started off on a trot , the chains rattled as they ran off the whim , and the car commenced a suddenly accelerated speed down the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the reader suppose that our friends are cowardly , or even timorous , but there are some things and some occasions which " Make cowards of us alL " It is not surprising , therefore , that for an instant he should have felt a tremor of fear as the car suddenly sprang forward down the slope , and was disposed to leap clear of it and cling to the timbers on the side of the plane . The feeling was bat momentary , however , and , as the descent became more regular and uniform , lie rather enjoyed the novelty of it . They were again startled out of their propriety , when , having descended about one hundred and fifty feet , the bottom of the car leaped up very suddenly from the track , and struck the wall above them with a bump which threw Snell back upon his companion and upset the latter out upon the track . They were restored to their equanimity by the uproarious laughter which greeted their accident ; and as soon as they could pick themselves up , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had arrived at the mouth of a gallery running off to the right of the track , and the car had run upon a turntable at the entrance thereof . By the light of several candles they discovered their friend , Byram , who had preceded them , surrounded by three or four miners , who seemed highly amused at the result of their seeming accident . Upon entering the gallery they were cautioned to be careful where they trod , else they might descend to the bottom of the mine rather more rapidly than might be pleasant . Examining rather more closely their footing , they found that they were standing upon a " stull " which had been formed by timbers placed between the foot and hanging wall , on which the lean ore had been piled , and on this a track had been laid to a breast which was being driven some one hundred and fifty feet distant from the plane . In this stall , at various places , the rubbish had fallen through between the timbers , leaving large and seemingly very dangerous apertures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall through ; yet the miners pass back and forth along the gallery , by the dim light of their candles , with great apparent carelessness . All of the operations or " workings " at this mine are carried on by means of inclined shafts sunk into the vein of ore on the plane of its dip , by which method all of the material raised to the suiface is marketable . In commencing his operations on this plan , the miner , after removing the soil , opens a well , or " sink , " from six to eight feet square , from which he removes the ore , generally by means of a windlass and kibble or tub , until he reaches a depth of thirty or thirty-five feet . This done ; he puts in a gang of men who commence to take off the ore from the side of the well at about twenty feet from the surface , and , after they have worked off about ten feet , another gang is put in who commence about five or six feet below , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are put in , who follow each other , keeping always about the same distance apart and below each other . This is called " driving a breast , " and the method of doing it is called " stoping . " When the last gang have worked away from the bottom of the well some distance , a gang is put into the " sink , " who drive it down thirty or forty feet deeper ; and other gangs are set to work to drive another breast . A horse-whim is erected , a track laid down , and the ore is now drawn up in cars . When the first breast is driven to a distance from the well or shaft , a stull is formed , as before explained , a track is laid upon it , upon which the cars containing the ore are run ont to the shaft , and , by means of a turn-table , are shifted upon the track in the shaft and raised to the surface . This turn-table is a simple platform hinged to the hanging-wall and raised at pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lower gallery . The second series of gangs work off all the ore from the bottom of the sink up to the first stull or gallery , and thus the breasts are driven to the right or left of the shaft , or both , as the case may be , as far as circumstances or the rights and privileges of the miner will allow . Masses of rock are frequently met with by the miners , penetrating the mass of ore , parallel to the walls , and are termed " horsers " or " horses , " from some fancied resemblance to the back of that animal . Our friends were conducted by their guide , Mr. B. , along the gallery on which they stood , to the stopes where the miners were at work driving the breast . They were obliged to creep cautiously along for fear of the man-traps in the stull , bending low down on account of the timbers . A short distance from the shaft they met a car filled with ore and propelled by one of the miners , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot wall and hold on by the timbers until it passed . The motive-power of this machine was a young man , black , grimed , and greasy , from a small oil lamp which he carried secured in his cap or turban , and which , from the position he assumed in pushing the car forward , threw a faint light upon the track just before him , the sleepers of which furnished him with a foot-hold . Arrived at the stopes , they witnessed a scene similar to that already described at the Hibernia mine . As at that place , the ore had been taken out rather too close to the surface , and , in consequence thereof , about half an acre of one of the miners ' cabbage-gardens had slid into the mine , leaving an immense hole open to the daylight . Fortunately the accident had occurred at a time when the workmen were at dinner , and no one was injured . As the miners were about to fire a blast our friends returned to the shaft , where they entered a car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the mine , where a gang of men were at work in the sink , and others on stopes , to the right and left of the shaft . Having spent an hour or more in inspecting the various operations going on in the mine our friends prepared to return to the surface , but just as they were about to enter a car for that purpose , three or four of the dirt-begrimed miners stepped forward and claimed their " footing . " As they had heretofore overlooked this time-honored custom of " paying the shot , " the demand was met in a liberal spirit , and , taking their places in the car , the word was given , and they began the ascent of nearly two hundred and fifty feet . At this moment two sharp discharges rang upon their ears , followed by rolling reverberations , which were repeated hgain and again as the sounds reached the several breasts , and being thus returned to the ear , produced upon that organ an effect similar to a severe and close clap of thunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all the awe-inspiring wonders of the place still lingering in their minds , our friends reached the surface and stepped upon the platform whence they had started , glad once more to breathe the fresh air of heaven , and have its blue canopy above them . Tint found an elevated point from which to make a sketch of the works , on the top of a miner 's cabin , while the Doctor and Snell visited various interesting objects in the vicinity . In this way the forenoon was passed , and after dinner the party walked over to the Dickerson Mine , about half a mile distant . This is said to be the oldest mine in Morris County , the land , together with the mine , being " *IVINC A BREAST . " A TURN-TABLE. // taken up by Joseph Kirkbride , in 1713 ; previous to which time the ore was free to all . For a long time the only means of conveying the ore to the various forges and furnaces for manufacture was in leathern or canvas bags , on the backs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey , purchased the property in 1807 , and worked the mine up to the time of his death . Soon after that event the Dickerson Suckasunny Mining Company became its owners , and are now prosecuting the*vorkings . The deposit outcrops on the surface of a hill which runs in a northeasterly and southwesterly direction . The vein dips at an angle of about 500 , and is , in some places , thirty feet thick . In others it is not more than three feet in thickness . The ore is very pure , being upward of 83 per cent . iron , and is composed of a very pulverulent although closely compacted mixture of small angular grains of magnetic iron ore , or magnetite , with small round granules of phosphate of lime or apatite . Such ore is called " shot ore " by the miners , from its crumbling easily into small fragments , from the size of a small shot to that of a large pea . The mine is at present worked hy means of a perpendicular shaft , which is sunk through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it strikes the vein , and the kibbles or iron tubs which are used for hoisting the ore , from that point descend on the foot wall to the bottom of the mine , where they are loaded from the cars which are used in the galleries . The view of this mine shows the group of buildings covering the engine , pump , and shaft , and also the opening into that portion of the vein of ore which lies above the surface . The descent into the mine is accomplished hy means of ladders and steps cut in the rock and ore , through an opening made by the caving in of a portion of the soil ; but as it neither offered any new experiences nor presented any very attractive features , our friends were content with a peep down the shaft and a visit to the various buildings , including the residence of the agent of the Company , Mr. Canfield , whose scientific taste has adorned its walls with one of the finest mineralogical ana entomological collections to he found in this country . In their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile of ore containing four thousand five hundred tons , ecery pound of which had been broughtfrom the mouth of the shaft to the place where it lay-waiting a market - on a railroad track which was laid with English iron . The distance from this mine and the others in its immediate vicinity , to the Morris Canal  --  the great channel of communication with the manufacturing establishments of Pennsylvania and New Jersey-is between one and a half and three miles ; yet it would not pay to convey the ore to market . Our friends , after inspecting the various points of interest about the mine , spent the balance of the afternoon in conversation with Mr. C. , in examining his beautiful cabinets , and in admiring the charming view from the top of his residence , which embraced a wide extent of country in every direction . Returning to Mr. Byram 's in time for tea , they spent the evening in arranging for the morrow a trip to the complete and extensive furnaces and mills at Boonton , about nine miles east of Dover . Having witnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were desirous of seeing it manufactured into bars , sheets , rods , and nails , ready for market . Alas ! how little do we know what the morrow may bring forth ! Their dream were disturbed by no visions of disappointed hopes , and they awoke to find the promise of the golden sunset of the day previous verified in a clear and deliciously cool day , with every prospect of a delightful drive before them . Upon going to look for the horses , however ( they had been turned into a field to pasture the night previous ) , one of them was not to be found . No broken fence , or bars let down , indicated the way of exit , and the whole party were completely at a loss to discover how , or by what means , she had escaped . Several of the men were sent off in various directions in search of the truant , but returned without any tidings . At length , after two or three hours had been spent in the unprofitable search , inquiry was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any thing of the stray animal . He informed them that , in passing along the road at an early hour , he had noticed both of the animals in the field beneath an apple-tree , the fruit of which they were trying to reach . While admiring them for their beauty , one made a rush at the other , who slipped and fell backward , and as she did not rise he supposed she had slid off a bank . Being in a hurry he had not stopped to see the result . Upon repairing to the spot it was found that his words were too true , and that in stepping back from the rush of her mate she had trod on the weak and rotten covering of a well nearly twenty-five feet deep which had been covered up many years previous , the existence of which had been almost forgotten , and had fallen to the bottom of it . Upon examination it was found that she had descended tail foremost , and that her hind legs were turned upward under her while her fore legs projected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcomed the appearance of the face of the Doctor , who was the first to approach the mouth of the opening , was a sufficient indication that she was not badly hurt , although at first sight it appeared wonderful how she could have fallen such a distance without killing herself . The width of the opening , however , explained the seeming paradox . It was but two feet six inches in diameter , and , falling backward as she had , her struggles to arise had served only to allow her to slip foot by foot to the bottom , where she sat so constrained as scarcely to be able to move a muscle . Of course the unanimous advice of the party which had gathered about the well was to shoot her and cover her up , but the Doctor , who would have loved his pets next to his wife had he had one , and , having none , had nothing else to love , was not disposed to any such course // until he had satisfied himself that she was past redemption . Clambering down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her limbs were broken , and the brightness of her eye and her responses to his caressings satisfying him that she was not dangerously injured , he returned to the surface declaring his intention to bring her up if it were possible . All hands went to work now with a will to aid in the laudahie undertaking , and in the course of half an hour a pair of shears were rigged and erected , pulleys were slung , and the Doctor , descending into the well again , passed a broad belt around the back of the animal and up between her fore-legs and secured it to the lower hlock . Fastening her forelegs together that she might not injure herself hy her struggles , her hind legs being secured to the fall to aid in lifting her , he gave the word to " hoist away . ' It was some moments before there was any perceptihle " give ; but finally , little by little , foot by foot , she rose , until at length she reached the surface , and a platform being rigged beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more stood upon her feet , apparently none the worse for her fall and subsequent confinement , except two or three spots on her hips and limbs where the hair had been removed . She was quite stiff , however , from her long confinement , and it was week ere she could again travel over the road with that elastic step and rapid gait which was her wont . This ended , for a time , the intimacy between our friends and the Doctor and his beautiful ponies , with whom thy had spent so many pleasant hours . " May their shadows never be less ! , , Determined not to he cheated out of their contemplated visit to Boonton , and its forges and mills and machine-shops , our friends , at the suggestion of Mr. Byram , were driven over in the afternoon to M'Cainsville , a little village on the Suckasunny plains , about one and a half miles distant , where they took passage on the " raging canal , and where we will leave them in charge of Captain Blivens , the gentlemanly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
