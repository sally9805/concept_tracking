THE FOCI OF THE SOCIAL ELLIPSE . THE ellipse , significant in its mathematical relations , is scarcely less apt in its representative power . It has two centres , or foci , instead of one . The curve , as a whole , is similarly related to each of these foci , though every point in it is differently and adversely connected to them . They stand overagainst each other , two conjoint centres from which the figure has been described , and to each of which it is referable in exactly the same way . A diaineter equidistant from them divides the curve into two equal and complementary parts . The ellipse thus becomes a striking type of joint yet separate action ; of similar yet diverse relations ; of equal yet opposed positions . For this purpose we now use it to represent the social circuit with its two foci , male and female . So God created man in His own image ; male and female created He them . The word man is thus used as common , and parts into the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thought in the words man and wife , man or woman . As in mathematics we designate a line as a , and the same line in a modified relation as a ' prime , so in the rational world , our first form of being is man , and our second is man prime ,  - -  woman . Let the two foci of an ellipse approach each other till they meet , and the figure becomes a circle ; let the centre of a circle part into two points , and then stand over-against each other , and it becomes an ellipse . Man , the undivided being covered by . the one word that groups us all , is the centre of the circle of rational life ; man , parted into male and female , is the foci of the ellipse into which this single , germinant circle expands in the first steps or stage of growth . What we wish to establish is , that the foci of the true social ellipse are occupied by equal , complementary parVOL . Iv. - 93 ties , who give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it the evenly balanced and exact product of its two constituents . These may approach each other and meet for the time in one centre , or may part , and send distinct influences forth for the construction of society , yet this , in its perfection , shall remain the equal and symmetrical result of their united action . When we affirm that men and women occupy equal , balanced social positions , we do not mean that there is a numerical measure of power to be found somewhere , on whose scale-mark they touch exactly the same point ; neither that the kind and grade of power are identical , both medium or both prime . Equality in the spiritual world has a less precise , a more ranging definition . Men and women are equal in the same sense that men are equal . There is a liberal per percentage of folly and weakness in the world , but they are not confined to races , classes , or sex , but are sown broad-cast through them all . The equality of men and women is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as types of beauty ; like the equality of oxygen and hydrogen in the production of water , , like the equality of the east and west end of a great cathedral , the one majestic with towers , the other sacred with . chancel and legendary windows . It is , not an absolute barren equality , but a potential , diversified , exalted one , that seeks the equipoise of things various , lifted , in their excellence , above a dickering , fractional , scrupulous measurement ; an equality of things that look now smaller one than the other , now larger , according as we come under their immediate influence , or contelnplate them on this side or on that . These two powers , in this sense equal , are also complementary . Life is not of // one or the other , but of the two . Society is neither the product of man nor of woman , but of man and woman . They do not enter , therefore , the physical , social , or intellectual field , to yield the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in kind as in some subtle balance of the forces they contain . The limbs of man are complementary . The right and left leg are alike , yet unlike . Identical in structure , the arrangement of parts is exactly opposed , while , in walking , their duties are of an alternate , not simultaneous character . In like manner , the right and left hand are complements , and though in the division of offices there is a stronger distinction between them , this rests on convenience and custom , not structure . In close complementary relation there is a dependence and independence , a likeness and unlikeness , equally striking . Taken separately , each of the partners may seem complete , but regarded in reference to some joint state or action , they are wholly dependent . Each loses , not only what the other contributes , but its own peculiar function , by the separation . Thus we can not walk half as far on one leg as we can on two ; we can not walk at all till the missing member is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our usual labor with the right hand alone . Its customary dexterity is lost except as the left waits upon it , and remains , as a skilful , trained attendant , ready at each instant to furnish the expected aid . One limb stands in perpetual pause till the other can be planted ; one hand fills itsell and has no point of relief or change till the other is brought forward . If our individual , physical structure is full of complementary relations , it becomes natural to expect something of the same kind in our joint social structure . At the foundation of this , accordingly , there lies the most perfect of complements , extending through the physical , intellectual , and emotional natures . Men and women are equal in that the superiority of neither at any one point is absolute and unapproachable , and is always balanced by some corresponding superiority at another Thus , say what we will about the inferiority of woman in intellectual power , none of us would regard as a miracle a woman who should evince more capacity than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first man of the age is himself extraordinary , but not miraculous ; for the feet of woman have often walked lightly along the summits of intellectual power , and we see that there is no point absolutely denied them . Though there are very few who , like Mrs. Somerville , or Miss Martineau , or Margaret Fuller , seem to tread freely the fields of philosophy , there are sufficient to show that they are to the region born , and need crave no admission there . Though here and there a solitary peak in the clear intellectual heavens seems to belong almost exclusively to man , yet we are to remember that very few men have ever scoffed at woman , for whom there might not have been selected , with a little care , women by dozens decidedly superior to them in the very qualities of which they boasted . Moreover , there are other just as brilliant and true methods of manifesting mental power , which seem equally open to the one sex as the other . Mrs. Browning is one of the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelist , and the Bront6s and Mrs. Lewcs and Miss Muloch have few peers . It is true , then , that the intellectual superiority of man is not of a general , absolute , unapproachable kind , but that he simply holds high vantage-ground , which he has occupied for centuries , and for a portion of which certain phases of his power pre*mincntly fit him ; yet , be it borne in mind , ground every inch of which may be essayed by the nimble wits of woman . Overagainst this , in the balance of position , women occupy , pitch their tents upon , cover , the more serene , genial , and truly commanding mounts of moral power . // If it is easy to find two talented men for one talented woman , it is yet more easy to find two pure-minded women for one man who bears about with him a tolerable wholesome , moral atmosphere . If it is unusual to find a woman like Lady Montague , Mine . De Sta*l , or Mine . Roland , seeking a peer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical . or political themes , it would be equally unusual to find devout worship , holy membership in Christ , lively , sympathetic , personal charity , in which two thirds of the participants were not women . Indeed , this eminence , this blessed preeminence , seems conceded to them , and only one human being in the growth of Christianity has been lifted by the worship of men beyond the pale of human powers into divine honors-Mary , the Mother of God . Men who are determined to reject this essential oneness and equality of nature , scorn , in the comparison , the moral element . They forget that it is by virtue of this alone that we touch the clouds ; that it is this that chiefly defines character , and gives the outlines and lineaments of our spiritual being . The intellect is an instrument , and that for which we use it determines its value . If it is a sword in the hand of some great madman driving through Asia or Europe and striking at the lives and liberties of men , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceitful and dazzling : fools may stare , but angels weep . If it is a steamship , a jenny , a power-press , then it puts new and benign instruments at our disposal , yet instruments that must still find the kindness and gladness of their service in the gentle thoughts of those who use them . It is the angel or demon of the moral nature , that stands behind the intellect , goes into it as into an arsenal , to arm itself for mischief , to seeure there missiles of wrath whose sweep and power know no limit ; or to gather up the tools of husbandry , of commerce , of manufacture , and ease therewith the toil of men , and lighten and sustain their hard labors . The element of intelleet , which man represents , stands servitor to the moral power typified in woman ; and is good or bad , angelic or devilish , according to the handling . If superiority is to be claimed beeause of the central power , the distinguishing feature of character , it must be awardecj to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two constituent forces of society serves still further to point out the n*ture of their equality . Look at the physic .1 endowments and beauty of each ; at Venus and Hereules , Minerva and Apol lo . The one personified power , the other personified sensibilities ; the one , a type of aggressive strength , strength offensive and defensive , of power , piercing , penetrative , declared ; the other , of attractive , winning force to be possessed , trusted , rejoiced in , more to be loved than feared , to be feared only when love has been betrayed , to be feared only when love has been outraged and made vindictive , when the moral sentiment has been stirred to wrath . Intellectually , there is the same complementary relation . The heaven-given Promethean fire is wanting to neither , but in one it burns with more heat ; in the other , with more light . To the quick glance of the one , the intuitive , emotional aspects of truth lie revealed ; to the steady , patient thought of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poetry and art lie open to a Mrs. Ilemans , or Hosmer , or Bonheur , while philosophy and invention yield chiefly to the systematic , slow approaches of the male mind . They are indeed to each other as the two arms of the military service-the scouring cavalry and the patient , conquering infantry . For effective , lively service in the recitation room , I think most instructors would award the palm to young ladies rather than to young men ; and it is plain that a good many of the more boastful sex guard their superiority by carefully declining competition . There are in the thoughts of women velocity , electricity , brilliancy ; in the thoughts of men patience , proportion , coolness ; and in the interplay // of the two , the best , the only conditions of society . If we add to this the fact that the one class of minds are permeated with more pure and spiritual incentives , their morality always looking out on the heavenward side , neither baulked nor discouraged by self-denial , while the thoughts of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moderated in forecast , and are perpetu&amp;lly looking earthward , along that vista of hopes , fears , liabilities , which are gathering in the path before them ; we have the conditions of intense interaction , as when the outside and inside surface of an electric jar , by diverse characters and mutual affinities , nrin each other through every inch of surface with prickly points of fire . Before passing to a discussion of the consequences involved in this relation of the foci of the social ellipse , we wish to animadvert a little on the temper of the male mind in one or two phases it quite too frequently assumes . The first of these is that of contempt , supercilious and unreasoning . In this frame , men think so well of themselves and so poorly of those not endowed with the same dThtinguishing and distinguished characteristics , as not to feel it i*ccessary to give any reason for their ( nclusions . They are content to float on the waves  --  the shilly-shally opinions that have ebbed and flowed backwards and forwards in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have taken the drainage of maudlin prejudices , miserable conceits , and a mean love of power ; and they expect others to abide with them on like easy , lazy , comfortable terms of faith in their own immaculate being . It is not strange that women should be despised . The world has never seen a time yet in which angels would not have been first stared at , then laughed at , and at length stoned . In the progress of civilization we , from time to time , like the toad , cast our skin , but too often , like him , we turn again and swallow it . Society started from the physical point , and as n1*n is stronger than woman , she became his slave . This servitude she has been casting off ever since , the spiritual beauty and strength that are in her , ridding themselves slowly , one after another , of the vile , despiteful tasks and badges laid upon them . There is no use in denying the persistent , persecuting character of the contempt that men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on women . Language is full of it . The unmarried female is an old maid and spinster , and the widow the relict of her departed lord , as if she lingered behind ' like his old hat or church-coat . If woman is unsubmissive , she is a termagant , a shrew , a scold , a vixen , a virago . If she is uncleanly , she is a slut , and if she is impure , we have buried her many layers deep , piling on a fearful burden of epithets , as if we would fain crush her forever , and bar for her , with triple , impregnable bars , the road back to virtue . One might gather from language , that woman became a harlot by some devilish device of her own , and that the frightened virtue of men , hovering on unsullied wing , avenged its scandalized purity with ingenious appeilatives of horror and scorn , hurled at the crouching , crawling victim beneath him . As Edith , in the masterpiece of Dickens , shrinks in self-loathing from the pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were hiding away , cloaked in all the vile epithets of speech , from that immaculate being , man . And these six-fold words of shame not to be mentioned here are matched by not one distinctive appellation for like guilt in man . Love opens the gates of Heaven ; Man , with a skeleton key craftily shaped on this high model , opens doors which he assures his confiding victim are those of pearl , and then slams them shut behind her , the gates of death , the portals of the tomb ; while society rushes forward to bolt and bar them , and virtuous maidens even plant themselves voluntary sentinels , that there may be no return , no voice of pity , no word of encouragement . We said there is scarcely in our language an epithet of disparagement that belongs exclusively to man . Let // us be just ; there are some . When he is thought to be too much like a woman , he is called a milk-sop , a granny , a Betty . Whence comes this wicked , intolerable scorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gender it , as the dead , by inevitable law , swarms with life . If woman be weak , she is not therefore to be despised ; if she be pure - as we should all be compelled to acknowledge that she is , if the words of Christ were in our ears , " He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her " - she is therefore to be honored . Our wonder is of whom these wise men were begotten-this breed of noble blood ; whether it be the life of their mothers that is in them thus curdling and separating and congealing in intestine strife and spleen , one ruddy drop blushing with shame at its fellow . These doubtless have a way of their own of reaching the world . There are two forms of this contempt which add hypocrisy to scorn , and are thus doubly unendurable ; the one is the religious and the other the chivalric phase of it . The conditions of life when Christianity had first touched them and was just disclosing them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized on , and the counsels applicable to the incipient stages of society exalted into complete formulae , perfect principles wherein to express its ripe growth . We have had enough of this measuring up the present in the sealed and certified vessels of the past-this putting of the new wine into the old bottles and waiting for a burst . Seed-truth , germinating truth , truth prolific in new varieties and fresh forms , is the living truth and the only living truth of God . Gallantry that adorns woman till she becomes a petty deity , that lifts her up , and then worships and berates her by turns , that praises its own courtesy , condescension , and consideration in seeming to praise her dependent graces , and is careful to keep her , with all her alleged virtues , in close vassalage , and to wear her as an unmistakable ornament somewhat sparingly and proudly , is the solution which fashionable society loves to make of the relation of the sexes ; and with all its gilding of sweet phrases and outside show , it suffers not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low life , in which men mnd women square at each other in bold defiance , and give each to the other a list of their virtues in honest , understandable English . A gallantry which perverts language , which makes appearances belie facts , and patiently forges and then adorns the links of servitude , is one of the more mischievous ways in which man asserts his position , then stoops gracefully from it to hawk up his prey . Woman is , and should be , equally independent of scorn and charity . She walks a queen . And with power honestly conceded and skilfully used , she may win by commanding , and command by winning . In the highest impersonations of attributes , if the artist shapes his conception toward complete beauty , shades it off in the loveliness and sublimity of moral endowments , lifts it into the purity and peace of affections composed in spiritual life , of thoughts that touch evil and disaster without tarnish or weakness , he can hardly escape the female form . This being-woman-who brings to earth the gentlest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire on the hearth of home ; who bears not on her shoulders , but in her bosom , most of human sorrow , hushing , consoling , suffering it ; who presents in her person the tenderest , most attractive type of known beauty , the image nearest the invisible form of angelic life ; who lights with quick , brilliant thought the paths we tread together in social glee , or scale alone in wrapt meditation ; who brings to man the chief image of Heaven 's chief benison , love , and remains the point of pure attachment of the incarnate life of Christ to the life of our lost race ,  --  can well pity the scorn of man and plead exemption from his gallantry ; can withdraw , as angels do , from too harsh and gross a // touch into the unapproachable precincts of her own spiritual , purified power . Say not , this is woman idealized , and so nought . It is because she can be so idealized , is so idealized before every penetrative , impassioned eye , and from time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image , that she becomes the carrierdove of every noblest impulse , speeding it on its way to Heaven . What we choose to call the physical and intellectual weakness of woman , her want of strength , invention , and philosophy , in a certain aspect of them , are the conditions of her triumph . Her victory is a moral one , and this she works out , not with sword or ploughshare , not by the violence of the physical or the dazzling achievements of the intellectual world , not by trick of head or hand , but by the silent influences of the nobler nature , slowly stealing into the heart , as the warmth of spring into the frozen earth , and unlocking there the fountains of human life and her own power . If what we have now said were not absolutely true , but only partially so , there would yet be a plain identity , not a conflict of interests , between sex and sex in the growth of society . There can not be full strength in the one without full strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the occasion of a corresponding weakness on that . Each must act as an occasion and condition of growth to the other . As in a play of swords , the steady eye , the quick stroke , watchful guard of the one party become the germ in training of the like qualities in the other ; so the trenchant thrust of thought , the keen retort of wit , the ever-ready foil of patience , the subduing stroke of affection , are , in the sharp , free play of social life , the conditions between man and woman of mutual respect and power . Nothing can be plainer than this as regards physical perfection . It is difficult to tell on which root of life strength is most dependent . The mother can not sink into feebleness ,  --  and what a pity it is that tobe feeble and tobe effeminate are very much the same thing - nor the father fall off from the full force of the race , without introducing the subtle seeds of miscl*ef . If there is any thing in the world conjoint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand fluids , forged by a thousand blows , shaped by a thousand processes , it is the life- that is today in each of us ; and if there is any thing bi-partate , hi-polar , made up of the mingled waters of two great rivers , poised in the attraction and interaction of two types , adjusted by concession here , conquest there , and partition everywhere , it is the life we bear about with us , sealed in features maternal , or strengthened in forces paternal , as providential law may have wrought for us . The coming man , strong , lithe , healthy , nimble of limb , patient of thought , must find the alchemy of his being skiP fully compounded by two spirits , equally adroit , clear-eyed , and potent . Nor is it less true in the cultivation of our powers than in their first grade and combination , that we shall meet these double conditions . This is a point we wish to handle a little more carefully , and we shall do it more effectually on the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the form and stren* , th of both in society will be determined , in a large degree , by the answering characteristics of the sexes . Our immediate assertion is , that every deficiency in the character of woman will be found to play into an answering fault in that of man . Woman has been , and still is in a measure , subdued to a position of mean dependence on man . That it has been so , is admitted ; for the sinuous , slimy trail of history brings the painful record everywhere to thc light ; that it still in part remains so , *t us concisely enforce . Woman is not the equal of man before the civil law . She makes no laws , she enforces no laws , she simply suffers under law . She has no trial by her peers ; men try her , convict her , imprison or hang her . Men listen to the complaints and decide upon them ao'ainst her property , life , and good // name . She stands in no equal possession of property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Property that came through her , may pass in spite of her to his heirs at his death . Not so with him . He may dispose of his personal property against her will ; not she of hers . He is her complete heir in all vested rights ; she enters by one third into his property , though it may have been originally all her own . And this is about the practical ratio in which the law deals with her-three to one . In education , she is excluded from the highest endowed institutions of the land , while these are replaced with scarcely one adequately endowed for her , especial benefit . By the unusual expensiveness and poor quality of instruction , she is cut off from the higher , more perfect , more desirable forms of knowledge . The occupations open to her are still limited , and she is hunted by an inquisitive , tormenting , scandalizing public sentiment , if she passes the bonuds assigned her . A like sentimont , as subtle and irascible as Greekfire , prescribes an unhealthy , inconvenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her powers , and crowds her , by an intolerable sense of dependence on others , and a certain , undefined shame of a life rejected from service and from love , into the marriage state , in which almost all that pertains to her is put at the mercy of one man . The exigency has not altogether passed of that earlier time in which seven women laying hold of one man besought him , saying , " We will eat our own bread , and wear our own apparel : only let us be called by thy name , to take a way our reproach . " Abate these statements as you will , and there still remains an undeniable and unnecessary element of weakness and servitude in woman . And what is the answering vice in man ? We need not go far to look for it  --  the arrogant assumption of the male gender , no matter how low and grovelling the propensities under which it has hid itself . The man whom all erca tion spurns , yet manages to find some woman to spit upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . He has been dodging and shying at the negro for a score of years , feigning offence to his nostrils and scandal to his understanding , but really afraid to meet , unwilling to meet , in fair field this patient competitor . Now , he fears that his domestic sceptre is endangered , and that he can not bring his gross vices and unclean lusts in exactly the same arbitrary way to the household , if the partner of his bosom is emancipated to knowledge , self-government , and equal rights . He hates to treat with parties he has been wont to command , and be put upon his courtesy and kindness so long disused . Here is the fatal , reciprocal effect of a subservient , dependent attitude in one of two parties essentially equal . It begets and must beget tyranny , arrogance , self-assertion , and self-indulgence . There were never slaves without masters , nor slavish vices without magisterial vices as well . If you say these statements are not applicable to our best families , we admit it , and make answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the husband has been waved , or has found an amicable basis in perfect love . The point claimed is exactly this : the unity of the household must be one of rational , thoughtful , independent , coalescing elements , and thus only can it be a school of mutual forbearance , seifrespect , and skill . Just so far as submission , sinking to servility , comes in on the one side , power rising to arrogance will enter on the other , and we shall have more or less of the spectacle which still lingers with us - home made the only place in which man finds no motive to disguise his brutal passions , or , may we not truthfully say , in which he sometimes avenges himself in the outrageous indecency of behavior for all the restraint the world has put upon him . We know where the under-current of thought is sapping these statements . It is first affirmed that much of this mischief is due not to the condition , // the terms of the relation between man and woman , 1 ) ut to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society , constructed as it is , tends to cast it off . Yes , growth casts it off ; because it shakes and . shatters the theory and practice of dependence in which much of it is rooted . And these declared methods of the law and the base do but disclose more clearly and undeniably the vicious tendencies of a system , the same in its spirit everywhere . Why should you , by the order and harmony of your home , resting on mutual respect , love , and concession , uphold in theory a principle which , in practice , you have discarded l Why give an alleged law of order , under which the tyrannical husband hides himself from himself and from the world , ns he stalks with coarse authority and uncovered faults through the frightened , trembling household ? Another prevalent defect in womanly character , induced , or at least enhanced , by a too restricted field of thought and labor , is vanity . This is the ruling vice of the female mind . The irrational ridiculous , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and execution . By means of it , leaders are driven in a round trot of extravagance , through unnecessary and nonsensical changes , wearing out their existence with hopes , fears , perplexities , triumphs , chagrins , none of which are at all worthy , not merely of them , but of any intelligent being . This making it all of life to live ; this uniting of one 's self to the ephemera , hovering on the wing , and feeding on the sunshine ; this acceptance of bonnet and bend as the polite language of our polite nature , itself thought of as a jewel of a thing , is the weakness and sin of the womanly heart , and it begets at once its answering transgression in man . The acquisitive , greedy spirit , with eager , searching eye , hard and unsympathetic , is the innate and acquired mipulse of men , which wakes up in them on the slightest provocation , as inevitably as scent in a hound . The ground and necessity of this eagerness are found in large part in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more a luxury , and the dress and equipage of the household a gauge-mark of success . How can the father pause , when he must bring home game to this camp of cormorants ! How can he yield kind and considerate terms , when his daughters are to him as those of the horseleech , crying , with unending iteration , " Give , give ! " He finds his satisfaction in this showy vanity of those whom society and he himself have set apart to display ,  --  have made the sashes and shoulder-straps of social rank ; and in order to keep full its resources , he must resume , year by year , that untiring labor which has become the habit and form , the harsh and uncompromising contour , of his very existence . A last fault which we shall mention , in which this reciprocity of influence is betrayed , is a certain undue effeminacy of character in woman , a toning down of power till it becomes weakness , an innocence that is ignorance , an untimely flow of sentiment , an unwise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a simpering sentimentality , or , anon , the vivacious extravagance of silly shrieks and heaped hyperbole . Sober , sedate strength is wanting , and wanting because broad , deep knowledge is wanting , and many avenues of labor are wanting with their earnest hopes of success and pressing fears of failure . Borrowing from frivolous society all their expectations , they accept the lien thus resting on them ; they become the bubbles which the idle breath of flattery finds its pleasure in blowing them into . As woman , above all , is deeply freighted with feeling , so , above all , does she require the ballast of weighty purpose and profound thought . She , least of all , can with safety dance an empty shallop on idle waves , that first sport with and then devour her . Now the answering vice of man is deep-seated and damnable . He holds woman lightly as a means of pleasure , // toys with her , and , weary , flings aside the fragile plaything . Those three words , " wine and women , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human passion . The monster lust , like Minotaur of old , loves to exact a yearly tribute of* virgins . It is impossible to say what we are about to say with absolute certainty . Each can qualify the statement according to his own opportunities of knowledge . Moreover , an unwillingness to hear and know and confront the facts which we but glance at in passing is a part of what we complain of ; as imbecility ; innocent in one sense , it maybe , butit is not for that reason the less fatal in its results . It is the wisdom of the ostrich , hiding its head in the sand as a means of safety . The one sex are as a rule chaste , cold , passionless ; the other quick , passionate , full of heat . It follows hence that young men perpetually misunderstand and misinterpret young women ; and the latter approach and provoke danger with no sufficient knowledge of it . That which is silly in the one addresses that which is wicked in the other ; and passion finds boldness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is not strengthened with the dignity of knowledge , or armed with the forecast of self-reliance . Thus fashionable society often sinks into a spider-and-fly game , and we find by thousands in our great cities those who , bereft of moral life , are still dangling on the web , not yet having passed into complete decay . The vanities , the excitements , the condiments , the expenses of fashional ) le dress and festivities , afford the best possible conditions for the interplay of uneasy , lustful passions half hidden from their possessor , and of tantalizing beauty that calls forth admiration without respect , that nettles the curious , critical eye , yet is able to east over itself no veil of moral qualities , or overawe with a halo of spiritual powers . It is a great error , that what is thought to be beauty , and is fallen beauty , beauty slipping from its spiritual heights , should be sought so exclusively for women , and be regarded as their prime adornment . Beauty itself is thus perverted , and becomes a means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it . The intellectual and moral elements drop away from it , the physical predominates , and then it is used as a lure for the eye , two often a lustful eye , that plucks this fruit , exactly as it would pluck any fruit , for its own selfish indulgence . The aesthetic sentiment rules over woman in a false , feeble , fashionable way , and leaves man pretty much unrestrained . He may show the results of unseemly vices , may whisper his sweet adulation or his ffippant follies with foul breath from an unclean mouth , and pass unscathed . A wholesome person and a wholesome spirit are rarely sought for in him as long as he has power and grasps the reins of influence . Herein is a radical disorganization rather than organization of society ; a morbid , diseased action rather than a healthful , sound one . This mischief , in the relation of the two great parties to the social compact , springs from that false sentiment which makes one of its members weak , dependent , ornamental ; the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman is primarily one of fascination and adornnaent . Her education is of that outside character which fits her for this , her fortunes are made dependent on her success in it ; while her danger lies in m4ing early shipwreck in these strange , enchanted seas , where what is below the surface is so different from what appears above it . Let man be more bound to the beauty of personal character ; let woman huve more strength to cope with her opponent , too often her adversary ; and the issue of these shifting , stirring plots of real life will less often he commonplace , or sad , or dreadful . We do not , indeed , suppose that the change of any or all of the external conditions of society will renovate it , but we do believe , that with renovation will be swept away the last vestige of // tyranny alike of man over man and man over woman . Having dwelt on the correlation of vices incident to social life , we need not enlarge on the fact that there is a like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesy there ; that independence and purity and power overbear and abash impudence and intrigue , and call forth appreciation and respect ; while respect works both ways in the elevation of its object and subject-of her whose due it is , of him who has the wisdom and justice to yield it . If an ellipse be revolved about its major axis , and the surface described be one of perfect reflection , then the light in one focus will all be gathered in the other , nor the heat in one measure that emanating from the other . Society , symmetrically formed , is such a surface ; the light of one agent is the light of the other , and neither can look in any direction without seeing the glory of the other . Even when the air seems scarcely to be luminous , heat , more modest and unobtrusive , though not less benignant than light , steals over from the one centre to the other , and lifts each to the same point of comfort and pleasure . It only remains for us to consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women . The first , the all-inclusive one , is power  --  the full development on the part of both of all the strength that belongs to them . It is strange that any wise r*an should wish to set limits to the powers of any portion of the race . The strength of every man and woman is the strength with which they are able to work for us , and with which they do work for us , in every legitimate undertaking . The jealousy of a blind selfishness is always fearful of exposing itself ; and seeks its purposes under the disguise of some plausible reason . It is alleged that the nature of woman and society is such as to admit of no serious enlargement of her powers . What society allows , we have been striving to show . It not merely suffers strength , it covets it . Everywhere , and at all times , it is searching up and down through its various members for power , power to enter on this undertaking , to ward off this danger , to organize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it puts her in the vanguard of its noble servants as unhesitatingly as if she had been a man ; nay , she might have been a man thrice as long and , without these wise ways of her womanly nature , received nothing . Society does not fear power , it fears dependence , easy compliance , the burden of those who can not put their feet to the ground , nor handle tools , nor speak clear , resonant words of truth , but must , in the march of life , be trundled along on wheels , under those comprehensive words of imbecility and weakness , women and children . There is nothing , then , in the nature of the most perfect and highly-organized society that excludcs power-the spirit as much of beauty as utility-but quite the reverse . Is there any thing in the nature of woman ? We believe not . If there is , however , we have here no ground of debate with an adversary , for we wish her to have merely the opportunity of doing , to be left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forced into , or out of ; alleged impossibilities . When men cry everywhere , " Nature , nature , nature , is against you , " and yet are careful to maintain customs and laws in protection and fortification of the alleged provisions of nature , we distrust their assertion and candor alike . Nature has a way of tending to her own concerns , that renders all aid superfluous . When Nature makes a baboon , that is the end of it , and he stays where he is without coercion . When man calls his fellow a baboon , and plants both feet upon him , then comes such a tussle , such peeled knuckles and bloody noses , as to show there has been a grave mistake somewhere . If Nature is against woman , we need not disturb ourselves . She will never do more than God made her to do . We simply wish the way to be cleared , that we may all see , in the last , // best experiment of power , what she can do . We have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time , organized into fixed institutions : suppose we have for a time woman 's notion of her own capabilities harmlessly developed by their actual establishment . She will not outstrip the grace of God , and what she does she will do by that grace . He will make answer on the one side or the other by fire ; fIre consuming her faltering claims , or fire flashing new light and joy into the world of endeavor and achievement . The grounds of hope are sufficient to justify to a wise man the endeavor . Some women do succeed in speaking much better than the mass of men who make it their business , and thereby show this to be their constitution , their line of power . Power , real power , generous , gracious power , is not to be feared in whosesoever hands it may be lodged . It is the primary , essential condition to the ful. filment of social duties . The secondary conditions on which its attainment rests , are , first , opportunities ; second , independence . Woman must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use , power . She has been deprived of opportunities , positively and negatively ; positively by a public sentiment , by a dress and by customs that have cut her off from most fields of labor , and consequently made her wages contemptible in those which she has been permitted to occupy ; negatively , by the failure on the part of society to make that sufficient and liberal provision for her education which has been so wisely furnished for the rival sex . Quality , quantity , and expense are all here to be complained of ; and most women are thus excluded from any thing approaching a liberal education . This , taken with the frivolous part which fashionable society assigns her , and the secondary character of most of the labors entrusted to her , goes far to confirm that trivial , gossiping , routine movement of mind which we are afterward willing to cast at her a a first stone in driving her back from the nobler walks of.life . He who shuts to me the gates of opportunity , stands between me and God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that heavenly destiny which is upon me . When Nature sets a door ajar , cursed be the man who slams it in my face , and , with the cold heart of a turnkey , locks it against me . We need have no other permit in the universe of God than strength . Where we can walk , there we may walk ; and the battle will be renewed with each succeeding year , till every barrier has been cast down , every private claim surrendered , and we possess the universe of God in the method and measure in which he has given it us . Some burly , intellectual bear , like Samuel Johnson , who took a grim satisfaction in hugging an adversary till he could hear his bones crack , may contemptuously say , " Sir , a woman 's preaching is like a dog 's walking on his hind legs . It is not done well , but we are surprised to find it done at alL " Yet the dog keeps to his sphere , and woman undaunted explores the way to hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unheeded in its quiet justice , is becoming irresistible in its commanding authority on the lips of the future . " Give way ! the question lies between me and my Maker , and thus alone shall it be decided , " is more and more the lan . guage of every imperious soul , as it searches for its own amid the great issues and hopes of being ; as it dashes out on the untried , willing to perish there , rather than to miss any the least of its true inheritance . The second condition of power is independence . Woman must use her own and barter her own on equal grounds . She is now forced on the market , as it were , with but one commodity-herself-and is Jewed and hawked about till an advantageous exchange is luckily made , is missed of , or is compromised under humiliating conditions . If any rational being needs good footing , a position that yields purchase , a whereabouts to which she can retire with advantage , it is woman // treating with man ; it is woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and using it as a ground of conciliation and safety . This independence is found in having a feasible livelihood open to her , and the civil right to make , guard , and govern her own . The only grave argument demanding much respect that is brought to oppose this independence of woman , is that derived from the unity of the household ,  --  the singleness of its life that suffers but one head , one voice , one vote . Now there are two ways of reaching and expressing this unity ; the one is outside and formal , the other inside and vital . In unchristian and barbarous society , when the lnst can not be reached , perhaps something of the first must be endured . The father must be left uppermost , as he is by strength , in the prolific , rebellious brood of life , looking with untamed , unchastened eyes everywhere , within and without . Not thus is it when the conditions of spiritual unity are really reached : " They two shall be one , " are words of Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , a new one , as the two foci of the ellipse unite at the midway-point , the centre of a circle . Woman , then , lapses by marriage , not out of being , but into being ; she loses no old power , but gains new ones , and the union that is achieved is not one of conquest , surrender , and absorption , but of growth , of forces vitally disposed and related , and hence with functions enlarged and confirmed . There are mutual concessions and mutual gains , and the reserved right to disagree where formal agreement is impossible . Now , this actual , vital unity can easily be liberal towards outside disagreements ; while a formal government , an exterior headship , is always sensitive of difference and jealous of contradiction . An equivocal , unsurrendered claim to authority is always the most vexatious and insurmountable obstacle to conciliation and harmony . A surrender of hereditary , prescriptive rights , and a frank appeal to personal and immediate claims , are the first steps to all hearty coL*peration and unreserved affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except between equals . There are other phases of it , but this is the condition under which it becomes the safe and sufficient link of the race . No man till he has yielded independence , can rightly claim or use or value the love of woman . But is it not a little hard on man to come down from his high Pauline pitch , given him , as he has fancied , for all time , and stand on the plane of simple moral power ? Not the least . There is no attitude so easy and comfortable , so safe and invulnerable , as this of equality and independence . A man may justly be fretted at , if he professes to take the lead , to be the head , face , and serene forehead of things , and is yet unable to steer clear of troubles and perplexities . Petulance and peevishness are a minority right ; fault-finding and querulousness the privilege of the weak , who have no other method in which to avenge themselves of the wrong done them by the imbecility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreat from criticism and complaint to quietly reply , " Suppose you try your hand at it , and let me occupy the easy-chair a little while . " Many an uncharitable auditor would come down from the pulpit , like the deacon , in a free perspiration , and with the crestfallen confession , " It is a deal harder to preach than I thought it . " For one , I am anxious to occupy the position of the young gallant , whose services being scomfully rejected , quietly asked , if he might sit on the wall , and see her go . I am every way willing to compose myself to the spectacle of the outburst and achievement of this new social force . The load of life has drawn hard enough in time past , we all know , and if the evener is soon to be slaughtered , and our consort is to pull with equal and disciplined powers , who is to oh-ject ? The fact of comfort is a good exchange for the appearance of power , at least to the unambitious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // pelled to respect and admire , the better off is he . Let us abide patiently the new era announced , for if we as men cease to be the entire liead of the race , we shall at least have larger sympathy and partnership in the angry scratches and staggering blows that shall come to our common physiognomy from the ills and evils of life . Deference to real power is certainly as befitting a grace as an outside courtesy , ever ready to become the concealment of contempt ; while a little fear is a wholesome sedative to passionate admiration . We shall not be the losers by powers bent to more consideration , fairness , and respect , and compelled to initiate conquest by good behavior . Nor , on the other hand , will there be lost to man that which amid all scorn , forgetfulness , and harshness , he mest truly values-womanly character , affection , sympathy , and patience . The elements of the genuine , tender , in one word womanly , heart , are not of so uncertain and unstable a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more knowledge and opportunity . An addition of strength to patience , of power to love , of comprehension to tenderness , is all that remains to give woman in character a sublimity equal to her present beauty . If we have buried woman , when fallen , under the worst words of our language , as stones cast upon her to hide her from the eye , yet the pure woman , by her inner life , has lifted other words , all her own , into the region of the most delightful , vivifying , blessed emotion , and made them the abiding seat of all holy home-affection . Mother , wife , and sister , are the keywords with which each of us unlocks the treasures of the heart , or , wanting which , plod on poor and penniless forever in a beggared world , that brings no zest in memory , in existence , or in hope . The patient tenderness of the mother , the prodigal love of the wife , the jealous affection of the sister , so possess the feelings and command the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in waking or in sleeping hours , form and feature to those angels that go up from us into the open heavens , or come down to us as from the presence of God .
