Oh come , and gaze on beauty 's star to night ! Behold it rise with rare and radiant light , Then pass into a cloud , and from this sphere With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the startling scenes When Heaven between belligerents intervenes ! See Falsehood , with his cowering legions , fly Before the marshalled armies of the sky ; Or , suddenly enwrapped in sulphurous sheet , Stand pale and lifeless at the Conqueror 's feet : And learn how strong becomes the weaker cause When it is succoured by celestial laws . To lift up Truth from under Perjury 's heel Behold the sepulchre her gates unseal ; Dead bones around them wrap their dust and walk , And stand before a mighty king and talk ; And , from the fate of him who wrought a crime That stained the flag of Poland through all time , Profoundest lessons draw and faith sublime . Main text ACT I. PIOTRAWIN , WITH THE CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS IN VIEW . SCENE I. Morning . The frontage-ground of the Manor-House of STANISLAS on the bank of the Vistula . Enter CHRISTINE in a riding habit and mask , followed by ALISA in the attire of a cavalier . CHRISTINE ( pausing before a rose-tree , and striking her habit with Her whip , as if beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice singing , Though all around is mute  --  Down in my heart ' t is ringing , Like silver-corded lute . Sometimes it breathes in mezzo Softest emmoving tones , Then rises to falsetto As sighs break into moans  --  ALISA ( approaching with an air of alarm ) . Christine , Christine , my pet , didst hear that thunder ? CHRISTINE ( continuing her reverie ) Then fine as spirits rapping , Their presence to impart At Eden 's gate , I hear a tapping At the portal of my heart . And one without a-crying  --  " ' T is late , come forth fair one  --  Keep me not here a-sighing Until the day be done . Come a-gleaning and love-prating By babbling brook and broom  --  The fruit is ripe and waiting  --  The flowers they are all in bloom . " ALISA . Christine , Christine , my pet , didst hear that thunder ? CHRISTINE ( laying her little gloved hand on the arm of ALISA ) . Alisa , tell me why I wear this mask ? ALISA ( kissing her brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . CHRISTINE . I 'm sure the wind would spoil it not for once : To-morrow I would ride without my mask . ALISA . I 'll ask the Bishop for permission , Miss . CHRISTINE . Why ask the Bishop ? Art not thou my mistress ? I want to ride outside the park to-morrow  --  And ride without my mask . ALISA . Ay ! you surprise me . CHRISTINE . I know there ' re pretty roads and flowers outside , And people , too ; for one day as we passed Beneath the ivied wall that separates Our grounds from Mile 's lofty towered castle , A flower was thrown o'er ' neath my pony 's feet . ALISA . A loving angel dropped it from the sky . CHRISTINE . Do angels wear fair beards , and hats like thine ? ALISA . Why does my lambkin ask such silly questions ? CHRISTINE . Because above the wall whence came the flower I saw a beard and hat , and pair of eyes Bright as two stars  --  ALISA . Tut ! tut ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beards and hats , Alisa ? And have months wreathed with smiles that make the heart leap ? ALISA ( aside ) . The bud is bursting into sudden bloom : I am alarmed , and must acquaint the Bishop . CHRISTINE . Alisa , nurse , why dost thou ape a man ? ALISA ( confused ) . The better to protect my little birdie . CHRISTINE . I think thee horrible in pantaloons , And would prefer a natural gentleman . ALISA . Girls in their teens think not of gentlemen ; ( Aside . Oh ! this is frightful ! ) that 's their time for study . CHRISTINE . Have I not studied Greek and Latin till I can say Homer , Virgil , all by heart ? ALISA . Yes , dearest lamb , and let me hear again Thee say the Battle of the Gods , from Homer  --  Thine own translation , not the Bishop 's give me . CHRISTINE . And wilt thou let me ride without my mask ? ALISA . Recite it , and I will beseech the Bishop . CHRISTINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortal throng , a tumult rose That shook the pallid world . Without the wall , Beside the deepened trench , Minerva stood , And shouted till her clarion voice was heard Where dashed the roaring waves of Simos . Upon the highest tower of trembling Troy Mars , God of War , stood like a mighty tempest , Urging the Trojans on to deadly strife ; Or , like a whirlwind swept along their ranks . Jove , father of the Deities and men , Thundered from highest heaven . The Ocean God Heaved from beneath immensity of earth , And shook the mountain tops . The roots of Ida , And all her fountain-gushing summits reeled ; Troy , city and the navy of the Greeks , Rocked like an earthquake . Deep beneath the ground The Monarch of the Dead in darkest hell Turned pale , and leaped affrighted from his throne , And shrieked aloud , lest He that shakes the world Should cleave earth 's vault asunder , and lay bare Hell 's mansions to the eyes of Gods and men . ALISA . Bravo ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now may I ride unmasked outside the park ? ALISA . I 'll see the Bishop , and hear what he says . CHRISTINE . Oh , dear ! Why does he lock me in my room When he has gentlemen to dinner , Alisa ? ALISA ( aside ) . Dear , dear ! I have no answer for that question ! CHRISTINE . There 's one of them has such a magic voice  --  I 'd like to see him  --  and I will see him ! ALISA ( aside ) . That is young Milo who talks like a lute  --  But , I must end this tte -- tte somehow . Girls at her age are difficult to manage  --  Nature is such a blabber of her secrets One can not keep the heart in ignorance . ( To CHRISTINE ) . Christie , sweet birdie , thou art weary  --  come in , Come , pretty one , and we will see to-morrow . It is thy birth-day , and we 'll have a fte  --  A dance upon the green in honour of it . Exeunt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated at a table reading Plato . STANISLAS ( looking up ) . The world has but one Plato and one Homer : In the unfathomed rivers of their thoughts Philosophy and poesy will live And light the universe as long as Sol . Their minds were mediums of divinity , The dew Heaven drops into the lips of thought To quench the carnal longing of the soul , And lift it to the level of the Godhead  --  The inspiration , without which there 's naught Immortal  --  ( ALISA enters , and drops into a fauteuil opposite . ) ALISA . My Lord , I hare great need to speak with thee . ( The BISHOP lays his book on the table , and folds his ! hands in the attitude of listening ) . My wits are at their end  --  quite at their end For answers to a thousand and one questions . Our lamb must have a larger fold , my Lord ; And if we give it not , she 'll leap the fence , And stray away wherever it may please her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one has thrown a bouquet o'er the wall  --  Milo , I know  --  that 's turned her little head : She is resolved to ride outside the park Without her mask  --  yes , sir , without her mask  --  And to be present at your dinner parties When Milo , Waldimir  --  and all are here . Says that she hears a voice among their voices That 's sweeter than the music of the lute  --  ' Tie Milo 's voice that 's turning her young head . I know it is  --  O sir ! you laugh ! but if You were to hear her you would cry , as I do . STANISLAS ( with a deep sigh ) . A change of shepherds must be brought about . ALISA . O sir ! O sir ! say not so ! say not so ! For eighteen years I 've nursed her in my bosom  --  Carried her in my very heart of hearts , And all the while she 's been the dearest thing , The mildest , sweetest little blue-eyed lamb That ever God sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge unto another  --  O sir ! O sir ! the thought quite overcomes me  --  ( Aside ) . If Milo should propose for her  --  O heaven And earth ! break not my soul on such a wheel ! STANISLAS . To-morrow is her birth-day . We will have A fte upon the lawn , and let her dance With Milo , Waldimir , without her mask . ALISA . Encourage not the noble Milo , sir ; Young Waldimir 's a better match for her , More suited to her age and youthful tastes . STANISLAS . And why not Milo ? He 's a princely youth , A match for any maiden in the land . ALISA ( stammering ) . Yes , he 's a prince  --  a princely youth , indeed , But Waldimir would match our beauty better He is so handsome , gentle , and so loving . STANISLAS . Alisa , I hare often thought that nature Intended Milo for our precious pearl ; The moulds wherein she cast them are so like , Hast never thought of it ? ALISA ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But since you turn my thoughts into the subject , I see a likeness that might swear their veins Had drawn their currents from the self-same fount  --  But , sir , come talk to Christie of the fte , And smooth the ruffled waters of her heart . STANISLAS . Nay , bring her here ; but first bid Jean attend me . ( Aside , writing ) . I 'll summon Milo to my bower this night , And on his heart-pulse lay my mental finger . ALISA ( aside , going ) . Milo shall ne'er be shepherd to my lamb ! I 'll turn the world out of its orbit sooner  --  Unlock my heart  --  and to the pitiless winds Bid scandal with her foul breath blow my secret . Exit . STANISLAS ( giving a note to JEAN , who enters ) . Take this to Milo  --  place it in his hand , And with your best speed bring me his reply . ( Exit JEAN . Re-enter ALISA with CHRISTINE ) . Well , well , how doth it with my pearl to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . STANISLAS . Then why that sigh , my pearl ? That jarring quaver in thy silver voice ? Has not thy pony trotted to thy liking ? CHRISTINE ( sighing ) . Yes , father . STANISLAS . Have the birds sung out of tune ? CHRISTINE ( sighing ) . They never sang so sweetly as this morn . ( Aside . ) But on my heartstrings love made sweeter music . STANISLAS . Then , kiss me , child , and tell me why thou art sad , And discontent . CHRISTINE ( kissing his brow ) . I am not sad  --  but  --  but  --  STANISLAS . But what ? CHRISTINE ( after a pause ) . I 'm weary of this mask  --  the roads  --  The trees  --  the flowers  --  the birds  --  the air I breathe  --  Everything . STANISLAS . Of me , too ? CHRISTINE . O , no , father , no  --  But I would like to ride outside the park Without my mask , and see the roads , and trees , And flowers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you shall , my pearl  --  to-morrow is Thy birth-day . We will have a fte , and thou Shalt dance with Milo , Waldimir , without Thy mask . CHRISTINE . O father ! do you really mean it ? STANISLAS ( kissing her brow ) . Yes , child . CHRISTINE . Then , I shall never weep again . STANISLAS . I 'd give my life to buy thee happiness  --  Ay , fifty lives , were they at my disposal . ( He leads her out , followed by ALISA ) . SCENE III . Evening . An Oaken Bower on the bank of the Vistula , in sight of the Manor-House . STANISLAS , wrapped in a long black stole walks to and fro . He stops , and clasps his brow with his right hand , as if to fix his thoughts . STANISLAS . It must be so , alas ! it must be so ! This selfish heart must render up its idol , The deified Penates of my household . For eighteen years I 've been a faithful shepherd , Watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with love and prayer ; For eighteen years have studied how to shield Its helplessness against the wind and wave  --  The wolf that is the scourge of bleeding Poland . The time is come that asks a change of shepherds . Milo has thrown his heart over the wall Wrapped up in ' a bouquet . He is my man . He 's noble , powerful , and would defend My lamb against his brother , King  --  his God . He dashes a tear from his cheek , and strides forward into the arms of MILO as he enters from un avenue , followed closely by SOBOUSKI , the King 's spy , muffled in a dark mantle . He passes behind a tree . The two noblemen seat themselves on a garden bench beneath the same . ALISA appears at one angle of the bower , eavesdropping , and WALDIMIR at another , each ignorant of the other 's presence or of the presence of SOBOUSKI . I am so glad , my Lord , to meet thee here Where there 's no ear but thine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . A solemn matter have I to unfold Concerning one of whom thou ne'er hast heard , But who is dearer to me than my life . MILO ( aside ) . He 's going to talk to me about his daughter , And thinks I know not of so fair a creature  --  Dreams not I 've scaled the wall a thousand times To see her galloping beneath the limes  --  Lavished upon her charms all powers of art , And wear her beauteous image on my heart . ( To STAN . ) Thy sweet confessional , my Lord , I 'll list . STANISLAS ( stammering ) . Milo , my friend , couldst thou a shepherd be ? MILO . I 've had no practice in the fold , my Lord . STANISLAS . Milo , give ear ! Just eighteen years ago God trusted to my keeping a white lamb , So tiny , tender , and so beautiful , I feared to touch it with my mortal hands : For eighteen years I 've been its prayerful keeper  --  Tended it , nursed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine own life . Milo , I want a shepherd  --  for my lamb , A tender , watchful , prayerful , loving shepherd . MILO . Worlds would I give , my Lord , to be that shepherd ! I 'd build the lamb a fold of gold , and set It in a case of pearls and precious diamonds  --  I 'd nurse it  --  tend it  --  carry it in my bosom , And shield it from the softest breath of heaven . Place it upon a jewelled pedestal , And kneel before it as before my God . STANISLAS ( clasping MILO 'S hand ) . Thanks , Milo , thanks  --  a thousand  --  thousand thanks ! I had not hoped to find so good a shepherd , But heaven is ever mindful of her servants . MILO . Though I have had no practice in the fold , I 'll be a model shepherd to thy lamb  --  Give it to me  --  Oh , give it me to-night ! And I will fold it in my inmost heart ! STANISLAS . But thou must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' T is needless quite , my Lord , I know its charms And all its countless wealth of loveliness . STANISLAS ( astonished ) . How ? mortal man , save I , ne'er gazed upon it . MILO . The angels have , and blabbed abroad its beauty  --  The Pearl of Poland ' s toasted far and near . STANISLAS . Thou dreamst , my Lord , she never passed my gate  --  Ne'er spoke to man , save me , in all her life , Nor breathed the air of heaven but in her mask . MILO . Imagination peers through masks of iron , And nature wills her chefs-d'oeuvre be seen . ( Draws a miniature of CHRISTINE from his bosom ) . Is this a likeness of the Pearl of Poland ? STANISLAS ( snatching the picture and gazing on it ) . How ? Whence , my Lord , came this ? It lives ! It breathes ! MILO ( with a sinister smile ) . Some culprit painter stealing in the park ; Or , peeping o'er the wall when she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot  --  Her graceful movement  --  and the face imagined . Here 's one of her on horseback at fall gallop  --  How dost thou like it ? STANISLAS ( snatching it , and springing to his feet ) . ' T is ! My lamb is lost ! MILO ( rising ) . Lost ! lost ! my Lord ! What dost thou mean ? Speak ! speak ! STANISLAS . That if these fall beneath Boleslas 's eye , There is no power in earth to save my lamb . MILO . Fear not , my Lord , fear not the royal wolf ! I 'd run him through , though fifty times a king  --  Burn down the palace o'er his pagan head . STANISLAS . Thou wouldst involve poor Poland in a war . MILO . I 'd barter worlds of Polands for her Pearl . STANISLAS . Be moderate , friend , draw on thy heart the curb , Lest , taking the bit , it run away with reason . MILO . Love knows no curb , my Lord , no hobble brooks  --  Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate , Piotrawin , is thine In trust for her , and for her heirs for ever . STANISLAS . That would be over-haste  --  To-morrow morn At ten , attend on me ; behold the pearl , My precious gem , unmasked , and if thy mind Be then of this accord , it shall be thine According to the Church ; Piotrawin mine According to the State ; and in the eve We 'll have a nuptial fte upon the green To glad the vassals of Piotrawin . MILO ( embracing STANISLAS ) . Thanks , thanks , my Lord , to-morrow morn will see Milo the happiest man in Poland  --  in The world ! WALDIMIR ( aside ) . The knell of hope is tolling in my heart ! ALISA ( aside , wringing her hands ) . It must not be ! It can not  --  shall not be ! STANISLAS ( lifting his eyes heavenward ) . Heaven be propitious to my lamb and shepherd ! Surround the future fold with ranks of angels So deep the wolf can find not where to enter ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall invest thee with the shepherd 's crook . MILO . Until to-morrow is a century , Lying between me and the land of bliss , Oh , for the lightning 's wings to waft me onward ! STANISLAS . Go to thy home , my son , and come to-morrow . MILO . Adieu ! To-morrow ' s registered in Heaven ! Exeunt in different directions . SOBOUSKI ( coming from behind the tree , with a triumphant laugh ) . The air is the worst keeper of men 's secrets , The sorriest confidant of pious shepherds , Since every square inch holds an eavesdropper ; They think they 're talking to the wind while they Are emptying their hearts into men 's ears . There is no secrecy but in the tomb  --  No safe , trustworthy confidant but death , He tells no tales outside of his dominions , But locks them in the storehouse of his wisdom , And by his reticence , provokes the sages . This side that silent Bourn man 's heart is bare For envy and chicanery to peck on ; And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kings are dead and rotten ; For in the Bishop there 's an iron will  --  A dead persistency when in the right , That may move heaven and earth to mutiny . ALISA ( aside , wringing her hands ) . My heart will burst . My brain asunder split ! But recognition will be , certain death ! SOBOUSKI ( continuing ) . To memory , now , I must commit the facts That are to slake the thirst of royal ears , And for which I receive more gold than honour  --  Purchase more adulation than respect . Let 's see how runs the current of events . To-morrow morn , there is to be a wedding ; To-morrow morn , Piotrawin conveyed To Stanislas in trust for his white lamb ; To-morrow eve , a fte upon the green  --  Profoundest secrets , all . Ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! As he goes toward the exit , drawing his cloak around him , ALISA rushes out and seizes him by the arm . ALISA . Villain ! base , gold-fed , smooth-faced villain ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! lest on thy head descend my vengeance ! Say to thy regal master if he dare To cross the path of that most sainted virgin , Or soil her beauty by one lecherous glance , I 'll tear the crown from his unworthy brow , And spurn it with the foot of indignation ! SOBOUSKI . Who ' rt thou that dar'st with such unblushing front To stop a gentleman ? ALISA . An honest woman , Who will expend the last drop of her veins To bring a damnd villain to just judgment . SOBOUSKI ( trying to shake her off ) . Release me , harlot ! ALISA . Not until thou'st eaten That leprous word , coined in base heart like thine . SOBOUSKI ( dashing her off violently ) . Wench ! learn the price of thy temerity . WALDIMIR ( rushing forward with sword drawn ) . Coward ! Dost dare to strike a woman ? draw ! They fight . SOBOUSKI is unarmed , and wounded . SCENE IV . Evening . The grounds before MILO 'S castle . ' MILO ' and ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The flags of Poland and Syradie floating above the eagle-mounted portal . Coloured lamps glimmering among the trees . Fountains playing amid the green foliage . Garden benches , covered with crimson velvet , occupying the angles . A band of musicians occupying a raised das , left of centre . Count WALDIMIR leaning pensively against a statue of Cupid , right of centre . Ladies and gentlemen promenading , rear of centre . Peasants dancing Mazurka , centre , seen at the rising of the curtain . MILO enters , leading his bride , followed by STANISLAS , ALISA , ladies and gentlemen , and a crowd of vassals , crying , ' Live MILO ! Live CHRISTINE ! Live STANISLAS ! ' ALISA ( aside , rushing forward ) . T is done ! ' t is done !  --  O God ! ' t is done despite !  --  And I am mad ! a poor , weak , vanquished woman ! O Fate ! that I was born to be thy sport , And see mine idols shattered by thy hand ! Young Waldimir misplaced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , proud heart ! that would not  --  could not break , And give my secret to the pitiless winds !  --  There are some marriages not registered In Heaven  --  and this , O God ! is one of them !  --  I will away ! and , though it cost my life , Sever the chain that makes them man and wife ! MILO ( coming forward with CHRISTINE on his arm ) . Sweet friends , inhabitants of Syradie , This is my bride , the priceless Pearl of Poland , And guardian angel of Piotrawin . With such a bulwark harm can reach us not . PEOPLE . Ho ! live Lord Milo ! live the Pearl of Poland ! Live Stanislas ! the pillar of the Church ! Pride of the good , and terror of the wicked ! The gentlemen applaud . The ladies fling their bouquets at CHRISTINE 'S feet . WALDIMIR comes forward , embraces MILO , drops on his knee , and kisses the hand of the bride . STANISLAS takes leave of the bridal party . The band plays the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dance commences with great animation . After a few rounds , MILO leads CHRISTINE to one of the front benches . MILO . Oh , what a happy day is this , Christine ! How all things harmonise with our glad hearts ! I bless Heaven for her prodigality , Which , not content to give to me an angel , Hath girt me round with joys of Paradise . CHRISTINE . I can not speak , my lord , the bliss I feel . It seems to me I 'm not upon the earth , But am translated to some heavenly sphere ; Yet , midst this joy , I frankly must avow , I feel the chill of some dark hovering shadow . MILO ( pressing a kiss on her brow ) . Soul of my soul ! sweet life-blood of my heart ! Bathe thy pure spirit in this sea of joy  --  So new and fresh to thy young opening life  --  Dive , my beloved , into its dizzy depths , And lose thyself in sweet delirium ! If but the shadow of a shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll hurl it backward with the arm of Love , That 's strong enough to pluck Sol out of Heaven . I feel a sadness , too , but know the why . This wondrous joy recalls my country 's woes , The which thy youthful ear hath never drunk  --  Ah ! how much sorrow hath Boleslas wrought her ! How many bosoms laid in hopeless ruin ! Where'er he pass , is fear ; where'er he pause , Are tears ; where'er he dwell , despair and death . ( Aside . ) Teach me not , Fate ! that beauty is a curse That falls upon her prostrate worshippers , Like some bewildering star cast out of Heaven ! ( To CHRISTINE . ) Adored Christine ! my sun , my moon , my star ! Thy beauty 's fame may reach his royal ears , And at the Court he may command thy presence  --  Oh ! promise me thou never wilt obey ! CHRISTINE ( rising , and posing her little gloved hand on his arm ) . The King command my presence at the Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , Who never till to-day kept company But with my nurse , my pony , and my doll , Nor converse held save with the trees and flowers ? Why , sure ! I 'll disobey , And on this cross will swear That none my heart shall sway Save thou , my gallant Pierre . My Court is thy proud castle , My sovereign lord thou art , And whether queen or vassal , My throne 's thy lofty heart . There will I reign for ever , Through good and ill renown ; To leave it monarch never Shall tempt me with his crown . Like sunny rivers meeting , And mingling into one , Then down the valleys , greeting , On towards the ocean run ; Side by side in sunny weather , Side by side ' mid wind and rain , Our lives shall flow together Till death shall make them twain . MILO ( aside ) . She is a poet  --  a heart-melting poet  --  The heiress of God 's richest , proudest gifts  --  Beauty and poesy  --  Heaven 's rarest union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For near my Paradise I hear the serpent , And feel his venomous presence in the air  --  Mine Eve  --  my beauteous Eve is doomed to fall ! ( To CHRISTINE . ) Upon thine oath I stake my happiness , My future , wherein thou art sun , and star , And moon , and all that lights my heaven of bliss . Now , let us to the company return , And show our gratitude to those who make This festival so beautiful for us . As he leads her back to the company , WALDIMIR , who has been standing near them , follows CHRISTINE with loving eyes , and thus speaks : WALDIMIR . I loved her ere I saw her face  --  I loved her for her lovely name : Her beauty and celestial grace Have kindled in my breast a flame That neither time nor tide can tame . The arrow 's quivering in my heart . I strive to draw it  --  but in vain : Mine eyes grow dim  --  my pulses start  --  Hot lava streams course every vein  --  Delirium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decree Of Fate , and never can be mine  --  Such bliss Heaven never meant for me ; But I can worship at the shrine Of beauty that is all divine . I know that I must meet her oft , And gaze into her eyes so meek , And clasp her hand so fair and soft ; But lip nor eye shall ever seek To tell the pain that can not speak . Within my heart of heart I 'll bear Her image through the world with me , And none shall ever know ' t is there , Although my guiding star it be  --  My lamp into eternity . MILO beckons WALDIMIR to join the dance . The band plays the Mazurka , and in an instant the whole multitude is in a whirl . The sound of wheels is heard . Two armed Heralds enter and announce the King . The royal car enters , escorted by a guard . BOLESLAS , in robes of State , descends , surrounded by his courtiers . The music stops , the dancers pause with signs of discontent . ALISA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he bound . I will keep nigh with dagger ready . ' MILO advances slowly , with CHRISTINE on his arm , to greet the King . BOLESLAS . Passing Piotrawin this evening , and Hearing sweet music and the sounds of joy ; And learning it was a fte in honour of The marriage of my noble equerry , Milo , with Beauty 's heir and Poland 's Pearl , I turned aside to pay them my respects . MILO . We had not hoped for so much honour , Sire  --  This is a simple family festival , Unworthy of the presence of a king ; And , had we known your Majesty so near , We had not dared to count upon your presence . This fte was organised by twice two thousand Vassals devoted to myself and bride . BOLESLAS . It pleases me to hear of their devotion And loyalty unto the Pearl of Poland , Upon whose presence Cracow counts this winter For the embellishment of all her ftes . CHRISTINE . I thank you , Sire ; I much prefer to rest At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I have sworn to do so . BOLESLAS . The oaths of beauty are revocable  --  But to the Bishop I will put the question , Full sure thou wilt obey his pious hests . CHRISTINE . Oh , yes , I will abide his sweet commands , Since with his life I know he will protect me . BOLESLAS ( looking round ) . The dance is done . I would it recommence  --  I came to bring thee joy , not drive it hence . With thee , fair lady , I would try the waltz , Which I so awkwardly just interrupted . CHRISTINE turns to MILO for a reply , He bows assent . The King encircles her waist with his arm . The band plays , and the dance recommences at every point of the grounds . After a few rounds , CHRISTINE tears herself from her royal partner , and running to MILO , who is seated on a front bench , falls swooning into his arms . The band stops  --  the company gathers round them  --  ALISA rushes at the King with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SCENE V. Midnight . An ante-room in the Castle of Milo . Shrieks heard within . The three royal favourites , masked , enter right of centre , bearing CHRISTINE in her nuptial attire , and swooning . They place her on a sofa . SOBOUSKI ( bending over her ) . She 's beautiful as Heaven ! WALISLAS ( looking in her face ) . She is , by Jove ! KOTSCHUSKI ( looking at her ) . She has Diana 's brow , and Hebe 's lids . SOBOUSKI . Venus 's mouth , and nectar-dripping lips , And , by the gods , I 'll taste them ere the King ! ( Kisses her ) . WALISLAS . Dost thou not fear the vengeance of the bridegroom ? SOBOUSKI . Between this and the waking of the bridegroom There will be time to kiss my life away . VOICES ( within ) . Murder ! Oh , murder ! murder ! murder ! thief ! SOBOUSKI . Hark ye ! the bloodhounds are upon our track ! Let us away with her to Cracow . They , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crying ' Murder ! ' and dash out in pursuit of them . SCENE VI . The bridal chamber . Weeping vassals . Lifeless form of MILO , in his nuptial attire , lying on a couch . Count WALDIMIR kneeling by it with his face concealed in his hands . The vassals shrink back . STANISLAS , in his long sable stole , his rich brown hair of yesterday white as snow , and bearing a crucifix uplifted before him , enters and kneels by the couch ; then rising , and gazing around on the weeping vassals , breaks forth : STANISLAS . The wolf ! the wolf ! the royal wolf 's been here ! Like a thief in the night , he stole into the fold , Murdered the shepherd , bore away the lamb To satiate his damnd appetite ! Look on this manly form , this cold , pale brow , On which so recently joy sat enthroned ; These lips , so eloquent with magic lore ; These love-illumined eyes , that yester-even Outshone the stars in Heaven , now sealed for ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Think of his goodness . What he was  --  and is ; His bud of bliss nipped on its eve of blooming , And , if ye can , withhold your righteous vengeance . He again weeps , then continues : The wolf ! the wolf ! the royal wolf 's been here ! O'ercome the shepherd , ravished the sweet fold  --  Hark ! hear ye not the bleating of the lamb ?

Leave them to women , and if ye be men  --  Men with kind souls  --  men with sweet , loving hearts  --  Go forth ; like trumpet-tongud tempest , thunder This deed , before which Hell turns ashy pale , Into the ears of Heaven and Earth until They , smit with horror , rise in combination , And of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arms of WALDIMIR .

A sofa near a window : a little table in front of it , on which are writing materials . Ghost of MILO , standing behind the sofa , following CHRISTINE with sorrowful eyes , as she gropes about the room , still in her bridal attire , seen at the rising of the curtain . CHRISTINE . Am I asleep ? Is this some horrid dream ? Or a reality that will undo me ? What place is this ? These things so rich and strange : They daze mine eyes ! ' T is not my bridal chamber ! That is bedecked with chaster garniture , And drapery more virgin in its hues  --  BOLESLAS enters by a secret door . It is the King ! I 'm lost ! ( He approaches . ) Aback ! Approach Me not !

Come , pen thy state , and drop it from the window . CHRISTINE ( looking up from where she is crouched ) . What do I hear ? It is my bridegroom 's voice ! The same that rapt me at the nuptial altar With music sweeter than angelic harpings . I will obey  --  will write to Waldimir  --  Creeps to the table , writes , and flings the letter from the window . As she turns around BOLESLAS re-enters . She shrieks , and flies from him . He follows her up . BOLESLAS . Silence ! fair Pearl ! make not this much ado !

Piotrawin . Evening . A dimly-lighted room in the Manor House . The glass covered . STANISLAS reclining on a couch in his dressing-gown . JEAN nodding in a fauteuil near him . STANISLAS ( running his fingers through his white hair ) . Jean , what 's the matter with my hair ? JEAN ( awaking ) . Oh , nothing , Master . STANISLAS . Bring me the glass . JEAN ( springing up ) . Oh , do n't look at it ! Do n't master ! do n't ! STANISLAS ( sternly ) . Art mad ? Why 's the glass covered ? Uncover it , and bring it instantly ! JEAN . Oh , no , no , master ! do n't look at thyself ! do n't ! STANISLAS ( rising , and pushing JEAN aside ) . Madman ! hold off thy hands ! I 'll see myself ! He falls into the arms of WALDIMIR , who enters . WALDIMIR ( replacing him on the couch ) . My lord , my lord , I find you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm weak  --  I 'm very weak . The tempest was too much this time . It broke The oak . Why have they veiled the mirror ? I 'd see the havoc that the storm has made . WALDIMIR . My lord , it is a silly superstition Our simple vassals all attach to mirrors . When death or malady is in the house , They fancy thence will look some horrid Death 's head . But calm thyself , and hear the news I bring . STANISLAS ( seizing WALDIMIR 'S arm ) . What is it ? Has my son returned to life ? WALDIMIR . Ah ! no ! but better news than that , my lord . After I saw thee safe at home this morn , Upon my swiftest steed I flew to Cracow  --  Entered the forest by the eastern gate  --  Approached the palace ' neath the spreading oaks , And paused beneath an iron-latticed window , Hoping to hear some voice or see some sign To tell me where the stolen Pearl was hidden , And on what point to bring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , Concealed behind an oak , when I beheld The fairest little hand Heaven ever made Let fall between the bars a tiny note . I seized it  --  placed it in my throbbing bosom  --  Retraced my steps  --  regained my steed  --  remounted  --  Buried my spurs half in his quivering flanks  --  And in an hour retouched Piotrawin . During this narration STANISLAS holds WALDIMIR 'S arm with a death-clasp , draws himself up halfway between a horizontal and a perpendicular , and gazes into the speaker 's face with the stare of a maniac . STANISLAS . Why razed ye not the palace to the ground ? Buried the damnd wolf beneath its ruins ? WALDIMIR ( rubbing his arm ) . Thy clasp , my lord , is too emphatical  --  Resume thy pillow  --  Jean , sit down behind him ; There , so ; now list me read . STANISLAS ( in a tearful voice ) . My little lamb , I hear it bleating still . WALDIMIR . I hear it , too ; And for its woes could shed a sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Now , lean on Jean , and hear me read the letter , Dropped from the window as if meant for me . STANISLAS . I tell thee Heaven 's at work upon our side . WALDIMIR . This letter is in evidence . Now , lean On Jean  --  there , so ; and calmly list me read it . STANISLAS . Calmly ? Oh ! ask the tempest to be calm ! The wounded lion not to roar with pain ! The stricken , gladiator not to bleed ! WALDIMIR . Jean , hold thy master till I read this letter . STANISLAS . He can not hold the tongue of agony : That must find speech , or cleave the heart asunder . WALDIMIR ( reading ) . ' I 'm in the palace of the King imprisoned , My door and every egress sentinelled ; And though a fire is burning in my brain , And blood-stained hands are still before mine eyes , Yet am I calm , because not all deserted : Pierre 's love-attund voice enrapts my ear Like tearful breathing of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with triumphant front , Entered my presence , and was put to flight By the celestial armour that surrounds me .

Oh , bear them thither with the speed of lightning , And rally gallant Poland to my rescue ; Or , if her heart be dumb  --  Oh , come thyself ! And pluck me from the rock wherein I lie , Amid dark waves that threat me with destruction ! ' CHRISTINE . ' STANISLAS . I told thee so ! I told thee so ! Ha ! ha ! ha !

O Thou who art the Judge of quick and dead , Pity my weakness and my wondrous grief ! Send me a torch-bearer from Heaven to light The difficult ways wherein Thou wilst I tread ! Send me my son  --  my shepherd of a day ! JEAN . O master , no ! Bring him not back ! Oh , do n't ! The light grows dim  --  the ghost of Milo enters , and pauses before the couch . JEAN covers his head , and WALDIMIR falls back , powerless . STANISLAS . Welcome , thrice welcome , back , ill-fated shepherd ! Fresh from the presence of the Triune Powers , Acquaint me how far Heaven my cause espouses ; Whate'er thy mission be , unfold it freely ; Withhold no word meant for mine ears , attuned To highest tension to take in God 's Will . Expose to me the hired assassin 's name , Who , like a hoar-frost , in the night-time came , And so untimely nipped thy bud of bliss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After the fte upon my nuptial night , While my fair bride was bent before the Virgin , Weary , I flung me on my couch a moment : Scarce had I touched it when sleep closed mine eyes , To ope ' no more but on my murderers , And then reclose upon the things of earth : Sobouski 's pitiless hand was on my throat , Which with one grasp sent me before my God , Unshrived , and unabsolyed of mortal sin . Abashed , I told the story of my wrong : Then , as when enemy invades a country , Dearer than life to its devoted people , They rise up as one man , one arm , one soul , All Heaven , incensed , arose against the authors Of this most cruel and untimely murder ; And since there is no earthly tribunal To try a King , and bring him to just judgment ; And since his crimes are bounded by no law Of conscience nor of country , Heaven takes sides In favour of the weak against the strong . Arouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cracow , in thy palace , And to the noble Archbishop of Poland Assign the task to wait upon the King , To lay bare to his eyes his many crimes , And ask the liberation of his captives . Christine , the priceless Pearl of Poland 's there : To me ' t is given a certain time to guard her Against the machinations of Boleslas . Fly to her aid while I return to Heaven To lay his sins before the Triune Bar . ( Exit . ) SCENE III . Cracow . Morning . The Audience Hall in the Episcopal Palace . On an estrade , rear of centre , in the episcopal fauteuil , reclines ARCHBISHOP DE GENSE , Primate of Poland , in his scarlet and ermine : on his left , in a fauteuil less elevated , sits STANISLAS , in his sable stole and white locks , uncovered . Right of centre art seated the principal noblemen of Poland ; left of centre , the archbishops , bishops , and sub-dignitaries of the Church . STANISLAS ( rising and addressing the nobles , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chevaliers and respected seigniors , Convened , you see assembled here to-day , Our venerated and beloved colleagues  --  His Highness , Pierre de Gense , Archbishop and Primate of Poland ; the Lords of Varsovie , Of Grodno , Lublin , Syriade , and Kolo , Who , now , are ready to give ear to ye , And bring your cause their best deliberations ; But first , according to our ancient usage , Swear Waldimir , your spokesman , on this Book To speak no word ye can not verify In presence of most scrupulous inquisition . WALDIMIR ( advancing and placing his right hand on the Bible , extended to him by STANISLAS ) . I swear to speak the truth in fear of Heaven , And in the presence of the hovering Spirit Whose sacred rights we 're here to vindicate . STANISLAS . Now , to our Primate and these Bishops , speak As doth become a noble and a Christian ; Bare to their mental eyes the moral cancer That 's secretly consuming Poland 's heart ; Ring in their ears the shrieks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despairing fathers ; Emmove their hearts until their hands , perforce , Tear from the body-politic this ulcer That  --  that  --  speak , Waldimir ! speak ! tell it all ! Sits down , and lays his face in his hands . WALDIMIR ( addressing the PRIMATE and BISHOPS ) . My lord , and dignitaries of the Church , Absorbed by holy things , ye may not know The wrongs endured by Poland and her children In consequence of the unbridled passions Of him whose name I yet forbear to mention . Till now , my lords , restrained by love of peace , And Poland 's ancient reverence for her chiefs , The general indignation has been silent ; But it has reached the limit of sweet patience ; The slumbering volcano is awaking ; The lava hisses  --  Earth trembles  --  Heaven quakes  --  The smothered fires are ready to burst forth , And with their thunders shake the pallid world . Your Lordships ' ears have , doubtless , drunk , ere this , The many rumours of the brilliant union Contracted ' twixt Lord Milo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  A gem so fair , so chaste , so beautiful , The sun , the moon , the stars  --  all Heaven and Earth To its perfection yield their spotless lustre . Know ye , that on the evening of this marriage , Boleslas , like a shadowy bird of prey , Descended ' mid the gay festivities , Danced with the bride , and breathed death in her ear ? That in the dead hour of that festive night , His favourites , Sobouski , Walislas , Kotschuski , masked and armed , the castle entered , Murdered the bridegroom on his nuptial-couch , And to their master bore the beauteous bride ? PRIMATE . Impossible ! impossible ! my lord ! WALDIMIR . Impossible , my lord ! Behold the proof ! ( Hands him CHRISTINE 'S letter . ) And when thou hast perused that solemn missive , Let fall thy lofty glance upon thy left , ( Points to STANISLAS ) And there behold the monument of grief  --  The noble ruin of a mighty temple O'erthrown and shattered by this moral storm , And say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( returning the letter ) . Ah ! ah ! ' t is very sad ! ' T is very sad ! WALDIMIR . Indeed it is , my lord ! ' T is wondrous sad ! ( Points to STANISLAS . ) Survey those piteous tears  --  those snow-white locks , Drained of their golden sap and silken lustre By one fell thunderbolt of ruthless sorrow , And from thy throne of dignity descend Down to the level of his monstrous grief  --  Weep with him , moan , sigh  --  wring thy hands with him  --  Be unto him what Christ was to the Leper  --  Touch him , revive him  --  send him leaping forth Like fount unchained beneath the smile of God . He had , my lord , a little blue-eyed lamb , Which in his bosom eighteen years he 'd carried ; Sheltered it  --  nursed it  --  loved it as his life : A youthful shepherd saw it  --  loved it too ; And to his tender care he did confide it ; And on that very night the royal wolf Broke into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him the bleating lamb . Pity ! my lord ! he hears its cries even now ! They tear his heartstrings like thrice barbd arrows ; They bend him , break him  --  they are killing him ! Oh ! save him ! save him ! Thou who art so strong , Fly to the royal harem ! seek Boleslas ! Appeal not to the King , but to the man ! Around him weave thy magic spells of speech ; Lift him upon the wings of eloquence Until he see the grandeur of his crimes , And render liberty to captive beauty  --  Oh , do ! Oh , do ! my lord ! I pray , beseech thee To save this bleached , bent oak ! Let it not fall Quite to the ground ! but lift it  --  prop it up  --  Brace it until it take fresh root , and draw Into its shrunken veins new sap  --  new life ! During this appeal , STANISLAS slides from his seat and creeps on his knees towards the speaker , who is on his knees before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into each other 's arms , and remain thus during the Primate 's speech . PRIMATE ( wiping a timid tear from his cheek ) . Noble chevaliers , we have heard your cause With patient and dispassionate attention , And unreservedly to you confess The shame and sorrowful regret we feel In presence of the truth of the shortcomings Of him who guides so well the ship of State ; Who through so many perilous storms hath brought her Safely , though oft dismasted , into port . If sympathy could bring the dead to life , And reinstate them in their nuptial rights ; To household-altars give their idols back ; If tears could wash the dark spots from the sun , Then were it done , my lords , and quickly done ; But all the waters in the heart of earth Would not suffice to make them one shade whiter : For wrongs , such as you lay before these presence , The Pouvoir of the Church is impotent ; And as the criminal is the Temporal-Court , Ye have no remedy save prayers and tears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in harmony with all the world ; And disobeying this advice would be To seek occasion of dissension with Him who holds in his hands both peace and war , The destinies , my lords , of Church and State : To interfere would be the Church 's downfall ; To knock from under her her corner stone : Deprive her of her royal recognition , And who would then our imposts us deliver ? Who authorise our pious institutions ? Encourage and sustain our goodly works ? Abandoned to the simple charity And sole sustainment of our faithful Brebis  --  Our golden crosses broken  --  we would be Compelled to be contented with the bton Of the Apostles ; and I , myself , confess I slightly understand the Apostleships , Without the miracles and sanctities . Then let us try , as long as possible , Noble chevaliers , to preserve the peace And sweet conciliation of the Church ; And be content to pray the Lord our God Upon behalf of sinners and their victims . Such is , I know , the aggregate opinion Of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WALDIMIR 'S bosom with a heavy groan . The noblemen look at each other with astonishment , and the bishops , after nodding assent to the Primate , hang down their heads . STANISLAS ( disengaging himself from WALDIMIR 'S arms , and rising to his feet ) . My noble lords , and venerated colleagues , God keep me from an undervaluation Of the wise admonition of the Apostle , In recommending peace and harmony . The Church , I dare affirm , had never more At heart these mighty goods than at this moment ; And that , when she consents to lose them , ' t is Non possumus enforces it upon her . Devoid of peace  --  which is her soul and sinew  --  You 'd see , my lords , how much more she 'd desire it Than those who recommend it unto her . Peace and conciliation she 'd then teach By recommending virtue to the mighty ; And would replace her crosses by the bton , Rather than covenant with royal crime , And to the great legitimate the vices For which she every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , He said  --  ' Chastise ye sinners , follow them , Adjure them , and fear not ye sin in making Them hear , and understand the words of wrath . ' I ask , my lords , if kings be here excepted ? And add  --  Saint Ambrose did not thus believe ; And though I be unworthy of Saint Ambrose , I 'll strive to make this new Theodosius hear The voice of truth . Armed only with the cross And Christian grace , I 'll seek this royal pagan . PRIMATE . If thou dost beard the lion in his den , And dost get bitten , cry not to the Church . She 's given thee warning , and will hearken not . STANISLAS . My lord , suppose you had a little lamb  --  WALDIMIR ( springing to his feet ) . My lord , my lord , appeal not to his heart ! Its portals are all locked with golden keys . Excuse him . Emotion 's unbecoming ermine . T ' anoint the blind man 's eyes  --  to touch the leper  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretching his pale trembling hands heavenward ) . O Thou , who rul'st the Church above , below ; Who see'st the heart though mountains of fine gold Be piled on it , to these wise men assembled , In thine own way make manifest thy will , And teach them that , though Mammon reign on earth , Justice and Virtue reign in heaven ! A soft mist fills the hall  --  the ghost of MILO glides in and pauses before the Primate . Behold , my Lord Primate , mine advocate ! PRIMATE . What ! a ghost raised up to plead before me ? ' T is an impostor ! I will listen not . Away ! away ! perfidious conjurors ! Who with fell arts would steal away my senses  --  Away ! away ! He swoons  --  the bishops rush forward to his aid  --  all becomes dark . SCENE IV . A dimly-lighted cabinet in the Palace of the King . The King and WALISLAS seated at a table , left of centre , playing at chess . Sobouski and Kotschuski looking on . Ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Guards lingering about the entrance to the cabinet . BOLESLAS ( knocking over the chessmen in a fury ) . Checkmated ! by the holy gods , checkmated ! What is the matter ? Have I lost my wits ? I bring my men out well , but they 're misplaced , As if the devil were at play among them . Array again the armies , Walislas , And let us have the rubber with King's-Gambit . Fortune in that , perchance , will favour me More than she hath done in the Bishop's-Opening . All laugh . The move is mine , and if I lose the rubber , I shall be sure the devil 's on the tapis ( moves ) . King 's pawn to king 's fourth-square , my gallant knight : WALISLAS ( moving ) . King 's pawn to king 's fourth-square , your majesty . BOLESLAS . King 's bishop 's pawn moves to king 's bishop 's fourth . WALISLAS . Which I will take according to the gambit . BOLESLAS . My king 's knight jumps o'er to king 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pawn advances to his fourth . BOLESLAS . My royal bishop seeks queen 's bishop 's fourth , And menacingly looks on your king 's guard . GHOST moves it to queen 's knight 's fifth . WALISLAS . And my king 's bishop holds queen 's bishop 's fourth , And from your king cuts off his aide-de-camp . BOLESLAS . Then , shall my queen march on king 's castle 's fifth , And look defiance on your trembling king . WALISLAS . His valiant knight attacks her majesty . BOLESLAS ( taking the King 's bishop 's pawn with his queen ) . Checkmate ! ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! Checkmate ! ha ! ha ! WALISLAS . Checkmate ! ha ! ha ! My king now takes your queen  --  ha ! BOLESLAS ( aghast ) . My queen ! King 's bishop covers her attack ! WALISLAS . Your bishop stands upon your queen 's knight 's fifth , Leaving his queen unsheltered in the field . BOLESLAS ( looking ) . By all the gods ! ' t is so ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've lost the rubber : In three games he has tripped up my success . GHOST moves bishop back to queen 's fourth . Look ! look ! ' t is now upon queen 's bishop 's fourth ! KOTSCHUSKI ( forcing the KING back into his seat ) . Sit down , your Majesty . Be calm ; ' t is nothing ! BOLESLAS ( trembling ) . A hand as thin as air I saw remove it Back to queen 's bishop 's fourth , where I reposed it ! I 'll cause the Pearl of Poland to be strangled ; For since her presence here I 've seen but ghosts And goblins , and the devil 's hand at chess ! SOBOUSKI ( laughing ) . We 'll call his Majesty the ghost-seer . Ha ! ha BOLESLAS . Silence , Sobouski ! Sing me a gay song ; Something to lift my spirits  --  I am sad . SOBOUSKI ( accompanying himself on the guitar ) : The Pearl , The Pearl of Poland , Fairer by far is she Than fairest gem of Ophir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and haughty , And knows not to obey ; And with celestial armour , Boleslas keeps at bay  --  BOLESLAS . Silence ! I asked for something gay , Sobouski : Something to drive away these ghosts and goblins , And lift my spirits to their wonted level . SOBOUSKI ( laughing inwardly ) . One happy day in coach of State , And royal robes arrayed , Boleslas sought the nuptial fte Of Poland 's loveliest maid . And taken by her wondrous charms , As must a gallant King , He took the lady in his arms , And danced around the ring  --  BOLESLAS ( furious ) . Silence , Sobouski ! Thou art most provoking ! When I am sad , thou ever must be glad ! Some strange , discordant spirit doth attend me Where'er I go , befogging all my thoughts , Upsetting glasses , and misplacing chessmen . Did ever mortal play a sorrier game Than I have played to-night with Walislas ? Who , at the best , is but a sorry player . WALISLAS . Your playing , Sire , doth justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lucky with the fair . ' Upon the latter game I 'd bet my head Upon your Majesty 's triumph and gain . BOLESLAS ( mourfully ) . Dost thou call that a triumph and a gain ? Illusion shall not carry me away . Such triumphs fail to satisfy the heart ; And as to gain , I 'm poorer than before . Favourites laugh . SOBOUSKI . In that , I 'm quite of your opinion , Sire ; But as to difficulty of the games , I see but little difference ' twixt the two : In both some cavalier must be blocked Who 's charged with the defending of the lady ; And when one 's driven him well into the corner , It needs but little talent to o'erwhelm him , And captive bear away the precious Pearl . Ha ! BOLESLAS . Silence , Sobouski ! Wilt e'er be a fool ? SOBOUSKI . In the same play , the fool rare leaves the King ; And doctors say that madness is contagious . Ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea its foam , By inward agitation . Ha ! ha ! ha ! BOLESLAS . Silence , Sobouski ! Silence , I command thee ! Henceforth , I recognise the right of none To speak to me upon this galling subject . CESLAS enters , and announces STANISLAS , who has been for some time in sight , hearing the conversation . The favourites burst into roars of laughter on the announcement of the Bishop . Well , Ceslas , bid his saintship enter . Ha ! ha ! ha ! Conduct him hither with due ceremony . STANISLAS follows the old guard with a slow , majestic step , till he stops before the King , who points to a fauteuil , which he refuses to accept , and remains standing , and regarding the favourites with a fixed gaze , while they turn their faces away with low tittering bursts of laughter . STANISLAS ( with great dignity ) . Sire , what I 'd say might uselessly fatigue These gentlemen . I pray your Majesty , Therefore , to spare to them the pain of listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retire : they obey , and STANISLAS takes the fauteuil . BOLESLAS . What new and pressing matters have arisen Within the Church to-day to send thee hither ? STANISLAS . Your Majesty , the Church is always pressed When at her heart she hath her children 's welfare . I came to speak to you upon the subject Your Majesty just said ' none hath the right . ' BOLESLAS . What ! you have listened ? STANISLAS . Involuntarily , Sire . One who had been more timid had retired , But I leaned on your magnanimity . Esteem and admiration such rare courage Might in your royal breast , perchance , inspire . BOLESLAS . Such daring 's dangerous . Speak upon thine errand . STANISLAS . Having naught new wherewith you to acquaint , I will proceed at once upon the issue . I come before you as a suppliant , The broken-hearted father of a family , Horribly outraged , Sire  --  BOLESLAS . Horribly outraged ! STANISLAS . Yes , Sire , yes  --  horribly outraged  --  horribly ! While you enjoy serenity of conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were born a Christian  --  reared upon Your mother 's knee , and often heard her read The lesson which I would recall to you . A Prophet once to Israel 's great King said  --  ' Two men inhabited the selfsame city , The one was rich , the other one was poor . The rich man was possessed of mighty troops ; The poor man , Sire , had nothing but one lamb  --  One precious , little , snowy , blue-eyed lamb , Which he had sheltered from its infancy  --  His meat and drink with it divided , Sire '  --  BOLESLAS . Yes , yes , I know ; but speak upon thine errand . STANISLAS . Now , Sire , one day , this rich man who possessed So many lambs , did take it in his head To steal the poor man 's lamb , and kill his shepherd . BOLESLAS . ' T is false ! ' t is false ! I say  --  STANISLAS . And killed both , Sire , For there are different ways of killing lambs . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exclaimed  --  ' That rich man was God 's enemy ! ' BOLESLAS . Pontiff ! you are insulting Royalty ! STANISLAS . Very far from that , Sire ; I admire it much . And when this parable the Prophet ended , He said to this great King , ' Thou'rt this rich man ! ' The King then wept , and tore his raiment , Sire , And rolled upon the ground , exclaiming wildly  --  ' I acknowledge it ! I 've sinned before the Lord ! ' Think'st , Sire , this was insulting Royalty ? BOLESLAS ( aside ) . He 'll have me in the madhouse if I list him . ( To STANISLAS . ) Stop there ! I warn you to stop where you are ! I feel not the contrition of your King . Away ! insult my dignity no more ! STANISLAS . Your royal dignity I much respect ; But , Sire , you understand my parable , And if you act not on it  --  woe ! woe ! to Poland ! BOLESLAS . Enough ! enough ! your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect before you send me hence . Think of your mother ; of your ancient glory ; And , above all , of your immortal soul . BOLESLAS . Pontiff , I 'll hear no more ! Stop where you are ! Ho ! guards ! conduct the Bishop from my presence . The guards approach . STANISLAS . Unhappy , most unhappy Prince ! dost mean it ? Then , hear the last words of my parable . And , by this Prophet , God said to this King  --  ' I pardon thee , but since thou me offend'st , Thy sword shall never be victorious more . Thy wives I will deliver to thy neighbour , And thou shalt lose the children born to thee . ' And to that King God did all that He promised . BOLESLAS . Pontiff , away ! Pray , pray for me , but go ! STANISLAS . The days of miracles are not all passed . Between this world and God 's high judgment-seat Are myriads of invisible messengers , Who take notes of our good and evil deeds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pontiff , ' t is false ! I tell thee to be gone ! STANISLAS ( lifting his eyes in silent prayer , while the GHOST glides in front of the KING ) . Behold the shepherd of the stolen lamb ! Hear him , your Majesty , then ope ' thy harem , And to domestic altars give their idols . Speak , Ghost , poor wandering and unhappy shade ! Open thy fleshless lips ; in thy tear-moving voice , Attuned by angels , read this obdurate King The schedule of his crimes before God 's bar . BOLESLAS ( concealing his head in his mantle ) . Guards , seize the Pontiff ! Seize the Ghost ! Away With them  --  away ! The ghost vanishes  --  guards drag STANISLAS out , crying , ' Woe to BOLESLAS ! ' The King then peers from his mantle . They 're gone : I am alone . That monk lit in my heart the fires of hell , And marshalled round them all my ghastly sins . O God ! were I a better man ! But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doth say the law . I am awakened on the brink of ruin . If I had listened to that priest much longer He 'd led me straight into the cloister . He 's a wonderful man . A master spirit  --  Smooth-tongued , contained , and subtle as the devil , And unto me a deadly enemy . I must find means to clip the eagle 's wings  --  To cut the hamstrings of this Hercules ; And for such business I have habile friends . Ho ! guards ! my courtiers  --  my courtiers ! He wipes the dew of fear from his brow , and composes his features into calmness , that they might not see his weakness . Favourites re-enter . Ha ! friends , ye fled before the enemy , While boldly I alone sustained his fire . Ha ! ha ! you see I have not lost much blood ; But my position is intenable  --  I can not fight beneath a cross so heavy . The shepherd 's turned his crook into a switch : And God in Heaven knows I 'm ill disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your Majesty , the remedy is easy : It is to break the switch upon the shoulders Of him who wills to use it over thine . And break it , too , so thoroughly that he Nor anyone can gather up the pieces . BOLESLAS . ' T were letter to paralyse it than to break it . The last might put us on the kingdom 's back , Which post might prove somewhat embarrassin We must extend a net beneath his feet , In the entanglement of which he 'll lose More than life . He 'll lose action , liberty , Esteem  --  his wondrous popularity . SOBOUSKI . Thank Heaven ! I have the net here in my pocket . BOLESLAS . Would't not be nearer right to thank the devil ? SOBOUSKI . Mock me not , Sire ; if you desire to cage This sacerdotal lion , you may need me . KOTSCHUSKI . To shut his cage-door will be easy , Sire . SOBOUSKI .

Your Greatness also knows he left three nephews  --  Pierre , Jacques , and Sulislas , who are his next Of kin ; and lawful born , his heirs-at-law , And rightful claimants of Piotrawin . Now , add these bare-faced facts unto the oaths Of eighteen worthy vouchers who are loyal , And you can sink his saintship to perdition . What dost thou think ? BOLESLAS ( flinging his arms around SOBOUSKI ) . I think Sobouski worth A kingdom to his King . Ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! It is power or the wheel . Great men are rare ; And in his saintship 's stead I 'll make thee Bishop . KOTSCHUSKI ( bowing to the ground ) . Bishop Sobouski , I salute your saintship . WALISLAS . Th ' episcopal promotion of Sobouski , Doubtless , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his conscience should take holy orders . BOLESLAS . You 're charming , gentlemen ; but on this subject Not another word . Sobouski 's idea 's good , And on it I am going to act at once . Summon the claimants of Piotrawin , Within a few days , on the plain thereby , I will convene , and hold the royal Colloque , And there will have a care that Stanislas Appear to answer for the crime of murder . ALL . Ho ! live Boleslas ! live the King of Poland ! BOLESLAS . No ; live Sobouski , Justice , and the Law ! Re-enter GHOST by a small secret door , followed by CHRISTINE , who is crazy , and attired in a loose white robe , her golden hair flowing nearly to the ground . They pause near the joyous group . CHRISTINE recognises SOBOUSKI , and draws a dagger from her bosom . SOBOUSKI . ' T is justice and the King against a priest . Monk Stanislas for murder of Lord Milo , Appropriation of his lands and chattels . BOLESLAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Who shall have it ? ALL . The King . BOLESLAS ( crossing his hands ) .

The King espies the GHOST , which hovers near her , and staggers backward aghast . The curtain falls on tableau , to low solemn music . END OF ACT II . ACT III . SCENE I. Piotrawin . Morning . A plain before the village , encumbered with tents , troops , ana peasants , surrounded by their chariots , children , and animals . In front of centre rears an estrade , surmounted by statues of Peace and Justice . Between them , in a rich fauteuil under a golden das , sits BOLESLAS in robes of State , surrounded by Ms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their purple mantles . Right of estrade stand the royal guard ; left of it , the justiciers and ushers ; front of guard , a crowd of plaintiffs and defendants ; front of justiciers and ushers , a crowd of witnesses . Passing to and fro on the plain , accompanied by trumpeters and a choir , are armed heralds bearing a banner , on which is painted the Judgment of Solomon . As they advance in front of the estrade , the choir sing : Wrong , treachery , and falsehood This day ' re to be o'erthrown  --  Truth from the dust uplifted , And Justice mount her throne : Then , come , ye lords and ladies Who feed on nuptial rue  --  Come all ye fair-haired maidens Whose lovers are untrue : Come all who are downtrodden By perfidy or might Before the King Boleslas , And have your wrongs set right . Guns announce the opening of the sance ; BOLESLAS rises and looks round on the vast assemblage with a pleasing smile . BOLESLAS . Children of Poland , and my duteous subjects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming health and blessed prosperity . From earliest time your chiefs have claimed the privilege Of re-convening every year this Colloque , Which purposes the banishment of wrong , Settling your quarrels and your litigations , Defending th ' oppressed against th ' oppressor , and Of re-establishing among you peace , Content , good-will , and social harmony . Such is the end of this time-honoured Conference , To hold which for your weal I 'm here to-day . People cry , ' Live BOLESLAS ! ' Happy the people who find in their King A father , friend , and conscientious guide ; Happy the King who feels it his first duty His children to defend against oppression . Whate'er your quarrels , bring them here to-day ; Whate'er your wrongs , lay them before this bar ; Whate'er your sorrows , pour them freely out ; Whate'er your wounds , uncover them that I In hem may pour the Balm of Gilead . People cry , ' Live BOLESLAS ! Live the King of Poland ! ' The sance , now , is open . Justiciers , call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JUSTICIER . Your Majesty , the most important cause , As in our judgment seems , is that of three Chevaliers : Pierre , Jacques , and Sulislas , Nephews , and heirs-at-law of Pierre de Milo . These gentlemen in their joint names bring suit For the rendition of Piotrawin , Property of their loved lamented uncle , Which Stanislas acquired the day he died , And for the which they vouch he never paid ; And , to avoid which payment , they believe He did assassinate their noble kinsman . BOLESLAS . These are grave charges ' gainst our pious prelate , And with much proof , and strong , must needs be propped . Ushers , conduct his saintship to the bar  --  With all the ceremony due his rank . The ushers thread the crowd with their btons , and return in a few moments , followed by STANISLAS , leaning on the arm of Count WALDIMIR . Every head of his party is uncovered as he passes : some fall on their knees , and essay to kiss his hand ; some touch the edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceive Divinity ; and some cry , ' Live , saintly bishop ! ' As he approaches the estrade the King points to a rich fauteuil , which he accepts , and WALDIMIR takes his place behind it . Most venerated and belovd Bishop , It grieves me sore to see your saintship holding The fauteuil of a criminal before me  --  STANISLAS ( springing to his feet ) . I , hold the fauteuil of a criminal ! Of what am I accused , your Majesty ? BOLESLAS . Of murder  --  STANISLAS ( in a voice of thunder ) . Murder ! BOLESLAS . Ay , the murder of Lord Milo , Your daughter 's bridegroom , and my noble subject . STANISLAS ( sarcastically ) . Stealing the lamb , too , for the royal wolf ? For , he who killed the shepherd stole the lamb , And bore it bleating to his damnd den . ' T is true , your Majesty , my son was murdered Upon that fatal day that saw him wed ; But is his blood upon these trembling hands That could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , Sire ! see there the guilty spots Upon the hands of two who sit by thee ! Blood-spots appear on the hands of WALISLAS and KOTSCHUSKI as they lift them to hide their faces . Look ! look ! behold the crimson witnesses ! Whose testimony ' s strong as holy writ ! BOLESLAS ( deadly pale ) . Sit down ! such flights of fancy ill become One in the sige of a criminal  --  STANISLAS . A criminal ! ha ! BOLESLAS . Silence , priest ! sit down ! Lest on your head descend our royal vengeance ! STANISLAS falls back into the fauteuil , and drops his head on his breast with a heavy sigh . I am not able to believe your Eminence Capable of the crimes against your King With which you here so grievously stand charged ; But , such your saintship knows is my position As umpire of my people 's holy rights , Holding between my hands the scales of Justice , That I must give due weight to great and small ; And here of persons no respecter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , According to the evidence adduced . STANISLAS ( rising ) . Who 're my accusers ? Let them speak before me . BOLESLAS . Pierre , Jacques , and Sulislas de Milo , rise , And state your charges ' gainst his sanctity . PIERRE ( the eldest of the Nephews ) . Your Majesty , we claim rendition of Piotrawin , our uncle Pierre 's estate , To which we are at law the rightful heirs ; And which he deeded to his sanctity Upon the day that saw him wed and dead : And no receipt of payment for the same Has to this day , your Majesty , been found . We pray his sanctity for the receipt , Or , the rendition of the property : If neither he bestow us , we 'll proceed ' Gainst him for murder and appropriation . STANISLAS ( springing up ) . For murder and appropriation ! Liars ! Base , gold-fed , fraudful claimants ! have a care ! BOLESLAS . Silence ! sit down , monk ! You have heard the charges , What have you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sarcastic smile ) . I say , your Majesty , that if Lord Milo Could look down from that world which he inhabits , And see his kin before this tribunal With such persistent lies upon their lips , He 'd blush , and plead with Heaven for liberty Here to descend to contradict these charges . BOLESLAS . Ye 've heard his answer : what have ye to say ? PIERRE . With indignation we protest against it , And claim the quittance or Piotrawin . BOLESLAS ( with a smile of compassion ) . But , can your Greatness not produce the quittance ? Some line or sign in proof of payment made ? STANISLAS . No , Sire ; and ' t is because they know none doth exist That they do here persistently demand it : They know full well their uncle would not rob That happy day of time enough to give it , And that his death perfected the default ; But , happily for my cause , I have that which Is better , Sire , than mere material paper ; I have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I have the testimony Of conscientious vouchers who are here , And who were present at the signing , Sire , And who will put these claimants to the blush BOLESLAS . Wilt point them out ? STANISLAS ( handing a paper ) . On this their names are writ . BOLESLAS . Ushers , conduct the Bishop 's vouchers hither ; As morning sunbeams backward drive the mist That hangs upon the lofty mountain top , I trust these vouchers may dispel the cloud That overcasts the honour of his saintship . The ushers find the vouchers among the crowd , and conduct them before the tribunal . Vouchers , ye know his sanctity , the accused ? A VOUCHER . We do , your Majesty : ' t is Stanislas . BOLESLAS . Saw ye the payment for Piotrawin ? VOUCHER . Never , your Majesty , saw we such payment . BOLESLAS . Were ye present at the signing of the deed ? VOUCHER . Never , your Majesty . BOLESLAS . Ye may retire : But say , your Eminence , have you no other Witnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth ; And God forgive who bear false testimony ! A great tumult arises in the crowd . Those in favour of the King cry , ' No receipt  --  no witnesses  --  the bishop ' s guilty ! ' and make a rush towards him , when WALDIMIR steps before them with drawn sword . WALDIMIR . Back ! miscreants ! advance another step , And one by one I 'll cut ye down like grass !  --  A back ! Upon the peril of your lives Touch not a hair of that grief-blanchd head ! BOLESLAS . Count Waldimir , by what authority Dare you assume command in royal presence ? WALDIMIR . By the authority of Heaven , Sire , That gives a man the right to shield his friend Against the darts of merciless murderers . Has he not drunk enough of gall already ? The bishop 's party cry , ' Yes , yes ! down with false claimants ! perjured vouchers ! ' and rush towards claimants and vouchers . STANISLAS . Hold , friends ! stir not in anger for my sake ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly ascends the first step of the estrade , turns his pale face towards the people , and stretches his trembling hands heaven-ward . The people , awed , fall on their knees in silence . O King of Heaven ! Just Judge of quick and dead ! That with thy glance dost mark the sparrow 's fall , And grasp'st the meaning of vast multitudes ! Since here , before this royal conference , Justice is dumb , and truth lies crushed to earth , And all is lost to me and to my cause , It is to thy Tribunal I appeal , Before which falsehood dare not lift its head , Nor gold-bought vouchers give false testimony ! The King and his favourites laugh ; the people cry , ' Hear ! ' Your Majesty , grant me three days ' delay , And here , before this earthly tribunal , I will produce a witness who shall tell You the whole truth  --  and nothing but the truth : Here , in these presence , on myself I take The obligation in three days from this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead will fail me not as have the living , And God , who knows my heart , will be with me ! As he descends the estrade , the royal party makes another rush towards him . WALDIMIR again steps before them . WALDIMIR . Back ! miscreants ! cowards ! stir another step ! And , by the God that rules , I 'll slay ye all ! BOLESLAS ( rising ) . Children of Poland , hold ! all vengeance stay ! Respect his person , and his sacred stole ; Although accused , he is not yet condemned ; And from the cloud that now o'ershadows him , He may emerge as spotless as the sun : To give him , then , all chances of defence , I will postpone this Colloque for three days : Go to your homes , or rest ye where ye will In peace and harmony , and in God 's fear , Until the hour of reassembling here . The curtain falls on tableau , to slow music . END OF ACT III . ACT IV . SCENE I. Piotrawin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crucifix . Count WALDIMIR standing behind him . The Bishop rises with a smile suffusing his face , and flings his arms around WALDIMIR . STANISLAS . Count Waldimir ! most noble Waldimir ! The only one in all the world who dares To stand by me amid the cruel storm , My prayer is heard and answered  --  I shall conquer  --  Triumph o'er wrong : of this , I have the vouch Of Heaven  --  WALDIMIR . What if it fail ? STANISLAS . Heaven never fails ! It is the human , not divine , that fails . A miracle is to be wrought : but He Who said  --  ' Let there be light ! ' and there was light  --  Uncounted worlds , like tops , spun into space , Rotating according to eternal laws  --  ' Let space divide the waters from the waters , The day be separated from the night , The earth produce her fruits ! ' and it was so  --  Can bid the dead arise , and be obeyed . For myself , Waldimir , and for my cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've many . WALDIMIR . What , my lord ? STANISLAS . Waldimir , thou lov'st my daughter . WALDIMIR . How dost thou know ? I never did confess . STANISLAS . Woe 's wound my senses to the omnipresent : I see , and hear , and feel , and know all things , As if my brain were thought 's illumined centre : The seer 's prophetic vision 's mine : I see Boleslas plant his sabre here  --  Lays his hand on his heart . WALDIMIR . O Heaven ! STANISLAS . I would not leave my lamb without a shepherd  --  Waldimir , it is thine  --  WALDIMIR ( falling on his knees ) . Mine ! mine ! my lord ? STANISLAS . Ay , thine : deliver it  --  take it to thy fold , Keep it , according to the sacrament ; Be unto it a tender , loving shepherd ; And , whether in this world or in the next , Mine orisons for thee shall plead for ever . WALDIMIR ( kissing his hands ) . I will deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in its virgin purity , And set it down between thee and the king , Or in the effort render up this life , Which is a bagatelle without the Pearl ! STANISLAS ( lifting him to his feet ) . Now go , my son , and leave me till the third , ( aside ) Which will be my last day upon this earth . WALDIMIR reaches the door , then turning , rushes back into the open arms of the Bishop , as he stands like a broken column . WALDIMIR . Oh , let me stay with thee ! Oh , let me stay ! Thou need'st the consolation of a son . STANISLAS . My consolation is not of this world . Now go , my son , and meet me at the Colloque : Thy care on that occasion I may need . The Bishop presses a kiss on the brow of WALDIMIR , and waves him to depart : he obeys , and the Prelate continues solus : Fail , fail ?  --  I fail ? Heaven is not so unjust ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Epics , And filled his soul with their eternal light , That fails : who never read the luminous volumes That line the libraries of the firmament , That fails : whose prayers were never entered in The ledger of the sky ; whose songs of praise And hymns of adoration never rapt Beatific ears ; whose purblind eyes bend earthward , And never look Heaven in the face , that fails . Fail , fail ?  --  I fail ? It is impossible ! I , who have pondered every volume flung Out of the fathomless fountains of the Godhead , And of their inspiration drunk until My soul , incbriate , fell upon its face , And lay abashed and helpless in the Presence Of Triune majesty  --  left to be vanquished By dog-toothed lies and hell-born machinations ? I , who have wrestled with gigantic Passion  --  Battled with sin and Satan till my soul , Like veteran warrior 's scarred all over , fail ? I , who have ope 'd the gates of Heaven with prayer , And treated with the Triune Powers , fail ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me , And in this hour of trial He 'll not desert me ! Falls on his knees before the altar . SCENE II . Cracow . The great entrance to the Palace of the King . Sentinels pacing to and fro on each side . Enter WALDIMIR at the head of insurgents . SENTINEL . What seek ye here in absence of the King ? WALDIMIR ( grasping the hilt of his sword ) . We seek the Pearl of Poland here detained . SENTINEL . We 'll render nothing in our master 's absence , Who to Piotrawin is gone to-day To hold the Colloque , and adjudge the guilty  --  WALDIMIR ( drawing his sword ) . Then will we raze the palace to the ground , And let its weeping captives forth  --  SENTINEL . Aback ! Advance another step , and  --  WALDIMIR ( stabbing him ) . Death is thine ! He kills the second sentinel , and rushes into the court over their dead bodies . Follow me , gentlemen , follow me to the rescue ! A crowd of armed servants dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in leaps WALDIMIR , while the combat goes on without  --  in an instant flames burst out through the windows , and shrieking women in dishabille rush out by the different portals . VOICES ( amid the crowd ) . Waldimir ! Waldimir ! come forth  --  come forth ! Save thyself ! save the fair Christine ! save Poland 's Pearl ! WALDIMIR appears among the fames , bearing in his arms the senseless form of CHRISTINE . As he descends , a hundred voices cheer him . SCENE III The whole depth of stage . The plain before Piotrawin , encumbered as on the first day of the Colloque . People talking in whispers and casting mysterious glances towards the entrance . The King , surrounded by the councillors of State , is seated between the statues of Peace and Justice . KOTSCHUSKI and WALISLAS are looking out . BOLESLAS ( descending the estrade ) . Gentlemen , what see ye there upon the horizon ? KOTSCHUSKI . We 're looking for the ghost , your Majesty . BOLESLAS . His ghostship 's late . Methought the dead were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your Majesty . BOLESLAS . He 's slept so long , methinks he might rise earlier . KOTSCHUSKI . Perchance , he 's stopped to break his fast  --  ha ! ha ! Or quench his thirst  --  BOLESLAS . Ghosts only walk at night , Like certain gentry who love not the light . WALISLAS . This is a morning ghost , your Majesty , That takes the air by daylight  --  ha ! ha ! ha ! BOLESLAS . Truly , this is an interesting morning , My friends , a page in Poland 's history . What will become of that ill-fated bishop When , like an avalanche the verdict takes him That I have been preparing all the night ? Which way will look he ? Whither fly for refuge ? Where seek a shelter from the public scorn ? Really , his saintship 's fate disturbs my peace . KOTSCHUSKI ( laughing ) . By my faith , Sire , if tak'st it thus to heart , I 'll charge myself with finding him a place . Madame , the Baroness Kotschuski , is In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her I will guarantee him bliss  --  A sort of paradise  --  ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! WALISLAS ( looking out ) . See the procession ! look , look , what a crowd ! By my faith , Sire , I think all Poland ' s there ! BOLESLAS . But do you really see the ghost , Walislas ? Look well ; for he is there , be sure  --  ha ! WALISLAS . By my faith , one might really think so , Sire ; For by the bishop walks a sort of phantom Which he is holding by the hand  --  look , Sire ! BOLESLAS ( looking out ) . It is true  --  what a piece of jugglery ! ' T is mocking God and man  --  but to your posts , And help to play the drama of the ghost . The King ascends the estrade , followed by his favourites , and gains his seat just as several of his guard and his physician enter in haste and consternation . What is the matter , Ceslas ? What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lifted thy hair erect , and drawn thine eyes A mile out of thy head ? Hast seen the ghost ? CESLAS ( breathing hard ) . Yes , Sire , and all my comrades with me saw it  --  O Sire ! it is no fiction ! no illusion ! I looked into the grave ; for I had doubts : I laughed and made light of the powers of Heaven . O Sire ! O Sire ! it is a wicked thing To mock that which outmeasures reason 's stature ! A wicked thing  --  a monstrous wicked thing ! I stood right on the border of the grave , And looked down in the coffin , which was lidless , And saw with my two eyes wide open , Sire  --  Wide open  --  and clear of vision as they 're now  --  The fine dust stir , then rise like ashes when A softly breathing zephyr blows into them ; Then settle back upon the dry white bones , And take the form of purple-threaded gauze , Whose fairy meshes ' gan to pulse and throb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That interline the pinions of a fly , Along the violet-latticed rays to roll Into a central fountain in the breast  --  Right in the spot where , Sire , once beat the heart  --  The noble , youthful , palpitating heart . The bosom heaved  --  the eyes into their sockets leaped , Flashing like stars amid the crpuscule  --  The lips smiled  --  the hair put on its hues  --  And Milo rose  --  and stood up in the grave ! Then , Sire , I felt my blood all turn to ice  --  My hair rise up a mile upon my head  --  My breath pass from my body like the air Out of the bellows when they 're sorely pressed . I tried to run  --  but fell upon my face , As thou dost see me , now  --  asphyxi  --  BOLESLAS . Where 's Wislas , my physician ? Him I bade Attend the drama of the ghost . WISLAS ( comimg forward ) . Yes , Sire , Yes , I was there , and saw the comedy : I left the madhouse ere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue . BOLESLAS . Ceslas , old guard ; resume thy legs  --  to Wislas Repeat thy tale . Thou sawst the dead , didst say , Little by little quicken into life ? CESLAS ( rising ) . Sire , as I said , I saw the dust condensed , Quicken , arise , like soft expanding mist Whose weft is interwove with crimson sunbeams , Then settle down around the dry white bones , Covering them like a soft flesh-tinted mantle That holds the unseen mystery of life : Then pulse , and throb , and breathe , like a machine When viewless powers electrify its springs , And take on them the semblance of Lord Milo , Who rose and stood up in the grave , astonished A thousandfold more than the multitude , To find himself again upon this earth . BOLESLAS . What dost thou say to that , my learned doctor ? WISLAS . Why , Sire , I say that he believes he saw it . BOLESLAS . But all these guards , his comrades , saw it , too . WISLAS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOLESLAS . But , by my faith ! how dost thou that explain ? WISLAS . By different conditions of the brain , Sire . The nervous nets , which bring us images , Have two extremities  --  th ' exterior , which Receives impressions of the visible world ; And the interior , which deposits these Same images beneath the mental eye ; That is , before the mind , which has the power , When it is under very strong emotions , To send them back again like shuttlecocks Unto said nervous net that brought them hither ; These images , then , having been repelled With a contagions nature , touch their neighbours . And bring about collective  --  hallucination . You understand me , Sire ?  --  BOLESLAS . Why , by my faith , no ; For when instead of these emotions , which Compel the mind to play at shuttlecock With , its own images , it hold contrary Belief , who is it strikes the blow of the racket ? And when these flying images translate Themselves in flesh , and blood , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is it hallucination ? WISLAS . No ; but ' t is then that we return to jugglery , With which we 'll all the rest explain , your Majesty . BOLESLAS . I have fears , Wislas , ' t is thy reason fills The office of the shuttlecock  --  WALISLAS ( pointing to entrance . ) Sire ! Sire ! Behold the apparition ! See ! The King springs to his feet , and STANISLAS enters , leading Lord MILO , and followed by a crowd of people , priests , and nuns , singing : He is risen from the dead Erect and strong of tread , As ere he went to sleep In the tomb so dark and deep ; God , who is life and death , Gives and takes away our breath , Reclothes with flesh dead bones To startle perjured thrones . BOLESLAS ( pale and trembling ) . Gentlemen , to your places ; Wislas remain A while . The Court is open . Ushers conduct His sanctity and apparition hither . With majestic bearing , STANISLAS leads MILO to the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absent witness , Lord Milo , vender of Piotrawin , Who , by permission of the King of Heaven , Appears before you to give testimony : Accord to him the privilege of speaking On my behalf before this tribunal , That all may learn how falsely I 'm accused BOLESLAS ( with a smile of derision ) . Justicier , swear the ghost . We 'll hear him speak . A justicier timidly holds out the Bible at arm's-length , MILO places on it his right hand . JUSTICIER . Upon this book you swear to speak the truth , And nothing but the truth ? MILO ( in a sepulchral voice ) . Before the King  --  The justicier staggers back . The King partially swoons . Several in the crowd fall on their knees and commence praying . The justicier recovers  --  re-extends the book and MILO resumes . Before the King of men I swear to lift Truth from the dust where perjury bas crushed her , And put the blush upon bold-fronted falsehood That with her leprous tongue has here essayed To cover with infamy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favourites ) . He speaks well for a ghost  --  by Jove he does ! MILO ( who has heard the King ) . Sire , it is I , Lord of Piotrawin , Who , by your order , on my nuptial night Was cruelly and most untimely murdered By one who , now , his crime is expiating In dungeons lighted by the fires of torment In bottomless pit prepared for murderers , Where coils of fiery serpents twine their brows , And flesh sharp fangs of flame in their hot brains , Wringing out shrieks that shake the abysmal world . BOLESLAS ( aside , wiping his brow ) . Oh ! I can bear no more ! no more of this ! MILO . Spies , traitors , liars , and perjurers are there , Chained down to flaming stakes of fire and brim-stone , While demons heap live coals upon their heads  --  BOLESLAS . This is irrelevant  --  insupportable ; If thou know'st aught that can illume this cause , Say it , and get thee back into thy grave ! MILO . Piotrawin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deed , and touched the price , Upon that day that saw me wed and dead : These witnesses were vouchers to the same ; And these false claimants are no kin of mine . BOLESLAS . Claimants and witnesses , what say ye now ? PIERRE . Your Majesty , it is a lying ghost , A hypocritical , false-swearing phantom . Thunder heard ; a sheet of lightning envelopes them , and leaves them pale and lifeless as statues . BOLESLAS . Wislas , approach , and touch that apparition : I wish to know if it be flesh or air , Which will make all the difference in my verdict . it be air , the Bishop 's case is lost ; If it be flesh , he sure must prove the winner . After several attempts , WISLAS succeeds in placing the tips of his fingers on MILO 'S shoulder . What say you now , Wislas , is it air or flesh ? WISLAS ( shaking with fear ) . Sire , scientific rigour doth exact  --  Firstly , that we ourselves design the subject On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we be the witnesses ; And thirdly , that of it we be permitted , At time and place convenient to ourselves , Several examinations of the same ; Respectfully I , therefore , here submit  --  But , bat , Sire , what would'st thou have me say ? BOLESLAS . Tell the impression touch makes on thy brain : We can not touch a thing without ideas Flying along the highways of the senses Like couriers to bring the latest news . WISLAS ( confused ) . Your Majesty , at first , I thought the thing Naturally impossible  --  but  --  but  --  I was mistaken  --  was deceived  --  your Majesty . All laugh and applaud . BOLESLAS . All who believe this phantom to be Milo In person , will declare it . VOICES ( amid laughter ) . It is he , Lord Milo , Master of Piotrawin . BOLESLAS . Therefore , unto these presence be it known His saintship is not guilty of the charges ' Gainst him preferred before this tribunal ; And that to him Piotrawin belongs . Voices cry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Kotschuski , Walislas , give me your hands : I know not if I be awake or sleeping  --  Living or dead  --  in this world or the next . Come nearer to me , till I be assured . MILO and STANISLAS are receiving congratulations , when Count WALDIMIR , bearing CHRISTINE in his arms , enters amid a tumultuous crowd , and sets her down before them . The King falls back powerless . STANISLAS presses a kiss on her pale brow , and places her hand in MILO 'S . STANISLAS . My son , behold again our long-lost Pearl The noble Waldimir has found and rescued ! The precious gem has faded  --  since we saw it  --  ( sobs ) But light and liberty will soon restore it . BOLESLAS ( recovering his senses ) . What meaneth this ? I understand it not . STANISLAS ( drying his eyes ) . Sire , in Piotrawin there lived a shepherd , Who had , upon a time , a milk-white lamb , Which in his bosom eighteen years he carried  --  Petted , and loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he trusted it to a new keeper  --  A noble , youthful , and lamb-loving shepherd , Who worshipped it  --  adored it  --  took it home ; And on that very night the royal bloodhounds Broke into , the new fold  --  the shepherd killed , And to their master bore the bleating lamb . Then , to this mighty king the owner went , Bending beneath his wondrous weight of woe , And on his knees implored him to release it , Which he refused , and drove the shepherd hence With scorn that cut into his soul like sword-point . This wrong moved noble hearts to mutiny , Who to the palace of this great king went , And brought to him , perforce , his stolen lamb  --  Behold it , Sire ! behold its meek blue eyes ! And ask thyself if thou hadst such a lamb , And some great monarch stole it from thy fold , If thou'dst not rescue it at any price . BOLESLAS . Pontiff , away ! you are intolerable ! Hence with your lamb , and ghost ! and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : You 're Satan in his sacerdotal stole . STANISLAS . Sire , summon to thine aid sweet Christian patience Until I learn the will of this good witness , Whom Heaven 's sent here to put things into joint . Milo , thou mayst elect to sojourn here , Or , to return into the peaceful tomb . Select thy lot  --  and be for ever blessed ! MILO ( with a serene smile ) . My lord , I thank Heaven for her wondrous bounty , And thee for all the prayers thou'st offered for me ; They have been heard and answered in all justice : With what 's called life and death I 'm now acquaint , And know the cost and value of the twain . For him who has not crossed that mystic line That bounds the vision of mortality , This world has many fascinations  --  pleasures That dazzle and allure the purblind soul Whose mortal ken is wisely circumscribed By the unfathomed wisdom of the Godhead ; But , for him who has passed that distant bourn Into the land that knows nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world Are dross , and from his unveiled vision fade , As stars before the effulgent smile of day . Who taste the peaceful slumbers of the tomb  --  That holy rest none in the flesh can know  --  That sweet serenity and perfect peace , Born but of sense of bless 'd security Against the storms and tempests of this life  --  The pains and pangs humanity begets  --  Sorrows , whose merciless fingers wind the heart-strings Till with distension they asunder snap  --  The subtile woofs of envy and of falsehood  --  The machinations of the mighty wicked  --  Will thank Heaven for the shelter of the tomb , And to the vulture bare their hearts no more ; Therefore , let me return into the grave , And with my mantle gathered round me , sleep Until the angel 's trumpet bid me rise . During this speech , CHRISTINE , upheld by WALDIMIR , looks up into the face of her bridegroom , and when he is done , thus pleads : CHRISTINE . Oh , stay ! oh , stay ! beloved with me ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from thraldom I am free , Of Earth I 'll make a Heaven . I 'll weave around thy life a charm Of beauty and delight ; Sorrow and wee with love disarm , And murder put to flight . So long for thee I 've pined and wept , These nuptial robes have wore ; So long for thee sad vigil kept , Thou'lt leave me nevermore ? Or , if thou wilt not stay with me To dissipate the gloom  --  Take me , belov 'd , to dwell with thee In thy mansion in the tomb . MILO . Christine , most loved , most honoured on the earth , It is not meet that we be reunited . The grave between us came  --  so let it be ! The flowers of thy young heart are scarce in bloom ; Bestow their wondrous wealth on Waldimir , Who is more worthy of the priceless gift .

STANISLAS , stabbed to the heart , falls into the arms of WALDIMIR , who has confided the swooning girl to his valet . STANISLAS . This is the last of earth  --  the end of sorrow  --  The last blow that my king and fate can deal me . Midway the voyage of life my bark is wrecked ; But through the storm I see a sail approaching : Nearer it comes , and nearer  --  now , it waits me ! Your Majesty , draw near me .

Most grievous exit !  --  Monster ! Christine 's thy daughter  --  Milo is thy son  --  And both the blighted fruit of mine own womb : Pent in thy harem , Pierre was my first-born , Whom , ignorant of his parentage , I reared , And from thy royal treasure did enrich , Ennoble , and lift to his princely level .

In time , a mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick travail-pangs Whose sweet result  --  unseen by mortal eyes  --  I substituted for her womb 's dead fruit . What joy !

( Dies . ) GHOST ( pointing its pale fingers at the King as it vanishes amid a halo of mist ) . Thou'rt doomed  --  the mists of night are gathering round thee , And in the pits of hell , already , demons Are building fires of torment for thy soul . BOLESLAS ( running to and fro ) . ' T is so !

I 'm going home , I 'm going home , I hear my father call  --  I 'm going home , I 'm going home , And soon shall meet them all . Goes to a tall mirror , and shakes out her long golden tresses over her white robe ; then turns towards the door , and smiling , stands gazing on a fixed point . There is my bridegroom of a day ! All dressed in white is he ; I see him there beside the way , And he is beckoning me . I 'll go to him , though I 'm no more In nuptial robes arrayed : My wedding wreath he will deplore , But he knows that flowers will fade . Exit .

Doctor , sweet patient friend , medicine my soul ! Put thought and sense to sleep , till certainty Bid Reason reign , or abdicate her throne ! VASSAL ( re-entering ) . A fair girl from the river they have drawn  --  WALDIMIR . Christine ! VASSAL . The daughter of our woodcutter , Who , robbed of innocence , herself has drowned . The thief of virtue could not steal her beauty  --  It clings to her even in the arms of death . WALDIMIR ( drying his eyes ) . O Heaven ! Thank God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with dew-cold feet , she roams the forest , Chasing the mirage of her fevered brain . Exeunt WALDIMIR and DOCTOR . SCENE II . A Forest . A woodcutter gathering flowers . Enter CHRISTINE , wearing a wreath of leaves  --  a crown of ivy on her head . CHRISTINE ( in a tearful voice ) . They 're dead and gone , they 're dead and gone , To dwell on spirit-shore ; They 're dead and gone , they 're dead and gone , And will return no more . I 'm going there , I 'm going there , Since they can not come here ; I 'm going there , I 'm going there , To join the loved and dear . O father ! father ! take me home  --  Take me from this unrest , As a white lamb Fate dooms to roam , And fold me in thy breast . WOODCUTTER ( coming forward ) . Pretty Christine , why com'st abroad so early ? CHRISTINE ( looking up ) . Who may'st thou be ? WOODCUTTER . Thy father 's woodcutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee not : Go on thy way  --  go on thy way . Go  --  go ! WOODCUTTER . Scorn not thy father 's servant , pretty one , But take these flowers he 's gathered for his daughter . ( Aside ) Who is mad too . CHRISTINE ( recoiling ) . Is there a serpent in them ? WOODCUTTER . Pretty one , no ; but why suspect'st a serpent ? CHRISTINE . Upon my wedding-day they bound My brow with flowers of snow , ' Mong which a basilisk fierce was wound That wrought me death and woe . And ever since , when I behold A lady 's nuptial wreath , I see a basilisk fierce unfold Its coils the flowers beneath . I was so happy on that day  --  The world seemed full of light ; No cloud hung o'er my flower-strewn way  --  But now ' t is starless night . Pity the woe that can not die  --  Pity this bosom 's pain ; The fountains of my heart are dry  --  Fires burning in my brain . She presses her brow with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( aside ) . Poor little Pearl ! Ah ! how I pity her ! So beautiful and rich , and yet so sad . Ah ! sorrow is respecter of no persons . My little girl is sad ; but she is poor , Else had her lover not deserted her . Wipes his eyes with his sleeve . Christine , the dew is chilly ; come aback , And in my loving arms I 'll carry thee . CHRISTINE ( moving slowly on ) . I 'm going home , I 'm going home , I hear my father call ; I 'm going home , I 'm going home , And soon shall meet them all . Exit , followed by WOODCUTTER . SCENE III . Another part of the Forest , Furious barking of dogs heard . BOLESLAS , clad in rags , his long matted beard hanging on his naked breast , his haggard brow twined with ivy , rushes in , believing his body to be entwined by a serpent , whose coil he is trying to break . BOLESLAS . Aback ! ye howling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Unclasp my heart ! Or I will break thy damnd coil . Oh ! oh ! There , now ! I 've got my heel upon thy head ! Die ! die ! ha ! ha ! I 've vanquished thee ! ha ! ha ! Oh ! what a pest-house is the heart of envy ! Oh ! what a plague her hell  --  begotten hounds , That , wide-mouthed , yelp a mighty monarch down ! From star to star I leaped , they on my track ; Astride a comet 's back I sped through space , They hanging to his fiery tail , and howling To split the ears of Ether . ( Dogs bark . ) Hark ! they follow ! Thence , like a shooting meteor , down I darted Into the sea , they yelping on my heels  --  Startling the sirens and aquatic armies , Leviathan monsters , stretching many a rood Behind the coral breastworks of the deep . Then on a seahorse , goaded by their yells , And plunging through the blinding fogs of foam , Away I sped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships , And sepulchres of dead men 's bleaching bones , Until I reached the confines of my kingdom .  --  Dismounting then , I leaped forth into forests Lampless as Chaos ere the stars were lighted  --  Ran up the trees  --  then down  --  then up again , Clutching their branches , swung myself ' cross rivers  --  Up to my throne , whereon I 'll take my seat . Seats himself on a fallen tree . CHRISTINE , followed by terrified Woodcutter , enters opposite , singing in a low , tearful voice . CHRISTINE . They 're dead and gone , they 're dead and gone , To dwell on spirit-shore ; They 're dead and gone , they 're dead and gone , And will return no more . BOLESLAS ( coming towards her ) . Of whom dost sing so sadly , pretty one ? CHRISTINE . My father , whom Boleslas killed  --  My young and gallant love , Whom on his nuptial night he willed To send to realms above . O stranger , if thou hast a heart To feel a lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw thy dart Against her royal foe ( weeps ) . BOLESLAS . Do not weep , pretty maiden , do not weep ! I 'll send mine armies forth to combat him . CHRISTINE . Thine armies ? BOLESLAS . Ay , the hosts of Heaven and earth , Of which I 'm king . But thou wilt be my queen ? CHRISTINE . Oh , no ! Oh , no ! I can not wed , My hand 's already given ; My thoughts are dwelling with the dead , Who wait me in you Heaven . Farewell , farewell , I 'm going home  --  I hear my father call ; Farewell , farewell , I 'm going home , And soon shall meet them all . She goes out opposite , followed by King and Woodcutter . In an instant furious barking of dogs is heard , and the King comes running back , and mounts on the fallen tree . WALDIMIR and Doctor enter opposite , and stand unobserved , regarding the maniac . BOLESLAS ( with wild gesticulations towards the entrance where the dogs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ere war against ye I declare , and bid Mine armies , numerous as the sands of earth , Against ye march , and howling hurl ye hellward .

Another howling insult , and ye 'll find Yourselves transfixed on points of flaming swords , Tumbling headlong adown the steeps of night . Sinks down on the tree . Drops his head on his breast , and clasps his hands in front of his knees . WALDIMIR . How have the mighty fallen ! Verily , Verily , the way of the transgressor is hard . Terrible the judgments of avenging Heaven ! The Woodcutter , pale and out of breath , rushes in , and falls at WALDIMIR 'S feet . What is it ? What is ' t , man ? Oh , speak ! Oh , speak ! Lest with uncertainty my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' t is something terrible ! WALDIMIR . Oh ! what is it ? Canst thou not tell what ' t is ? WOODCUTTER ( rolling over and over ) . O sir ! wait till I gets a little breath ; The horror shakes me like a wintry wind . WALDIMIR . I shall go mad  --  I shall go mad , dear Doctor ! DOCTOR . Good man , canst thou not speak upon the point ? WOODCUTTER ( making an effort ) . O sir ! you did not send me after her ; But I was in the woods , and saw her coming , And followed her right to the cemetery , Singing ' I 'm going home , ' in such a voice , It made me cry just like a boy that 's whipped . And when she reached , the cemetery , sir , Like a white snow-flake on his grave she fell , And lay a-trembling like a fallen leaf : Then , in my bosom , sir , I put her feet  --  Her little feet  --  no larger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart 's poor fire  --  But oh ! the icy chill ! I feel it still  --  Right here upon my heart , sir , where they lay , While up , and open wide , she turned her eyes , Bluer than the blue heaven whereon she gazed : Then , sir . Oh ! that was worse than all ; ' t was , sir ! I never shall forget it  --  never , sir ! I saw three angels in white robes descend ; One was the Bishop  --  one Lord Milo  --  one Alisa , poor , good , murdered Alisa , sir  --  And fell upon my face  --  right upon my face ; And when my terror passed  --  and I looked up , I saw them bearing her white soul to heaven . WALDIMIR leans heavily on the Doctor , during this paroxysm of the Woodcutter , then moves on towards the cemetery . SCENE IV . The Cemetery . CHRISTINE lying on MILO 'S grave . Terrified Peasants standing apart . Enter WALDIMIR , leaning on the Doctor 's arm . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl to his bosom . WALDIMIR . Christine ! Christine ! come back ! speak ! speak !

Oh , do ! so new , it must not stop for ever ! The Doctor answers with tears . WALDIMIR gazes on the cold pale face , and cries between his sobs . Gone ! alas ! for ever gone ! With thy wealth of beauty , Leaving me in the world alone , With nor hope nor duty : Like a ship without a helm , Starless drifting , ever , Outward on the boundless realm , Finding anchorage never : Gone ! in life 's sweet vernal hour , Like a bud half-blown , Dropping from the parent bower Into worlds unknown .

How have I fallen ! From what kingly height ! ' Twixt fangs of dogs  --  my executioners , That from my soul tore off the pall of madness , And turned mine eyes into my heart , back from Whose baleful depths I shuddering shrink  --  as  --  as  --  Gazes on CHRISTINE .
