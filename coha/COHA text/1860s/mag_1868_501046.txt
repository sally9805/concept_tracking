STRETCHING along the eastern coast of Asia is the beautiful group of islands composing the Japanese Empire . They represent a total area of 270,000 square miles , which is twice that of Great Britain , and have an estimated population of 30,000,000 . Until visited by Commodore Perry , in 1852 , this distant country was looked upon as a kind of dream-land , or as belonging to another world . Its distance , its self-imposed isolation , the mystery of its internal life and national existence , and the fact of its being the last land to be opened and explored by the enterprise and power of modern civilization , awakened the liveliest interest in the breast of every lover of history , progress , and the development of human knowledge . As a result of Perry 's visit , four years afterward , a treaty of commerce and friendly intercourse was signed by the President of the United States and the Taicoon of Japan . Thus , after two centuries of seclusion and national hermitabe , the most important era of Japanese history was inaugurated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilized world . Very soon after this event I took up my ahode at one of the Japanese islands , which , for the subsequeht five years , became my home . If bewildered at first setting foot upon the soil of this mysterious land , and almost overwhelmed by the novelty and strangeness of everything around me , I was certainly far more so when , after having acquired a knowledge of the language , I sat down to study the history , government , laws , and customs of this strange people . Some results of this study I now propose to give . Like the Egyptians , the Japanese compare the world , in their account of the creation , to an egg  --  the germ or vivifying principle of which was a spirit , or kami . After myriads of ages , during which the world was inhabited only by spirits , and was gradually becoming fitted for the abode of man , a human pair appear , and give birth to a female child , named Ten-she-o-dai-gin , or daughter of heaven . She , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first earthly Micado , and the long line of their spiritual emperors are her lineal descendants . It is not till many hundred years later , or about 659 B. C. , that their mythological history closes , and their authentic record begins . This latter history is inaugurated by the accession to the Micadoship of the lineal heir , Gimutenno , He goes forth , with sword in hand , subduing the various tribes , who were little more than bands of robbers ; surveys the country , divides it into provinces , and , having everywhere established his power , founds the Japanese Empire . The Portuguese , the most enterprising commercial nation of that age , claim the actual discovery of Japan , in the year 542 , forty-five years after the doubling of the Cape of Good Hope by Vasco de Gama , one of their most celebrated mariners . Through this channel the Japanese had a new and broad avenue // // opened for entering upon a still higher grade of civilization , and one far in a& vance of that of their Celestial neighbors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received , and then the Spanish , Dutch , and English , who , all in turn and together , enjoyed Japanese trade and confidence . For a century rapid strides were made by this people , in all or most that belonged to the civilization of the West , and a commerce , comparable with that of any of the Oriental countries , was being carried on with the maritime nations of the world . The Portuguese , more especially , wherever they went , were accompanied by friars , mostly Franciscan , and the building of churches and the apostacy of the people was among the first , and most energetically conducted , works of Asiatic pioneering . Their success in Japan was almost unparalleled . During this period of Western intercourse religious toleration was the policy of the Japanese emperors-one having said , on being asked n regard to the admission of the Jesuits , that " as there were already many sects , one more could do no harm . " Many of the most powerful princes ultimately became converted to the Catholic faith , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great progress in gaining spiritual dominion , these Papal disciples finally showed signs of a desire for temporal power . Becoming alarmed at this new phase of Jesuit influence , as web as at the arbitrary and dictatorial tone of the various Western powers with which they had commercial intercourse , the Japanese emperor determined to expel all foreigners , close the country , and enter upon that system of seclusion which , as we know , has been successful for the past two centuries and a half . Japan has two emperors , two capitals , and the dual system of government which it implies . The Micado , or spiritual emperor , has the city of Miaco for his capital . The Taicoon , or temporal emperor , is at the city of Yedo , some two hundred miles farther north . Who is the Micado , or spiritual emperor , and who the Taicoon , or temporal emperor ? In the mythological history of this people , Ten-she-o-dai-gin , or daughter of the first pair , is said to be the mother of their race , their first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lineal descendants . This story is , to every one of the 30,000,000 who inhabit these islands , what the Bible and its sacred revelation are to the Christian world . The unity of their race , the divine origin of their Micados , and the infallibility of their ancient records form their natural religion ; and , though the Buddhist faith has been engrafted upon it , as a natural principle it is never lost sight of and is the basis of their patriotism . The perpetuity of the Micadoship , and preservation , inviolable , of its lineal succession , is regarded as the highest duty of every individual of their whole race , and the key-stone to their national existence . If these conditions are fulfilled , it does not matter who is the actual sovereign of the empire , or whether there is any central ruling power at all . The nation may exist for ages as a confederation of princes ( as it has at various periods of their history ) , each exercising entire control over the domestic affairs , uncontrolled by any national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About the end of the Tenth Century , at the close of one of the civil wars , which were the frequent result of this condition of things , a successful military chieftain , by the name of Yorotomo , having brought the whole country under his sway , was confirmed by the Micado in the civil and military administration of the affairs of the empire , and took the title of Shiogoon , or Taicoon , which // was the origin of the dual system of government , implied by the existence of two emperors . Since that time , the Micado 's real power is only reflected as derived from the strongest party , whether it be the Taicoon or a combination of princes sufficiently powerful to overthrow his government . When the Taicoon is able to keep in control the various feudal lords , he has nothing to fear from the Micado 's veto . Once on the throtie , the Taicoon , in mock solicitude for the Micado 's ease and dignity , strips him of all power , by supporting him in idleness ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renders it unnecessary for him to have even a body-guard or a treasury , by which he might oppose the Taicoon 's civil authority . His policy , beside this , is to amuse the Micado and his court , so that his principal , and , as many say , only , occupation is the following out of incomprehensible labyrinths of meaningless ceremony , and revelling in a superiority of rank that dwarfs all human comprehension . The political condition or government of Japan to-day is that which was inaugurated by Gongensama , the founder of the present dynasty , two hundred and fifty years ago . Of the numerous feudal lords who held possession of the country before he arose to power , eighteen of the larger and more powerful still hold their ancient title and a portion of their former estate . These are called confederated princes , and either voluntarily or by force acknowledge Gongensama on his assumption of the Taicoonship as the ruler of the whole nation . Thus we find in Japan , at the present time , no less than two hundred and sixty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own domestic affairs , sustain large bodies of armed men , and have all the governing machinery of independent states . With the exception of eighteen , who were the most ancient and powerful before Gongensama assumed the throne , all these princes hold their titles , estates , and lives even , subject to the Taicoon . The government , though feudal in its character and origin , resembles more closely a constitutional monarchy than any other form of rule , being based on a series of laws equivalent to a constitution . He is aided by four bodies of nobles , two hereditary , who act as imperial counsellors , and two elective and legislative , corresponding in some respects to the House of Lords and Commons in England . At no period in the history of Europe did there ever exist such a perfect feudal system as in Japan . The two emperors , the eighteen great princes , and the two hundred and sixty smaller ones , with other hosts of servants and retainers , make up a privileged horde in number , power and influence which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever cursed with . The badge of the aristocracy is the long and short sword thrust in the belt at the left side . So immovable are these barriers of society , that no degree of merit , talent or wealth can transfer one of low birth into the ranks of the privileged class . The penal laws are remarkably severe . Adultery , and theft above the sum of one hundred dollars , are punished by decapitation , arson by burning at the stake , and counterfeiting by crucifixion . With a most thorough and efficient police , a criminal rarely escapes detection . Contrary to the generally-received belief that punishment is immediate and summary , a vast majority die in prison before their cases are decided by the constituted tribunals . Death is never inflicted on an offender , whatever may be his crime , or however well proven , till he makes a full confession of his guilt . To effect this , torture is resorted to , and it is quite probable that innocent men often acknowledge the commission of crimes in order to escape the pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before officers appointed for the purpose . There are two devices for obtaining truthful testimony ; the first , by making the witness seal his evidence by a drop of his blood ; the second , by making him responsible for the conviction of the accused-that is to say , if ; on his testimony , an innocent man is punished , he must suffer the same penalty . Han kin , or self-destruction for criminal offences , is only practised by the privileged class . The word is derived from two others-han , bowels ; and kin , to cut . It is rather a privilege , and is permitted for certain crimes only . In some cases , a noble not only has the opportunity of escaping an ignoble death at the hands of the executioner , but saves his family from disgrace and his estate from confiscation . In others , he only escapes the executioner , while all the penalties of disinheritance are visited on his descendants . For treason , and for the profession of Christianity , his most distant kin are put to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impress all with the horrors of punishment ; and the bodies or heads of the criminals are exposed for three days , charred and mutilated , at the place of execution . Most private disputes are settled by arbitration , without the aid of the police or the constituted authorities . The arbitrators are usually selected from among the friends and relatives of the disputants . These have protracted sittings , and consume far more time in feasting than in actual business , and that at the expense of the parties in difficulty . For this reason , if for no other , the disputants are usually disposed to come to a speedy settlement , rather than run the risk of being impoverished by the appetites of their improvised lawyers . Piracy , so great a scourge on the China coast , is unknown in Japanese waters . The severity of the law against dishonest wrecking , and the faithfulness of its execution , are well worthy of imitation by more civilized and enlightened nations . Property wrecked on the most thinly-inhabited island of the Japanese group is surer of recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The officers and crew of the American bark " Chevalier , " wrecked on the coast of one of the most hostile princes , met with the greatest kindness and hospitality . The Japanese rescued them at the utmost peril to themselves . They even went so far as to put up a bathing place , and an apparatus for heating water , as a daily hot bath is almost a religious duty with " 7a* , " and the Americans could not refuse a nightly boil without running the risk of giving offence . Every article , of however insignificant value , floating ashore from the chests of the sailors , was carefully returned to its proper owner . The wrecking was done under the direction of a government officer , and everything movable was brought to Yokohama and placed in the hands of our Consul . It has been often remarked that the civilization and moral condition of a people may be determined at a glance , by the manner in which women are treated , and by the view taken of the marriage relation . The Japanese acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the rural districts , women aid in harvesting , but , as a rule , do no more out-door work than I have seen performed by their sex in many parts of Europe . Their habits of living being very simple , the female portion of the family have much leisure for the use of the needle , or for gossip with neighbors . Marriages and courtships are carried on by " go-betweens , " as they are termed , and the smiles and kisses of the blooming lovers must be transmitted by the same agents as the nuptial contract . Divorces are resorted to , for the sake of a change , by at least three-fourths of all married people , before ten years of married life . The legal causes of // divorce are put down as seven , any one of which is sufficient to enable the husband to put away his wife . These causes are : Disrespect to parents , inclination to make trouble , barrenness , adultery , dishonesty , leprosy , and talkativeness . The same grou ads of complaint , unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband . There seems to be a limit , however , to the number of times a man can be divorced , which limit is stated to be " 7 1-2 . " This half must be , I presume , when he is obliged to support his divorced spouse . The majority of both sexes can read and write . Ready computation is an accomplishment , and a knowledge of the Chinese characters , so as to be able to read their classics , is looked upon as the highest of educational acquirements . In modern times , Dutch and English have been studied , with military tactics and chemistry ; but these have been attempted by so few as hardly to be accounted national studies . Primary schools are nearly as common as in our country , and , in a morning walk , through almost any of the valleys , one is sure to meet several groups of children , with books and noonday meal , wending their way to the village school . Music , as an accomplishment , is studied by the young ladies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest . The doctor ranks as one of the privileged class , is the most consequential man in the village , and in town holds a most respectable position . The theory of practice is , in general , Chinese , which is a system of the merest empiricism . There is a modern school which follows the teachings of the Dutch . These practise substantially the same as ourselves , and use most of our staple medicines . In bleeding , blistering , and the use of mercurials , they outdo our most ancient Esculapians , and , for the present generation , inflict infinitely more harm than good . A doctor never sends a bill . That would make him a trader , which his caste scorns . He leaves his remuneration to his patient 's generosity , which latter all the doctors acknowledge to be exceedingly unsatisfactory . I was not long , from experience , in coming to the same conclusion . Soon after my arrival in the country , I was called upon by the Governor for medical aid and advice . After nearly two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , professing himself under many obligations , assured me he would take an early opportunity to remunerate me for my services . In a few days , accordingly , he called , accompanied by a large retinue , and , with considerable ceremony , prese nted me , through the hands of his secretary , a small box , on the top of which was very carefully folded a piece of paper . Its weight , at least , was encouraging , I thought , on accepting it with my best bow-for want of any other polite expressions of thanks , as the interview was conducted inihe native tongue . After his departure , I sat down to examine myfee . The nicely-folded paper on top contained a silver coin of the value of forty-two cents , and the box-half a pound of isinglass jelly , sweetened with molasses . The religion of the Japanese is essentially Buddhist , and was introduced from China A. D. 532 . There are several sects , but all claim a common origin . As a people , they do not appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance and superstition . All observe days of feasting , and celebrate the births of their patron-gods . The priesthood is numerous and powerful . The heads of the various orders are almost like princes  --  the temples and monasteries over which they preside having been endowed with both money and land by the founder of the dynasty . In order to more effectually eradicate all traces of Christianity , which had been introduced by the Jesuits , the Emperor , // in addition to the fearful persecution which followed his decree of expulsion , instituted the most stringent laws against the profession of the Catholic faith , and made it obligatory on everybody to subscribe himself at some temple as a Buddhist , at the risk of being thought a Christian , which Is worse than death , as it would include the sacrifice of his family and nearest kinsmen as well as himself . So rigid is this system of requirements , and so dangerous is it even to talk of Christianity , that the most abject and painful fear is exhibited by all Japanese at its very mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal native drop a book in which was pictured the emblem of the crucifixion , as if it had been a coal of fire , and by no amount of persuasion could I induce him to touch it again . Two hundred and fifty years have elapsed since the Jesuits were expelled , and yet to-day , at the entrance of every village , and at every cross-road , stands , as a prominent object , the tablet on which is kept ever bright the inscription , naming the fearful and certain punishments provided for any one who may profess Christianity . Until the government repeals this law , our missionaries will not be able to make many converts ; and , in proof of this , we have their almost fruitless labor for seven years . Take off the restriction , however , and no more encouraging field is to be found in the whole East . The Buddhist priests have taught the people that Christianity is a system of witchcraft , and that its teachers deal in charms and incantations , which , at the same time , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the officers of government as to what Christianity really is . A foreign mountebank once came to the settlement for the purpose of giving an entertainment to the Europeans . He announced the day on which it would take place by a handbill , illustrated by a man holding his own head under his arm . The English printer , who struck off the bills , gave them to his Japanese servants to post about town . They had but half completed the work , however , before the card was observed by the ever-vigilant police , and the alarm given . The Christians had again appeared ! They had seen , with their own eyes , the emblem of their order . The unfortunate servants were immediately seized by a strong police force , and thrown into prison , and an investigation was instituted . The principal in the affair , however , being beyond their reach , as the subject of a foreign power , they were brought to an embarrassing stand . Something must be done , or they would be thought by their superiors delinquent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to punish , they fell on the two unfortunate servants . They were , accordingly , beaten and tortured to the verge of destruction , and thus the matter ended . A few years more of foreign intercourse will make the Japanese exceedingly ashamed of their ignorance . Even now they look upon the great mass of the priests as useless and a nuisance ; and , in fact , a more ignorant , bigoted , lazy , dirty class of human beings is nowhere to be found . The majority live by begging , the sale of charms and indulgences , and the fees connected with burials . A man who can not pay the priest of a temple a certain yearly tax , can not secure to himself a decent interment , as no burial is permitted except under priestly supervision . From the encouragement given by the government to the support of Buddhism as the national religion , the temples are the most expensive and stately structures in the country , and the perfection of Japanese architectural skill . In numbers , they put to shame the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , // every town dozens , and Miaco is half made up of them . They always occupy the most elevated grounds , commanding the finest and most extensive views of the surrounding country , are shaded by the loftiest and noblest trees of the forest , and , in brief ; in every way take the preference of location . In architecture , the Japanese are less proficient than in some other branches of industry . Their principal works are temples , gateways , and bridges . Edifices of stone or brick are almost unknown . The great reason for this is the frequency of earthquakes . No massive structure of solid masonry would stand a twelvemonth without beinb racked and thrown from the perpendicular , though a decade of years might pass without its being entirely destroyed . The hourly danger of such an accident , therefore , docs not justify the erection of costly structures . For all purposes , the buildings are as cheap as consistent with a certain degree of protection against the inclemencies of the weather and against robbery . The palace of the Taicoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this economic plan . They are rarely more than one and one-half stories high , and comprise a simple frame-work , with light , plastered walls and partitions , mostly of sliding paper screens , with a roof of tile , thatch , or shingles . The walls of the better houses are covered with paper , not unfrequently of unique and tasteful pattern . On their screens I have often seen ornaments , each one of which was a work of art . The floors are universally covered with mats , always of the same size , viz. , three feet by six , and two inches in thickness . They are made of long , coarse straw , firmly sewed together for a foundation , and covered by a fine , braided grass , usually light colored , but sometimes of bright , variegated patterns . On these mats they bestow especial care , never stepping on them except in their stockings-their sandals , or wooden clogs , being left at the door . The neat and clean appearance of these mats is proverbial , and cleanness is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put . A cotton mattrass , which is stored in a closet during the day , is spread on the mats at night for a bed . A few trays , with the family meal , are arranged on them for a table , and , with the addition of a small cushion , they serve the purpose of chairs , sofa , and lounge . The rooms are usually small . They contain little furniture  --  a cupboard , a low writing-table , a brazier of coals , on which is the ever-steaming tea-pot , and a tobacco-box and spittoon . You might go into a hundred houses , by chance , of both rich and poor , without finding more . The smallest plot of ground in front or rear of their dwellings , by their admirable skill and taste in ornamental gardening , is often transformed into a marvel of beauty-everything is in miniature ; a whole landscape will sometimes be fashion*z1 , with wonderful accuracy , in an inconceivably small compass . The Japanese are passionately fond of flowers , and the dwarfing of trees and shrubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as common as the rose with us , and numerous beautiful varieties , never found in this country , are to be seen in almost every door-yard . I purchased for a few shillings a japonica tree at least ten feet high , on which were over two hundred as perfect and delicate flowers as ever graced a bouquet . Some of the more common varieties grow as large as forest trees . With dwellings constructed of such light materials , conflagrations , particularly in large towns , are frequent , and very destructive . In Yedo , a city of over 2,000,000 people , thousands of houses are annually laid in ashes , and the Emperor 's palace is destroyed , at least in part , every five years . For protection against complete destruction of all merchandise by the flames , store-houses underground are common . The wealthier tradesmen , however , build fire-proof magazines of // clay and plaster , which they finish with a hard polish , rendering them durable as well as ornamental . The most destructive fires are occasioned by earthquakes , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred places at once . About ten years ago the populous capital was nearly half destroyed in this way , and over two hundred thousand people were buried beneath the ruins , where many met with a lingering death , being held down by falling timbers , or imprisoned under the rubbish . In the interior much of the upland is allowed to go to waste , though clear of rocks and stones , and easily tillable . The soil is usually dark and exceedingly mellow , often so much so that a slender cane can be thrust its whole length into the earth with the greatest ease . In cultivation , an instrument like a garden spade , fixed to a handle after the manner of a hoe , is almost exclusively used . A plough is rarely met with . Almost everything is planted , or sown in drills , and the whole system of husbandry is more like horticulture than agriculture . The productions are nearly all those belonging to the temperate zone in other parts of the world , and are principally rice , wheat , corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cotton , tobacco , tea , sugar , and salt . Among the fruits , grapes , plums , peaches , oranges , and persimmons are the only ones worth mentioning , as compared with those of our country . Tea , cotton , and silk are the chief productions which find a foreign market . The tea is of a superior quality , and , for their own use , is grown by all the farmers in their own yards . Eight or ten cargoes of it annually find their way to America , where it is much more prized than in Europe . Silk , in its raw state , stands first as an article of export . It is equal in quality to the Italian , and superior to most that is found in China . It finds a ready market in France and England at leading prices . Forty thousand bales was the amount exported last year . Cotton became an article of export only after the Southern Rebellion , * and probably has ceased , as such , before this . The tillers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor ( or appear to be so ) , in consequence of the enormous draft made on the product of their labor by a numerous , indolent , non-producing , privileged class . They display great taste and economy in the management of their lands-nothing that can add to their productiveness being allowed to go to waste . The picturesque beauty and richness of the numerous fertile valleys which sweep down to the sea from the mountain interior are unsurpassed . From the springs at their heads their water is collected in reservoirs , and then conducted in shaded , winding channels , along the bill sides , from which it is let out at pleasure on the luxuriant rice-fields which occupy every foot of the bottom lands . The gentler slopes are devoted to the upland grains , cultivated in small plats like garden beds , giving the landscape a peculiar checkered appearance , which is heightened in its season by the numerous patches of the yellow rape and snowy cotton . In the more fertile districts the farmers usually live in hamlets , though there are numerous isolated dwellings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secluded nook , at the foot of a wooded hill , and so hidden among trees of forest growth and luxuriant shrubbery that one is frequently surprised to find himself in the streets of a village almost before he is aware even of his proximity to a human abode . In the strictest sense of the word , the Japanese are manufacturers . Contrivances for saving labor are only used to a very limited extent . Curiously enough , the most complicated machine in anything like general use is an old-fashioned // fanning-mill , which stands in strange contrast to the simple style of all other agricultural operations . The turning-lathe , though a good deal in use , is such a rudely-constructed instrument that it hardly deserves the name of a machine . Practically , however , it accomplishes much , and turns out many beautiful specimens of workmanship . The Japanese swords have a world-wide reputation for the fineness of their steel and their beautiful finish ; and , from the frequency with which they are tried on the foreign residents , they have carved out a fame quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress than their general intelligence would seem to promise . One reason for this may be , that no encouragement is offered by the government , either in the way of premiums or patents . On the contrary , there is a profusion of sumptuary laws enforcing simplicity and frugality . Two genuine inventions , however , we may be said to have copied ; one , that of making masts for ships from a number of pieces bound together by iron bands , instead of a single stick ; and the other , that of fastening false teeth upon plates . I have in my possession a set of teeth , both for the upper and lower jaw , in which great ingenuity is displayed , not only in fastening the teeth , but in fitting them to the inequalities of the mouth . The upper set is retained in position by atmospheric pressure . The Japanese may boast a prior claim to this invention , because they have had it in use for over a hundred years . The imitative genius of the Japanese is worthy of especial note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , from a steam engine to a cut-glass decanter . I have seen a most beautiful working House 's telegraph , complete , air guns , etc. , made by native mechanics . Every one has heard of the stories of Chinese tailors , who never fail to put as many patches on the new garment they may be required to make as are on the old one given as a pattern . That the Japanese are not far behind in this amusing peculiarity is illustrated by the following incident , which came under my notice : Mr. A. , soon after his arrival in the country , was so unfortunate as to break the bow of his only pair of spectacles . He sent them out by a servant , with the injunction to have them repaired as soon as possible ; and , it being in the capital , the job was given to one of the best workmen in the empire . After waiting for a couple of weeks , he sent a messenger to inquire how the work was getting on . Rather to his surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broken spectacles , and saying he could not possibly do the work . On A. 's asking him why so , he replied : " I can do all but that , " pointing to the word " Philadelphia , " which was stamped on the broad part of the bow , and through which the break ran ; " but , if you are not particular about having that renewed , I will be able to return you the glasses to-morrow , , as strong as ever . " The concession being made , the mechanic went away , and , sure enough , returned them the next day , saying he had " saved as much of the word as possible . " In the fine arts , the Japanese have a fair idea of perspective , execute landscapes with some degree of skill , and , in their painting of birds , flowers , and fishes , excel . Portraits and animals they execute badly . They illustrate books profusely , but generally quite rudely , and without taste . In carving of every description , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mostly ivory , and exceedingly complex groups of men and animals are executed with an accuracy and grace that would be creditable to the most accomplished artists of Italy . I have seen admirable life-sized statues carved from wood . Their bronze deserves mention . Some specimens of this work are not far behind the best of the French . // I might give many other examples of the native genius and acuteness of this people , did my space allow . As to their manners and customs , I can hardly claim to have considered them at all , and the subject , fully detailed , would fill volumes . One of the most interesting and important subjects connected with this distant empire is its reestablishment of foreign intercourse , after its ports have been so long bermetically sealed against all the world . The success of Japan in maintaining her long seclusion is difficult to understand , especially when we take into consideration the never-ceasing eastern encroachments of European nations and their unscrupulous exercise of power in their efforts to extend their commerce to every part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the confluence of two streams of commercial enterprise flowing around the world from opposite directions , headed by the Spanish and Portuguese . In like manner , the re-opening of the country has been the inevitable result of currents of commercial progress in modern times , setting in from different points of the compass , and their final union here , after having reached the shores of India and China on the one hand , and California on the other . The Japanese themselves were conscious of this closing in upon them of the powers of the West , and when Commodore Perry appeared in their waters , though an unwelcome , he was not entirely an unexpected visitor . Like every other country , Japan has its conservative and its liberal party . The conservatives are the Micado , his court , the priesthood , and some of the older princes . They still adhere to their borrowed Chinese literature and customs , look with suspicion on all innovations upon their long-cherished system of seclusion , and refuse , like other celestial teachers , to recognize civilization beyond their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The liberal party consists of some of the smaller princes , and the middle grades of the privileged class , who are readers of Dutch books , or their translations , and prize them far above their old Chinese writers . The Japanese are eminently a progressive people , and but for the conservative tendencies of their feudal system , would now have been much farther advanced . The Government of the Taicoon may be said to represent at the present moment the progressive branch of the ruling aristocracy . It is not liberal , however , in the popular sense , and shows its despotic and feudal character by its dread of the effects of enlightenment on the people . It makes use of its absolute power to prevent any but those whom it may authorize from receiving the advantages of the higher grades of education made accessible by the opening of the country . Before Commodore Perry 's visit , the Chinese and Dutch were the only foreign languages studied by the Japanese . No sooner , however , did they observe the overwhelming preponderance of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye to their future intercourse with the dominant nations in Christendom , they ceased to pursue the Dutch language , and bent all their energies to the study of English . In many other respects they have kept their eyes on England and America as their guides in the onward march to civilization and enlightenment . The demand for dictionaries and school-books of the English language quickly exceeded the supply . " Webster 's Unabridged " had many purchasers , and the pocket size was sought for by hundreds . Resorting to the font of type presented to them by the United States , they commenced the publication of school-books themselves , so that in a short time they were able to supply the demand at a price less than that at which they could be brought from America . // The first Japanese school-book that fell into my hands I mistook for one of our own publications , for , with the exception of the paper , it was a fac-simzYe of one of Appleton 's books , not even the name and date of the original being omitted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything which aids our national progress , that I do not hesitate to say that one or two specimens of every invention of any merit would be purchased by those people , and , if too expensive for a private individual , as an experiment , one of the princes would become its buyer . The Government has already purchased twenty or thirty steamers , among which , at the time , were the finest and swiftest that had ever left the West . The princes , too , are each anxious to secure a steamer as a private yacht , but the Government for the most part aims to retain the monopoly of steam navigation . The Emperor , instead of taking his three-weeks ' journey overland to Miaco , now goes by steam in twenty-four hours . What is most remarkable is , that all these steamers are managed without the aid of foreigners . For three or four years a small foundery and machine shop were in operation in Nagasaki , under the supervision of the Dutch , and in this school the Japanese received their brief instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession is all that is required for them to understand the most complicated engine of our ocean steamships , and , so far , I have heard of no serious accident from the want of experience . What a strange contrast do we see here to the lethargy of the bigoted and conceited Chinese ! They have been , more or less , in constant intercourse with the civilized world for centuries , and for fifty years intimately so , yet out of the numerous steamers which they have purchased from us , and have in constant use , not one is without its foreign engineers , and , in most cases , its foreign captain , for its navigation . I have often been asked who the Japanese Ambassadors were that once visited our country , and what became of them , particularly of the xvonclerful Tommy . The chief ambassadors belonged to the class Hcdomoto , or squires . They were clothed with extraordinary powers and rank for the occasion . On their return they delivered the results of their mission , and the presents , to the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them before setting out for this country . As to their committing han kin , or being disgraced , I never heard anything of it , except in our own newspapers . Tommy was some ways removed from the honor of being of princely blood . He was the adopted son of one of the petty officers in the Government service , and was chosen to accompany the embassy because of his ability to speak English , which he had acquired as a boy at the custom house . He is now a major in the Imperial army , and , when I left , was taking lessons f ; om an old member of the Seventh Regiment of New York in military tactics . He is thoroughly democratic , and remarked to me one day that they would soon have * . revolution in their country in favor of free and enlightened principles , against the effete aristocracy and feudalism of a barbarous age , still pressing on them . Tommy is but one of many whom I have met who hold the same views , and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their voices , and give their lives even , when the proper moment arrives , for the defence of the most cherished rights of man-equality , the freedom of speech , and the exercise of his conscience-for which it may almost be said the Japanese have no expression in their language . Before Commodore Petry 's visit even , our country and its wonderful history seemed to have produced a peculiar impression upon the intelligent Japanese .
