APPENDIX . I. Early unpublished Maps of the Mississippi and the Great Lakes . II . The Eldorado of Mathieu Sagean . INDEX Illustration : LA SALLE 'S COLONY on the Illinois FROM THE MAP OF FRANQUELIN , 1684 . INTRODUCTION . The Spaniards discovered the Mississippi . De Soto was buried beneath its waters ; and it was down its muddy current that his followers fled from the Eldorado of their dreams , transformed to a dismal wilderness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was well-nigh forgotten . On early Spanish maps , the Mississippi is often indistinguishable from other affluents of the Gulf . A century passed after De Soto 's journeyings in the South , before a French explorer reached a northern tributary of the great river . This was Jean Nicollet , interpreter at Three Rivers on the St. Lawrence . He had been some twenty years in Canada , had lived among the savage Algonquins of Allumette Island , and spent eight or nine years among the Nipissings , on the lake which bears their name . Here he became an Indian in all his habits , but remained , nevertheless , a zealous Catholic , and returned to civilization at last because he could not live without the sacraments . Strange stories were current among the Nipissings of a people without hair and without beards , who came from the West to trade with a tribe beyond the Great Lakes . Who could doubt that these strangers were Chinese or Japanese ? Such tales may well have excited Nicollet 's curiosity ; and when , in or before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribe in question , he would not have been surprised if on arriving he had found a party of mandarins among them . Possibly it was with a view to such a contingency that he provided himself , as a dress of ceremony , with a robe of Chinese damask embroidered with birds and flowers . The tribe to which he was sent was that of the Winnebagoes , living near the head of the Green Bay of Lake Michigan . They had come to blows with the Hurons , allies of the French ; and Nicollet was charged to negotiate a peace . When he approached the Winnebago town , he sent one of his Indian attendants to announce his coming , put on his robe of damask , and advanced to meet the expectant crowd with a pistol in each hand . The squaws and children fled , screaming that it was a manito , or spirit , armed with thunder and lightning ; but the chiefs and warriors regaled him with so bountiful a hospitality that a hundred and twenty beavers were devoured at a single feast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fox River , crossed to the Wisconsin , and descended it so far that , as he reported on his return , in three days more he would have reached the sea . The truth seems to be , that he mistook the meaning of his Indian guides , and that the " great water " to which he was so near was not the sea , but the Mississippi . It has been affirmed that one Colonel Wood , of Virginia , reached a branch of the Mississippi as early as the year 1654 , and that , about 1670 , a certain Captain Bolton penetrated to the river itself . Neither statement is improbable , but neither is sustained by sufficient evidence . Meanwhile , French Jesuits and fur-traders pushed deeper and deeper into the wilderness of the northern lakes . In 1641 , Jogues and Raymbault preached the DISCOVERY OF THE GREAT WEST . THE DISCOVERY OF THE GREAT WEST . CHAPTER I. 1643-1669 . CAVELIER DE LA SALLE . THE YOUTH OF LA SALLE.  --  HIS CONNECTION WITH THE JESUITS .  --  HE GOES TO CANADA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEIGNIORY AT LA CHINE.  --  HIS EXPEDITION IN SEARCH OF A WESTERN PASSAGE TO INDIA . Among the burghers of Rouen was the old and rich family of the Caveliers . Though citizens and not nobles , some of their connections held high diplomatic posts and honorable employments at Court . They were destined to find a better claim to distinction . In 1643 was born at Rouen Robert Cavelier , better known by the designation of La Salle . Footnote : The following is the acte de naissance , discovered by Margry in the registres de l'etat civil , Paroisse St. Herbland , Rouen . " Le vingt-deuxieme jour de novembre 1643 , a ete baptise Robert Cavelier , fils de honorable homme Jean Cavelier et de Catherine Geest ; ses parrain et marraine honorables personnes Nicolas Geest et Marguerite Morice . " La Salle 's name in full was Rene-Robert Cavelier , Sieur de la Salle . La Salle was the name of an estate near Rouen , belonging to the Caveliers . The wealthy French burghers often distinguished the various members of their families by designations borrowed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an ex-notary , received the name of Voltaire , which he made famous . His father Jean and his uncle Henri were wealthy merchants , living more like nobles than like burghers ; and the boy received an education answering to the marked traits of intellect and character which he soon , began to display . He showed an inclination for the exact sciences , and especially for the mathematics , in which he made great proficiency . At an early age , it is said , he became connected with the Jesuits ; and though doubt has been expressed of the statement , it is probably true . Footnote : Margry , after investigations at Rouen , is satisfied of its truth .  --  Journal General de l'Instruction Publique , xxxi. 571 . Family papers of the Caveliers , examined by the Abbe Faillon , and copies of some of which he has sent to me , lead to the same conclusion . We shall find several allusions hereafter to La Salle 's having in his youth taught in a school , which , in his position , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The doubts alluded to have proceeded from the failure of Father Felix Martin , S.J. , to find the name of La Salle on the list of novices . If he had looked for the name of Robert Cavelier , he would probably have found it . The companion of La Salle , Hennepin , is very explicit with regard to this connection with the Jesuits ,  --  a point on which he had no motive for falsehood . La Salle was always an earnest Catholic ; and yet , judging by the qualities which his after life evinced , he was not very liable to religious enthusiasm . It is nevertheless clear , that the Society of Jesus may have had a powerful attraction for his youthful imagination . This great organization , so complicated yet so harmonious , a mighty machine moved from the centre by a single hand , was an image of regulated power , full of fascination for a mind like his . But if it was likely that he would be drawn into it , it was no less likely that he would soon wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power , but at the circumference ; not the mover , but the moved ; the passive instrument of another 's will , taught to walk in prescribed paths , to renounce his individuality and become a component atom of a vast whole ,  --  would have been intolerable to him . Nature had shaped him for other uses than to teach a class of boys on the benches of a Jesuit school . Nor , on his part , was he likely to please his directors ; for , self-controlled and self-contained as he was , he was far too intractable a subject to serve their turn . A youth whose calm exterior hid an inexhaustible fund of pride ; whose inflexible purposes , nursed in secret , the confessional and the " manifestation of conscience " could hardly drag to the light ; whose strong personality would not yield to the shaping hand ; and who , by a necessity of his nature , could obey no initiative but his own ,  --  was not after the model that Loyola had commended to his followers . La Salle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , on good terms , and with a reputation of excellent acquirements and unimpeachable morals . This last is very credible . The cravings of a deep ambition , the hunger of an insatiable intellect , the intense longing for action and achievement subdued in him all other passions ; and in his faults , the love of pleasure had no part . He had an elder brother in Canada , the Abbe Jean Cavelier , a priest of St. Sulpice . Apparently , it was this that shaped his destinies . His connection with the Jesuits had deprived him , under the French law , of the inheritance of his father , who had died not long before . An allowance was made to him of three or , as is elsewhere stated , four hundred livres a year , the capital of which was paid over to him , and with this pittance he sailed for Canada , to seek his fortune , in the spring of 1666 . Footnote : It does not appear what vows La Salle had taken . By a recent ordinance , 1666 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vows before the age of twenty-five . By the family papers above mentioned , it appears , however , that he had brought himself under the operation of the law , which debarred those who , having entered religious orders , afterwards withdrew , from claiming the inheritance of relatives who had died after their entrance . Next , we find him at Montreal . In another volume , we have seen how an association of enthusiastic devotees had made a settlement at this place . Footnote : " The Jesuits in North America , " c. xv . Having in some measure accomplished its work , it was now dissolved ; and the corporation of priests , styled the Seminary of St. Sulpice , which had taken a prominent part in the enterprise , and , indeed , had been created with a view to it , was now the proprietor and the feudal lord of Montreal . It was destined to retain its seignorial rights until the abolition of the feudal tenures of Canada in our own day , and it still holds vast possessions in the city and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sober conservatism , were holding a post with which a band of veteran soldiers or warlike frontiersmen would have been better matched . Montreal was perhaps the most dangerous place in Canada . In time of war , which might have been called the normal condition of the colony , it was exposed by its position to incessant inroads of the Iroquois , or Five Nations , of New York ; and no man could venture into the forests or the fields without bearing his life in his hand . The savage confederates had just received a sharp chastisement at the hands of Courcelles , the governor ; and the result was a treaty of peace , which might at any moment be broken , but which was an inexpressible relief while it lasted . The priests of St. Sulpice were granting out their lands , on very easy terms , to settlers . They wished to extend a thin line of settlements along the front of their island , to form a sort of outpost , from which an alarm could be given on any descent of the Iroquois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had the priests understood him ,  --  which they evidently did not , for some of them suspected him of levity , the last foible with which he could be charged ,  --  had they understood him , they would have seen in him a young man in whom the fire of youth glowed not the less ardently for the veil of reserve that covered it ; who would shrink from no danger , but would not court it in bravado ; and who would cling with an invincible tenacity of gripe to any purpose which he might espouse . There is good reason to think that he had come to Canada with purposes already conceived , and that he was ready to avail himself of any stepping-stone which might help to realize them . Queylus , Superior of the Seminary , made him a generous offer ; and he accepted it . This was the gratuitous grant of a large tract of land at the place now called La Chine , above the great rapids of the same name , and eight or nine miles from Montreal . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and on the other , it was favorably situated for the fur-trade . La Salle and his successors became its feudal proprietors , on the sole condition of delivering to the Seminary , on every change of ownership , a medal of fine silver , weighing one mark . Footnote : Transport de la Seigneurie de St. Sulpice , cited by Faillon . La Salle called his new domain as above . Two or three years later , it received the name of La Chine , for a reason which will appear . He entered on the improvement of his new domain , with what means he could command , and began to grant out his land to such settlers as would join him . Approaching the shore where the city of Montreal now stands , one would have seen a row of small compact dwellings , extending along a narrow street , parallel to the river , and then , as now , called St. Paul Street . On a hill at the right stood the windmill of the seigneurs , built of stone , and pierced with loop-holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of defence . On the left , in an angle formed by the junction of a rivulet with the St. Lawrence , was a square bastioned fort of stone . Here lived the military governor , appointed by the Seminary , and commanding a few soldiers of the regiment of Carignan . In front , on the line of the street , were the enclosure and buildings of the Seminary , and , nearly adjoining them , those of the Hotel-Dieu , or Hospital , both provided for defence in case of an Indian attack . In the hospital enclosure was a small church , opening on the street , and , in the absence of any other , serving for the whole settlement . Footnote : A detailed plan of Montreal at this time is preserved in the Archives de l'Empire , and has been reproduced by Faillon . There is another , a few years later , and still more minute , of which a fac-simile will be found in the Library of the Canadian Parliament . Landing , passing the fort , and walking southward along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and entered the primeval forest . Here , mile after mile , he would have journeyed on in solitude , when the hoarse roar of the rapids , foaming in fury on his left , would have reached his listening ear ; and , at length , after a walk of some three hours , he would have found the rude beginnings of a settlement . It was where the St. Lawrence widens into the broad expanse called the Lake of St. Louis . Here , La Salle had traced out the circuit of a palisaded village , and assigned to each settler half an arpent , or about a third of an acre , within the enclosure , for which he was to render to the young seigneur a yearly acknowledgment of three capons , besides six deniers  --  that is , half a sou  - -  in money . To each was assigned , moreover , sixty arpents of land beyond the limits of the village , with the perpetual rent of half a sou for each arpent . He also set apart a common , two hundred arpents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of the payment by each of five sous a year . He reserved four hundred and twenty arpents for his own personal domain , and on this he began to clear the ground and erect buildings . Similar to this were the beginnings of all the Canadian seigniories formed at this troubled period . Footnote : The above particulars have been unearthed by the indefatigable Abbe Faillon . Some of La Salle 's grants are still preserved in the ancient records of Montreal . That La Salle came to Canada with objects distinctly in view , is probable from the fact that he at once began to study the Indian languages , and with such success that he is said , within two or three years , to have mastered the Iroquois and seven or eight other languages and dialects . Footnote : Papiers de Famille , MSS . He is said to have made several journeys into the forests , towards the North , in the years 1667 and 1668 , and to have satisfied himself that little could be hoped from explorations in that direction . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broad breast of the Lake of St. Louis , bounded by the dim forests of Chateauguay and Beauharnois ; but his thoughts flew far beyond , across the wild and lonely world that stretched towards the sunset . Like Champlain and all the early explorers , he dreamed of a passage to the South Sea , and a new road for commerce to the riches of China and Japan . Indians often came to his secluded settlement ; and , on one occasion , he was visited by a band of the Seneca Iroquois , not long before the scourge of the colony , but now , in virtue of the treaty , wearing the semblance of friendship . The visitors spent the winter with him , and told him of a river called the Ohio , rising in their country , and flowing into the sea , but at such a distance that its mouth could only be reached after a journey of eight or nine months . Evidently , the Ohio and the Mississippi are here merged into one . Footnote : According to Dollier de Casson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Mississippi the Ohio , while the Algonquins gave it its present name . In accordance with geographical views then prevalent , he conceived that this great river must needs flow into the " Vermilion Sea ; " that is , the Gulf of California . If so , it would give him what he sought ,  --  a western passage to China ; while , in any case , the populous Indian tribes said to inhabit its banks , might be made a source of great commercial profit . La Salle 's imagination took fire . His resolution was soon formed ; and he descended the St. Lawrence to Quebec , to gain the countenance of the Governor to his intended exploration . Few men were more skilled than he in the art of clear and plausible statement . Both the Governor , Courcelles , and the Intendant , Talon , were readily won over to his plan ; for which , however , they seem to have given him no more substantial aid than that of the Governor 's letters patent authorizing the enterprise . Footnote : Talon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oct. 1670 , expresses himself as if the enterprise had originated with him . The cost was to be his own ; and he had no money , having spent it all on his seigniory . He therefore proposed that the Seminary , which had given it to him , should buy it back again , with such improvements as he had made . Queylus , the Superior , being favorably disposed towards him , consented , and bought of him the greater part ; while La Salle sold the remainder , including the clearings , to one Jean Milot , an ironmonger , for twenty-eight hundred livres . Footnote : Faillon , Colonie Francaise en Canada , iii . 288 . With this he bought four canoes , with the necessary supplies , and hired fourteen men . Meanwhile , the Seminary itself was preparing a similar enterprise . The Jesuits at this time not only held , an ascendency over the other ecclesiastics in Canada , but exercised an inordinate influence on the civil government . The Seminary priests of Montreal were jealous of these powerful rivals , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the conquering of new domains for the Faith . Under this impulse , they had , three years before , established a mission at Quinte , on the north shore of Lake Ontario , in charge of two of their number , one of whom was the Abbe Fenelon , elder brother of the celebrated Archbishop of Cambray . Another of them , Dollier de Casson , had spent the winter in a hunting-camp of the Nipissings , where an Indian prisoner , captured in the North-west , told him of populous tribes of that quarter , living in heathenish darkness . On this , the Seminary priests resolved to essay their conversion ; and an expedition , to be directed by Dollier , was fitted out to this end . He was not ill suited to the purpose . He had been a soldier in his youth , and had fought valiantly as an officer of cavalry under Turenne . He was a man of great courage ; of a tall , commanding person ; and uncommon bodily strength , of which he had given striking proofs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Footnote : He was the author of the very curious and valuable Histoire de Montreal , preserved in the Bibliotheque Mazarine , of which a copy is in my possession . The Historical Society of Montreal has recently resolved to print it . On going to Quebec , to procure the necessary outfit , he was urged by Courcelles to modify his plans so far as to act in concert with La Salle in exploring the mystery of the great unknown river of the West . Dollier and his brother priests consented . One of them , Galinee , was joined with him as a colleague , because he was skilled in surveying , and could make a map of their route . Three canoes were procured , and seven hired men completed the party . It was determined that La Salle 's expedition , and that of the Seminary , should be combined in one ; an arrangement ill suited to the character of the young explorer , who was unfit for any enterprise of which he was not the undisputed chief . Midsummer was near , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was most unpropitious , for a Seneca chief had lately been murdered by three scoundrel soldiers of the fort of Montreal ; and , while they were undergoing their trial , it became known that three other Frenchmen had treacherously put to death several Iroquois of the Oneida tribe ,  --  in order to get possession of their furs . The whole colony trembled in expectation of a new outbreak of the war . Happily , the event proved otherwise . The authors of the last murder escaped : but the three soldiers were shot at Montreal , in presence of a considerable number of the Iroquois , who declared themselves satisfied with the atonement ; and on this same day , the sixth of July , the adventurers began their voyage .

With them were two other canoes , bearing the party of Senecas who had wintered at La Salle 's settlement , and who were now to act as guides . They fought their way upward against the perilous rapids of the St. Lawrence , then scarcely known to the voyager , threaded the romantic channels of the Thousand Islands , and issued on Lake Ontario . Thirty days of toil and exposure had told upon them so severely that not a man of the party , except the Indians , had escaped the attacks of disease in some form . Their guides led them directly to the great village of the Senecas , near the banks of the Genesee , flattering them with the hope that they would here find other guides , to conduct them to the Ohio ; and , in truth , the Senecas had among them a prisoner of one of the western tribes , who would have answered their purpose . The chiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mastered the language sufficiently to serve as spokesman ; and a Dutch interpreter , brought by the priests , could not explain himself in French . The Jesuit Fremin was stationed at the village , and his servant came to their aid : but , as the two priests thought , wilfully misinterpreted them ; and they also conceived the suspicion , perhaps uncharitable , that the Jesuits , jealous of their enterprise , had tampered with the Senecas , to thwart it . Be this as it may , the Indians proved impracticable , evaded their request for a guide , burned before their eyes the unfortunate western prisoner , and assured them that if they went to the Ohio the people of those parts would put them to death . As there were many among the Senecas who wished to kill them in revenge for the chief murdered near Montreal , and as these and others were at times in a frenzy of drunkenness with brandy brought from Albany , the position of the French was very hazardous . They remained , however , for a month ; still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an Indian from a village called Ganastogue , a kind of Iroquois colony at the head of Lake Ontario , offered to conduct them thither , assuring them that they would find what they sought . They left the Seneca town ; coasted the south shore of the lake ; passed the mouth of the Niagara , where they heard the distant roar of the cataract ; and , five days after , reached Ganastogue . The inhabitants proved friendly , and La Salle received the welcome present of a Shawnee prisoner , who told them that the Ohio could he reached in six weeks , and that he would guide them to it . Delighted at this good fortune , they were about to set out ; when they heard , to their astonishment , of the arrival of two other Frenchmen at a neighboring village . One of the strangers proved to be a man destined to hold a conspicuous place in the history of western discovery . This was Louis Joliet , a young man of about the age of La Salle . Like him , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wilderness had conquered his early inclinations , and changed him to an active and adventurous fur-trader . Talon had sent him to discover and explore the copper-mines of Lake Superior . He had failed in the attempt , and was now returning . His Indian guide , afraid of passing the Niagara portage lest he should meet enemies , had led him from Lake Erie , by way of Grand River , towards the head of Lake Ontario ; and thus it was that he met La Salle and the Sulpitians . This meeting caused a change of plan . Joliet showed the priests a map which he had made , of such parts of the Upper Lakes as he had visited , and gave them a copy of it ; telling them , at the same time , of the Pottawattamies , and other tribes of that region , in grievous need of spiritual succor . The result was a determination on their part to follow the route which he suggested , notwithstanding the remonstrances of La Salle , who in vain reminded them that the Jesuits had pre-occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They resolved that the Pottawattamies should no longer sit in darkness ; while , as for the Mississippi , it could be reached , as they conceived , with less risk by this northern route than by that of the south . Since reaching the head of Lake Ontario , La Salle had been attacked by a violent fever , from which he was not yet recovered . He now told his two colleagues that he was in no condition to go forward , and should be forced to part with them . The staple of La Salle 's character , as his life will attest , was an invincible determination of purpose , which set at naught all risks and all sufferings . He had cast himself with all his resources into this enterprise , and , while his faculties remained , he was not a man to recoil from it . On the other hand , the masculine fibre of which he was made did not always withhold him from the practice of the arts of address , and the use of what Dollier de Casson styles belles paroles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seems , of the Jesuits ,  - -  and he was under obligations to the Sulpitians of Montreal . Hence there can be no doubt that he used his illness as a pretext for escaping from their company without ungraciousness , and following his own path in his own way . On the last day of September , the priests made an altar , supported by the paddles of the canoes laid on forked sticks . Dollier said mass ; La Salle and his followers received the sacrament , as did also those of his late colleagues ; and thus they parted ,  --  the Sulpitians and their party descending the Grand River towards Lake Erie , while La Salle , as they supposed , began his return to Montreal . What course he actually took , we shall soon inquire ; and meanwhile , for a few moments , we will follow the priests . When they reached Lake Erie , they saw it tossing like an angry ocean under a wild autumnal sky . They had no mind to tempt the dangerous and unknown navigation , and encamped for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long Point . Here they gathered a good store of chestnuts , hickory-nuts , plums , and grapes ; and built themselves a log-cabin , with a recess at the end for an altar . They passed the winter unmolested , shooting game in abundance , and saying mass three times a week . Early in spring , they planted a large cross , attached to it the arms of France , and took formal possession of the country in the name of Louis XIV . This done , they resumed their voyage , and , after many troubles , landed one evening in a state of exhaustion on or near Point Pelee , towards the western extremity of Lake Erie . A storm rose as they lay asleep , and swept off a great part of their baggage , which , in their fatigue , they had left at the edge of the water . Their altar-service was lost with the rest ,  --  a misfortune which they ascribed to the jealousy and malice of the Devil . Debarred henceforth from saying mass , they resolved to return to Montreal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strait by which Lake Huron joins Lake Erie ; and , landing near where Detroit now stands , found a large stone , somewhat suggestive of the human figure , which the Indians had bedaubed with paint , and which they worshipped as a manito . In view of their late misfortune , this device of the arch-enemy excited their utmost resentment . " After the loss of our altar-service , " writes Galinee , " and the hunger we had suffered , there was not a man of us who was not filled with hatred against this false deity . I devoted one of my axes to breaking him in pieces ; and then , having fastened our canoes side by side , we carried the largest piece to the middle of the river , and threw it , with all the rest , into the water , that he might never be heard of again . " This is the first recorded passage of white men through the Strait of Detroit ; though Joliet had , no doubt , passed this way on his return from the Upper Lakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the Upper Lakes , had followed the route of the Ottawa , or , more recently , that of Toronto and the Georgian Bay . Iroquois hostility had long closed the Niagara portage and Lake Erie against them . The two missionaries took this course , with the intention of proceeding to the Saut Sainte Marie , and there joining the Ottawas , and other tribes of that region , in their yearly descent to Montreal . They issued upon Lake Huron ; followed its eastern shores till they reached the Georgian Bay , near the head of which the Jesuits had established their great mission of the Hurons , destroyed , twenty years before , by the Iroquois ; Footnote : " Jesuits in North America . " and , ignoring or slighting the labors of the rival missionaries , held their way northward along the rocky archipelago that edged those lonely coasts . They passed the Manatoulins , and , ascending the strait by which Lake Superior discharges its waters , arrived on the twenty-fifth of May at Ste. Marie du Saut . Here they found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fort of cedar pickets , built by their men within the past year , and enclosing a chapel and a house . Near by , they had cleared a large tract of land , and sown it with wheat , Indian corn , peas , and other crops . The new-comers were graciously received , and invited to vespers in the chapel ; but they very soon found La Salle 's prediction made good , and saw that the Jesuit fathers wanted no help from St. Sulpice . Galinee , on his part , takes occasion to remark that , though the Jesuits had baptized a few Indians at the Saut , not one of them was a good enough Christian to receive the Eucharist ; and he intimates , that the case , by their own showing , was still worse at their mission of St. Esprit . The two Sulpitians did not care to prolong their stay ; and , three days after their arrival , they left the Saut : not , as they expected , with the Indians , but with a French guide , furnished by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they crossed to the waters of the Ottawa , and descended to Montreal , which they reached on the eighteenth of June . They had made no discoveries and no converts ; but Galinee , after his arrival , made the earliest map of the Upper Lakes known to exist . Footnote : Galinee appears to have made use of the map given him by Joliet . He says , in the narrative of his journey , that he has laid down on his own map nothing but what he had himself seen ; but this is disproved by the map itself . Thus , he represents with minuteness the northern coast as far west as the islands at the mouth of Green Bay ; but that he never went so far is evident not only from his own journal , but from the fact that he was ignorant of the existence of the Straits of Michillimackinac and the peninsula of Michigan ; Lakes Huron and Michigan being by him merged into one , under the name of " Michigane , ou Mer Douce des Hurons . " The map , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half feet by three and a half . It is covered with descriptive remarks , which , oddly enough , are all inverted , so that it must be turned with the north side down in order to read them . Faillon has engraved it , but on a small scale , with the omission of most of the inscriptions , and other changes . The well-known Jesuit map of Lake Superior appeared the year after . Besides making the map , Galinee wrote a very long and minute journal of the expedition , which is preserved in the Bibliotheque Imperiale . Much of the substance of it is given by Faillon , Colonie Francaise , iii . chap , vii. , and Margry , Journal General de l'Instruction Publique , xxxi . No. 67 . In the letters of Talon to Colbert are various allusions to the journey of Dollier and Galinee . We return now to La Salle , only to find ourselves involved in mist and obscurity . What did he do after he left the two priests ? Unfortunately , a definite answer is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain in some measure an enigma . That he was busied in active exploration , and that he made important discoveries , is certain ; but the extent and character of these discoveries remain wrapped in doubt . He is known to have kept journals and made maps ; and these were in existence , and in possession of his niece , Madeleine Cavelier , then in advanced age , as late as the year 1756 ; Footnote : See Margry , in Journal General de l'Instruction Publique , xxxi. 659. beyond which time the most diligent inquiry has failed to trace them . The Abbe Faillon affirms , that some of La Salle 's men , refusing to follow him , returned to La Chine , and that the place then received its name , in derision of the young adventurer 's dream of a westward passage to China . Footnote : Dollier de Casson alludes to this as " cette transmigration celebre qui se fit de la Chine dans ces quartiers . " As for himself , the only distinct record of his movements is that contained in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la Salle . " It is an account of his explorations , and of the state of parties in Canada previous to the year 1678 ; taken from the lips of La Salle himself , by a person whose name does not appear , but who declares that he had ten or twelve conversations with him at Paris , whither he had come with a petition to the Court . The writer himself had never been in America , and was ignorant of its geography ; hence blunders on his part might reasonably be expected . His statements , however , are in some measure intelligible ; and the following is the substance of them . After leaving the priests , La Salle went to Onondaga , where we are left to infer that he succeeded better in getting a guide than he had before done among the Senecas . Thence he made his way to a point six or seven leagues distant from Lake Erie , where he reached a branch of the Ohio ; and , descending it , followed the river as far as the rapids at Louisville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confluence with the Mississippi . His men now refused to go farther , and abandoned him , escaping to the English and the Dutch ; whereupon he retraced his steps alone . Footnote : As no part of the memoir referred to has been published , I extract the passage relating to this journey . After recounting La Salle 's visit with the Sulpitians to the Seneca village , and stating that the intrigues of the Jesuit missionary prevented them from obtaining a guide , it speaks of the separation of the travellers and the journey of Galinee and his party to the Saut Ste. Marie , where " les Jesuites les congedierent . " It then proceeds as follows : " Cependant Mr. de la Salle continua son chemin par une riviere qui va de l'est a l'ouest ; et passe a Onontaque ( Onondaga ) , puis a six ou sept lieues au-dessous du Lac Erie ; et estant parvenu jusqu'au 280me ou 83me degre de longitude , et jusqu'au 4lme degre de latitude , trouva un sault qui tombe vers l'ouest dans un pays has , marescageux , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ en a quelquesunes qui sont encore sur pied . Il fut done contraint de prendre terre , et suivant une hauteur qui le pouvoit mener loin , il trouva quelques sauvages qui luy dirent que fort loin de la le mesme fleuve qui se perdoit dans cette terre basse et vaste se reunnissoit en un lit . Il continua done son chemin , mais comme la fatigue estoit grande , 23 ou 24 hommes qu'il avoit menez jusques la le quitterent tous en une nuit , regagnerent le fleuve , et se sauverent , les uns a la Nouvelle Hollande et les autres a la Nouvelle Angleterre . Il se vit done seul a 400 lieues de chez luy , ou il ne laisse pas de revenir , remontant la riviere et vivant de chasse , d'herbes , et de ce que luy donnerent les sauvages qu'il rencontra en son chemin . " This must have been in the winter of 1669-70 , or in the following spring ; unless there is an error of date in the statement of Nicolas Perrot , the famous voyageur , who says that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ottawa with a party of Iroquois . Footnote : Perrot , Memoires , 119 , 120 . But how was La Salle employed in the following year ? The same memoir has its solution to the problem . By this it appears that the indefatigable explorer embarked on Lake Erie , ascended the Detroit to Lake Huron , coasted the unknown shores of Michigan , passed the Straits of Michillimackinac , and leaving Green Bay behind him , entered what is described as an incomparably larger bay , but which was evidently the southern portion of Lake Michigan . Thence he crossed to a river flowing westward ,  --  evidently the Illinois ,  --  and followed it until it was joined by another river flowing from the northwest to the southeast . By this , the Mississippi only can be meant ; and he is reported to have said that he descended it to the thirty-sixth degree of latitude ; where he stopped , assured that it discharged itself not into the Gulf of California , but into the Gulf of Mexico ; and resolved to follow it thither at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies . Footnote : The memoir ,  - -  after stating , as above , that he entered Lake Huron , doubled the peninsula of Michigan , and passed La Baye des Puants ( Green Bay ) ,  --  says , " Il reconnut une baye incomparablement plus large ; au fond de laquelle vers l'ouest il trouva un tres-beau havre et au fond de ce havre un fleuve qui va de l'est a l'ouest . Il suivit ce fleuve , et estant parvenu jusqu'environ le 280me degre de longitude et le 39me de latitude , il trouva un autre fleuve qui se joignant au premier coulait du nordouest au sud-est , et il suivit ce fleuve jusqu'au 36me degre de latitude . " The " tres-beau havre " may have been the entrance of the River Chicago , whence , by an easy portage , he might have reached the Des Plaines branch of the Illinois . We shall see that he took this course in his famous exploration of 1682 . The Intendant Talon announces in his despatches of this year that he had sent La Salle southward and westward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating to the Ohio ,  --  confused , vague , and in great part incorrect as it certainly is , is nevertheless well sustained as regards one essential point . La Salle himself , in a memorial addressed to Count Frontenac in 1677 , affirms that he discovered the Ohio , and descended it as far as to a fall which obstructed it . Footnote : The following are his words ( he speaks of himself in the third person ) : " L'annee 1667 , et les suivantes , il fit divers voyages avec beaucoup de depenses , dans lesquels il decouvrit le premier beaucoup de pays au sud des grands lacs , et entre autres la grande riviere d'Ohio ; il la suivit jusqu'a un endroit ou elle tombe de fort haut dans de vastes marais , a la hauteur de 37 degres , apres avoir ete grossie par une autre riviere fort large qui vient du nord ; et toutes ces eaux se dechargent selon toutes les apparences dans le Golfe du Mexique . " This " autre riviere , " which , it seems , was above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scioto . There is but one fall on the river , that of Louisville , which is not so high as to deserve to be described as " fort haut , " being only a strong rapid . The latitude , as will be seen , is different in the two accounts , and incorrect in both . Again , his rival , Louis Joliet , whose testimony on this point can not be suspected , made two maps of the region of the Mississippi and the Great Lakes . The Ohio is laid down on both of them , with an inscription to the effect that it had been explored by La Salle . Footnote : One of these maps is entitled Carte de la decouverte du Sieur Joliet , 1674 . Over the lines representing the Ohio are the words , " Route du sieur de la Salle pour aller dans le Mexique . " The other map of Joliet bears , also written over the Ohio , the words , " Riviere par ou descendit le sieur de la Salle au sortir du lac Erie pour aller clans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made before the voyage of Joliet and Marquette , and apparently in the year 1673 , on which the Ohio is represented as far as to a point a little below Louisville , and over it is written , " Riviere Ohio , ainsy appellee par les Iroquois a cause de sa beaute , par ou le sieur de la Salle est descendu . " The Mississippi is not represented on this map ; but  --  and this is very significant , as indicating the extent of La Salle 's exploration of the following year  --  a small part of the upper Illinois is laid down . That he discovered the Ohio may then be regarded as established . That he descended it to the Mississippi , he himself does not pretend ; nor is there reason to believe that he did so . With regard to his alleged voyage down the Illinois , the case is different . Here , he is reported to have made a statement which admits but one interpretation ,  --  that of the discovery by him of the Mississippi prior to its discovery by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man not prone to vaunt his own exploits , who never proclaimed them in print , and whose testimony , even in his own case , must therefore have weight . But it comes to us through the medium of a person , strongly biased in favor of La Salle and against Marquette and the Jesuits . Seven years had passed since the alleged discovery , and La Salle had not before laid claim to it ; although it was matter of notoriety that during five years it had been claimed by Joliet , and that his claim was generally admitted . The correspondence of the Governor and the Intendant is silent as to La Salle 's having penetrated to the Mississippi ; though the attempt was made under the auspices of the latter , as his own letters declare ; while both had the discovery of the great river earnestly at heart . The governor , Frontenac , La Salle 's ardent supporter and ally , believed in 1672 , as his letters show , that the Mississippi flowed into the Gulf of California , and , two years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joliet . Footnote : Lettre de Frontenac au Ministre , 14 Nov. 1674 . He here speaks of " la grande riviere qu'il ( Joliet ) a trouvee , qui va du nord au sud , et qui est aussi large que celle du Saint-Laurent vis-a-vis de Quebec . " Four years later , Frontenac speaks slightingly of Joliet , but neither denies his discovery of the Mississippi nor claims it for La Salle , in whose interest he writes . After La Salle 's death , his brother , his nephew , and his niece addressed a memorial to the King , petitioning for certain grants in consideration of the discoveries of their relative , which they specify at some length ; but they do not pretend that he reached the Mississippi before his expeditions of 1679 to 1682 . Footnote : Papiers de Famille , MSS. ; Memoire presente au Roi . The following is an extract : " Il parvient ... jusqu'a la riviere des Illinois . Il y construisit un fort situe a 350 lieues au-dela du fort de Frontenac , et suivant ensuite le cours de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand fleuve appelle par ceux du pays Missisippi , c'est a dire grande eau , environ cent lieues audessous du fort qu'il venoit de construire . " This fort was Fort Crevecoeur , built in 1680 , near the site of Peoria . The memoir goes on to relate the descent of La Salle to the Gulf , which concluded this expedition of 1679-82 . This silence is the more significant , as it is this very niece who had possession of the papers in which La Salle recounts the journeys of which the issues are in question . Footnote : The following is an extract , given by Margry , from a letter of the aged Madeleine Cavelier , dated 21 Fevrier , 1756 , and addressed to her nephew M. Le Baillif , who had applied for the papers in behalf of the minister , Silhouette : " J'ay cherche une occasion sure pour vous anvoye les papiers de M. de la Salle . Il y a des cartes que j'ay jointe a ces papiers , qui doivent prouver que , en 1675 , M. de Lasalle avet deja @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ une carte , que je vous envoye , par laquelle il est fait mention de l'androit auquel M. de Lasalle aborda pres le fleuve de Mississipi . " This , though brought forward to support the claim of discovery prior to Joliet , seems to indicate that La Salle had not reached the Mississippi , but only approached it , previous to 1675 . Margry , in a series of papers in the Journal General de l'Instruction Publique for 1862 , first took the position that La Salle reached the Mississippi in 1670 and 1671 , and has brought forward in defence of it all the documents which his unwearied research enabled him to discover . Father Tailhan , S.J. , has replied at length , in the copious notes to his edition of Nicolas Perrot , but without having seen the principal document cited by Margry , and of which extracts have been given in the notes to this chapter . Had they led him to the Mississippi , it is reasonably certain that she would have made it known in her memorial . La Salle discovered the Ohio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he discovered the Mississippi has not been proved , nor , in the light of the evidence we have , is it likely . CHAPTER III . 1670-1672 . THE JESUITS ON THE LAKES . THE OLD MISSIONS AND THE NEW .  --  A CHANGE OF SPIRIT .  --  LAKE SUPERIOR AND THE COPPER-MINES.  --  STE . MARIE .  --  LA POINTE.  --  MICHILLIMACKINAC.  --  JESUITS ON LAKE MICHIGAN .  --  ALLOUEZ AND DABLON.  --  THE JESUIT FUR-TRADE . What were the Jesuits doing ? Since the ruin of their great mission of the Hurons , a perceptible change had taken place in them . They had put forth exertions almost superhuman , set at naught famine , disease , and death , lived with the self-abnegation of saints and died with the devotion of martyrs ; and the result of all had been a disastrous failure . From no short-coming on their part , but from the force of events beyond the sphere of their influence , a very demon of havoc had crushed their incipient churches , slaughtered their converts , uprooted the populous communities on which their hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fugitives far and wide through the wilderness . Footnote : See " The Jesuits in North America . " They had devoted themselves in the fulness of faith to the building up of a Christian and Jesuit empire on the conversion of the great stationary tribes of the lakes ; and of these none remained but the Iroquois ,  --  the destroyers of the rest , among whom , indeed , was a field which might stimulate their zeal by an abundant promise of sufferings and martyrdoms ; but which , from its geographical position , was too much exposed to Dutch and English influence to promise great and decisive results . Their best hopes were now in the North and the West ; and thither , in great part , they had turned their energies . We find them on Lake Huron , Lake Superior , and Lake Michigan , laboring vigorously as of old , but in a spirit not quite the same . Now , as before , two objects inspired their zeal , the " greater glory of God , " and the influence and credit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat lost in power , the other had gained . The epoch of the saints and martyrs was passing away ; and henceforth we find the Canadian Jesuit less and less an apostle , more and more an explorer , a man of science , and a politician . The yearly reports of the missions are still , for the edification of the pious reader , stuffed with intolerably tedious stories of baptisms , conversions , and the exemplary deportment of neophytes ; for these have become a part of the formula ; but they are relieved abundantly by more mundane topics . One finds observations on the winds , currents , and tides of the Great Lakes ; speculations on a subterranean outlet of Lake Superior ; accounts of its copper-mines , and how we , the Jesuit fathers , are laboring to explore them for the profit of the colony ; surmises touching the North Sea , the South Sea , the Sea of China , which we hope ere long to discover ; and reports of that great mysterious river of which the Indians tell us ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps to the Vermilion Sea ,  --  and the secrets whereof , with the help of the Virgin , we will soon reveal to the world . The Jesuit was as often a fanatic for his order as for his faith ; and oftener yet , the two fanaticisms mingled in him inextricably . Ardently as he burned for the saving of souls , he would have none saved on the Upper Lakes except by his brethren and himself . He claimed a monopoly of conversion , with its attendant monopoly of toil , hardship , and martyrdom . Often disinterested for himself , he was inordinately ambitious for the great corporate power in which he had merged his own personality ; and here lies one cause , among many , of the seeming contradictions which abound in the annals of the order . Prefixed to the Relation of 1671 is that monument of Jesuit hardihood and enterprise , the map of Lake Superior ; a work of which , however , the exactness has been exaggerated , as compared with other Canadian maps of the day . While making surveys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dablon reports that they had found it in greatest abundance on Isle Minong , now Isle Royale . " A day 's journey from the head of the lake , on the south side , there is , " he says , " a rock of copper weighing from six hundred to eight hundred pounds , lying on the shore where any who pass may see it ; " and he farther speaks of great copper boulders in the bed of the River Ontonagan . Footnote : He complains that the Indians were very averse to giving information on the subject , so that the Jesuits had not as yet discovered the metal in situ , though they hoped soon to do so . The Indians told him that the copper had first been found by four hunters , who had landed on a certain island , near the north shore of the lake . Wishing to boil their food in a vessel of bark , they gathered stones on the shore , heated them red hot and threw them in ; but presently discovered them to be pure copper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of the lynxes and the hares ; which , on this island , were as large as dogs , and which would have devoured their provisions , and perhaps their canoe . They took with them some of the wonderful stones ; but scarcely had they left the island , when a deep voice , like thunder , sounded in their ears , " Who are these thieves who steal the toys of my children ? " It was the God of the Waters , or some other powerful manito . The four adventurers retreated in great terror , but three of them soon died , and the fourth survived only long enough to reach his village and tell the story . The island has no foundation , but floats with the movement of the wind ; and no Indian dares land on its shores , dreading the wrath of the manito.  --  Dablon , Relation , 1670 , 84 . There were two principal missions on the Upper Lakes ; which were , in a certain sense , the parents of the rest . One of these was Ste. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Galinee ,  --  at the outlet of Lake Superior . This was a noted fishing-place ; for the rapids were full of white-fish , and Indians came thither in crowds . The permanent residents were an Ojibwa band , called by the French Sauteurs , whose bark lodges were clustered at the foot of the rapids , near the fort of the Jesuits . Besides these , a host of Algonquins , of various tribes , resorted thither in the spring and summer ; living in abundance on the fishery , and dispersing in winter to wander and starve in scattered hunting-parties far and wide through the forests . The other chief mission was that of St. Esprit , at La Pointe , near the western extremity of Lake Superior . Here were the Hurons ,  --  fugitives twenty years before from the slaughter of their countrymen ; and the Ottawas , who , like them , had sought an asylum from the rage of the Iroquois . Many other tribes ,  --  Illinois , Pottawattamies , Foxes , Menomonies , Sioux , Assinneboins , Knisteneaux , and a multitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French . Here was a young Jesuit , Jacques Marquette , lately arrived from the Saut Ste. Marie . His savage flock disheartened him by its backslidings : and the best that he could report of the Hurons , after all the toils and all the blood lavished in their conversion , was , that they " still retain a little Christianity ; " while the Ottawas are " far removed from the kingdom of God , and addicted beyond all other tribes to foulness , incantations , and sacrifices to evil spirits . " Footnote : Lettre du Pere Jacques Marquette au R. P. Superieur des Missions ; in Relation , 1670 , 87 . Marquette heard from the Illinois ,  --  yearly visitors at La Pointe ,  --  of the great river which they had crossed on their way , Footnote : The Illinois lived at this time beyond the Mississippi , thirty days ' journey from La Pointe ; whither they had been driven by the Iroquois , from their former abode near Lake Michigan . Dablon , ( Relation , 1671 ; 24 , 25 , ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi , in eight villages . A few years later , most of them returned to the east side and made their abode on the River Illinois. and which , as he conjectured , flowed into the Gulf of California . He heard marvels of it also from the Sioux , who lived on its banks ; and a strong desire possessed him , to explore the mystery of its course . A sudden calamity dashed his hopes . The Sioux ,  --  the Iroquois of the West , as the Jesuits call them ,  --  had hitherto kept the peace with the expatriated tribes of La Pointe ; but now , from some cause not worth inquiry , they broke into open war , and so terrified the Hurons and Ottawas that they abandoned their settlements and fled . Marquette followed his panic-stricken flock ; who , passing the Saut Ste. Marie , and descending to Lake Huron , stopped , at length ,  --  the Hurons at Michillimackinac , and the Ottawas at the Great Manatoulin Island . Two missions were now necessary to minister to the divided bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the Manatoulin Island to Louis Andre . The former took post at Point St. Ignace , on the north shore of the straits of Michillimackinac , while the latter began the mission of St. Simon at the new abode of the Ottawas . When winter came , scattering his flock to their hunting-grounds , Andre made a missionary tour among the Nipissings and other neighboring tribes . The shores of Lake Huron had long been an utter solitude , swept of their denizens by the terror of the all-conquering Iroquois ; but now that these tigers had felt the power of the French , and learned for a time to leave their Indian allies in peace , the fugitive hordes were returning to their ancient abodes . Andre 's experience among them was of the roughest . The staple of his diet was acorns and tripe de roche ,  --  a species of lichen , which , being boiled , resolved itself into a black glue , nauseous , but not void of nourishment . At times he was reduced to moss , the bark of trees , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His hosts treated him very ill , and the worst of their fare was always his portion . When spring came to his relief , he returned to his post of St. Simon , with impaired digestion and unabated zeal . Besides the Saut Ste. Marie and Michillimackinac ,  --  both noted fishing-places ,  --  there was another spot , no less famous for game and fish , and therefore a favorite resort of Indians . This was the head of the Green Bay of Lake Michigan . Footnote : The Baye des Puans of the early writers ; or , more correctly , La Baye des Eaux Puantes . The Winnebago Indians , living near it , were called Lies Puans , apparently for no other reason than because some portion of the bay was said to have an odor like the sea . Lake Michigan , the Lac des Illinois of the French , was , according to a letter of Father Allouez , called Machihiganing by the Indians . Dablon writes the name , Mitchiganon . Here and in adjacent districts several distinct tribes had made their abode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name ; the Pottawattamies and Winnebagoes were near the borders of the bay ; the Sacs on Fox River ; the Mascoutins , Miamis , and Kickapoos , on the same river , above Lake Winnebago ; and the Outagamies , or Foxes , on a tributary of it flowing from the north . Green Bay was manifestly suited for a mission ; and , as early as the autumn of 1669 , Father Claude Allouez was sent thither to found one . After nearly perishing by the way , he set out to explore the destined field of his labors , and went as far as the town of the Mascoutins . Early in the autumn of 1670 , having been joined by Dablon , Superior of the missions on the Upper Lakes , he made another journey ; but not until the two fathers had held a council with the congregated tribes at St. Francois Xavier ,  --  for so they named their mission of Green Bay . Here , as they harangued their naked audience , their gravity was put to the proof ; for a band of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down , aping the movements of the soldiers on guard before the Governor 's tent at Montreal . " We could hardly keep from laughing , " writes Dablon , " though we were discoursing on very important subjects ; namely , the mysteries of our religion , and the things necessary to escaping from eternal fire . " Footnote : Relation , 1671 , 43 . The fathers were delighted with the country , which Dablon. calls an earthly paradise ; but he adds that the way to it is as hard as the path to heaven . He alludes especially to the rapids of Fox River , which gave the two travellers great trouble . Having safely passed them , they saw an Indian idol on the bank , similar to that which Dollier and Galinee found at Detroit ; being merely a rock , bearing some resemblance to a man , and hideously painted . With the help of their attendants , they threw it into the river . Dablon expatiates on the buffalo ; which he describes apparently on the report of others , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the two priests followed the river leading to the town of the Mascoutins and Miamis , which they reached on the fifteenth of September . Footnote : This town was on the Neenah or Fox River , above Lake Winnebago . The Mascoutins , Fire Nation , or Nation of the Prairie , are extinct or merged in other tribes .  --  See " Jesuits in North America . " The Miamis soon removed to the banks of the River St. Joseph , near Lake Michigan . These two tribes lived together within the compass of the same inclosure of palisades ; to the number , it is said , of more than three thousand souls . The missionaries , who had brought a highly-colored picture of the Last Judgment , called the Indians to council and displayed it before them ; while Allouez , who spoke Algonquin , harangued them on hell , demons , and eternal flames . They listened with open ears , beset him night and day with questions , and invited him and his companion to unceasing feasts . They were welcomed in every lodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and awe . Dablon overflows with praises of the Miami chief ; who was honored by his subjects like a king , and whose demeanor to wards his guests had no savor of the savage . Their hosts told them of the great river Mississippi , rising far in the north and flowing southward ,  --  they knew not whither ,  --  and of many tribes that dwelt along its banks . When at length they took their departure , they left behind them a reputation as medicine-men of transcendent power . In the winter following , Allouez visited the Foxes , whom he found in extreme ill-humor . They were incensed against the French by the ill-usage which some of their tribe had lately met with when on a trading-visit to Montreal ; and they received the faith with shouts of derision . The priest was horror-stricken at what he saw . Their lodges ,  --  each , containing from five to ten families ,  --  seemed in his eyes like seraglios ; for some of the chiefs had eight wives . He armed himself with patience , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so well , that when he showed them his crucifix , they would throw tobacco on it as an offering ; and , on another visit , which he made them soon after , he taught the whole village to make the sign of the cross . A war-party was going out against their enemies , and he bethought him of telling them the story of the Cross and the Emperor Constantine . This so wrought upon them that they all daubed the figure of a cross on their shields of bull-hide , set out for the war , and came back victorious , extolling the sacred symbol as a great war-medicine . " Thus it is , " writes Dablon , who chronicles the incident , " that our holy faith is established among these people ; and we have good hope that we shall soon carry it to the famous river called the Mississippi , and perhaps even to the South Sea . " Footnote : Relation , 1672 , 42 . Most things human have their phases of the ludicrous ; and the heroism of these untiring priests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations were much alike . They consisted of a chapel ( commonly of logs ) and one or more houses , with perhaps a storehouse and a workshop ,  --  the whole fenced with palisades , and forming , in fact , a stockade fort , surrounded with clearings and cultivated fields . It is evident that the priests had need of other hands than their own and those of the few lay brothers attached to the mission . They required men inured to labor , accustomed to the forest life , able to guide canoes and handle tools and weapons . In the earlier epoch of the missions , when enthusiasm was at its height , they were served in great measure by volunteers , who joined them through devotion or penitence , and who were known as donnes , or " given men . " Of late , the number of these had much diminished ; and they now relied chiefly on hired men , or engages . These were employed in building , hunting , fishing , clearing and tilling the ground , guiding canoes , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colony in trading with the Indians for the profit of the missions . This charge of trading  --  which , if the results were applied exclusively to the support of the missions , does not of necessity involve much censure  --  is vehemently reiterated in many quarters , including the official despatches of the Governor of Canada ; while , so far as I can discover , the Jesuits never distinctly denied it ; and , on several occasions , they partially admitted its truth .

TALON.  --  ST . LUSSON.  --  PERROT.  --  THE CEREMONY AT SAUT STE . MARIE .  - -  THE SPEECH OF ALLOUEZ.  --  COUNT FRONTENAC . Jean Talon , Intendant of Canada , was a man of no common stamp . Able , vigorous , and patriotic ,  --  he was the worthy lieutenant and disciple of the great minister Colbert , the ill-requited founder of the prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future of New France , and labored strenuously to realize them . He urged upon the king a scheme which , could it have been accomplished , would have wrought strange changes on the American continent . This was , to gain possession of New York , by treaty or conquest ; Footnote : Lettre de Talon a Colbert , 27 Oct. 1667 . Twenty years after , the plan was again suggested by the Governor , Denonville. thus giving to Canada a southern access to the ocean , open at all seasons , separating New England from Virginia , and controlling the Iroquois , the most formidable enemy of the French colony . Louis XIV . held the king of England in his pay ; and , had the proposal been urged , the result could not have been foretold . The scheme failed , and Talon prepared to use his present advantages to the utmost . While laboring strenuously to develop the industrial resources of the colony , he addressed himself to discovering and occupying the interior of the continent ; controlling the rivers , which were its only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation . On the east , England was to be hemmed within a narrow strip of seaboard ; while , on the south , Talon aimed at securing a port on the Gulf of Mexico , to hold the Spaniards in check , and dispute with them the possession of the vast regions which they claimed as their own . But the interior of the continent was still an unknown world . It behooved him to explore it ; and to that end he availed himself of Jesuits , officers , fur-traders , and enterprising schemers like La Salle . His efforts at discovery seem to have been conducted with a singular economy of the king 's purse . La Salle paid all the expenses of his first expedition made under Talon 's auspices ; and apparently of the second also , though the Intendant announces it in his despatches as an expedition sent out by himself . Footnote : At all events , La Salle was in great need of money about the time of his second journey . On the sixth of August , 1671 , he had received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " from Branssat , fiscal attorney of the Seminary , merchandise to the amount of four hundred and fifty livres ; and , on the eighteenth of December of the following year , he gave his promise to pay the same sum , in money or furs , in the August following . Faillon found the papers in the ancient records of Montreal . When , in 1670 , he ordered Daumont de St. Lusson to search for copper-mines on Lake Superior , and , at the same time , to take formal possession of the whole interior for the king ; it was arranged that he should pay the costs of the journey by trading with the Indians . Footnote : In his despatch of 2d Nov. 1671 , Talon writes to the king that " St. Lusson 's expedition will cost nothing , as he has received beaver enough from the Indians to pay him . " St. Lusson set out with a small party of men , and Nicolas Perrot as his interpreter . Among Canadian voyageurs few names are so conspicuous as that of Perrot ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievement , but because he could write , and left behind him a tolerable account of what he had seen . Footnote : Moeurs , Coustumes , et Relligion des Sauvages de l'Amerique Septentrionale . This work of Perrot , hitherto unpublished , appeared in 1864 , under the editorship of Father Tailhan , S.J. A great part of it is incorporated in La Potherie . He was at this time twenty-six years old , and had formerly been an engage of the Jesuits . He was a man of enterprise , courage , and address ; the last being especially shown in his dealings with Indians , over whom he had great influence . He spoke Algonquin fluently , and was favorably known to many tribes of that family . St. Lusson wintered at the Manatoulin Islands ; while Perrot  --  having first sent messages to the tribes of the north , inviting them to meet the deputy of the Governor at the Saut Ste. Marie in the following spring  --  proceeded to Green Bay , to urge the same invitation upon the tribes of that quarter . They knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Miamis , it is said , received him with a sham battle , which was designed to do him honor , but by which nerves more susceptible would have been severely shaken . Footnote : See La Potherie , ii . 125 . Perrot himself does not mention it . Charlevoix erroneously places this interview at Chicago . Perrot 's narrative shows that he did not go farther than the tribes of Green Bay ; and the Miamis were then , as we have seen , on the upper part of Fox River . They entertained him also with a grand game of la crosse , the Indian ball-play . Perrot gives a marvellous account of the authority and state of the Miami chief ; who , he says , was attended day and night by a guard of warriors ,  --  an assertion which would be incredible were it not sustained by the account of the same chief given by the Jesuit Dablon . Of the tribes of the Bay , the greater part promised to send delegates to the Saut ; but the Pottawattamies dissuaded the Miami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatigue incident to it might injure his health ; and he therefore deputed them to represent him and his tribesmen at the great meeting . Their principal chiefs , with those of the Sacs , Winnebagoes , and Menomonies , embarked , and paddled for the place of rendezvous ; where they and Perrot arrived on the fifth of May . Footnote : Perrot , Memoires , 127 . St. Lusson was here with his men , fifteen in number , among whom was Louis Joliet ; Footnote : Proces Verbal de la Prise de Possession , etc. , 14 Juin , 1671 . The names are attached to this instrument. and Indians were fast thronging in from their wintering grounds ; attracted , as usual , by the fishery of the rapids , or moved by the messages sent by Perrot ,  - -  Crees , Monsonis , Amikoues , Nipissings , and many more . When fourteen tribes , or their representatives , had arrived , St. Lusson prepared to execute the commission with which he was charged . At the foot of the rapids was the village of the Sauteurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by stood the fort of the Jesuits . On the morning of the fourteenth of June , St. Lusson led his followers to the top of the hill , all fully equipped and under arms . Here , too , in the vestments of their priestly office , were four Jesuits ,  --  Claude Dablon , Superior of the Missions of the Lakes , Gabriel Druilletes , Claude Allouez , and Louis Andre . Footnote : Marquette is said to have been present ; but the official act , just cited , proves the contrary . He was still at St. Esprit . All around , the great throng of Indians stood , or crouched , or reclined at length , with eyes and ears intent . A large cross of wood had been made ready . Dablon , in solemn form , pronounced his blessing on it ; and then it was reared and planted in the ground , while the Frenchmen , uncovered , sang the Vexilla Regis . Then a post of cedar was planted beside it , with a metal plate attached , engraven with the royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of the Jesuits uttered a prayer for the king . St. Lusson now advanced , and , holding his sword in one hand , and raising with the other a sod of earth , proclaimed in a loud voice ,  --  " In the name of the Most High , Mighty , and Redoubted Monarch , Louis , Fourteenth of that name , Most Christian King of France and of Navarre , I take possession of this place , Sainte Marie du Saut , as also of Lakes Huron and Superior , the Island of Manatoulin , and all countries , rivers , lakes , and streams contiguous and adjacent thereunto ; both those which have been discovered and those which may be discovered hereafter , in all their length and breadth , bounded on the one side by the seas of the North and of the West , and on the other by the South Sea : declaring to the nations thereof that from this time forth they are vassals of his Majesty , bound to obey his laws and follow his customs : promising them on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their enemies : declaring to all other potentates , princes , sovereigns , states and republics ,  --  to them and their subjects ,  --  that they can not and are not to seize or settle upon any parts of the aforesaid countries , save only under the good pleasure of His Most Christian Majesty , and of him who will govern in his behalf ; and this on pain of incurring his resentment and the efforts of his arms . Vive le Roi . " Footnote : Proces Verbal de la Prise de Possession . The Frenchmen fired their guns and shouted " Vive le Roi , " and the yelps of the astonished Indians mingled with the din . What now remains of the sovereignty thus pompously proclaimed ? Now and then , the accents of France on the lips of some straggling boatman or vagabond half-breed ;  --  this , and nothing more . When the uproar was over , Father Allouez addressed the Indians in a solemn harangue ; and these were his words : " It is a good work , my brothers , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in council to-day . Look up at the cross which rises so high above your heads . It was there that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , after making himself a man for the love of men , was nailed and died , to satisfy his Eternal Father for our sins . He is the master of our lives ; the ruler of Heaven , Earth , and Hell . It is he of whom I am continually speaking to you , and whose name and word I have borne through all your country . But look at this post to which are fixed the arms of the great chief of France , whom we call King . He lives across the sea . He is the chief of the greatest chiefs , and has no equal on earth . All the chiefs whom you have ever seen are but children beside him . He is like a great tree , and they are but the little herbs that one walks over and tramples under foot . You know Onontio , Footnote : The Indian name of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know and you have seen that he is the terror of the Iroquois , and that his very name makes them tremble , since he has laid their country waste and burned their towns with fire . Across the sea there are ten thousand Onontios like him , who are but the warriors of our great King , of whom I have told you . When he says , ' I am going to war , ' everybody obeys his orders ; and each of these ten thousand chiefs raises a troop of a hundred warriors , some on sea and some on land . Some embark in great ships , such as you have seen at Quebec . Your canoes carry only four or five men , or at the most , ten or twelve ; but our ships carry four or five hundred , and sometimes a thousand . Others go to war by land , and in such numbers that if they stood in a double file they would reach from here to Mississaquenk , which is more than twenty leagues off . When our King attacks his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth trembles ; the air and the sea are all on fire with the blaze of his cannon : he is seen in the midst of his warriors , covered over with the blood of his enemies , whom he kills in such numbers , that he does not reckon them by the scalps , but by the streams of blood which he causes to flow . He takes so many prisoners that he holds them in no account , but lets them go where they will , to show that he is not afraid of them . But now nobody dares make war on him . All the nations beyond the sea have submitted to him and begged humbly for peace . Men come from every quarter of the earth to listen to him and admire him . All that is done in the world is decided by him alone . " But what shall I say of his riches ? You think yourselves rich when you have ten or twelve sacks of corn , a few hatchets , beads , kettles , and other things of that sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are of men in all this country for five hundred leagues around . In each city there are store-houses where there are hatchets enough to cut down , all your forests , kettles enough to cook all your moose , and beads enough to fill all your lodges . His house is longer than from here to the top of the Saut ,  --  that is to say , more than half a league ,  --  and higher than your tallest trees ; and it holds more families than the largest of your towns . " Footnote : A close translation of Dablon 's report of the speech . See Relation , 1671 , 27 . The Father added more in a similar strain ; but the peroration of his harangue is not on record . Whatever impression this curious effort of Jesuit rhetoric may have produced upon the hearers , it did not prevent them from stripping the royal arms from the post to which they were nailed , as soon as St. Lusson and his men had left the Saut ; probably , not because they understood the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a charm . St. Lusson proceeded to Lake Superior ; where , however , he accomplished nothing , except , perhaps , a traffic with the Indians on his own account ; and he soon after returned to Quebec . Talon was resolved to find the Mississippi , the most interesting object of search , and seemingly the most attainable , in the wild and vague domain which he had just claimed for the king . The Indians had described it ; the Jesuits were eager to discover it ; and La Salle , if he had not reached it , had explored two several avenues by which it might be approached . Talon looked about him for a fit agent of the enterprise , and made choice of Louis Joliet , who had returned from Lake Superior . Footnote : Lettre de Frontenac au Ministre , 2 Nov. 1672 , MS . In the Brodhead Collection , by a copyist 's error , the name of the Chevalier de Grandfontaine is substituted for that of Talon . But the Intendant was not to see the fulfilment of his design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an end . A misunderstanding had arisen between him and the Governor , Courcelles . Both were able and public-spirited ; but the relations between the two chiefs of the colony were of a nature necessarily so critical , that a conflict of authority was scarcely to be avoided . The Governor presided at the council , and held the military command ; the Intendant directed affairs of justice , finance , and commerce . Each thought his functions encroached upon , and both asked for recall . Footnote : Courcelles returned home on the plea of ill health . Talon remained a little longer ; but soon asked leave to return to France , seeing that he should fare worse with the new governor than with the old . Another governor succeeded ; one who was to stamp his mark , broad , bold , and ineffaceable , on the most memorable page of French-American History . In the Church of Notre Dame , at Quebec , on a day in the early autumn of 1672 , the priests were singing Te Deum for the safe arrival of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or beneath it . Here you would have seen the new governor surrounded by officers , and by the chief inhabitants , anxious to pay their court ; a tall man in the pompous garb of a military noble of that gorgeous reign , well advanced in middle life , but whose high keen features , full of intellect and fire , bespoke his prompt undaunted nature ,  --  Louis de Buade , Count of Palluau and Frontenac . He belonged to the high nobility , had held important commands , and , if the song-writers of his time speak true , had anticipated the king in the favors of Madame de Montespan . Footnote : See Brunet , in notes to Correspondance de la Duchesse d'Orleans ; Paulin , in notes to the Historiettes de Tallement des Reaux ; and Margry , in Journal General de I'Instruction Publique . His wife , who could not endure him  --  and the aversion seems to have been mutual  --  was a noted beauty of the court , and held great influence in its brilliant and corrupt society . Footnote : St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame de Frontenac , who is also mentioned in the Lettres de Madame de Sevigne . Her portrait will be found at Versailles . Frontenac was full of faults ; but it is not through these that his memory has survived him . He was domineering , arbitrary , intolerant of opposition , irascible , vehement in prejudice , often wayward , perverse , and jealous : a persecutor of those who crossed him ; yet capable , by fits , of moderation , and a magnanimous lenity ; and gifted with a rare charm  --  not always exerted  --  to win the attachment of men : versed in books , polished in courts and salons ; without fear , incapable of repose , keen and broad of sight , clear in judgment , prompt in decision , fruitful in resources , unshaken when others despaired ; a sure breeder of storms in time of peace , but in time of calamity and danger a tower of strength . His early career in America was beset with ire and enmity ; but admiration and gratitude hailed him at its close : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it triumphant from an abyss of ruin . Footnote : In the Library of the Seminary of Quebec is preserved the funeral oration pronounced over the body of Frontenac by Olivier Goyer , a Recollet friar . It is a blind and wholesale panegyric , but it is interlined with notes and comments at great length , by some other ecclesiastic , a bitter enemy of the Governor . He is vindictive and acrimonious beyond measure ; but , between the two , a good deal of truth is struck out . Charlevoix 's estimate of Frontenac is admirably candid , when it is remembered that he writes of an enemy of his Order . The career of Frontenac , his letters , and those of his enemies ,  --  of which many are preserved ,  --  are , however , his best interpretation . CHAPTER V. 1672-1675 .

JOLIET SENT TO FIND THE MISSISSIPPI .  --  JACQUES MARQUETTE.  --  DEPARTURE .  - -  GREEN BAY .  --  THE WISCONSIN .  --  THE MISSISSIPPI .  --  INDIANS .  --  MANITOUS.  - -  THE ARKANSAS .  --  THE ILLINOIS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  HIS ILLNESS .  --  HIS DEATH . If Talon had remained in the colony , Frontenac would infallibly have quarrelled with him ; but he was too clear-sighted not to approve his plans for the discovery and occupation of the interior . Before sailing for France , Talon recommended Joliet as a suitable agent for the discovery of the Mississippi , and the Governor accepted his counsel . Footnote : Lettre de Frontenac au Ministre , 2 Nov. 1672 ; Ibid 14 Nov. 1674 . MSS Louis Joliet was the son of a wagon-maker in the service of the Company of the Hundred Associates , Footnote : See " Jesuits in North America . " then , owners of Canada . He was born at Quebec in 1645 , was educated by the Jesuits ; and , when still very young , he resolved to be a priest . He received the tonsure and the minor orders at the age of seventeen . Four years after , he is mentioned with especial honor for the part he bore in the disputes in philosophy , at which the dignitaries of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took part . Footnote : " Le 2 Juillet ( 1666 ) les premieres disputes de philosophie se font dans la congregation avec succes . Toutes les puissances s'y trouvent ; M. l'Intendant entr'autres y a argumente tres-bien . M. Jolliet et Pierre Francheville y ont tres-bien repondu de toute la logique. "  --  Journal des Jesuites , MS . Not long after , he renounced his clerical vocation , and turned fur-trader . Talon sent him , with one Pere , to explore the copper-mines of Lake Superior ; and it was on his return from this expedition that he met La Salle and the Sulpitians near the head of Lake Ontario . Footnote : Nothing was known of Joliet till Shea investigated his history . Ferland , in his Notes sur les Registres de Notre-Dame de Quebec ; Faillon , in his Colonie Francaise en Canada ; and Margry , in a series of papers in the Journal General de I'Instruction Publique ,  --  have thrown much new light on his life . From journals of a voyage made by him at a later period to the coast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seems to have been a man of close and intelligent observation . His mathematical acquirements appear to have been very considerable . In what we know of Joliet , there is nothing that reveals any salient or distinctive trait of character , any especial breadth of view or boldness of design . He appears to have been simply a merchant , intelligent , well educated , courageous , hardy , and enterprising . Though he had renounced the priesthood , he retained his partiality for the Jesuits ; and it is more than probable that their influence had aided not a little to determine Talon 's choice . One of their number , Jacques Marquette , was chosen to accompany him . He passed up the lakes to Michillimackinac ; and found his destined companion at Point St. Ignace , on the north side of the strait ; where , in his palisaded mission-house and chapel , he had labored for two years past to instruct the Huron refugees from St. Esprit , and a band of Ottawas who had joined them . Marquette was born in 1637 , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north of France , and was now thirty-five years of age . When about seventeen , he had joined the Jesuits , evidently from motives purely religious ; and in 1666 he was sent to the missions of Canada . At first he was destined to the station of Tadoussac ; and , to prepare himself for it , he studied the Montagnais language under Gabriel Druilletes . But his destination was changed , and he was sent to the Upper Lakes in 1668 , where he had since remained . His talents as a linguist must have been great ; for , within a few years , he learned to speak with ease six Indian languages . The traits of his character are unmistakable . He was of the brotherhood of the early Canadian missionaries , and the true counterpart of Garnier or Jogues . He was a devout votary of the Virgin Mary ; who , imaged to his mind in shapes of the most transcendent loveliness with which the pencil of human genius has ever informed the canvas , was to him the object of an adoration not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sensitive heart , divorced from earth , sought solace in the skies . A subtile element of romance was blended with the fervor of his worship , and hung like an illumined cloud over the harsh and hard realities of his daily lot . Kindled by the smile of his celestial mistress , his gentle and noble nature knew no fear . For her he burned to dare and to suffer , discover new lands and conquer new realms to her sway . He begins the journal of his voyage thus : " The day of the Immaculate Conception of the Holy Virgin ; whom I had continually invoked , since I came to this country of the Ottawas , to obtain from God the favor of being enabled to visit the nations on the river Mississippi  --  this very day was precisely that on which M. Joliet arrived with orders from Count Frontenac , our Governor , and from M. Talon , our Intendant , to go with me on this discovery . I was all the more delighted at this good news , because I saw my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the happy necessity of exposing my life for the salvation of all these tribes ; and especially of the Illinois , who , when I was at Point St. Esprit , had begged me very earnestly to bring the word of God among them . " The outfit of the travellers was very simple . They provided themselves with two birch canoes , and a supply of smoked meat and Indian corn ; embarked with five men ; and began their voyage on the seventeenth of May . They had obtained all possible information from the Indians , and had made , by means of it , a species of map of their intended route . " Above all , " writes Marquette , " I placed our voyage under the protection of the Holy Virgin Immaculate , promising that if she granted us the favor of discovering the great river , I would give it the name of the Conception . " Footnote : The doctrine of the Immaculate Conception , sanctioned in our own time by the Pope , was always a favorite tenet of the Jesuits ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ westward ; and , plying their paddles , they passed the Straits of Michillimackinac , and coasted the northern shores of Lake Michigan ; landing at evening to build their camp-fire at the edge of the forest , and draw up their canoes on the strand . They soon reached the river Menomonie , and ascended it to the village of the Menomonies , or Wild-rice Indians . Footnote : The Malhoumines , Malouminek , Oumalouminek , or Nation des Folles-Avoines , of early French writers . The folle-avoine , wild oats or " wild rice , "  - -  Zizania aquatica ,  --  was their ordinary food , as also of other tribes of this region . When they told them the object of their voyage , they were filled with astonishment , and used their best ingenuity to dissuade them . The banks of the Mississippi , they said , were inhabited by ferocious tribes , who put every stranger to death , tomahawking all new-comers without cause or provocation . They added that there was a demon in a certain part of the river , whose roar could be heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the abyss where he dwelt ; that its waters were full of frightful monsters , who would devour them and their canoe ; and , finally , that the heat was so great that they would perish inevitably . Marquette set their counsel at naught , gave them a few words of instruction in the mysteries of the Faith , taught them a prayer , and bade them farewell . The travellers soon reached the mission at the head of Green Bay ; entered the Fox River ; with difficulty and labor dragged their canoes up the long and tumultuous rapids ; crossed Lake Winnebago ; and followed the quiet windings of the river beyond , where they glided through an endless growth of wild rice , and scared the innumerable birds that fed upon it . On either hand rolled the prairie , dotted with groves and trees , browsing elk and deer . Footnote : Dablon , on his journey with Allouez in 1670 , was delighted with the aspect of the country and the abundance of game along this river . Carver , a century later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose up in clouds from the wild-rice marshes . On the seventh of June , they reached the Mascoutins and Miamis , who , since the visit of Dablon and Allouez , had been joined by the Kickapoos . Marquette , who had an eye for natural beauty , was delighted with the situation of the town , which he describes as standing on the crown of a hill ; while , all around , the prairie stretched beyond the sight , interspersed with groves and belts of tall forest . But he was still more delighted when he saw a cross planted in the midst of the place . The Indians had decorated it with a number of dressed deer-skins , red girdles , and bows and arrows , which they had hung upon it as an offering to the Great Manitou of the French ,  --  a sight by which , as Marquette says , he was " extremely consoled . " The travellers had no sooner reached the town than they called the chiefs and elders to a council . Joliet told them that the Governor of Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God had sent his companion to teach the true faith to the inhabitants ; and he prayed for guides to show them the way to the waters of the Wisconsin . The council readily consented ; and on the tenth of June the Frenchmen embarked again , with two Indians to conduct them . All the town came down to the shore to see their departure . Here were the Miamis , with long locks of hair dangling over each ear , after a fashion which Marquette thought very becoming ; and here , too , the Mascoutins and the Kickapoos , whom he describes as mere boors in comparison with their Miami townsmen . All stared alike at the seven adventurers , marvelling that men could be found to risk an enterprise so hazardous . The river twisted among lakes and marshes choked with wild rice ; and , but for their guides , they could scarcely have followed the perplexed and narrow channel . It brought them at last to the portage ; where , after carrying their canoes a mile and a half over the prairie and through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bade farewell to the waters that flowed to the St. Lawrence , and committed themselves to the current that was to bear them they knew not whither ,  --  perhaps to the Gulf of Mexico , perhaps to the South Sea or the Gulf of California . They glided calmly down the tranquil stream , by islands choked with trees and matted with entangling grape-vines ; by forests , groves , and prairies ,  --  the parks and pleasure-grounds of a prodigal nature ; by thickets and marshes and broad bare sand-bars ; under the shadowing trees , between whose tops looked down from afar the bold brow of some woody bluff . At night , the bivouac ,  - -  the canoes inverted on the bank , the flickering fire , the meal of bison-flesh or venison , the evening pipes , and slumber beneath the stars : and when in the morning they embarked again , the mist hung on the river like a bridal veil ; then melted before the sun , till the glassy water and the languid woods basked breathless in the sultry glare . Footnote : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from personal observation of the river during midsummer . On the 17th of June , they saw on their right the broad meadows , bounded in the distance by rugged hills , where now stand the town and fort of Prairie du Chien . Before them , a wide and rapid current coursed athwart their way , by the foot of lofty heights wrapped thick in forests . They had found what they sought , and " with a joy , " writes Marquette , " which I can not express , " they steered forth their canoes on the eddies of the Mississippi . Turning southward , they paddled down the stream , through a solitude unrelieved by the faintest trace of man . A large fish , apparently one of the huge cat-fish of the Mississippi , blundered against Marquette 's canoe with a force which seems to have startled him ; and once , as they drew in their net , they caught a " spade-fish , " whose eccentric appearance greatly astonished them . At length , the buffalo began to appear , grazing in herds on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marquette describes the fierce and stupid look of the old bulls , as they stared at the intruders through the tangled mane which nearly blinded them . They advanced with extreme caution , landed at night , and made a fire to cook their evening meal ; then extinguished it , embarked again , paddled some way farther , and anchored in the stream , keeping a man on the watch till morning . They had journeyed more than a fortnight without meeting a human being ; when , on the 25th , they discovered footprints of men in the mud of the western bank , and a well-trodden path that led to the adjacent prairie . Joliet and Marquette resolved to follow it ; and , leaving the canoes in charge of their men , they set out on their hazardous adventure . The day was fair , and they walked two leagues in silence , following the path through the forest and across the sunny prairie , till they discovered an Indian village on the banks of a river , and two others on a hill half a league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names of Peouaria ( Peoria ) and Moingouena , are represented in Marquette 's map upon a river corresponding in position with the Des Moines ; though the distance from the Wisconsin , as given by him , would indicate a river farther north . Now , with beating hearts , they invoked the aid of Heaven , and , again advancing , came so near without being seen , that they could hear the voices of the Indians among the wigwams . Then they stood forth in full view , and shouted , to attract attention . There was great commotion in the village . The inmates swarmed out of their huts , and four of their chief men presently came forward to meet the strangers , advancing very deliberately , and holding up toward the sun two calumets , or peace-pipes , decorated with feathers . They stopped abruptly before the two Frenchmen , and stood gazing at them with attention , without speaking a word . Marquette was much relieved on seeing that they wore French cloth , whence he judged that they must be friends and allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were ; whereupon they answered that they were Illinois , and offered the pipe ; which having been duly smoked , they all went together to the village . Here the chief received the travellers after a singular fashion , meant to do them honor . He stood stark naked at the door of a large wigwam , holding up both hands as if to shield his eyes . " Frenchmen , how bright the sun shines when you come to visit us ! All our village awaits you ; and you shall enter our wigwams in peace . " So saying , he led them into his own ; which was crowded to suffocation with savages , staring at their guests in silence . Having smoked with the chiefs and old men , they were invited to visit the great chief of all the Illinois , at one of the villages they had seen in the distance ; and thither they proceeded , followed by a throng of warriors , squaws , and children . On arriving , they were forced to smoke again , and listen to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , standing between two old men , naked like himself . His lodge was crowded with the dignitaries of the tribe ; whom Marquette addressed in Algonquin , announcing himself as a messenger sent by the God who had made them , and whom it behooved them to recognize and obey . He added a few words touching the power and glory of Count Frontenac , and concluded by asking information concerning the Mississippi , and the tribes along its banks , whom he was on his way to visit . The chief replied with a speech of compliment ,  --  assuring his guests that their presence added flavor to his tobacco , made the river more calm , the sky more serene , and the earth more beautiful . In conclusion , he gave them a young slave and a calumet , begging them at the same time to abandon their purpose of descending the Mississippi . A feast of four courses now followed . First , a wooden bowl full of a porridge of Indian meal boiled with grease was set before the guests , and the master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a large spoon . Then , appeared a platter of fish ; and the same functionary , carefully removing the bones with his fingers , and blowing on the morsels to cool them , placed them in the mouths of the two Frenchmen . A large dog , killed and cooked for the occasion , was next placed before them ; but , failing to tempt their fastidious appetites , was supplanted by a dish of fat buffalo-meat , which concluded the entertainment . The crowd having dispersed , buffalo-robes were spread on the ground , and Marquette and Joliet spent the night on the scene of the late festivity . In the morning , the chief , with some six hundred of his tribesmen , escorted them to their canoes , and bade them , after their stolid fashion , a friendly farewell . Again they were on their way , slowly drifting down the great river . They passed the mouth of the Illinois , and glided beneath that line of rocks on the eastern side , cut into fantastic forms by the elements , and marked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French maps . Presently they beheld a sight which reminded them that the Devil was still lord paramount of this wilderness . On the flat face of a high rock , were painted in red , black , and green a pair of monsters ,  --  each " as large as a calf , with horns like a deer , red eyes , a beard like a tiger , and a frightful expression of countenance . The face is something like that of a man , the body covered with scales ; and the tail so long that it passes entirely round the body , over the head and between the legs , ending like that of a fish . " Such is the account which the worthy Jesuit gives of these manitous , or Indian gods . Footnote : The rock where these figures were painted is immediately above the city of Alton . The tradition of their existence remains , though they are entirely effaced by time . In 1867 , when I passed the place , a part of the rock had been quarried away , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertisement of " Plantation Bitters . " Some years ago , certain persons , with more zeal than knowledge , proposed to restore the figures , after conceptions of their own ; but the idea was abandoned . Marquette made a drawing of the two monsters , but it is lost . I have , however , a fac-simile of a map made a few years later by order of the Intendant Duchesneau ; which is decorated with the portrait of one of them , answering to Marquette 's description , and probably copied from his drawing . St. Cosme , who saw them in 1699 , says that they were even then almost effaced . Douay and Joutel also speak of them ; the former , bitterly hostile to his Jesuit contemporaries , charging Marquette with exaggeration in his account of them . Joutel could see nothing terrifying in their appearance ; but he says that his Indians made sacrifices to them as they passed . He confesses that at first they frightened him ; and his imagination and that of his credulous companions were so wrought upon by these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time to talk of them as they plied their paddles . They were thus engaged , when they were suddenly aroused by a real danger . A torrent of yellow mud rushed furiously athwart the calm blue current of the Mississippi ; boiling and surging , and sweeping in its course logs , branches , and uprooted trees . They had reached the mouth of the Missouri , where that savage river , descending from its mad career through a vast unknown of barbarism , poured its turbid floods into the bosom of its gentler sister . Their light canoes whirled on the miry vortex like dry leaves on an angry brook . " I never , " writes Marquette , " saw any thing more terrific ; " but they escaped with their fright , and held their way down the turbulent and swollen current of the now united rivers . Footnote : The Missouri is called Pekitanoui by Marquette . It also bears , on early French maps , the names of Riviere des Osages , and Riviere des Emissourites , or Oumessourits . On Marquette 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its banks , just above the Osages . Judging by the course of the Mississippi that it discharged into the Gulf of Mexico , he conceived the hope of one day reaching the South Sea by way of the Missouri . They passed the lonely forest that covered the site of the destined city of St. Louis , and , a few days later , saw on their left the mouth of the stream to which the Iroquois had given the well-merited name of Ohio , or , the Beautiful River . Footnote : Called on Marquette 's map , Ouabouskiaou . On some of the earliest maps , it is called Ouabache ( Wabash ) . Soon they began to see the marshy shores buried in a dense growth of the cane , with its tall straight stems and feathery light-green foliage . The sun glowed through the hazy air with a languid stifling heat , and , by day and night , mosquitoes in myriads left them no peace . They floated slowly down the current , crouched in the shade of the sails which they had spread as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank . The surprise was mutual , and each party was as much frightened as the other . Marquette hastened to display the calumet which the Illinois had given him by way of passport ; and the Indians , recognizing the pacific symbol , replied with an invitation to land . Evidently , they were in communication with Europeans , for they were armed with guns , knives , and hatchets , wore garments of cloth , and carried their gunpowder in small bottles of thick glass . They feasted the Frenchmen with buffalo-meat , bear 's oil , and white plums ; and gave them a variety of doubtful information , including the agreeable but delusive assurance that they would reach the mouth of the river in ten days . It was , in fact , more than a thousand miles distant . They resumed their course , and again floated down the interminable monotony of river , marsh and forest . Day after day passed on in solitude , and they had paddled some three hundred miles since their meeting with the Indians ; when , as they neared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wigwams on the west bank . Their inmates were all astir , yelling the war-whoop , snatching their weapons , and running to the shore to meet the strangers , who , on their part , called for succor to the Virgin . In truth they had need of her aid ; for several large wooden canoes , filled with savages , were putting out from the shore , above and below them , to cut off their retreat , while a swarm of headlong young warriors waded into the water to attack them . The current proved too strong ; and , failing to reach the canoes of the Frenchmen , one of them threw his war-club , which flew over the heads of the startled travellers . Meanwhile , Marquette had not ceased to hold up his calumet , to which the excited crowd gave no heed , but strung their bows and notched their arrows for immediate action ; when at length the elders of the village arrived , saw the peace-pipe , restrained the ardor of the youth , and urged the Frenchmen to come ashore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a better reception than they had reason to expect . One of the Indians spoke a little Illinois , and served as interpreter ; a friendly conference was followed by a feast of sagamite and fish ; and the travellers , not without sore misgivings , spent the night in the lodges of their entertainers . Footnote : This village , called Mitchigamea , is represented on several contemporary maps . Early in the morning , they embarked again , and proceeded to a village of the Arkansas tribe , about eight leagues below . Notice of their coming was sent before them by their late hosts ; and , as they drew near , they were met by a canoe , in the prow of which stood a naked personage , holding a calumet , singing , and making gestures of friendship . On reaching the village , which was on the east side , Footnote : A few years later , the Arkansas were all on the west side. opposite the mouth of the river Arkansas , they were conducted to a sort of scaffold before the lodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their reception , the ground being neatly covered with rush mats . On these they were seated ; the warriors sat around them in a semi-circle ; then the elders of the tribe ; and then the promiscuous crowd of villagers , standing , and staring over the heads of the more dignified members of the assembly . All the men were naked ; but , to compensate for the lack of clothing , they wore strings of beads in their noses and ears . The women were clothed in shabby skins , and wore their hair clumped in a mass behind each ear . By good luck , there was a young Indian in the village , who had an excellent knowledge of Illinois ; and through him Marquette endeavored to explain the mysteries of Christianity , and to gain information concerning the river below . To this end he gave his auditors the presents indispensable on such occasions , but received very little in return . They told him that the Mississippi was infested by hostile Indians , armed with guns procured from white men ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that they dared not hunt the buffalo , but were forced to live on Indian corn , of which they raised three crops a year . During the speeches on either side , food was brought in without ceasing ; sometimes a platter of sagamite or mush ; sometimes of corn boiled whole ; sometimes a roasted dog . The villagers had large earthen pots and platters , made by themselves with tolerable skill ,  --  as well as hatchets , knives , and beads , gained by traffic with the Illinois and other tribes in contact with the French or Spaniards . All day there was feasting without respite , after the merciless practice of Indian hospitality ; but at night some of their entertainers proposed to kill and plunder them ,  --  a scheme which was defeated by the vigilance of the chief , who visited their quarters , and danced the calumet dance to reassure his guests . The travellers now held counsel as to what course they should take . They had gone far enough , as they thought , to establish one important point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic or sea of Virginia , nor into the Gulf of California or Vermilion Sea , but into the Gulf of Mexico . They thought themselves nearer to its mouth than they actually were ,  --  the distance being still about seven hundred miles ; and they feared that , if they went farther , they might be killed by Indians or captured by Spaniards , whereby the results of their discovery would be lost . Therefore they resolved to return to Canada , and report what they had seen . They left the Arkansas village , and began their homeward voyage on the seventeenth of July . It was no easy task to urge their way upward , in the heat of midsummer , against the current of the dark and gloomy stream , toiling all day under the parching sun , and sleeping at night in the exhalations of the unwholesome shore , or in the narrow confines of their birchen vessels , anchored on the river . Marquette was attacked with dysentery . Languid and well-nigh spent , he invoked his celestial mistress . as day after day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way northward . At length they reached the Illinois , and , entering its mouth , followed its course , charmed , as they went , with its placid waters , its shady forests , and its rich plains , grazed by the bison and the deer . They stopped at a spot soon to be made famous in the annals of western discovery . This was a village of the Illinois , then called Kaskaskia ,  --  a name afterwards transferred to another locality . Footnote : Marquette says that it consisted at this time of seventy-four lodges . These , like the Huron and Iroquois lodges , contained each several fires and several families . This village was about seven miles below the site of the present town of Ottawa . A chief , with a band of young warriors , offered to guide them to the Lake of the Illinois ; that is to say , Lake Michigan . Thither they repaired ; and , coasting its shores , reached Green Bay at the end of September , after an absence of about four months , during which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hundred miles . Footnote : The journal of Marquette , first published in an imperfect form by Thevenot , in 1681 , has been reprinted by Mr. Lenox , under the direction of Mr. Shea , from the manuscript preserved in the archives of the Canadian Jesuits . It will also be found in Shea 's Discovery and Exploration of the Mississippi Valley , and the Relations Inedites , of Martin . The true map of Marquette accompanies all these publications . The map published by Thevenot and reproduced by Bancroft is not Marquette 's . The original of this , of which I have a fac-simile , bears the title Carte de la Nouvelle Decouverte que les Peres Jesuites out fait en l'annee 1672 , et continuee par le Pere Jacques Marquette , etc . The return route of the expedition is incorrectly laid down on it . A manuscript map of the Jesuit Raffeix , preserved in the Bibliotheque Imperiale , is more accurate in this particular . I have also another contemporary manuscript map , indicating the various Jesuit stations in the west at this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For these and other maps , see Appendix . Marquette remained , to recruit his exhausted strength ; but Joliet descended to Quebec , to bear the report of his discovery to Count Frontenac . Fortune had wonderfully favored him on his long and perilous journey ; but now she abandoned him on the very threshold of home . At the foot of the rapids of La Chine , and immediately above Montreal , his canoe was overset , two of his men and an Indian boy were drowned , all his papers were lost , and he himself narrowly escaped . Footnote : Lettre de Frontenac au Ministre , Quebec , 14 Nov. 1674 , MS . In a letter to Frontenac , he speaks of the accident as follows : " I had escaped every peril from the Indians ; I had passed forty-two rapids ; and was on the point of disembarking , full of joy at the success of so long and difficult an enterprise ,  --  when my canoe capsized , after all the danger seemed over . I lost two men , and my box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which I had left almost two years before . Nothing remains to me but my life , and the ardent desire to employ it on any service which you may please to direct . " Footnote : This letter is appended to Joliet 's smaller map of his discoveries . See Appendix . Joliet applied for a grant of the countries he had visited , but failed to obtain it , because the king wished at this time to confine the inhabitants of Canada to productive industry within the limits of the colony , and to restrain their tendency to roam into the western wilderness . On the seventh of October , 1675 , Joliet married Claire Bissot , daughter of a wealthy Canadian merchant , engaged in trade with the northern Indians . This drew Joliet 's attention to Hudson 's Bay , and he made a journey thither in 1679 , by way of the Saguenay . He found three English forts on the bay , occupied by about sixty men , who had also an armed vessel of twelve guns and several small trading-craft . The English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he declined , and returned to Quebec , where he reported that , unless these formidable rivals were dispossessed , the trade of Canada would be ruined . In consequence of this report , some of the principal merchants of the colony formed a company to compete with the English in the trade of Hudson 's Bay . In the year of this journey , Joliet received a grant of the islands of Mignan ; and in the following year , 1680 , he received another grant , of the great island of Anticosti in the lower St. Lawrence . In 1681 , he was established here with his wife and six servants . He was engaged in fisheries ; and , being a skilful navigator and surveyor , he made about this time a chart of the St. Lawrence . In 1690 , Sir William Phips , on his way with an English fleet to attack Quebec , made a descent on Joliet 's establishment , burnt his buildings , and took prisoners his wife and his mother-in-law . In 1694 , Joliet explored the coasts of Labrador under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seal fishery . On his return , Frontenac made him royal pilot for the St. Lawrence ; and at about the same time he received the appointment of hydrographer at Quebec . He died , apparently poor , in 1699 or 1700 , and was buried on one of the islands of Mignan . The discovery of the above facts is due in great part to the researches of Margry . Marquette spent the winter and the following summer at the mission of Green Bay , still suffering from his malady . In the autumn , however , it abated , and he was permitted by his superior to attempt the execution of a plan to which he was devotedly attached ,  --  the founding , at the principal town of the Illinois , of a mission to be called the Immaculate Conception , a name which he had already given to the river Mississippi ; He set out on this errand on the twenty-fifth of October , accompanied by two men , named Pierre and Jacques , one of whom had been with him on his great journey of discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also joined him . The united parties  --  ten canoes in all  --  followed the east shore of Green Bay as far as the inlet then called Sturgeon Cove , from the head of which they crossed by a difficult portage through the forest to the shore of Lake Michigan . November had come . The bright hues of the autumn foliage were changed to rusty brown . The shore was desolate , and the lake was stormy . They were more than a month in coasting its western border , when at length they reached the river Chicago , entered it , and ascended about two leagues . Marquette 's disease had lately returned , and hemorrhage now ensued . He told his two companions that this journey would be his last . In the condition in which he was , it was impossible to go farther . The two men built a log-hut by the river , and here they prepared to spend the winter , while Marquette , feeble as he was , began the spiritual exercises of Saint Ignatius , and confessed his two companions twice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with snow , but game was abundant . Pierre and Jacques killed buffalo and deer and shot wild turkeys close to their hut . There was an encampment of Illinois within two days ' journey ; and other Indians , passing by this well known thoroughfare , occasionally visited them , treating the exiles kindly , and sometimes bringing them game and Indian corn . Eighteen leagues distant was the camp of two adventurous French traders ,  --  one of them a noted coureur de bois , nicknamed La Taupine , Footnote : Pierre Moreau , alias La Taupine , was afterwards bitterly complained of by the Intendant Duchesneau for acting as the Governor 's agent in illicit trade with the Indians. and the other a self-styled surgeon . They also visited Marquette , and befriended him to the best of their power . Urged by a burning desire to lay , before he died , the foundation of his new mission of the Immaculate Conception , Marquette begged his two followers to join him in a novena , or nine days ' devotion to the Virgin . In consequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began to regain strength , and , in March , was able to resume the journey . On the thirtieth of the month , they left their hut , which had been inundated by a sudden rise of the river , and carried their canoe through mud and water over the portage which led to the head of the Des Plaines . Marquette knew the way , for he had passed by this route on his return from the Mississippi . Amid the rains of opening spring , they floated down the swollen current of the Des Plaines , by naked woods , and spongy , saturated prairies , till they reached its junction with the main stream of the Illinois , which they descended to their destination ,  --  the Indian town which Marquette calls Kaskaskia . Here , as we are told , he was received " like an angel from Heaven . " He passed from wigwam to wigwam , telling the listening crowds of God and the Virgin , Paradise and Hell , angels and demons ; and , when he thought their minds prepared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place near the town , on the great meadow which lies between the river and the modern village of Utica . Here five hundred chiefs and old men were seated in a ring ; behind stood fifteen hundred youths and warriors , and behind these again all the women and children of the village . Marquette , standing in the midst , displayed four large pictures of the Virgin ; harangued the assembly on the mysteries of the Faith , and exhorted them to adopt it . The temper of his auditory met his utmost wishes . They begged him to stay among them and continue his instructions ; but his life was fast ebbing away , and it behooved him to depart . A few days after Easter he left the village , escorted by a crowd of Indians , who followed him as far as Lake Michigan . Here he embarked with his two companions . Their destination was Michillimackinac , and their course lay along the eastern borders of the lake . As , in the freshness of advancing spring , Pierre and Jacques urged their canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dimmed sight and prostrated strength , communing with the Virgin , and the angels . On the nineteenth of May he felt that his hour was near ; and , as they passed the mouth of a small river , he requested his companions to land . They complied , built a shed of bark on a rising ground near the bank , and carried thither the dying Jesuit . With perfect cheerfulness and composure he gave directions for his burial , asked their forgiveness for the trouble he had caused them , administered to them the sacrament of penitence , and thanked God that he was permitted to die in the wilderness , a missionary of the faith and a member of the Jesuit brotherhood . At night , seeing that they were fatigued , he told them to take rest ,  --  saying that he would call them when he felt his time approaching . Two or three hours after , they heard a feeble voice , and , hastening to his side , found him at the point of death . He expired calmly , murmuring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the crucifix which one of his followers held before him . They dug a grave beside the hut , and here they buried him according to the directions which he had given them ; then re-embarking , they made their way to Michillimackinac , to bear the tidings to the priests at the mission of St. Ignace . Footnote : The contemporary Relation tells us that a miracle took place at the burial of Marquette . One of the two Frenchmen , overcome with grief and colic , bethought him of applying a little earth from the grave to the seat of pain . This at once restored him to health and cheerfulness . In the winter of 1676 , a party of Kiskakon Ottawas were hunting on Lake Michigan ; and when , in the following spring , they prepared to return home , they bethought them , in accordance with an Indian custom , of taking with them the bones of Marquette , who had been their instructor at the mission of St. Esprit . They repaired to the spot , found the grave , opened it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a box of birch-bark . Then , in a procession of thirty canoes , they bore it , singing their funeral songs , to St. Ignace of Michillimackinac . As they approached , priests , Indians , and traders all thronged to the shore . The relics of Marquette were received with solemn ceremony , and buried beneath the floor of the little chapel of the mission . Footnote : For Marquette 's death , see the contemporary Relation , published by Shea , Lenox , and Martin , with the accompanying Lettre et Journal . The river where he died is a small stream in the west of Michigan , some distance south of the promontory called the " Sleeping Bear . " It long bore his name , which is now borne by a larger neighboring stream . Charlevoix 's account of Marquette 's death is derived from tradition , and is not supported by the contemporary narrative . The voyageurs on Lake Michigan long continued to invoke the intercession of the departed missionary in time of danger . In 1847 , the missionary of the Algonquins at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tradition of the death of Marquette , from the lips of an old Indian woman , born in 1777 , at Michillimackinac . Her ancestress had been baptized by the subject of the story . The tradition has a resemblance to that related as fact by Charlevoix . The old squaw said that the Jesuit was returning , very ill , to Michillimackinac , when a storm forced him and his two men to land near a little river . Here he told them that he should die , and directed them to ring a bell over his grave and plant a cross . They all remained four days at the spot ; and , though without food , the men felt no hunger . On the night of the fourth day he died , and the men buried him as he had directed . On waking in the morning , they saw a sack of Indian corn , a quantity of lard , and some biscuits , miraculously sent to them in accordance with the promise of Marquette , who had told them that they should have food enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the stream began to rise , and in a few moments encircled the grave of the Jesuit , which formed , thenceforth , an islet in the waters . The tradition adds , that an Indian battle afterwards took place on the banks of this stream , between Christians and infidels ; and that the former gained the victory in consequence of invoking the name of Marquette . This story bears the attestation of the priest of the Two Mountains , that it is a literal translation of the tradition , as recounted by the old woman . It has been asserted that the Illinois country was visited by two priests , some time before the visit of Marquette . This assertion was first made by M. Noiseux , late Grand Vicar of Quebec , who gives no authority for it . Not the slightest indication of any such visit appears in any contemporary document or map thus far discovered . The contemporary writers , down to the time of Marquette and La Salle , all speak of the Illinois as an unknown country . The entire groundlessness of Noiseux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Weekly Herald , " of New York , April 21 , 1855 . CHAPTER VI . 1673-1678 . LA SALLE AND FRONTENAC . OBJECTS OF LA SALLE.  --  HIS DIFFICULTIES .  --  OFFICIAL CORRUPTION IN CANADA .  --  THE GOVERNOR OF MONTREAL .  --  PROJECTS OF FRONTENAC.  --  CATARAQUI.  --  FRONTENAC ON LAKE ONTARIO .  --  FORT FRONTENAC.  --  SUCCESS OF LA SALLE . We turn from the humble Marquette , thanking God with his last breath that he died for his Order and his faith ; and by our side stands the masculine form of Cavelier de la Salle . Prodigious was the contrast between the two discoverers : the one , with clasped hands and upturned eyes , seems a figure evoked from some dim legend of mediaeval saintship ; the other , with feet firm planted on the hard earth , breathes the self-relying energies of modern practical enterprise . Nevertheless , La Salle was a man wedded to ideas , and urged by the steady and considerate enthusiasm , which is the life-spring of heroic natures . Three thoughts , rapidly developing in his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First , he would achieve that which Champlain had vainly attempted , and of which our own generation has but now seen the accomplishment ,  --  the opening of a passage to India and China across the American continent . Next , he would occupy the Great West , develop its commercial resources , and anticipate the Spaniards and the English in the possession of it . Thirdly ,  --  for he soon became convinced that the Mississippi discharged itself into the Gulf of Mexico ,  --  he would establish a fortified post at its mouth , thus securing an outlet for the trade of the interior , checking the progress of the Spaniards , and forming a base , whence , in time of war , their northern provinces could be invaded and conquered . Here were vast projects , projects perhaps beyond the scope of private enterprise , conceived and nursed in the brain of a penniless young man . Two conditions were indispensable to their achievement . The first was the countenance of the Canadian authorities , and the second was money . There was but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gain of those who could aid the enterprise . Count Frontenac had no money to give ; but he had what was no less to the purpose , the resources of an arbitrary power , which he was always ready to use to the utmost . From the manner in which he mentions La Salle in his despatches , it seems that the latter succeeded in gaining his confidence very soon after he entered upon his government . There was a certain similarity between the two men . Both were able , resolute , and enterprising . The irascible and fiery pride of the noble found its match in the reserved and seemingly cold pride of the ambitious young burgher . Their temperaments were different , but the bases of their characters were alike , and each could perfectly comprehend the other . They had , moreover , strong prejudices and dislikes in common . With his ruined fortune , his habits of expenditure , the exigent demands of his rank and station , and the wretched pittance which he received from the king of three thousand francs a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable opportunity of bettering his condition . Footnote : That he engaged in the fur-trade , was notorious . In a letter to the Minister Seignelay , 13 Oct. 1681 , Duchesneau , Intendant of Canada , declares that Frontenac used all the authority of his office to favor those interested in trade with him , and that he would favor nobody else . The Intendant himself had a rival interest in the same trade . La Salle seems to have laid his plans before him as far as he had at this time formed them , and a complete understanding was established between them . Here was a great point gained . The head of the colony was on his side . It remained to raise money , and this was a harder task . La Salle 's relations were rich , evidently proud of him , and anxious for his advancement . As his schemes developed , they supplied him with means to pursue them , and one of them in particular , his cousin Francois Plet , became largely interested in his enterprises . Footnote : Papiers de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried into effect , would prove a source of immense wealth to all concerned in them , and gifted with a rare power of persuasion when he chose to use it , La Salle addressed himself to various merchants and officials of the colony , and induced some of them to become partners in his adventure . But here we are anticipating . Clearly to understand his position , we must revert to the first year of Frontenac 's government . No sooner had that astute official set foot in the colony than , with an eagle eye , he surveyed the situation , and quickly comprehended it . It was somewhat peculiar . Canada lived on the fur-trade , a species of commerce always liable to disorders , and which had produced , among other results , a lawless body of men known as coureurs de bois , who followed the Indians in their wanderings , and sometimes became as barbarous as their red associates . The order-loving king who swayed the destinies of France , taking umbrage at these irregularities , had issued mandates intended to repress the evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits of the settled country ; and requiring the trade to be carried on , not in the distant wilderness , but within the bounds of the colony . The civil and military officers of the crown , charged with the execution of these ordinances , showed a sufficient zeal in enforcing them against others , while they themselves habitually violated them ; hence , a singular confusion , with abundant outcries , complaint , and recrimination . Prominent among these officials was Perrot , Governor of Montreal , who must not be confounded with Nicolas Perrot , the voyageur . The Governor of Montreal , though subordinate to the Governor-General , held great and arbitrary power within his own jurisdiction . Perrot had married a niece of Talon , the late Intendant , to whose influence he owed his place . Confiding in this powerful protection , he gave free rein to his headstrong-temper , and carried his government with a high hand , berating and abusing anybody who ventured to remonstrate . The grave fathers of St. Sulpice , owners of Montreal , were the more scandalized at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain burlesque and gasconading vein which often appeared in him , and which they regarded as unseemly levity . Footnote : Perrot received his appointment from the Seminary of St. Sulpice , on Talon 's recommendation , but he afterwards applied for and gained a royal commission , which , as he thought , made him independent of the priests . Perrot , through his wife 's uncle , had obtained a grant of the Island above Montreal , which still bears his name . Here he established a trading house which he placed in charge of an agent , one Brucy , who , by a tempting display of merchandise and liquors , intercepted the Indians on their yearly descent to trade with the French , and thus got possession of their furs , in anticipation of the market of Montreal . Not satisfied with this , Perrot , in defiance of the royal order , sent men into the woods to trade with the Indians in their villages , and it is said even used his soldiers for this purpose , under cover of pretended desertion . Footnote : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still preserved in the ancient records of Montreal . The rage of the merchants of Montreal may readily be conceived , and when Frontenac heard of the behavior of his subordinate he was duly incensed . It seems , however , to have occurred , or to have been suggested to him , that he , the Governor-General might repeat the device of Perrot on a larger scale and with more profitable results . By establishing a fortified trading post on Lake Ontario , the whole trade of the upper country might be engrossed , with the exception of that portion of it which descended by the river Ottawa , and even this might in good part be diverted from its former channel . At the same time , a plan of a fort on Lake Ontario might be made to appear as of great importance to the welfare of the colony ; and in fact , from one point of view , it actually was so . Courcelles , the late governor , had already pointed out its advantages . Such a fort would watch and hold in check the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the aid of a few small vessels , it would intercept the trade which the upper Indians were carrying on through the Iroquois country with the English and Dutch of New York . Frontenac learned from La Salle that the English were intriguing both with the Iroquois and with the tribes of the Upper Lakes , to induce them to break the peace with the French , and bring their furs to New York . Footnote : Lettre de Frontenac a Colbert , 13 Nov. 1678 . Hence the advantages , not to say the necessity , of a fort on Lake Ontario were obvious . But , while it would turn a stream of wealth from the English to the French colony , it was equally clear that the change might be made to inure , not to the profit of Canada at large , but solely to that of those who had control of the fort ; or , in other words , that the new establishment might become an instrument of a grievous monopoly . This Frontenac and La Salle well understood , and there can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopoly : but the merchants of Canada understood it , also ; and hence they regarded with distrust any scheme of a fort on Lake Ontario . Frontenac , therefore , thought it expedient " to make use , " as he expresses it , " of address . " He gave out merely that he intended to make a tour through the upper parts of the colony with an armed force , in order to inspire the Indians with respect , and secure a solid peace . He had neither troops , money , munitions , nor means of transportation ; yet there was no time to lose , for should he delay the execution of his plan it might be countermanded by the king . His only resource , therefore , was in a prompt and hardy exertion of the royal authority ; and he issued an order requiring the inhabitants of Quebec , Montreal , Three Rivers , and other settlements to furnish him , at their own cost , as soon as the spring sowing should be over , with a certain number of armed men besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited the officers settled in the country to join the expedition , an invitation which , anxious as they were to gain his good graces , few of them cared to decline . Regardless of murmurs and discontent , he pushed his preparation vigorously , and on the third of June left Quebec with his guard , his staff , a part of the garrison of the Castle of St. Louis , and a number of volunteers . He had already sent to La Salle , who was then at Montreal , directing him to repair to Onondaga , the political centre of the Iroquois , and invite their sachems to meet the Governor in council at the Bay of Quinte on the north of Lake Ontario . La Salle had set out on his mission , but first sent Frontenac a map , which convinced him that the best site for his proposed fort was the mouth of the Cataraqui , where Kingston now stands . Another messenger was accordingly despatched , to change the rendezvous to this point . Meanwhile , the Governor proceeded , at his leisure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers settled along the bank , who , eager to pay their homage to the newly risen sun , received him with a hospitality , which , under the roof of a log hut , was sometimes graced by the polished courtesies of the salon and the boudoir . Reaching Montreal , which he had never before seen , he gazed we may suppose with some interest at the long row of humble dwellings which lined the bank , the massive buildings of the seminary , and the spire of the church predominant over all . It was a rude scene , but the greeting that awaited him savored nothing of the rough simplicity of the wilderness . Perrot , the local governor , was on the shore with his soldiers and the inhabitants , drawn up under arms , and firing a salute , to welcome the representative of the king . Frontenac was compelled to listen to a long harangue from the Judge of the place , followed by another from the Syndic . Then there was a solemn procession to the church , where he was forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priests . Te Deum followed , in thanks for his arrival , and then he took refuge in the fort . Here he remained thirteen days , busied with his preparations , organizing the militia , soothing their mutual jealousies , and settling knotty questions of rank and precedence . During this time every means , as he declares , was used to prevent him from proceeding , and among other devices a rumor was set on foot that a Dutch fleet , having just captured Boston , was on its way to attack Quebec . Footnote : Lettre de Frontenac a Colbert , 13 Nov. 1673 , MS . This rumor , it appears , originated with the Jesuit Dablon.  --  Journal du Voyage du Comte de Frontenac au Lac Ontario . MS . The Jesuits were greatly opposed to the establishment of forts and trading posts in the upper country , for reasons that will appear hereafter . Having sent men , canoes , and baggage , by land , to La Salle 's old settlement of La Chine , Frontenac himself followed on the twenty-eighth of June . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Indians from the missions , and a hundred and twenty canoes , besides two large flatboats , which he caused to be painted in red and blue , with strange devices , intended to dazzle the Iroquois by a display of unwonted splendor . Now their hard task began . Shouldering canoes through the forest , dragging the flatboats along the shore , working like beavers , sometimes in water to the knees , sometimes to the armpits , their feet cut by the sharp stones , and they themselves well nigh swept down by the furious current , they fought their way upward against the chain of mighty rapids that break the navigation of the St. Lawrence . The Indians were of the greatest service . Frontenac , like La Salle , showed from the first a special faculty of managing them ; for his keen , incisive spirit was exactly to their liking , and they worked for him as they would have worked for no man else . As they approached the Long Saut , rain fell in torrents , and the Governor , without his cloak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amphibious toil of his followers . Once , it is said , he lay awake all night , in his anxiety lest the biscuit should be wet , which would have ruined the expedition . No such mischance took place , and at length the last rapid was passed , and smooth water awaited them to their journey 's end . Soon they reached the Thousand Islands , and their light flotilla glided in long file among those watery labyrinths , by rocky islets , where some lonely pine towered like a mast against the sky ; by sun-scorched crags , where the brown lichens crisped in the parching glare ; by deep dells , shady and cool , rich in rank ferns , and spongy , dark green mosses ; by still coves , where the water-lilies lay like snow-flakes on their broad , flat leaves ; till at length they neared their goal , and the glistening bosom of Lake Ontario opened on their sight . Frontenac , to impose respect on the Iroquois , now set his canoes in order of battle . Four divisions formed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he himself , with his guards , his staff , and the gentlemen volunteers , followed , with the canoes of Three Rivers on his right , and those of the Indians on his left , while two remaining divisions formed a rear line . Thus , with measured paddles , they advanced over the still lake , till they saw a canoe approaching to meet them . It bore several Iroquois chiefs , who told them that the dignitaries of their nation awaited them at Cataraqui , and offered to guide them to the spot . They entered the wide mouth of the river , and passed along the shore , now covered by the quiet little city of Kingston , till they reached the point at present occupied by the barracks , at the western end of Cataraqui bridge . Here they stranded their canoes and disembarked . Baggage was landed , fires lighted , tents pitched , and guards set . Close at hand , under the lee of the forest , were the camping sheds of the Iroquois , who had come to the rendezvous in considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteenth of July , the drums beat , and the whole party were drawn up under arms . A double line of men extended from the front of Frontenac 's tent to the Indian camp , and through the lane thus formed , the savage deputies , sixty in number , advanced to the place of council . They could not hide their admiration at the martial array of the French , many of whom were old soldiers of the Regiment of Carignan , and when they reached the tent , they ejaculated their astonishment at the uniforms of the Governor 's guard who surrounded it . Here the ground had been carpeted with the sails of the flatboats , on which the deputies squatted themselves in a ring and smoked their pipes for a time with their usual air of deliberate gravity , while Frontenac , who sat surrounded by his officers , had full leisure to contemplate the formidable adversaries whose mettle was hereafter to put his own to so severe a test . A chief named Garakontie , a noted friend of the French , at length opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations , with expressions of great respect and deference towards " Onontio " ; that is to say , the Governor of Canada . Whereupon Frontenac , whose native arrogance , where Indians were concerned , always took a form which imposed respect without exciting anger , replied in the following strain :  --  " Children ! Mohawks , Oneidas , Onondagas , Cayugas , and Senecas . I am glad to see you here , where I have had a fire lighted for you to smoke by , and for me to talk to you . You have done well , my children , to obey the command of your Father . Take courage ; you will hear his word , which is full of peace and tenderness . For do not think that I have come for war . My mind is full of peace , and she walks by my side . Courage , then , children , and take rest . " With that , he gave them six fathoms of tobacco , reiterated his assurances of friendship , promised that he would be a kind father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was forced to speak through an interpreter , and ended with a gift of guns to the men , and prunes and raisins to their wives and children . Here closed this preliminary meeting , the great council being postponed to another day . During the meeting , Raudin , Frontenac 's engineer , was tracing out the lines of a fort , after a predetermined plan , and the whole party , under the direction of their officers , now set themselves to construct it . Some cut down trees , some dug the trenches , some hewed the palisades ; and with such order and alacrity was the work urged on , that the Indians were lost in astonishment . Meanwhile , Frontenac spared no pains to make friends of the chiefs , some of whom he had constantly at his table . He fondled the Iroquois children , and gave them bread and sweetmeats , and , in the evening , feasted the squaws , to make them dance . The Indians were delighted with these attentions , and conceived a high opinion of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fort was well advanced , Frontenac called the chiefs to a grand council , which was held with all possible state and ceremony . His dealing with the Indians , on this and other occasions , was truly admirable . Unacquainted as he was with them , he seems to have had an instinctive perception of the treatment they required . His predecessors had never ventured to address the Iroquois as " Children , " but had always styled them " Brothers " ; and yet the assumption of paternal authority on the part of Frontenac was not only taken in good part , but was received with apparent gratitude . The martial nature of the man , his clear decisive speech , and his frank and downright manner , backed as they were by a display of force which in their eyes was formidable , struck them with admiration , and gave tenfold effect to his words of kindness . They thanked him for that which from another they would not have endured . Frontenac began by again expressing his satisfaction that they had obeyed the commands of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to say . Then he exhorted them to embrace Christianity ; and on this theme he dwelt at length , in words excellently adapted to produce the desired effect ; words which it would be most superfluous to tax as insincere , though , doubtless , they lost nothing in emphasis , because in this instance conscience and policy aimed alike . Then , changing his tone , he pointed to his officers , his guard , the long files of the militia , and the two flatboats , mounted with cannon , which lay in the river near by . " If , " he said , " your Father can come so far , with so great a force , through such dangerous rapids , merely to make you a visit of pleasure and friendship , what would he do , if you should awaken his anger , and make it necessary for him to punish his disobedient children ? He is the arbiter of peace and war . Beware how you offend him . " And he warned them not to molest the Indian allies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chastise them for the least infraction of the peace . From threats he passed to blandishments , and urged them to confide in his paternal kindness , saying that , in proof of his affection , he was building a storehouse at Cataraqui , where they could be supplied with all the goods they needed , without the necessity of a long and dangerous journey . He warned them against listening to bad men , who might seek to delude them by misrepresentations and falsehoods ; and he urged them to give heed to none but " men of character , like the Sieur de la Salle . " He expressed a hope that they would suffer their children to learn French from the missionaries , in order that they and his nephews  --  meaning the French colonists  --  might become one people ; and he concluded by requesting them to give him a number of their children to be educated in the French manner , at Quebec . This speech , every clause of which was reinforced by abundant presents , was extremely well received ; though one speaker reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he had not told them at what prices they could obtain goods at Cataraqui . Frontenac evaded a precise answer , but promised them that the goods should be as cheap as possible , in view of the great difficulty of transportation . As to the request concerning their children , they said that they could not accede to it till they had talked the matter over in their villages ; but it is a striking proof of the influence which Frontenac had gained over them , that , in the following year , they actually sent several of their children to Quebec to be educated , the girls among the Ursulines , and the boys in the household of the Governor . Three days after the council , the Iroquois set out on their return ; and , as the palisades of the fort were now finished , and the barracks nearly so , Frontenac began to send his party homeward by detachments . He himself was detained , for a time , by the arrival of another band of Iroquois , from the villages on the north side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had made to the others ; and , this final meeting over , embarked with his guard , leaving a sufficient number to hold the fort , which was to be provisioned for a year by means of a convoy , then on its way up the river . Passing the rapids safely , he reached Montreal on the first of August . His enterprise had been a complete success . He had gained every point , and , in spite of the dangerous navigation , had not lost a single canoe . Thanks to the enforced and gratuitous assistance of the inhabitants , the whole had cost the king only about ten thousand francs , which Frontenac had advanced on his own credit . Though , in a commercial point of view , the new establishment was of very questionable benefit to the colony at large , the Governor had , nevertheless , conferred an inestimable blessing on all Canada , by the assurance he had gained of a long respite from the fearful scourge of Iroquois hostility . " Assuredly , " he writes , " I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear , and good-will . " Footnote : Lettre de Frontenac au Ministre , 13 Nov. 1673 . He adds , that the fort at Cataraqui , with the aid of a vessel , now building , will command Lake Ontario , keep the peace with the Iroquois , and cut off the trade with the English . And he proceeds to say , that , by another fort at the mouth of the Niagara , and another vessel on Lake Erie , we , the French , can command all the upper lakes . This plan was an essential link in the scheme of La Salle ; and we shall soon find him employed in executing it . It remained to determine what disposition should be made of the new fort . For some time it was uncertain whether the king would not order its demolition , as efforts had been made to influence him to that effect . It was resolved , however , that , being once constructed , it should be allowed to stand ; and , after a considerable delay , a final arrangement was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the autumn of 1674 , La Salle went to France , with letters of strong recommendation from Frontenac . Footnote : In his despatch to the minister Colbert , of the fourteenth of November , 1674 , Frontenac speaks of La Salle as follows : " I can not help , Monseigneur , recommending to you the Sieur de la Salle , who is about to go to France , and who is a man of intelligence and ability ,  - -  more capable than anybody else I know here , to accomplish every kind of enterprise and discovery which may be entrusted to him ,  --  as he has the most perfect knowledge of the state of the country , as you will see if you are disposed to give him a few moments of audience . " He was well received at Court ; and he made two petitions to the king ; the one for a patent of nobility , in consideration of his services as an explorer ; and the other for a grant in seigniory of Fort Frontenac , for so he called the new post , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered to pay back the ten thousand francs which the fort had cost the king ; to maintain it at his own charge , with a garrison equal to that of Montreal , besides fifteen or twenty laborers ; to form a French colony around it ; to build a church , whenever the number of inhabitants should reach one hundred ; and , meanwhile , to support one or more Recollet friars ; and , finally , to form a settlement of domesticated Indians in the neighborhood . His offers were accepted . He was raised to the rank of the untitled nobles ; received a grant of the fort , and lands adjacent , to the extent of four leagues in front and half a league in depth , besides the neighboring islands ; and was invested with the government of the fort and settlement , subject to the orders of the Governor-General .

La Salle returned to Canada , proprietor of a seigniory , which , all things considered , was one of the most valuable in the colony . It was now that his family , rejoicing in his good fortune , and not unwilling to share it , made him large advances of money , enabling him to pay the stipulated sum to the king , to rebuild the fort in stone , maintain soldiers and laborers , and procure in part , at least , the necessary outfit .

Those may believe , who will , that Frontenac did not expect a share in the profits of the new post . That he did expect it , there is positive evidence , for a deposition is extant , taken at the instance of his enemy , the Intendant Duchesneau , in which three witnesses attest that the Governor , La Salle , his lieutenant La Forest , and one Boisseau , had formed a partnership to carry on the trade of Fort Frontenac . CHAPTER VII . 1674-1678 . LA SALLE AND THE JESUITS . THE ABBE FENELON.  --  HE ATTACKS THE GOVERNOR .  --  THE ENEMIES OF LA SALLE.  --  AIMS OF THE JESUITS .  --  THEIR HOSTILITY TO LA SALLE . A curious incident occurred soon , after the building of the fort on Lake Ontario . A violent quarrel had taken place between Frontenac and Perrot , the Governor of Montreal , whom , in view of his speculations in the fur-trade , he seems to have regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his folly and arrogance , would have justified any reasonable measure of severity . Frontenac , however , was not reasonable . He arrested Perrot , threw him into prison , and set up a man of his own as governor in his place ; and , as the judge of Montreal was not in his interest , he removed him , and substituted another , on whom he could rely . Thus for a time he had Montreal well in hand . The priests of the Seminary , seigneurs of the island , regarded these arbitrary proceedings with extreme uneasiness . They claimed the right of nominating their own governor ; and Perrot , though he held a commission from the king , owed his place to their appointment . True , he had set them at nought , and proved a veritable King Stork , yet nevertheless they regarded his removal as an infringement of their rights . During the quarrel with Perrot , La Salle chanced to be at Montreal , lodged in the house of Jacques Le Ber ; who , though one of the principal merchants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell goods across his counter in person to white men and Indians , his wife taking his place when he was absent . Such were the primitive manners of the secluded little colony . Le Ber , at this time , was in the interest of Frontenac and La Salle ; though he afterwards became one of their most determined opponents . Amid the excitement and discussion occasioned by Perrot 's arrest , La Salle declared himself an adherent of the Governor , and warned all persons against speaking ill of him in his hearing . The Abbe Fenelon , already mentioned as half-brother to the famous Archbishop , had attempted to mediate between Frontenac and Perrot ; and to this end had made a journey to Quebec on the ice , in midwinter . Being of an ardent temperament , and more courageous than prudent , he had spoken somewhat indiscreetly , and had been very roughly treated by the stormy and imperious Count . He returned to Montreal greatly excited , and not without cause . It fell to his lot to preach the Easter sermon . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was crowded to the porch , all the chief persons of the settlement being present . The cure of the parish , whose name also was Perrot , said High Mass , assisted by La Salle 's brother , Cavelier , and two other priests . Then Fenelon mounted the pulpit . Certain passages of his sermon were obviously levelled against Frontenac . Speaking of the duties of those clothed with temporal authority , he said that the magistrate , inspired with the spirit of Christ , was as ready to pardon offences against himself as to punish those against his prince ; that he was full of respect for the ministers of the altar , and never maltreated them when they attempted to reconcile enemies and restore peace ; that he never made favorites of those who flattered him , nor under specious pretexts oppressed other persons in authority who opposed his enterprises ; that he used his power to serve his king , and not to his own advantage ; that he remained content with his salary , without disturbing the commerce of the country , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that he never troubled the people by inordinate and unjust levies of men and material , using the name of his prince as a cover to his own designs . Footnote : Faillon , Colonie Francaise , iii . 497 , and manuscript authorities there cited . I have examined the principal of these . Faillon himself is a priest of St. Sulpice . Compare H. Verreau , Les Deux Abbes de Fenelon , chap . vii . La Salle sat near the door , but as the preacher proceeded , he suddenly rose to his feet in such a manner as to attract the notice of the congregation . As they turned their heads , he signed to the principal persons among them , and by his angry looks and gesticulation called their attention to the words of Fenelon . Then meeting the eye of the cure , who sat beside the altar , he made the same signs to him , to which the cure replied by a deprecating shrug of the shoulders . Fenelon changed color , but continued his sermon . Footnote : Information faicte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , et Nicolas Dupont , etc. etc. , contre le Sr. Abbe de Fenelon , MS . Tilly and Dupont were sent by Frontenac to inquire into the affair . Among the deponents is La Salle himself . This indecent procedure of La Salle filled the priests with anxiety , for they had no doubt that the sermon would speedily be reported to Frontenac . Accordingly they made all haste to disavow it , and their letter to that effect was the first information which the Governor received of the affair . He summoned the offender to Quebec , to answer a charge of seditious language , before the Supreme Council . Fenelon appeared accordingly , but denied the jurisdiction of the Council ; claiming that as an ecclesiastic it was his right to be tried by the Bishop . By way of asserting this right , he seated himself in presence of his judges , and put on his hat ; and being rebuked by Frontenac , who presided , he pushed it on farther . Footnote : The Council always held its session with hats on . It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was also entitled to wear his hat , and Fenelon maintained that it had no right to require him to appear before it in any other character . He was placed under arrest , and soon after required to leave Canada ; but the king accompanied the recall with a sharp word of admonition to his too strenuous lieutenant . Footnote : Lettre du Roi a Frontenac , 22 Avril , 1675 , MS . This affair gives us a glimpse of the distracted state of the colony , racked by the discord of conflicting interests and passions . There were the quarrels of rival traders , the quarrels of priests among themselves , of priests with the civil authorities , and of the civil authorities among themselves . Prominent , if not paramount , among the occasions of strife , were the schemes of Cavelier de La Salle . All the traders not interested with him leagued together to oppose him ; and this with an acrimony easily understood , when it is remembered that they depended for subsistence on the fur-trade , while La Salle had engrossed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . Duchesneau , Intendant of the colony , and in that capacity almost as a matter of course on ill terms with the Governor , was joined with this party of opposition , with whom he evidently had commercial interests in common . La Chesnaye , Le Moyne , and ultimately Le Ber , besides various others of more or less influence , were in the league against La Salle . Among them was Louis Joliet , whom his partisans put forward as a rival discoverer , and a foil to La Salle . Joliet , it will be remembered , had applied for a grant of land in the countries he had discovered , and had been refused . La Salle soon after made a similar application , and with a different result , as will presently appear . His adherents continually depreciated the merits of Joliet , and even expressed doubt of the reality , or at least the extent , of his discoveries . But there was another element of opposition to La Salle , less noisy , but not less formidable , and this arose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under befitting forms of duty and courtesy , paid him back in the same coin . Having no love for the Governor , they would naturally have little for his partisan and protege ; but their opposition had another and a deeper root , for the plans of the daring young schemer jarred with their own . We have seen the Canadian Jesuits in the early apostolic days of their mission , when the flame of their zeal , fed by an ardent hope , burned bright and high . This hope was doomed to disappointment . Their avowed purpose of building another Paraguay on the borders of the Great Lakes Footnote : This purpose is several times indicated in the Relations . For an instance , see " Jesuits in North America , " 153. was never accomplished , and their missions and their converts were swept away in an avalanche of ruin . Still , they would not despair . From the Lakes they turned their eyes to the Valley of the Mississippi , in the hope to see it one day the seat of their new empire of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It meant a little nation of converted and domesticated savages , docile as children , under the paternal and absolute rule of Jesuit fathers , and trained by them in industrial pursuits , the results of which were to inure , not to the profit of the producers , but to the building of churches , the founding of colleges , the establishment of warehouses and magazines , and the construction of works of defence ,  --  all controlled by Jesuits , and forming a part of the vast possessions of the Order . Such was the old Paraguay , Footnote : Compare Charlevoix , Histoire de Paraguay , with Robertson , Letters on Paraguay. and such , we may suppose , would have been the new , had the plans of those who designed it been realized . I have said that since the middle of the century the religious exaltation of the early missions had sensibly declined . In the nature of things , that grand enthusiasm was too intense and fervent to be long sustained . But the vital force of Jesuitism had suffered no diminution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and absorption of the individual in the Order , which has marked the Jesuits from their first existence as a body , was no whit changed or lessened ; a principle , which , though different , was no less strong than the self-devoted patriotism of Sparta or the early Roman Republic . The Jesuits were no longer supreme in Canada , or , in other words , Canada was no longer simply a mission . It had become a colony . Temporal interests and the civil power were constantly gaining ground ; and the disciples of Loyola felt that relatively , if not absolutely , they were losing it . They struggled vigorously to maintain the ascendancy of their Order ; or , as they would have expressed it , the ascendancy of religion : but in the older and more settled parts of the colony it was clear that the day of their undivided rule was past . Therefore , they looked with redoubled solicitude to their missions in the West . They had been among its first explorers ; and they hoped that here the Catholic Faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sway . In Paraguay , it was their constant aim to exclude white men from their missions . It was the same in North America . They dreaded fur-traders , partly because they interfered with their teachings and perverted their converts , and partly for other reasons . But La Salle was a fur-trader , and far worse than a fur-trader ,  - -  he aimed at occupation , fortification , settlement . The scope and vigor of his enterprises , and the powerful influence that aided them made him a stumbling-block in their path . As they would have put the case , it was the spirit of this world opposed to the spirit of religion ; but I may perhaps be pardoned if I am constrained to think that the spirit which inspired these fathers was not uniformly celestial , notwithstanding the virtues which sometimes illustrated it . Frontenac , in his letters to the Court , is continually begging that more Recollet friars may be sent to Canada . Footnote : The Recollets , ejected from Canada on the irruption of the English in 1629 ( see " Pioneers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been allowed to return until 1669 , when their missions were begun anew . Not that he had any peculiar fondness for ecclesiastics of any kind , regular or secular , white , black , or gray ; but he wanted the Recollets to oppose to the Jesuits . He had no fear of these mendicant disciples of St. Francis . Far less able and less ambitious than the Jesuits , he knew that he could manage them , because they would need his support against their formidable rivals . La Salle , too , wanted more Recollets , and for the same reason ; but in one point he differed from his patron . He was a man , not only of regulated life , but of strong religious feeling , and , bating his violent prepossession against the Jesuits , he respected the Church and its ministers , as his letters and his life attest . Thus , in replying to a charge of undue severity towards some of his followers , he alleges in his justification the profane language of the men in question , and adds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blasphemers in my camp .

The writer knew the Sulpitian Galinee , Footnote : Ante , p. 11. who , as he says , had a very high opinion of La Salle ; and he was also in close relations with the discoverer 's patron , the Prince de Conti . Footnote : Louis-Armand de Bourbon , second Prince de Conti . I am strongly inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memoir . He says that he had ten or twelve interviews with La Salle , and becoming interested in him and in that which he communicated , he wrote down the substance of his conversation . The paper is divided into two parts ,  --  the first , called " Memoire sur Mr. de la Salle , " is devoted to the state of affairs in Canada , and chiefly to the Jesuits ; the second , entitled " Histoire de Mr. de la Salle , " is an account of the discoverer 's life , or as much of it as the writer had learned from him . Footnote : Extracts from this have already been given in connection with La Salle 's supposed discovery of the Mississippi . Ante , p. 20 . Both parts bear throughout the internal evidence of being what they profess to be ; but they embody the statements of a man of intense partisan feeling , transmitted through the mind of another person , in sympathy with him , and evidently sharing his prepossessions . In one respect , however , the paper is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vivid and not an exaggerated picture of the bitter strife of parties which then raged in Canada , and which was destined to tax to the utmost the vast energy and fortitude of La Salle . At times the memoir is fully sustained by contemporary evidence ; but often , again , it rests on its own unsupported authority . I give an abstract of its statements as I find them . The following is the writer 's account of La Salle : " All those among my friends who have seen him find in him a man of great intelligence and sense . He rarely speaks of any subject except when questioned about it , and his words are very few and very precise . He distinguishes perfectly between that which he knows with certainty and that which he knows with some mingling of doubt . When he does not know , he does not hesitate to avow it , and though I have heard him say the same thing more than five or six times , when persons were present who had not heard it before , he always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never heard anybody speak whose words carried with them more marks of truth . " Footnote : " Tous ceux de mes amis qui l'ont vu luy trouve beaucoup d'esprit et un tres grand sens ; il ne parle gueres que des choses sur lesquelles on l'interroge ; il les dit en tres-peu de mots et tres-bien circonstancies ; il distingue parfaitement ce qu'il scait avec certitude , de ce qu'il scait avec quelque melange de doute . Il avoue sans aucune facon ne pas savoir ce qu'il ne scait pas , et quoyque je lui aye ouy dire plus de cinq ou six fois les mesme choses a l'occasion de quelques personnes qui ne les avaient point encore entendues , je les luy ay toujours ouy dire de la mesme maniere . En un mot je n'ay jamais ouy parler personne do nt les paroles portassent plus de marques de verite . " After mentioning that he is thirty-three or thirty-four years old , and that he has been twelve years in America , the memoir declares that he made the following statements ,  --  that the Jesuits are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and does nothing but in concert with them ; Footnote : " Il y a une autre chose qui me deplait , qui est l'entiere dependence dans laquelle les Pretres du Seminaire de Quebec et le Grand Vicaire de l'Eveque sont pour les Peres Jesuites , car il ne fait pas la moindre chose sans leur ordre ; ce qui fait qu'indirectement ils sont les maitres de ce qui regarde le spirituel , qui , comme vous savez , est une grande machine pour remuer tout le reste. "  --  Lettre de Frontenac a Colbert , 2 Nov. 1672. that he is not well inclined towards the Recollets , Footnote : " Ces religieux ( les Recollets ) sont fort proteges partout par le comte de Frontenac , gouverneur du pays , et a cause de cela assez maltraites par l'evesque , parceque la doctrine de l'evesque et des Jesuites est que les affaires de la Religion chrestienne n'iront point bien dans ce pays-la que quand le gouverneur sera creature des Jesuites , ou que l'evesque sera gouverneur . "  --  Memoire sur Mr. de la Salle. who have little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Canada the Jesuits think everybody an enemy to religion who is an enemy to them ; that , though they refused absolution to all who sold brandy to the Indians , they sold it themselves , and that he , La Salle , had himself detected them in it ; Footnote : " Ils ( les Jesuites ) refusent l'absolution a ceux qui ne veulent pas promettre de n'en plus vendre ( de l'eau-de-vie ) , et s'ils meurent en cet etat , ils les privent de la sepulture ecclesiastique ; au contraire ils se permettent a eux-memes sans aucune difficulte ce mesme trafic quoique tout sorte de trafic soit interdit a tous les ecclesiastiques par les ordonnances du Roy , et par une bulle expresse du Pape . La Bulle et les ordonnances sont notoires , et quoyqu'ils cachent le trafic qu'ils font d'eau-de-vie , M. de la Salle pretend qu'il ne l'est pas moms ; qu ' outre la notoriete il en a des preuves certaines , et qu'il les a surpris dans ce trafic , et qu'ils luy ont tendu des pieges pour l'y surprendre ... Ils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ en traitaient jour et nuit . "  --  Ibid . The writer says that he makes this last statement , not on the authority of La Salle , but on that of a memoir made at the time when the Intendant , Talon , with whom he elsewhere says that he was well acquainted , returned to France . A great number of particulars are added respecting the Jesuit trade in furs. that the Bishop laughs at the orders of the king when they do not agree with the wishes of the Jesuits ; that the Jesuits dismissed one of their servants named Robert , because he told of their trade in brandy ; that Albanel , Footnote : Albanel was prominent among the Jesuit explorers at this time . He is best known by his journey up the Saguenay to Hudson 's Bay in 1672. in particular , carried on a great fur-trade , and that the Jesuits have built their college in part from the profits of this kind of traffic ; that they admitted that they carried on a trade , but denied that they gained so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pour vous parler franchement , ils ( les Jesuites ) songent autant a la conversion du Castor qu'a celle des ames . "  --  Lettre de Frontenac a Colbert , 2 Nov. 1672 . In his despatch of the next year , he says that the Jesuits ought to content themselves with instructing the Indians in their old missions , instead of neglecting them to make new ones , in countries where there are " more beaver-skins to gain than souls to save . " The memoir proceeds to affirm that they trade largely with the Sioux , at Ste. Marie , and with other tribes at Michillimackinac , and that they are masters of the trade of that region , where the forts are in their possession . Footnote : These forts were built by them , and were necessary to the security of their missions . An Indian said , in full council , at Quebec , that he had prayed and been a Christian as long as the Jesuits would stay and teach him , but since no more beaver were left in his country , the missionaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will have no priests but themselves in their missions , and call them all Jansenists , not excepting the priests of St. Sulpice . The bishop is next accused of harshness and intolerance , as well as of growing rich by tithes , and even by trade , in which it is affirmed he has a covert interest . Footnote : Francois Xavier de Laval-Montmorency , first bishop of Quebec , was a prelate of austere character . His memory is cherished in Canada by adherents of the Jesuits and all ultramontane Catholics . It is added that there exists in Quebec , under the auspices of the Jesuits , an association called the Sainte Famille , of which Madame Bourdon Footnote : This Madame Bourdon was the widow of Bourdon , the engineer , ( see " Jesuits in North America , " 299 ) . If we may credit the letters of Marie de l'Incarnation , she had married him from a religious motive , in order to charge herself with the care of his motherless children ; stipulating in advance that he should live with her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As may be imagined , she was regarded as a most devout and saint-like person. is superior . They meet in the cathedral every Thursday , with closed doors , where they relate to each other  --  as they are bound by a vow to do  --  all they have learned , whether good or evil , concerning other people , during the week . It is a sort of female inquisition , for the benefit of the Jesuits , the secrets of whose friends , it is said , are kept , while no such discretion is observed with regard to persons not of their party . Footnote : " Il y a dans Quebec une congregation de femmes et de filles qu'ils les Jesuits appellent la sainte famille , dans laquelle on fait voeu sur les Saints Evangiles de dire tout ce qu'on sait de bien et de mal des personnes qu'on connoist . La Superieure de cette compagnie s'appelle Madame Boudon ; une Mde . D'Ailleboust est , je crois , l'assistante et une Mde . Charron , la Tresoriere .

Ces personnes sont accusees de tenir secret ce qu'elles apprennent de mal des personnes de leur party et de n'avoir pas la mesme discretion pour les autres . "  --  Memoire sur Mr. de la Salle . The Madame d'Ailleboust mentioned above was a devotee like Madame Bourdon , and , in one respect , her history was similar . See " The Jesuits in North America , " 360 . The association of the Sainte Famille was founded by the Jesuit Chaumonot at Montreal in 1663 . Laval , Bishop of Quebec , afterwards encouraged its establishment at that place ; and , as Chaumonot himself writes , caused it to be attached to the cathedral . Vie de Chaumonot , 83 . For its establishment at Montreal , see Faillon , Vie de Mlle. Mance , i. 233 . " Ils les Jesuites ont tous une si grande envie de savoir tout ce qui se fait dans les familles qu'ils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leur rapportent tout ce qui se fait dans les maisons , " etc. , etc.  --  Lettre de Frontenac au Ministre , 13 Nov. , 1673 . Here follow a series of statements which it is needless to repeat , as they do not concern La Salle . They relate to abuse of the confessional , hostility to other priests , hostility to civil authorities , and over-hasty baptisms , in regard to which La Salle is reported to have made a comparison , unfavorable to the Jesuits , between them and the Recollets and Sulpitians . We now come to the second part of the memoir , entitled " History of Monsieur de la Salle . " After stating that he left France at the age of twenty-one or twenty-two , with the purpose of attempting some new discovery , it makes the statements repeated in a former chapter , concerning his discovery of the Ohio , the Illinois , and possibly the Mississipi . It then mentions the building of Fort Frontenac , and says that one object of it was to prevent the Jesuits from becoming undisputed masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the report set on foot by the Jesuit Dablon , to prevent the building of the fort . Three years ago , it pursues , La Salle came to France , and obtained a grant of the fort ; and it proceeds to give examples of the means used by the party opposed to him to injure his good name , and bring him within reach of the law . Once , when he was at Quebec , the farmer of the king 's revenue , one of the richest men in the place , was extremely urgent in his proffers of hospitality , and at length , though he knew him but slightly , persuaded him to lodge in his house . He had been here but a few days when his host 's wife began to enact the part of the wife of Potiphar , and this with so much vivacity , that on one occasion La Salle was forced to take an abrupt leave , in order to avoid an infringement of the laws of hospitality . As he opened the door , he found the husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot to entrap him . Footnote : This story is told at considerable length , and the advances of the lady particularly described . Another attack , of a different character , though in the same direction , was soon after made . The remittances which La Salle received from the various members and connections of his family were sent through the hands of his brother , the Abbe Cavelier , from whom his enemies were , therefore , very eager to alienate him . To this end , a report was made to reach the priest 's ears , that La Salle had seduced a young woman , with whom he was living , in an open and scandalous manner , at Fort Frontenac . The effect of this device exceeded the wishes of its contrivers ; for the priest , aghast at what he had heard , set out for the fort , to administer his fraternal rebuke ; but , on arriving , in place of the expected abomination , found his brother , assisted by two Recollet friars , ruling , with edifying propriety , over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passages in some of La Salle 's letters , it may be gathered that the Abbe Cavelier gave him at times no little annoyance . In his double character of priest and elder brother , he seems to have constituted himself the counsellor , monitor , and guide of a man , who , though many years his junior , was in all respects incomparably superior to him , as the sequel will show . This must have been almost insufferable to a nature like that of La Salle ; who , nevertheless , was forced to arm himself with patience , since his brother held the purse-strings . On one occasion , his forbearance was put to a severe proof , when , wishing to marry a damsel of good connections in the colony , the Abbe Cavelier saw fit , for some reason , to interfere , and prevented the alliance . Footnote : Letter of La Salle in possession of M. Margry . To resume the memoir . It declares that the Jesuits procured an ordinance from the Supreme Council , prohibiting traders from going into the Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being already established there in their missions , might carry on trade without competition . But La Salle induced a good number of the Iroquois to settle around his fort ; thus bringing the trade to his own door , without breaking the ordinance . These Iroquois , he is farther reported to have said , were very fond of him , and aided him in rebuilding the fort with cut stone . The Jesuits told the Iroquois on the south side of the lake , where they were established as missionaries , that La Salle was strengthening his defences , with the view of making war on them . They and the Intendant , who was their creature , endeavored to embroil the Iroquois with the French , in order to ruin La Salle ; writing to him at the same time that he was the bulwark of the country , and that he ought to be always on his guard . They also tried to persuade Frontenac that it was necessary to raise men and prepare for war . La Salle suspected them , and , seeing that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excited state , he induced the Governor to come to Fort Frontenac , to pacify them . He accordingly did so , and a council was held , which ended in a complete restoration of confidence on the part of the Iroquois . Footnote : Louis XIV . alludes to this visit , in a letter to Frontenac , dated 28 April , 1677 . " I can not but approve , " he writes , " of what you have done in your voyage to Fort Frontenac , to reconcile the minds of the Five Iroquois Nations , and to clear yourself from the suspicions they had entertained , and from the motives that might induce them to make war . " Frontenac 's despatches of this , as well as of the preceding and following years , are missing from the archives . In a memoir written in November , 1680 , La Salle alludes to " le desir que l'on avoit que Monseigneur le Comte de Frontenac fist la guerre aux Iroquois . " See Thomassy , Geologie Pratique de la Louisiane , 203 . At this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Footnote : Bruyas was about this time stationed among the Onondagas . Pierron was among the Senecas . He had lately removed to them from the Mohawk country .  --  Relation des Jesuites , 1673-9 , p. 140 ( Shea ) . Bruyas was also for a long time among the Mohawks. of spreading reports that the French were preparing to attack them . La Salle thought that the object of the intrigue was to make the Iroquois jealous of him , and engage Frontenac in expenses which would offend the king . After La Salle and the Governor had lost credit by the rupture , the Jesuits would come forward as pacificators , in the full assurance that they could restore quiet , and appear in the attitude of saviors of the colony . La Salle , pursues his reporter , went on to say , that about this time a quantity of hemlock and verdigris was given him in a salad ; and that the guilty person was a man in his employ , named Nicolas Perrot , otherwise called Solycoeur , who confessed the crime . Footnote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , for it is not likely that any other can be meant than the famous voyageur . I have found no mention elsewhere of the synonyme of Solycoeur . Poisoning was the current crime of the day ; and persons of the highest rank had repeatedly been charged with it . The following is the passage :  --  " Quoiqu'il en soit , Mr. de la Salle se sentit quelque temps aeres empoissonne d'une salade dans laquelle on avoit mesle du cigue , qui est poison en ce pays la , et du verd de gris . Il en fut malade a l'extremite , vomissant presque continuellement 40 ou 50 jours apres , et il ne rechappa que par la force extreme de sa constitution . Celuy qui luy donna le poison fut un nomine Nicolas Perrot , autrement Solycoeur , l'un de ses domestiques .... Il pouvait faire mourir cet homme , qui a confesse son crime , mais il s'est contente de l'enfermer les fers aux pieds. "  - -  Histoire de Mr. de la Salle . The memoir adds that La Salle , who recovered from the effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was not , as we shall see , the only one of the kind made against La Salle , is alluded to by him , in a letter to the Prince de Conti , written in Canada , when he was on the point of departure on his great expedition to descend the Mississippi . The following is an extract from it : " I hope to give myself the honor of sending you a more particular account of this enterprise when it shall have had the success which I hope for it ; but I have need of a strong protection for its support . It traverses the commercial operations of certain persons , who will find it hard to endure it . They intended to make a new Paraguay in these parts , and the route which I close against them gave them facilities for an advantageous correspondence with Mexico . This check will infallibly be a mortification to them ; and you know how they deal with whatever opposes them . Nevertheless , I am bound to render them the justice to say that the poison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instigation . The person who was conscious of the guilt , believing that I was their enemy because he saw that our sentiments were opposed , thought to exculpate himself by accusing them ; and I confess that at the time I was not sorry to have this indication of their ill-will : but having afterwards carefully examined the affair , I clearly discovered the falsity of the accusation which this rascal had made against them . I nevertheless pardoned him , in order not to give notoriety to the affair ; as the mere suspicion might sully their reputation , to which I should scrupulously avoid doing the slightest injury , unless I thought it necessary to the good of the public , and unless the fact were fully proved . Therefore , Monsieur , if any one shared the suspicion which I felt , oblige me by undeceiving him . " Footnote : The following words are underlined in the original : " Je suis pourtant oblige de leur rendre une justice , que le poison qu'on m'avoit donne n'estoit point de leur instigation . "  --  Lettre de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This letter , so honorable to La Salle , explains the statement made in the memoir , that , notwithstanding his grounds of complaint against the Jesuits he continued to live on terms of courtesy with them , entertained them at his fort , and occasionally corresponded with them . The writer asserts , however , that they intrigued with his men to induce them to desert ; employing for this purpose a young man named Deslauriers , whom they sent to him with letters of recommendation . La Salle took him into his service ; but he soon after escaped , with several other men , and took refuge in the Jesuit missions . Footnote : In a letter to the king , Frontenac mentions that several men who had been induced to desert from La Salle had gone to Albany , where the English had received them well .  --  Lettre de Frontenac au Roy , 6 Nov. 1679 . MS . The Jesuits had a mission in the neighboring tribe of the Mohawks , and elsewhere in New York . The object of the intrigue is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a number less than that which he was bound to maintain , thus exposing him to a forfeiture of his title of possession . He is also stated to have declared that Louis Joliet was an impostor , Footnote : This agrees with expressions used by La Salle in a memoir addressed by him to Frontenac in November , 1680 , and printed by Thomassy . In this he plainly intimates his belief that Joliet went but little below the mouth of the Illinois. and a donne of the Jesuits ,  --  that is , a man who worked for them without pay ; and , farther , that when he , La Salle , came to court to ask for privileges enabling him to pursue his discoveries , the Jesuits represented in advance to the minister Colbert , that his head was turned , and that he was fit for nothing but a mad-house . It was only by the aid of influential friends that he was at length enabled to gain an audience . Here ends this remarkable memoir ; which , criticise it as we may , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1677-1678 . THE GRAND ENTERPRISE . LA SALLE AT FORT FRONTENAC.  --  LA SALLE AT COURT .  --  HIS PLANS APPROVED .  --  HENRI DE TONTY.  --  PREPARATION FOR DEPARTURE . When La Salle gained possession of Fort Frontenac , he secured a base for all his future enterprises . That he meant to make it a permanent one is clear from the pains he took to strengthen its defences . Within two years from the date of his grant he had replaced the hasty palisade fort of Count Frontenac by a regular work of hewn stone ; of which , however , only two bastions , with their connecting curtains , were completed , the enclosure on the water side being formed of pickets . Within , there was a barrack , a well , a mill , and a bakery ; while a wooden blockhouse guarded the gateway . Footnote : Plan of Fort Frontenac , published by Faillon , from the original sent to France by Denonville , 1685 . Near the shore , south of the fort , was a cluster of small houses of French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Indian village . Two officers and a surgeon , with half a score or more of soldiers , made up the garrison ; and three or four times that number of masons , laborers , and canoe-men , were at one time maintained at the fort . Footnote : Etat de la depense faite par Mr. de la Salle , Gouverneur du Fort Frontenac , MS . When Frontenac was at the fort in September , 1677 , he found only four habitans . It appears by the Relation des Decouvertes du Sr. de la Salle , that , three or four years later , there were thirteen or fourteen families . La Salle spent 34,426 francs on the fort .  --  Memoire au Roy , Papiers de Famille , MSS . Besides these , there were two Recollet friars , Luc Buisset and Louis Hennepin ; of whom the latter was but indifferently suited to his apostolic functions , as we shall soon discover . La Salle built a house for them , near the fort ; and they turned a part of it into a chapel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view to ulterior designs , he caused four small decked vessels to be built : but , for ordinary uses , canoes best served his purpose ; and his followers became so skilful in managing them , that they were reputed the best canoe-men in America . Footnote : Relation des Decouvertes , MS . Hennepin repeats the statement . Feudal lord of the forests around him , commander of a garrison raised and paid by himself , founder of the mission , patron of the church , La Salle reigned the autocrat of his lonely little empire . But he had no thought of resting here . He had gained what he sought , a fulcrum for bolder and broader action . His plans were ripened and his time was come . He was no longer a needy adventurer , disinherited of all but his fertile brain and his intrepid heart . He had won place , influence , credit , and potent friends . Now , at length , he might hope to find the long-sought path to China and Japan , and secure for France those boundless regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his road to wealth , renown , and power . Again he sailed for France , bearing , as before , letters from Frontenac , commending him to the king and the minister . We have seen that he was denounced in advance as a madman ; but Colbert at length gave him a favoring ear , and granted his petition . Perhaps he read the man before him , living only in the conception and achievement of great designs , and armed with a courage that not the Fates nor the Furies themselves could appall . La Salle was empowered to pursue his proposed discoveries at his own expense , on condition of completing them within five years ; to build forts in the new-found countries , and hold possession of them on terms similar to those already granted him in the case of Fort Frontenac ; and to monopolize the trade in buffalo skins , a new branch of commerce , by which , as he urged , the plains of the Mississippi would become a source of copious wealth . But he was expressly forbidden to carry on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were accustomed to bring their furs to Montreal . Footnote : Permission an Sr. de la Salle de decouvrir la partie occidentals de la Nouvelle France , 12 May , 1678 , MS . Signed Colbert ; not , as Charlevoix says , Seignelay . Again La Salle 's wealthy relatives came to his aid , and large advances of money were made to him . Footnote : In the memorial which La Salle 's relations presented to the king after his death , they say that , on this occasion , " ses freres et ses parents n'epargnerent rien . " It is added that between 1678 and 1683 his enterprises cost the family more than 500,000 francs . By a memorandum of his cousin , Francois Plet , M.D. , of Paris , it appears that La Salle gave him , on the 27th and 28th of June , 1678 , two promissory notes of 9,805 francs and 1,676 francs respectively . He bought supplies and engaged men ; and in July , 1678 , sailed again for Canada , with thirty followers ,  --  sailors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchors , cables , and rigging ; iron tools ,  --  merchandise for trade , and all things necessary for his enterprise . There was one man of his party worth all the rest combined . The Prince de Conti had a protege in the person of Henri de Tonty , an Italian officer , one of whose hands had been blown off by a grenade in the Sicilian wars . His father , who had been Governor of Gaeta , but who had come to France in consequence of political convulsions in Naples , had earned no small reputation as a financier , and devised the form of life insurance known as the Tontine . The Prince de Conti recommended the son to La Salle ; and , as the event proved , he could not have done him a better service . La Salle learned to know his new lieutenant on the voyage across the Atlantic ; and , soon after reaching Canada , he wrote of him to his patron in the following terms : " His honorable character and his amiable disposition were well known to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doing things for which a strong constitution , an acquaintance with the country , and the use of both hands seemed absolutely necessary . Nevertheless , his energy and address make him equal to any thing ; and now , at a season when everybody is in fear of the ice , he is setting out to begin a new fort , two hundred leagues from this place , and to which I have taken the liberty to give the name of Fort Conti . It is situated near that great cataract , more than a hundred and twenty toises in height , by which the lakes of higher elevation precipitate themselves into Lake Frontenac Ontario . From there one goes by water , five hundred leagues , to the place where Fort Dauphin is to be begun , from which it only remains to descend the great river of the Bay of St. Esprit to reach the Gulf of Mexico . " Footnote : Lettre de La Salle au Prince de Conti , 31 Oct. 1678 , MS . Fort Conti was to have been built on the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Conti was given by La Salle to Lake Erie . The fort mentioned as Fort Dauphin was built , as we shall see , on the Illinois , though under another name . La Salle , deceived by Spanish maps , thought that the Mississippi discharged itself into the Bay of St. Esprit ( Mobile Bay ) . Henri de Tonty signed his name in the Gallicised , and not in the original Italian form , Tonti . He wore a hand of iron or some other metal , which was usually covered with a glove . La Potherie says that he once or twice used it to good purpose when the Indians became disorderly , in breaking the heads of the most contumacious or knocking out their teeth . Not knowing at the time the secret of the unusual efficacy of his blows , they regarded him as a " medicine " of the first order . La Potherie ascribes the loss of his hand to a sabre-cut received in a sortie at Messina ; but Tonty , in his Memoire , says , as above , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another ally , though a less efficient one , in the person of the Sieur de la Motte ; and at Quebec , where he was detained for a time , he found Father Louis Hennepin , who had come down from Fort Frontenac to meet him .

Hennepin was all eagerness to join in the adventure , and , to his great satisfaction , La Salle gave him a letter from his Provincial , Father Le Fevre , containing the coveted permission . Whereupon , to prepare himself , he went into retreat , at the Recollet convent of Quebec , where he remained for a time in such prayer and meditation as his nature , the reverse of spiritual , would permit . Frontenac , always partial to his Order , then invited him to dine at the chateau ; and having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the lower town and embarked . His vessel was a small birch canoe , paddled by two men . With sandalled feet , a coarse gray capote , and peaked hood , the cord of St. Francis about his waist , and a rosary and crucifix hanging at his side , the Father set forth on his memorable journey . He carried with him the furniture of a portable altar , which in time of need he could strap on his back , like a knapsack . He slowly made his way up the St. Lawrence , stopping here and there , where a clearing and a few log houses marked the feeble beginning of a parish and a seigniory . The settlers , though good Catholics , were too few and too poor to support a priest , and hailed the arrival of the friar with delight . He said mass , exhorted a little , as was his custom , and , on one occasion , baptized a child . At length , he reached Montreal , where the enemies of the enterprise enticed away his two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he continued his voyage , passed the rapids of the upper St. Lawrence , and reached Fort Frontenac at eleven o'clock at night , of the second of November , where his brethren of the mission , Ribourde and Buisset , received him with open arms . Footnote : Hennepin , Description de la Louisiane ( 1683 ) , 19 . Ibid. , Voyage Curieux ( 1704 ) , 66 . Ribourde had lately arrived . La Salle , Tonty , La Motte , and their party , who had left Quebec a few days after him , soon appeared at the fort ; La Salle much fatigued and worn by the hardships of the way , or more probably by the labors and anxieties of preparation . He had no sooner arrived , than he sent fifteen men in canoes to Lake Michigan and the Illinois , to open a trade with the Indians and collect a store of provisions . There was a small vessel of ten tons in the harbor ; and he ordered La Motte to sail in her for Niagara , accompanied by Hennepin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian of the expedition , and a conspicuous actor in it , has unwittingly painted his own portrait with tolerable distinctness .

He then speaks of his zeal for the saving of souls , but admits that a passion for travel and a burning desire to visit strange lands had no small part in his inclination for the missions . Footnote : Ibid. , Avant Propos , 5 . Being in a convent in Artois , his superior sent him to Calais , at the season of the herring-fishery , to beg alms , after the practice of the Franciscans .

He presently set out on a roving mission through Holland ; and he recounts various mishaps which befell him , " in consequence of my zeal in laboring for the saving of souls .

" Footnote : Ibid. , 13 . He got leave from his superiors to go to Canada , the most adventurous of all the missions ; and accordingly sailed in 1675 , in the ship which carried La Salle , who had just obtained the grant of Fort Frontenac . In the course of the voyage , he took it upon him to reprove a party of girls who were amusing themselves and a circle of officers and other passengers by dancing on deck . La Salle , who was among the spectators , was annoyed at Hennepin 's interference , and told him that he was behaving like a pedagogue . The friar retorted , by alluding  --  unconsciously , as he says  --  to the circumstance that La Salle was once a pedagogue himself , having , according to Hennepin , been for ten or twelve years teacher of a class in a Jesuit school . La Salle , he adds , turned pale with rage , and never forgave him to his dying day , but always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ au Lecteur . He elsewhere represents himself as on excellent terms with La Salle ; with whom , he says , he used to read histories of travels at Fort Frontenac , after which they discussed together their plans of discovery . On arriving in Canada , he was sent up to Fort Frontenac , as a missionary . That wild and remote post was greatly to his liking . He planted a gigantic cross , superintended the building of a chapel , for himself and his colleague , Buisset , and instructed the Iroquois colonists of the place . He visited , too , the neighboring Indian settlements , paddling his canoe in summer , when the lake was open , and journeying in winter on snow-shoes , with a blanket slung at his back . His most noteworthy journey was one which he made in the winter ,  --  apparently of 1677 ,  --  with a soldier of the fort . They crossed the eastern extremity of Lake Ontario on snow-shoes , and pushed southward through the forests , towards Onondaga ; stopping at evening to dig away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood for their fire , which they were forced to replenish repeatedly during the night , to keep themselves from freezing . At length they reached the great Onondaga town , where the Indians were much amazed at their hardihood . Thence they proceeded eastward , to the Oneidas , and afterwards to the Mohawks , who regaled them with small frogs , pounded up with a porridge of Indian corn . Here Hennepin found the Jesuit , Bruyas , who permitted him to copy a dictionary of the Mohawk language Footnote : This was the Racines Agnieres of Bruyas . It was published by Mr. Shea in 1862 . Hennepin seems to have studied it carefully ; for , on several occasions , he makes use of words evidently borrowed from it , putting them into the mouths of Indians speaking a dialect different from that of the Agniers , or Mohawks. which he had compiled , and here he presently met three Dutchmen , who urged him to visit the neighboring settlement of Orange , or Albany , an invitation which he seems to have declined . Footnote : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were pleased with him , he says , because he spoke Dutch . Bidding them farewell , he tied on his snow-shoes again , and returned with his companion to Fort Frontenac . Thus he inured himself to the hardships of the woods , and prepared for the execution of the grand plan of discovery which he calls his own ; " an enterprise , " to borrow his own words , " capable of terrifying anybody but me . " Footnote : " Une entreprise capable d'epouvanter tout autre que moi . "  --  Hennepin , Voyage Curieux , Avant Propos ( 1704 ) . When the later editions of his book appeared , doubts had been expressed of his veracity . " I here protest to you , before God , " he writes , addressing the reader , " that my narrative is faithful and sincere , and that you may believe every thing related in it . " Footnote : " Je vous proteste ici devant Dieu , que ma Relation est fidele et sincere , " etc.  - -  Ibid. , Avis au Lecteur . And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most impudent of liars ; and the narrative of which he speaks is a rare monument of brazen mendacity . Hennepin , however , had seen and dared much : for among his many failings fear had no part ; and where his vanity or his spite was not involved , he often told the truth . His books have their value , with all their enormous fabrications . Footnote : The nature of these fabrications will be shown hereafter . They occur , not in the early editions of Hennepin 's narrative , which are comparatively truthful , but in the edition of 1697 and those which followed . La Salle was dead at the time of their publication . La Motte and Hennepin , with sixteen men , went on board the little vessel of ten tons , which lay at Fort Frontenac . The friar 's two brethren , Buisset and Ribourde , threw their arms about his neck as they bade him farewell ; while his Indian proselytes , learning whither he was bound , stood with their hands pressed upon their mouths , in amazement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salle , with the rest of the party , was to follow as soon as he could finish his preparations . It was a boisterous and gusty day , the eighteenth of November . The sails were spread ; the shore receded ,  --  the stone walls of the fort , the huge cross that the friar had reared , the wigwams , the settlers ' cabins , the group of staring Indians on the strand . The lake was rough ; and the men , crowded in so small a craft , grew nervous and uneasy . They hugged the northern shore , to escape the fury of the wind which blew savagely from the north-east ; while the long , gray sweep of naked forests on their right betokened that winter was fast closing in . On the twenty-sixth , they reached the neighborhood of the Indian town of Taiaiagon , Footnote : This place is laid down on a manuscript map sent to France by the Intendant Duchesneau , and now preserved in the Archives de la Marine , and also on several other contemporary maps. not far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into the mouth of a river ,  --  probably the Humber ,  --  where the ice closed about her , and they were forced to cut her out with axes . On the fifth of December , they attempted to cross to the mouth of the Niagara ; but darkness overtook them , and they spent a comfortless night , tossing on the troubled lake , five or six miles from shore . In the morning , they entered the mouth of the Niagara , and landed on the point at its eastern side , where now stand the historic ramparts of Fort Niagara . Here they found a small village of Senecas , attracted hither by the fisheries , who gazed with curious eyes at the vessel , and listened in wonder as the voyagers sang Te Deum , in gratitude for their safe arrival . Hennepin , with several others , now ascended the river , in a canoe , to the foot of the mountain ridge of Lewiston , which , stretching on the right hand and on the left , forms the acclivity of a vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from this point to the cataract , seven miles above , rush , with the fury of an Alpine torrent , the gathered waters of four inland oceans . To urge the canoe farther was impossible . He landed , with his companions , on the west bank , near the foot of that part of the ridge now called Queenstown Heights , climbed the steep ascent , and pushed through the wintry forest on a tour of exploration . On his left sank the cliffs , the furious river raging below ; till at length , in primeval solitudes , unprofaned as yet by the pettiness of man , the imperial cataract burst upon his sight . Footnote : Hennepin 's account of the falls and river of Niagara  --  especially his second account , on his return from the West  --  is very minute , and on the whole very accurate . He indulges in gross exaggeration as to the height of the cataract , which , in the edition of 1683 , he states at five hundred feet , and raises to six hundred in that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four carriages to pass abreast under the American Fall without being wet . This is , of course , an exaggeration at the best ; but it is extremely probable that a great change has taken place since his time . He speaks of a small lateral fall at the west side of the Horse Shoe Fall which does not now exist . Table Rock , now destroyed , is distinctly figured in his picture . He says that he descended the cliffs on the west side to the foot of the cataract , but that no human being can get down on the east side . The name of Niagara , written Onguiaahra by Lalemant in 1641 , and Ongiara by Sanson , on his map of 1657 , is used by Hennepin in its present form . His description of the falls is the earliest known to exist . They are clearly indicated on the map of Champlain , 1632 . For early references to them , see " The Jesuits in North America , " 143 . A brief but curious notice of them is given by Gendron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The indefatigable Dr. O'Callaghan has discovered thirty-nine distinct forms of the name Niagara.  --  Index to Colonial Documents of New York , 465 . It is of Iroquois origin , and in the Mohawk dialect is pronounced Nyagarah . The explorers passed three miles beyond it , and encamped for the night on the banks of Chippewa Creek , scraping away the snow , which was a foot deep , in order to kindle a fire . In the morning they retraced their steps , startling a number of deer and wild turkeys on their way , and rejoined their companions at the mouth of the river . It was La Salle 's purpose to build a palisade fort at the mouth of the Niagara ; and the work was now begun , though it was necessary to use hot water to soften the frozen ground . But frost was not the only obstacle . The Senecas of the neighboring village betrayed a sullen jealousy at a design which , indeed , boded them no good . Niagara was the key to the four great lakes above , and whoever held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur-trade of the interior . Occupied by the French , it would , in time of peace , intercept the trade which the Iroquois carried on between the Western Indians , and the Dutch and English at Albany , and in time of war threaten them with serious danger . La Motte saw the necessity of conciliating these formidable neighbors , and , if possible , cajoling them to give their consent to the plan . La Salle , indeed , had instructed him to that effect . He resolved on a journey to the great village of the Senecas , and called on Hennepin , who was busied in building a bark chapel for himself , to accompany him . They accordingly set out with several men well armed and equipped , and bearing at their backs presents of very considerable value . The village was beyond the Genesee , south-east of the site of Rochester . Footnote : Near the town of Victor . It is laid down on the map of Galinee , and other unpublished maps . Compare Marshall , Historical Sketches of the Niagara Frontier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached it on the last day of December . They were conducted to the lodge of the great chief , where they were beset by a staring crowd of women , and children . Two Jesuits , Raffeix and Julien Garnier , were in the village ; and their presence boded no good for the embassy . La Motte , who seems to have had little love for priests of any kind , was greatly annoyed at seeing them ; and when the chiefs assembled to hear what he had to say , he insisted that the two fathers should leave the council-house . At this , Hennepin , out of respect for his cloth , thought it befitting that he should retire also . The chiefs , forty-two in number squatted on the ground , arrayed in ceremonial robes of beaver , wolf , or black squirrel skin . " The senators of Venice , " writes Hennepin , " do not look more grave or speak more deliberately than the counsellors of the Iroquois . " La Motte 's interpreter harangued the attentive conclave , placed gift after gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatchets , knives , and beads ,  - -  and used all his eloquence to persuade them that the building of a fort at the mouth of the Niagara , and a vessel on Lake Erie , were measures vital to their interest . They gladly took the gifts , but answered the interpreter 's speech with evasive generalities ; and having been entertained with the burning of an Indian prisoner , the discomfited embassy returned , half-famished , to Niagara . A few days after , Hennepin was near the shore of the lake , when he heard a well-known voice , and to his surprise saw La Salle approaching . This resolute child of misfortune had already begun to taste the bitterness of his destiny . Sailing with Tonty from Fort Frontenac , to bring supplies to the advanced party at Niagara , he had been detained by contrary winds when within a few hours of his destination . Anxious to reach it speedily , he left the vessel in charge of the pilot , who disobeyed his orders , and ended by wrecking it at a spot nine or ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envoye en 1693 sur la Decouverte du Mississippi et des Nations voisines , par le Sieur de la Salle , en 1678 , et depuis sa mort par le Sieur de Tonty . The published work bearing Tonty 's name is a compilation full of misstatements . He disowned its authorship . Its authority will not be relied on in this narrative . A copy of the true document from the original , signed by Tonty , in the Archives de la Marine , is before me . The provisions and merchandise were lost , though the crew saved the anchors and cables destined for the vessel which La Salle proposed to build for the navigation of the Upper Lakes . He had had a meeting with the Senecas , before the disaster ; and , more fortunate than La Motte ,  --  for his influence over Indians was great ,  --  had persuaded them to consent , for a time , to the execution of his plans . They required , however , that he should so far modify them as to content himself with a stockaded warehouse , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niagara . The loss of the vessel threw him into extreme perplexity , and , as Hennepin says , " would have made anybody but him give up the enterprise . " Footnote : Description de la Louisiane ( 1683 ) , 41 . It is characteristic of Hennepin , that , in the editions of his book published after La Salle 's death , he substitutes for " anybody but him , " " anybody but those who had formed so generous a design , " meaning to include himself , though he lost nothing by the disaster , and had not formed the design . The whole party were now gathered within the half-finished palisades of Niagara ; a motley crew of French , Flemings , and Italians , all mutually jealous . Some of the men had been tampered with by La Salle 's enemies . None of them seem to have had much heart for the enterprise . La Motte had gone back to Canada . He had been a soldier , and perhaps a good one ; but he had already broken down under the hardships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the choice of subordinates , had , perhaps , in all his company but one man in whom he could confidently trust ; and this was Tonty . He and Hennepin were on indifferent terms . Men thrown together in a rugged enterprise like this quickly learn to know each other ; and the vain and assuming friar was not likely to commend himself to La Salle 's brave and loyal lieutenant . Hennepin says that it was La Salle 's policy to govern through the dissensions of his followers ; and , from whatever cause , it is certain that those beneath him were rarely in perfect harmony . CHAPTER XI . 1679 . THE LAUNCH OF THE " GRIFFIN . " THE NIAGARA PORTAGE .  --  A VESSEL ON THE STOCKS .  --  SUFFERING AND DISCONTENT .  --  LA SALLE 'S WINTER JOURNEY .  --  THE VESSEL LAUNCHED .  --  FRESH DISASTERS . A more important work than that of the warehouse at the mouth of the river was now to be begun . This was the building of a vessel above the cataract . The small craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party had been hauled to the foot of the rapids at Lewiston , and drawn ashore with a capstan to save her from the drifting ice . Her lading was taken out , and must now be carried beyond the cataract to the calm water above . The distance to the destined point was at least twelve miles , and the steep heights above Lewiston must first be climbed . This heavy task was accomplished on the twenty-second of January . The level of the plateau was reached , and the file of burdened men , some thirty in number , toiled slowly on its way over the snowy plains and through the gloomy forests of spruce and naked oak trees ; while Hennepin plodded through the drifts with his portable altar lashed fast to his back . They came at last to the mouth of a stream which entered the Niagara two leagues above the cataract , and which was undoubtedly that now called Cayuga Creek . Footnote : It has been a matter of debate on which side of the Niagara the first vessel on the Upper Lakes was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful examination of the localities , have convinced me that the spot was that indicated above . Hennepin repeatedly alludes to a large detached rock rising out of the water at the foot of the rapids above Lewiston , on the west side of the river . This rock may still be seen , immediately under the western end of the Lewiston suspension-bridge . Persons living in the neighborhood remember that a ferry-boat used to pass between it and the cliffs of the western shore ; but it has since been undermined by the current and has inclined in that direction , so that a considerable part of it is submerged , while the gravel and earth thrown down from the cliff during the building of the bridge has filled the intervening channel . Opposite to this rock , and on the east side of the river , says Hennepin , are three mountains , about two leagues below the cataract.  --  Nouveau Voyage ( 1704 ) , 462 , 466 . To these " three mountains , " as well as to the rock , he frequently alludes . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates their position . They consist in the three successive grades of the acclivity : first , that which rises from the level of the water , forming the steep and lofty river bank ; next , an intermediate ascent , crowned by a sort of terrace , where the tired men could find a second resting-place and lay down their burdens , whence a third effort carried them with difficulty to the level top of the plateau . That this was the actual " portage " or carrying place of the travellers is shown by Hennepin ( 1704 ) , 114 , who describes the carrying of anchors and other heavy articles up these heights in August , 1679 . La Hontan also passed the falls by way of the " three mountains " eight years later .  --  La Hontan , ( 1703 ) , 106 . It is clear , then , that the portage was on the east side , whence it would be safe to conclude that the vessel was built on the same side . Hennepin says that she was built at the mouth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the falls . Excepting one or two small brooks , there is no stream on the west side but Chippewa Creek , which Hennepin had visited and correctly placed at about a league from the cataract . His distances on the Niagara are usually correct . On the east side there is a stream which perfectly answers the conditions . This is Cayuga Creek , two leagues above the Falls . Immediately in front of it is an island about a mile long , separated from the shore by a narrow and deep arm of the Niagara , into which Cayuga Creek discharges itself . The place is so obviously suited to building and launching a vessel , that , in the early part of this century , the government of the United States chose it for the construction of a schooner to carry supplies to the garrisons of the Upper Lakes . The neighboring village now bears the name of La Salle . In examining this and other localities on the Niagara , I have been greatly aided by my friend , O. H. Marshall , Esq. , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history and traditions of the Niagara frontier . Trees were felled , the place cleared , and the master-carpenter set his ship-builders at work . Meanwhile two Mohegan hunters , attached to the party , made bark wigwams to lodge the men . Hennepin had his chapel , apparently of the same material , where he placed his altar , and on Sundays and saints ' days said mass , preached , and exhorted ; while some of the men , who knew the Gregorian chant , lent their aid at the service . When the carpenters were ready to lay the keel of the vessel , La Salle asked the friar to drive the first bolt ; " but the modesty of my religious profession , " he says , " compelled me to decline this honor . " Fortunately , it was the hunting-season of the Iroquois , and most of the Seneca warriors were in the forests south of Lake Erie ; yet enough remained to cause serious uneasiness . They loitered sullenly about the place , expressing their displeasure at the proceedings of the French . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacksmith and tried to kill him ; but the Frenchman , brandishing a red-hot bar of iron , held him at bay till Hennepin ran to the rescue , when , as he declares , the severity of his rebuke caused the savage to desist . Footnote : Hennepin ( 1704 ) , 97 . On a paper drawn up at the instance of the Intendant Duchesneau , the names of the greater number of La Salle 's men are preserved . These agree with those given by Hennepin : thus the master-carpenter , whom he calls Maitre Moyse , appears as Moise Hillaret , and the blacksmith , whom he calls La Forge , is mentioned as  --  ( illegible ) dit la Forge . The work of the ship-builders advanced rapidly ; and when the Indian visitors beheld the vast ribs of the wooden monster , their jealousy was redoubled . A squaw told the French that they meant to burn the vessel on the stocks . All now stood anxiously on the watch . Cold , hunger , and discontent found imperfect antidotes in Tonty 's energy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lieutenant commanded in his place . Hennepin says that Tonty was jealous because he , the friar , kept a journal , and that he was forced to use all manner of just precautions to prevent the Italian from seizing it . The men , being half-starved in consequence of the loss of their provisions on Lake Ontario , were restless and moody ; and their discontent was fomented by one of their number , who had very probably been tampered with by La Salle 's enemies . Footnote : " This bad man " says Hennepin , " would infallibly have debauched our workmen , if I had not reassured them by the exhortations which I made them on Fete Days and Sundays , after divine service . " ( 1704 ) , 98 . The Senecas refused to supply them with corn , and the frequent exhortations of the Recollet father proved an insufficient substitute . In this extremity , the two Mohegans did excellent service ; bringing deer and other game , which relieved the most pressing wants of the party and went far to restore their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way back on foot to Fort Frontenac , a distance of some two hundred and fifty miles , through the snow-encumbered forests of the Iroquois and over the ice of Lake Ontario . The wreck of his vessel made it necessary that fresh supplies should be sent to Niagara ; and the condition of his affairs , embarrassed by the great expenses of the enterprise , demanded his presence at Fort Frontenac . Two men attended him , and a dog dragged his baggage on a sledge . For food , they had only a bag of parched corn , which failed them two days before they reached the fort ; and they made the rest of the journey fasting . During his absence , Tonty finished the vessel , which was of about forty-five tons burden . Footnote : Hennepin ( 1683 ) , 46 . In the edition of 1697 , he says that it was of sixty tons . I prefer to follow the earlier and more trustworthy narrative . As spring opened , she was ready for launching . The friar pronounced his blessing on her ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and French and Indians , warmed alike by a generous gift of brandy , shouted and yelped in chorus as she glided into the Niagara . Her builders towed her out and anchored her in the stream , safe at last from incendiary hands , and then , swinging their hammocks under her deck , slept in peace , beyond reach of the tomahawk . The Indians gazed on her with amazement . Five small cannon looked out from her portholes ; and on her prow was carved a portentous monster , the Griffin , whose name she bore , in honor of the armorial bearings of Frontenac . La Salle had often been heard to say that he would make the griffin fly above the crows , or , in other words , make Frontenac triumph over the Jesuits . They now took her up the river , and made her fast below the swift current at Black Rock . Here they finished her equipment , and waited for La Salle 's return ; but the absent commander did not appear . The spring and more than half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At length , early in August , he arrived at the mouth of the Niagara , bringing three more friars ; for , though no friend of the Jesuits , he was zealous for the Faith , and was rarely without a missionary in his journeyings . Like Hennepin , the three friars were all Flemings . One of them , Melithon Watteau , was to remain at Niagara ; the others , Zenobe Membre and Gabriel Ribourde , were to preach the Faith among the tribes of the West . Ribourde was a hale and cheerful old man of sixty-four . He went four times up and down the Lewiston heights , while the men were climbing the steep pathway with their loads . It required four of them , well stimulated with brandy , to carry up the principal anchor destined for the " Griffin . " La Salle brought a tale of disaster . His enemies , bent on ruining the enterprise , had given out that he was embarked on a harebrained venture , from which he would never return . His creditors , excited by rumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his property in the settled parts of Canada , though his seigniory of Fort Frontenac alone would have more than sufficed to pay all his debts . There was no remedy . To defer the enterprise would have been to give his adversaries the triumph that they sought ; and he hardened himself against the blow with his usual stoicism .

The " Griffin " had lain moored by the shore , so near that Hennepin could preach on Sundays from the deck to the men encamped along the bank . She was now forced up against the current with tow-ropes and sails , till she reached the calm entrance of Lake Erie . On the seventh of August , the voyagers , thirty-four in all , embarked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh breeze sprang up ; and with swelling canvas the " Griffin " ploughed the virgin waves of Lake Erie , where sail was never seen before . For three days they held their course over these unknown waters , and on the fourth turned northward into the strait of Detroit . Here , on the right hand and on the left , lay verdant prairies , dotted with groves and bordered with lofty forests . They saw walnut , chestnut , and wild plum trees , and oaks festooned with grape-vines ; herds of deer , and flocks of swans and wild turkeys . The bulwarks of the " Griffin " were plentifully hung with game which the men killed on shore , and among the rest with a number of bears , much commended by Hennepin for their want of ferocity and the excellence of their flesh . " Those , " he says , " who will one day have the happiness to possess this fertile and pleasant strait , will be very much obliged to those who have shown them the way . " They crossed Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which the present name is a perversion. and still sailed northward against the current , till now , sparkling in the sun , Lake Huron spread before them like a sea . For a time , they bore on prosperously . Then the wind died to a calm , then freshened to a gale , then rose to a furious tempest ; and the vessel tossed wildly among the short , steep , perilous waves of the raging lake . Even La Salle called on his followers to commend themselves to Heaven . All fell to their prayers but the godless pilot , who was loud in complaint against his commander for having brought him , after the honor he had won on the ocean , to drown at last ignominiously in fresh water . The rest clamored to the saints . St. Anthony of Padua was promised a chapel to be built in his honor , if he would but save them from their jeopardy ; while in the same breath La Salle and the friars declared him patron of their great enterprise . Footnote : Hennepin ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The obedient winds were tamed ; and the " Griffin " plunged on her way through foaming surges that still grew calmer as she advanced . Now the sun shone forth on woody islands , Bois Blanc and Mackinaw and the distant Manitoulins ,  --  on the forest wastes of Michigan and the vast blue bosom of the angry lake ; and now her port was won , and she found her rest behind the point of St. Ignace of Michillimackinac , floating in that tranquil cove where crystal waters cover but can not hide the pebbly depths beneath . Before her rose the house and chapel of the Jesuits , enclosed with palisades ; on the right , the Huron village , with its bark cabins and its fence of tall pickets ; on the left , the square compact houses of the French traders ; and , not far off , the clustered wigwams of an Ottawa village . Footnote : There is a rude plan of the establishment in La Hontan , though , in several editions , its value is destroyed by the reversal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a centre of the Indian trade ; and here , under the shadow of the cross , was much sharp practice in the service of Mammon . Keen traders , with or without a license ; and lawless coureurs de bois , whom a few years of forest life had weaned from civilization , made St. Ignace their resort ; and here there were many of them when the " Griffin " came . They and their employers hated and feared La Salle , who , sustained as he was by the Governor , might set at nought the prohibition of the king , debarring him from traffic with these tribes . Yet , while plotting against him , they took pains to allay his distrust by a show of welcome . The " Griffin " fired her cannon , and the Indians yelped in wonder and amazement . The adventurers landed in state , and marched , under arms , to the bark chapel of the Ottawa village , where they heard mass . La Salle knelt before the altar , in a mantle of scarlet , bordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him ,  --  black Jesuits , gray Recollets , swarthy voyageurs and painted savages ; a devout but motley concourse . As they left the chapel , the Ottawa chiefs came to bid them welcome , and the Hurons saluted them with a volley of musketry . They saw the " Griffin " at her anchorage , surrounded by more than a hundred bark canoes , like a Triton among minnows . Yet it was with more wonder than good-will that the Indians of the mission gazed on the floating fort , for so they called the vessel . A deep jealousy of La Salle 's designs had been , infused into them . His own followers , too , had been tampered with . In the autumn before , it may be remembered , he had sent fifteen men up the lakes , to trade for him , with orders to go thence to the Illinois , and make preparation against his coming . Early in the summer , Tonty had been despatched in a canoe , from Niagara , to look after them . Footnote : Tonty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the " Griffin . " It was high time . Most of the men had been seduced from their duty , and had disobeyed their orders , squandered the goods intrusted to them , or used them in trading on their own account . La Salle found four of them at Michillimackinac . These he arrested , and sent Tonty to the Falls of Ste. Marie , where two others were captured , with their plunder . The rest were in the woods , and it was useless to pursue them . Early in September , long before Tonty had returned from Ste. Marie , La Salle set sail again , and , passing westward into Lake Michigan , Footnote : Then usually known as Lac des Illinois , because it gave access to the country of the tribes so called .

Here , too , he found several of his advanced party , who had remained faithful , and collected a large store of furs . It would have been better had they proved false , like the rest . La Salle , who asked counsel of no man , resolved , in spite of his followers , to send back the " Griffin , " laden with these furs , and others collected on the way , to satisfy his creditors . Footnote : In the license of discovery , granted to La Salle , he is expressly prohibited from trading with the Ottawas and others who brought furs to Montreal .

La Salle , with the fourteen men who remained , in four canoes , deeply laden with a forge , tools , merchandise , and arms , put out from the island and resumed his voyage . The parting was not auspicious . The lake , glassy and calm in the afternoon , was convulsed at night with a sudden storm , when the canoes were midway between the island and the main shore . It was with much ado that they could keep together , the men shouting to each other through the darkness .

The gale raged meanwhile with a relentless fury . They trembled when they thought of the " Griffin . " When at length the tempest lulled , they re-embarked , and steered southward , along the shore of Wisconsin ; but again the storm fell upon them , and drove them , for safety , to a bare , rocky islet . Here they made a fire of driftwood , crouched around it , drew their blankets over their heads , and in this miserable plight , pelted with sleet and rain , remained for two days . At length they were afloat again ; but their prosperity was brief . On the twenty-eighth , a fierce squall drove them to a point of rocks , covered with bushes , where they consumed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of October , they paddled about thirty miles , without food , when they came to a village of Pottawattamies , who ran down to the shore to help them to land ; but La Salle , fearing that some of his men would steal the merchandise and desert to the Indians , insisted on going three leagues farther , to the great indignation of his followers . The lake , swept by an easterly gale , was rolling its waves against the beach , like the ocean in a storm . In the attempt to land , La Salle 's canoe was nearly swamped . He and his three canoe-men leaped into the water , and , in spite of the surf , which nearly drowned them , dragged their vessel ashore , with all its load . He then went to the rescue of Hennepin , who , with his awkward companion , was in woful need of succor . Father Gabriel , with his sixty-four years , was no match for the surf and the violent undertow . Hennepin , finding himself safe , waded to his relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the old friar , though drenched to the skin , laughed gayly under his cowl , as his brother missionary staggered with him up the beach . Footnote : Hennepin ( 1683 ) , 79 . When all were safe ashore , La Salle , who distrusted the Indians they had passed , took post on a hill , and ordered his followers to prepare their guns for action . Nevertheless , as they were starving , an effort must be risked to gain a supply of food ; and he sent three men hack to the village to purchase it . Well armed , but faint with toil and famine , they made their way through the stormy forest , bearing a pipe of peace ; but on arriving saw that the scared inhabitants had fled . They found , however , a stock of corn , of which they took a portion , leaving goods in exchange , and then set out on their return . Meanwhile , about twenty of the warriors , armed with bows and arrows , approached the camp of the French , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of his men , opened a parley with them , and kept them seated at the foot of the hill till his three messengers returned , when , on seeing the peace-pipe , the warriors set up a cry of joy . In the morning , they brought more corn to the camp , with a supply of fresh venison , not a little cheering to the exhausted Frenchmen , who , in dread of treachery , had stood under arms all night . This was no journey of pleasure . The lake was ruffled with almost ceaseless storms ; clouds big with rain above ; a turmoil of gray and gloomy waves beneath . Every night the canoes must be shouldered through the breakers and dragged up the steep banks , which , as they neared the site of Milwaukee , became almost insurmountable . The men paddled all day , with no other food than a handful of Indian corn . They were spent with toil , sick with the haws and wild berries which they ravenously devoured , and dejected at the prospect before them . Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several times , from famine and fatigue , but was revived by a certain " confection of Hyacinth , " administered by Hennepin , who had a small box of this precious specific . At length they descried , at a distance , on the stormy shore , two or three eagles among a busy congregation of crows or turkey-buzzards . They paddled in all haste to the spot . The feasters took flight ; and the starved travellers found the mangled body of a deer , lately killed by the wolves . This good luck proved the inauguration of plenty . As they approached the head of the lake , game grew abundant ; and , with the aid of the Mohegan , there was no lack of bear 's meat and venison . They found wild grapes , too , in the woods , and gathered them by cutting down the trees to which the vines clung . While thus employed , they were startled by a sight often so fearful in the waste and the wilderness , the print of a human foot . It was clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept , not , as it proved , without cause ; for that night , while the sentry thought of little but screening himself and his gun from the floods of rain , a party of Outagamies crept under the bank , where they lurked for some time before he discovered them . Being challenged , they came forward , professing great friendship , and pretending to have mistaken the French for Iroquois . In the morning , however , there was an outcry from La Salle 's servant , who declared that the visitors had stolen his coat from under the inverted canoe where he had placed it ; while some of the carpenters also complained of being robbed . La Salle well knew that if the theft were left unpunished , worse would come of it . First , he posted his men at the woody point of a peninsula , whose sandy neck was interposed between them and the main forest . Then he went forth , pistol in hand , met a young Outagami , seized him , and led him prisoner to his camp . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Outagami chief ,  --  for the wigwams were not far distant ,  - -  to whom he told what he had done , adding that unless the stolen goods were restored , the prisoner should be killed . The Indians were in perplexity , for they had cut the coat to pieces and divided it . In this dilemma , they resolved , being strong in numbers , to rescue their comrade by force . Accordingly , they came down to the edge of the forest , or posted themselves behind fallen trees on the banks , while La Salle 's men in their stronghold braced their nerves for the fight . Here three Flemish friars , with their rosaries , and eleven Frenchmen , with their guns , confronted a hundred and twenty screeching Outagamies . Hennepin , who had seen service , and who had always an exhortation at his tongue 's end , busied himself to inspire the rest with a courage equal to his own . Neither party , however , had an appetite for the fray . A parley ensued : full compensation was made for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a gift of beaver-skins . Their late enemies , now become friends , spent the next day in dances , feasts , and speeches . They entreated La Salle not to advance further , since the Illinois , through whose country he must pass , would be sure to kill him ; for , added these friendly counsellors , they hated the French because they had been instigating the Iroquois to invade their country . Here was a new subject of anxiety . La Salle thought that he saw in it another device of his busy and unscrupulous enemies , intriguing among the Illinois for his destruction . He pushed on , however , circling around the southern shore of Lake Michigan , till he reached the mouth of the St. Joseph , called by him the Miamis . Here Tonty was to have rejoined him , with twenty men , making his way from Michillimackinac , along the eastern shore of the lake : but the rendezvous was a solitude ; Tonty was nowhere to be seen . It was the first of November . Winter was at hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men clamored to go forward , urging that they should starve if they could not reach the villages of the Illinois before the tribe scattered for the winter hunt . La Salle was inexorable . If they should all desert , he said , he , with his Mohegan hunter and the three friars , would still remain and wait for Tonty . The men grumbled , but obeyed ; and , to divert their thoughts , he set them at building a fort of timber , on a rising ground at the mouth of the river . They had spent twenty days at this task , and their work was well advanced , when at length Tonty appeared . He brought with him only half of his men . Provisions had failed ; and the rest of his party had been left thirty leagues behind , to sustain themselves by hunting . La Salle told him to return and hasten them forward . He set out with two men . A violent north wind arose . He tried to run his canoe ashore through the breakers . The two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand could not help them . She swamped , rolling over in the surf . Guns , baggage , and provisions were lost ; and the three voyagers returned to the Miamis , subsisting on acorns by the way .

Thus was one heavy load lifted from the heart of La Salle . But where was the " Griffin " ? Time enough , and more than enough , had passed for her voyage to Niagara and back again . He scanned the dreary horizon with an anxious eye . No returning sail gladdened the watery solitude , and a dark foreboding gathered on his heart . Yet farther delay was impossible . He sent back two men to Michillimackinac to meet her , if she still existed , and pilot her to his new fort of the Miamis , and then prepared to ascend the river , whose weedy edges were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1679-1680 .

On the third of December , the party re-embarked , thirty-three in all , in eight canoes , Footnote : Lettre de Duchesneau a  --  , 10 Nov. 1680 , MS. and ascended the chill current of the St. Joseph , bordered with dreary meadows and bare gray forests . When they approached the site of the present village of South Bend , they looked anxiously along the shore on their right to find the portage or path leading to the headquarters of the Illinois . The Mohegan was absent , hunting ; and , unaided by his practised eye , they passed the path without seeing it . La Salle landed to search the woods . Hours passed , and he did not return . Hennepin and Tonty grew uneasy , disembarked , bivouacked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scour the country . Night came , but not their lost leader . Muffled in their blankets and powdered by the thick-falling snowflakes , they sat ruefully speculating as to what had befallen him ; nor was it till four o'clock of the next afternoon that they saw him approaching along the margin of the river . His face and hands were besmirched with charcoal ; and he was farther decorated with two opossums which hung from his belt and which he had killed with a stick as they were swinging head downwards from the bough of a tree , after the fashion of that singular beast . He had missed his way in the forest , and had been forced to make a wide circuit around the edge of a swamp ; while the snow , of which the air was full , added to his perplexities . Thus he pushed on through the rest of the day and the greater part of the night , till , about two o'clock in the morning , he reached the river again and fired his gun as a signal to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way along the bank , when he presently saw the gleam of a fire among the dense thickets close at hand . Not doubting that he had found the bivouac of his party , he hastened to the spot . To his surprise , no human being was to be seen . Under a tree beside the fire was a heap of dry grass impressed with the form of a man who must have fled but a moment before , for his couch was still warm . It was no doubt an Indian , ambushed on the bank , watching to kill some passing enemy . La Salle called out in several Indian languages ; but there was dead silence all around . He then , with admirable coolness , took possession of the quarters he had found , shouting to their invisible proprietor that he was about to sleep in his bed ; piled a barricade of bushes around the spot , rekindled the dying fire , warmed his benumbed hands , stretched himself on the dried grass , and slept undisturbed till morning . The Mohegan had rejoined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid the portage was soon found . Here the party encamped . La Salle , who was excessively fatigued , occupied , together with Hennepin , a wigwam covered in the Indian manner with mats of reeds . The cold forced them to kindle a fire , which before daybreak set the mats in a blaze ; and the two sleepers narrowly escaped being burned along with their hut . In the morning , the party shouldered their canoes and baggage , and began their march for the sources of the River Illinois , some five miles distant . Around them stretched a desolate plain , half-covered with snow , and strewn with the skulls and bones of buffalo ; while , on its farthest verge , they could see the lodges of the Miami Indians , who had made this place their abode . They soon reached a spot where the oozy saturated soil quaked beneath their tread . All around were clumps of alderbushes , tufts of rank grass , and pools of glistening water . In the midst , a dark and lazy current , which a tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weeds and rushes . Here were the sources of the Kankakee , one of the heads of the Illinois . Footnote : The Kankakee was called at this time the Theakiki , or Haukiki ( Marest ) ; a name , which , as Charlevoix says , was afterwards corrupted by the French to Kiakiki , whence , probably , its present form . In La Salle 's time , the name Theakiki was given to the River Illinois , through all its course . It was also called the Riviere Seignelay , the Riviere des Macopins , and the Riviere Divine , or Riviere de la Divine . The latter name , when Charlevoix visited the country in 1721 , was confined to the northern branch . He gives an interesting and somewhat graphic account of the portage and the sources of the Kankakee , in his letter dated De la Source du Theakiki , ce dix-sept Septembre , 1721 . Why the Illinois should ever have been called the Divine , it is not easy to see . The Memoirs of St. Simon suggest an explanation . Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells us , lived together in apartments at the Arsenal , where they held their salon and exercised a great power in society . They were called at court les Divines.  --  St. Simon , v. 835 ( Cheruel ) . In compliment to Frontenac , the river may have been named after his wife or her friend . The suggestion is due to M. Margry . I have seen a map by Raudin , Frontenac 's engineer , on which the river is called " Riviere de la Divine ou l'Outrelaise . " They set their canoes on this thread of water , embarked their baggage and themselves , and pushed down the sluggish streamlet , looking , at a little distance , like men who sailed on land . Fed by an unceasing tribute of the spongy soil , it quickly widened to a river ; and they floated on their way through a voiceless , lifeless solitude of dreary oak barrens , or boundless marshes overgrown with reeds . At night , they built their fire on ground made firm by frost , and bivouacked among the rushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region . On the right hand and on the left stretched the boundless prairie , dotted with leafless groves and bordered by gray wintry forests ; scorched by the fires kindled in the dried grass by Indian hunters , and strewn with the carcasses and the bleached skulls of innumerable buffalo . The plains were scored with their pathways , and the muddy edges of the river were full of their hoof-prints . Yet not one was to be seen . At night , the horizon glowed with distant fires ; and by day the savage hunters could be descried at times roaming on the verge of the prairie . The men , discontented and half-starved , would have deserted to them had they dared . La Salle 's Mohegan could kill no game except two lean deer , with a few wild geese and swans . At length , in their straits , they made a happy discovery . It was a buffalo bull , fast mired in a slough . They killed him , lashed a cable about him , and then twelve men dragged out the shaggy monster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember to have seen an incident precisely similar , many years ago , on the Upper Arkansas . In this case , however , it was impossible to drag the bull from the mire . Though hopelessly entangled , he made furious plunges at his assailants before being shot . Hennepin 's account of the buffalo , which he afterwards had every opportunity of seeing , is interesting and true . The scene changed again as they descended . On either hand ran ranges of woody hills , following the course of the river ; and when they mounted to their tops , they saw beyond them a rolling sea of dull green prairie , a boundless pasture of the buffalo and the deer , in our own day strangely transformed ,  --  yellow in harvest time with ripened wheat , and dotted with the roofs of a hardy and valiant yeomanry . Footnote : The change is very recent . Within the memory of men still young , wolves and deer , besides wild swans , wild turkeys , cranes , and pelicans , abounded in this region . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the window of a farm-house near the present town of La Salle . Running wolves on horseback was his favorite amusement in this part of the country . The buffalo long ago disappeared , but the early settlers found frequent remains of them . Mr. James Clark , of Utica , Ill. , told me that he once found a large quantity of their bones and skulls in one place , as if a herd had perished in the snow-drifts . They passed the site of the future town of Ottawa , and saw on their right the high plateau of Buffalo Rock , long a favorite dwelling-place of Indians . A league below , the river glided among islands bordered with stately woods . Close on their left towered a lofty cliff , Footnote : " Starved Rock . " It will hold , hereafter , a conspicuous place in the narrative. crested with trees that overhung the rippling current ; while before them spread the valley of the Illinois , in broad low meadows , bordered on the right by the graceful hills at whose foot now lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then tenanted the valley . Along the right bank of the river were clustered the lodges of a great Indian town . Hennepin counted four hundred and sixty of them . Footnote : La Louisiane , 137 . Allouez ( Relation , 1673-9 ) found three hundred and fifty-one lodges . This was in 1677 . The population of this town , which embraced five or six distinct tribes of the Illinois , was continually changing . In 1675 , Marquette addressed here an auditory composed of five hundred chiefs and old men , and fifteen hundred young men , besides women and children . He estimates the number of fires at five or six hundred .  - -  Voyages de Pere Marquette , 98 ( Lenox ) . Membre , who was here in 1680 , says that it then contained seven or eight thousand souls .  --  Membre , in Le Clercq , Premier Etablissement de la Foy , ii . 173 . On the remarkable manuscript map of Franquelin , 1684 , it is set down at twelve hundred warriors , or about six thousand souls . This was after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rasle reported upwards of twenty-four hundred families .  --  Lettre a son Frere in Lettres Edifiantes . At times , nearly the whole Illinois population was gathered here . At other times , the several tribes that composed it separated , some dwelling apart from the rest ; so that at one period the Illinois formed eleven villages , while at others they were gathered into two , of which this was much the largest . The meadows around it were extensively cultivated , yielding large crops , chiefly of Indian corn . The lodges were built along the river bank , for a distance of a mile and sometimes far more . In their shape , though not in their material , they resembled those of the Hurons . There were no palisades or embankments . This neighborhood abounds in Indian relics . The village graveyard appears to have been on a rising ground , near the river , immediately in front of the town of Utica . This is the only part of the river bottom , from this point to the Mississippi , not liable to inundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a farm occupied by a tenant of Mr. James Clark . Both Mr. Clark and his tenant informed me that every year great quantities of human bones and teeth were turned up here by the plough . Many implements of stone are also found , together with beads and other ornaments of Indian and European fabric . In shape , they were somewhat like the arched top of a baggage wagon . They were built of a framework of poles , covered with mats of rushes , closely interwoven ; and each contained three or four fires , of which the greater part served for two families . Here , then , was the town ; but where were the inhabitants ? All was silent as the desert . The lodges were empty , the fires dead , and the ashes cold . La Salle had expected this ; for he knew that in the autumn the Illinois always left their towns for their winter hunting , and that the time of their return had not yet come . Yet he was not the less embarrassed , for he would fain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followers . Some of them , searching the deserted town , presently found the caches , or covered pits , in which the Indians hid their stock of corn . This was precious beyond measure in their eyes , and to touch it would be a deep offence . La Salle shrank from provoking their anger , which might prove the ruin of his plans ; but his necessity overcame his prudence , and he took twenty minots of corn , hoping to appease the owners by presents . Thus provided , the party embarked again , and resumed their downward voyage . On New-Year 's day , 1680 , they landed and heard mass . Then Hennepin wished a happy new year to La Salle first , and afterwards to all the men , making them a speech , which , as he tells us , was " most touching . " Footnote : " Les paroles les plus touchantes . " Hennepin ( 1683 ) , 139 . The later editions add the modest qualification , " que je pus . " He and his two brethren next embraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " writes the father , " most tender and affectionate , " exhorting them , at the same time , to patience , faith , and constancy . Two days after these solemnities , they reached the long expansion of the river , then called Pimitoui , and now known as Peoria Lake , and leisurely made their way downward to the site of the city of Peoria . Footnote : Peoria was the name of one of the tribes of the Illinois . Hennepin says that they crossed the lake four days after leaving the village , which last , as appears by a comparison of his narrative with that of Tonty , must have been on the thirtieth of December . Here , as evening drew near , they saw a faint spire of smoke curling above the gray , wintry forest , betokening that Indians were at hand . La Salle , as we have seen , had been warned that these tribes had been taught to regard him as their enemy ; and when , in the morning , he resumed his course , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached each other ; and the Illinois was once more a river , bordered on either hand with overhanging woods . Footnote : At least it is so now at this place . Perhaps in La Salle 's time it was not wholly so , for there is evidence in various parts of the West that the forest has made considerable encroachments on the open country . At nine o'clock , doubling a point , he saw about eighty Illinois wigwams , on both sides of the river . He instantly ordered the eight canoes to be ranged in line , abreast , across the stream ; Tonty on the right , and he himself on the left . The men laid down their paddles and seized their weapons ; while , in this warlike guise , the current bore them swiftly into the midst of the surprised and astounded savages . The camps were in a panic . Warriors whooped and howled ; squaws and children screeched in chorus . Some snatched their bows and war-clubs ; some ran in terror ; and , in the midst of the hubbub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . None knew better how to deal with Indians ; and he made no sign of friendship , knowing that it might be construed as a token of fear . His little knot of Frenchmen stood , gun in hand , passive , yet prepared for battle . The Indians , on their part , rallying a little from their fright , made all haste to proffer peace . Two of their chiefs came forward , holding forth the calumet ; while another began a loud harangue , to check the young warriors who were aiming their arrows from the farther bank . La Salle , responding to these friendly overtures , displayed another calumet ; while Hennepin caught several scared children and soothed them with winning blandishments . Footnote : Hennepin ( 1683 ) , 142 . The uproar was quelled , and the strangers were presently seated in the midst of the camp , beset by a throng of wild and swarthy figures . Food was placed before them ; and , as the Illinois code of courtesy enjoined , their entertainers conveyed the morsels with their own hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while others rubbed their feet with bear 's grease . La Salle , on his part , made them a gift of tobacco and hatchets ; and , when he had escaped from their caresses , rose and harangued them . He told them that he had been forced to take corn from their granaries , lest his men should die of hunger ; but he prayed them not to be offended , promising full restitution or ample payment . He had come , he said , to protect them against their enemies , and teach them to pray to the true God . As for the Iroquois , they were subjects of the Great King , and , therefore , brethren of the French ; yet , nevertheless , should they begin a war and invade their country , he would stand by the Illinois , give them guns , and fight in their defence , if they would permit him to build a fort among them for the security of his men . It was , also , he added , his purpose to build a great wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , and then return , bringing them the goods of which they stood in need ; but if they would not consent to his plans , and sell provisions to his men , he would pass on to the Osages , who would then reap all the benefits of intercourse with the French , while they were left destitute , at the mercy of the Iroquois . Footnote : Hennepin ( 1683 ) , 144-149 . The later editions omit a part of the above . This threat had its effect , for it touched their deep-rooted jealousy of the Osages . They were lavish of promises , and feasts and dances consumed the day . Yet La Salle soon learned that the intrigues of his enemies were still pursuing him . That evening , unknown to him , a stranger appeared in the Illinois camp . He was a Mascoutin chief , named Monso , attended by five or six Miamis , and bringing a gift of knives , hatchets , and kettles to the Illinois . The chiefs assembled in a secret nocturnal session , where , smoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harangue of the envoys . Monso told them that he had come in behalf of certain Frenchmen , whom he named , to warn his hearers against the designs of La Salle , whom he denounced as a partisan and spy of the Iroquois , affirming that he was now on his way to stir up the tribes beyond the Mississippi to join in a war against the Illinois , who , thus assailed from the east and from the west , would be utterly destroyed . There was no hope for them , he added , but in checking the farther progress of La Salle , or , at least , retarding it , thus causing his men to desert him . Having thrown his firebrand , Monso and his party left the camp in haste , dreading to be confronted with the object of their aspersions . Footnote : Hennepin ( 1683 ) , 151 , ( 1704 ) , 205 . Le Clercq , ii . 157 . Memoire du Voyage de M. de la Salle , MS . This is a paper appended to Frontenac 's Letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a translation of it in the English edition of his later work . It charges the Jesuit Allouez with being at the bottom of the intrigue . La Salle had a special distrust of this missionary , who , on his part , always shunned a meeting with him . In another memoir , addressed to Frontenac in 1680 , La Salle states fully his conviction that Allouez , who was then , he says , among the Miamis , had induced them to send Monso on his sinister errand . See the memoir in Thomassy , Geologie , Pratique de la Louisiane , 203 . The account of the affair of Monso in the spurious work bearing Tonty 's name is mere romance . In the morning , La Salle saw a change in the behavior of his hosts . They looked on him askance , cold , sullen , and suspicious . There was one Omawha , a chief , whose favor he had won the day before by the politic gift of two hatchets and three knives , and who now came to him in secret to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Salle at once saw in it a device of his enemies ; and this belief was confirmed , when , in the afternoon , Nicanope , brother of the head chief , sent to invite the Frenchmen to a feast . They repaired to his lodge ; but before dinner was served ,  --  that is to say , while the guests , white and red , were seated on mats , each with his hunting-knife in his hand , and the wooden bowl before him , which was to receive his share of the bear 's or buffalo 's meat , or the corn boiled in fat , with which he was to be regaled ; while such was the posture of the company , their host arose and began a long speech . He told the Frenchmen that he had invited them to his lodge less to refresh their bodies with good cheer than to cure their minds of the dangerous purpose which possessed them , of descending the Mississippi . Its shores , he said , were beset by savage tribes , against whose numbers and ferocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by serpents , alligators , and unnatural monsters ; while the river itself , after raging among rocks and whirlpools , plunged headlong at last into a fathomless gulf , which would swallow them and their vessel for ever . La Salle 's men were , for the most part , raw hands , knowing nothing of the wilderness , and easily alarmed at its dangers ; but there were two among them , old coureurs de bois , who , unfortunately , knew too much ; for they understood the Indian orator , and explained his speech to the rest . As La Salle looked around on the circle of his followers , he read an augury of fresh trouble in their disturbed and rueful visages . He waited patiently , however , till the speaker had ended , and then answered him , through his interpreter , with great composure . First , he thanked him for the friendly warning which his affection had impelled him to utter ; but , he continued , the greater the danger , the greater the honor ; and even if the danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But were not the Illinois jealous ? Had they not been deluded by lies ? " We were not asleep , my brother , when Monso came to tell you , under cover of night , that we were spies of the Iroquois . The presents he gave you , that you might believe his falsehoods , are at this moment buried in the earth under this lodge . If he told the truth , why did he skulk away in the dark ? Why did he not show himself by day ? Do you not see that when we first came among you , and your camp was all in confusion , we could have killed you without needing help from the Iroquois ? And now , while I am speaking , could we not put your old men to death , while your young warriors are all gone away to hunt ? If we meant to make war on you , we should need no help from the Iroquois , who have so often felt the force of our arms . Look at what we have brought you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tools , for your good . If you still harbor evil thoughts of us , be frank as we are , and speak them boldly . Go after this impostor , Monso , and bring him back , that we may answer him , face to face ; for he never saw either us or the Iroquois , and what can he know of the plots that he pretends to reveal ? " Footnote : The above is a paraphrase , with some condensation , from Hennepin , whose account is sustained by the other writers . Nicanope had nothing to reply , and , grunting assent in the depths of his throat , made a sign that the feast should proceed . The French were lodged in huts , near the Indian camp ; and , fearing treachery , La Salle placed a guard at night . On the morning after the feast , he came out into the frosty air , and looked about him for the sentinels . Not one of them was to be seen . Vexed and alarmed , he entered hut after hut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including two of the best carpenters , were nowhere to be found . Discontented and mutinous from the first , and now terrified by the fictions of Nicanope , they had deserted , preferring the hardships of the midwinter forest to the mysterious terrors of the Mississippi . La Salle mustered the rest before him , and inveighed sternly against the cowardice and baseness of those who had thus abandoned him , regardless of his many favors . If any here , he added , are afraid , let them but wait till the spring , and they shall have free leave to return to Canada , safely and without dishonor . Footnote : Hennepin ( 1683 ) , 162.  --  Declaration faite par Moyse Hillaret , charpentier de barque , cy devant au service du Sr. de la Salle , MS . This desertion cut him to the heart . It showed him that he was leaning on a broken reed ; and he felt that , on an enterprise full of doubt and peril , there were scarcely four men in his party whom he could trust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for here , as at Fort Frontenac , an attempt was made to kill him . Tonty tells us that poison was placed in the pot in which their food was cooked , and that La Salle was saved by an antidote which some of his friends had given him before he left France . This , it will be remembered , was an epoch of poisoners . It was in the following month that the notorious La Voisin was burned alive , at Paris , for practices to which many of the highest nobility were charged with being privy , not excepting some in whose veins ran the blood of the gorgeous spendthrift who ruled the destinies of France . Footnote : The equally famous Brinvilliers was burned four years before . An account of both will be found in the Letters of Madame de Sevigne . The memoirs of the time abound in evidence of the frightful prevalence of these practices , and the commotion which they excited in all ranks of society . In these early French enterprises in the West , it was to the last degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wilderness , completely freed from the sharp restraints of authority in which they had passed their lives , a spirit of lawlessness broke out among them with a violence proportioned to the pressure which had hitherto controlled it . Discipline had no resources and no guarantee ; while those outlaws of the forest , the coureurs de bois , were always before their eyes , a standing example of unbridled license . La Salle , eminently skilful in his dealings with Indians , was rarely so happy with his own countrymen ; and yet the desertions from which he was continually suffering were due far more to the inevitable difficulty of his position than to any want of conduct . CHAPTER XIV . 1680 . FORT CREVECOEUR . BUILDING OF THE FORT .  --  LOSS OF THE " GRIFFIN . "  --  A BOLD RESOLUTION .  --  ANOTHER VESSEL .  --  HENNEPIN SENT TO THE MISSISSIPPI .  --  DEPARTURE OF LA SALLE . La Salle now resolved to leave the Indian camp , and fortify himself for the winter in a strong position , where his men would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold his ground against an outbreak of the Illinois or an Iroquois invasion . At the middle of January , a thaw broke up the ice which had closed the river ; and he set out in a canoe , with Hennepin , to visit the site he had chosen for his projected fort . It was half a league below the camp , on a little hill , or knoll , two hundred yards from the southern bank . On either side was a deep ravine , and , in front , a low ground , overflowed at high water . Thither , then , the party was removed . They dug a ditch behind the hill , connecting the two ravines , and thus completely isolating it . The hill was nearly square in form . An embankment of earth was thrown up on every side : its declivities were sloped steeply down to the bottom of the ravines and the ditch , and further guarded by chevaux-de-frise ; while a palisade , twenty-five feet high , was planted around the whole . The men were lodged in huts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cabin of planks for La Salle and Tonty , and another for the three friars ; while the blacksmith had his shed and forge in the rear . Hennepin laments the failure of wine , which prevented him from saying mass ; but every morning and evening he summoned the men to his cabin , to listen to prayers and preaching , and on Sundays and fete days they chanted vespers . Father Zenobe usually spent the day in the Indian camp , striving , with very indifferent success , to win them to the faith , and to overcome the disgust with which their manners and habits inspired him . Such was the first civilized occupation of the region which now forms the State of Illinois . The spot may still be seen , a little below Peoria . La Salle christened his new fort Fort Crevecoeur . The name tells of disaster and suffering , but does no justice to the iron-hearted constancy of the sufferer . Up to this time he had clung to the hope that his vessel ( the " Griffin " ) might still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had on board articles of the last necessity to him , including the rigging and anchors of another vessel , which he was to build at Fort Crevecoeur , in order to descend the Mississippi , and sail thence to the West Indies . But now his last hope had well-nigh vanished . Past all reasonable doubt , the " Griffin " was lost ; and in her loss he and all his plans seemed ruined alike . Nothing , indeed , was ever heard of her . Indians , fur-traders , and even Jesuits , have been charged with contriving her destruction . Some say that the Ottawas boarded and burned her , after murdering those on board ; others accuse the Pottawattamies ; others affirm that her own crew scuttled and sunk her ; others , again , that she foundered in a storm .

I am indebted for a copy of this paper to Winthrop Sargent , Esq. , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poet Southey . Like Hennepin , La Hontan went over to the English ; and this memoir is written in their interest . As for La Salle , the belief grew in him to a settled conviction , that she had been treacherously sunk by the pilot and the sailors to whom he had intrusted her ; and he thought he had found evidence that the authors of the crime , laden with the merchandise they had taken from her , had reached the Mississippi and ascended it , hoping to join Du Lhut , a famous chief of coureurs de bois , and enrich themselves by traffic with the northern tribes . Footnote : Lettre de la Salle a La Barre , Chicagou , 4 Juin , 1683 , MS . This is a long letter , addressed to the successor of Frontenac , in the government of Canada . La Salle says that a young Indian belonging to him told him that , three years before , he saw a white man , answering the description of the pilot , a prisoner among a tribe beyond the Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , while making his way with canoes laden with goods , towards the Sioux . His companions had been killed . Other circumstances , which La Salle details at great length , convinced him that the white prisoner was no other than the pilot of the " Griffin . " The evidence , however , is not conclusive . But whether her lading was swallowed in the depths of the lake , or lost in the clutches of traitors , the evil was alike past remedy . She was gone , it mattered little how . The main-stay of the enterprise was broken ; yet its inflexible chief lost neither heart nor hope . One path , beset with hardships and terrors , still lay open to him . He might return on foot to Fort Frontenac , and bring thence the needful succors . La Salle felt deeply the dangers of such a step . His men were uneasy , discontented , and terrified by the stories , with which the jealous Illinois still constantly filled their ears , of the whirlpools and the monsters of the Mississippi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should follow the example of their comrades , and desert . In the midst of his anxieties , a lucky accident gave him the means of disabusing them . He was hunting , one day , near the fort , when he met a young Illinois , on his way home , half-starved , from a distant war excursion . He had been absent so long that he knew nothing of what had passed between his countrymen and the French . La Salle gave him a turkey he had shot , invited him to the fort , fed him , and made him presents . Having thus warmed his heart , he questioned him , with apparent carelessness , as to the countries he had visited , and especially as to the Mississippi , on which the young warrior , seeing no reason to disguise the truth , gave him all the information he required . La Salle now made him the present of a hatchet , to engage him to say nothing of what had passed , and , leaving him in excellent humor , repaired , with some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the chiefs seated at a feast of bear 's meat , and he took his place among them on a mat of rushes . After a pause , he charged them with having deceived him in regard to the Mississippi , adding that he knew the river perfectly , having been instructed concerning it by the Master of Life . He then described it to them with so much accuracy that his astonished hearers , conceiving that he owed his knowledge to " medicine , " or sorcery , clapped their hands to their mouths , in sign of wonder , and confessed that all they had said was but an artifice , inspired by their earnest desire that he should remain among them . Footnote : Relation des Decouvertes et des Voyages du Sr. de la Salle , Seigneur et Gouverneur du Fort de Frontenac , au dela des grands Lacs de la Nouvelle France , faits par ordre de Monseigneur Colbert ; 1679 , 80 et 81 , MS . Hennepin gives a story which is not essentially different , except that he makes himself a conspicuous actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; one motive to desert removed . La Salle again might feel a reasonable security that idleness would not breed mischief among his men . The chief purpose of his intended journey was to procure the equipment of a vessel , to be built at Fort Crevecoeur ; and he resolved that before he set out he would see her on the stocks . The pit-sawyers and some of the carpenters had deserted ; but energy supplied the place of skill , and he and Tonty urged on the work with such vigor that within six weeks the hull was nearly finished . She was of forty tons burden , Footnote : Lettre de Duchesneau , a  --  , 10 Nov. 1680 , MS. and built with high bulwarks to protect those within from the arrows of hostile Indians . La Salle now bethought him that in his absence he might get from Hennepin service of more value than his sermons ; and he requested him to descend the Illinois , and explore it to its mouth . The friar , though hardy and daring , would fain have excused himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleague , Ribourde ,  --  himself too old for the journey ,  --  urged him to go , telling him that if he died by the way , his apostolic labors would redound to the glory of God . Membre had been living for some time in the Indian camp , and was thoroughly out of humor with the objects of his missionary efforts , of whose obduracy and filth he bitterly complained . Hennepin proposed to take his place , while he should assume the Mississippi adventure ; but this Membre declined , preferring to remain where he was . Hennepin now reluctantly accepted the proposed task . " Anybody but me , " he says , with his usual modesty , " would have been very much frightened at the dangers of such a journey ; and , in fact , if I had not placed all my trust in God , I should not have been the dupe of the Sieur de la Salle , who exposed my life rashly . " Footnote : " Tout autre que moi en auroit ete fort ebranle . Et en effet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la Salle , qui m'exposait temerairement , si je n'eusse mis toute ma confiance en Dieu " ( 1704 ) , 241 . On the last day of February , Hennepin 's canoe lay at the water 's edge ; and the party gathered on the bank to bid him farewell . He had two companions , Michel Accau , and a man known as the Picard Du Gay , Footnote : An eminent writer has mistaken " Picard " for a personal name . Du Gay was called " Le Picard , " because he came from the province of Picardy . Accau , and not Hennepin , was the real chief of the party. though his real name was Antoine Auguel . The canoe was well laden with gifts for the Indians ,  - -  tobacco , knives , beads , awls , and other goods , to a very considerable value , supplied at La Salle 's cost ; " and , in fact , " observes Hennepin , " he is liberal enough towards his friends . " Footnote : ( 1683 ) , 188 . This commendation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to La Salle , and embraced all the rest in turn . Father Ribourde gave him his benediction . " Be of good courage and let your heart be comforted , " said the excellent old missionary , as he spread his hands in benediction over the shaven crown of the reverend traveller . Du Gay and Accau plied their paddles ; the canoe receded , and vanished at length behind the forest . We will follow Hennepin hereafter on his adventures , imaginary and real . Meanwhile , we will trace the footsteps of his chief , urging his way , in the storms of winter , through those vast and gloomy wilds ,  --  those realms of famine , treachery , and death , that lay betwixt him and his far-distant goal of Fort Frontenac . On the second of March , Footnote : Tonty erroneously places their departure on the twenty-second. before the frost was yet out of the ground , when the forest was still leafless and gray , and the oozy prairie still patched with snow , a band of discontented men were again gathered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfinished ship lay on the stocks , white and fresh from the saw and axe , ceaselessly reminding them of the hardship and peril that was in store . Here you would have seen the calm impenetrable face of La Salle , and with him the Mohegan hunter , who seems to have felt towards him that admiring attachment which he could always inspire in his Indian retainers . Besides the Mohegan , four Frenchmen were to accompany him : Hunaud , La Violette , Collin , and Dautray . Footnote : Declaration faite par Moyse Hillaret , charpentier de barque , MS . His parting with Tonty was an anxious one , for each well knew the risks that environed both . Embarking with his followers in two canoes , he made his way upward amid the drifting ice ; while the faithful Italian , with two or three honest men and twelve or thirteen knaves , remained to hold Fort Crevecoeur in his absence . CHAPTER XV . 1680 . HARDIHOOD OF LA SALLE . THE WINTER JOURNEY .  --  THE DESERTED TOWN .  --  STARVED ROCK .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  LA SALLE 'S MEN GIVE OUT .  --  ILL TIDINGS .  --  MUTINY .  --  CHASTISEMENT OF THE MUTINEERS . The winter had been a severe one . When La Salle and his five companions reached Peoria Lake , they found it sheeted from shore to shore with ice that stopped the progress of their canoes , but was too thin to bear the weight of a man . They dragged their light vessels up the bank and into the forest , where the city of Peoria now stands ; made two rude sledges , placed the canoes and baggage upon them , and , toiling knee-deep in saturated snow , dragged them four leagues through the woods , till they reached a point where the motion of the current kept the water partially open . They were now on the river above the lake . Masses of drift ice , wedged together , but full of crevices and holes , soon barred the way again ; and , carrying their canoes ashore , they dragged them two leagues over a frozen marsh . Rain fell in floods ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a deserted Indian hut . In the morning , the third of March , they dragged their canoes half a league farther ; then launched them , and , breaking the ice with clubs and hatchets , forced their way slowly up the stream . Again their progress was barred , and again they took to the woods , toiling onward till a tempest of moist , half-liquid snow forced them to bivouac for the night . A sharp frost followed , and in the morning the white waste around them was glazed with a dazzling crust . Now , for the first time , they could use their snow-shoes . Bending to their work , dragging their canoes which glided smoothly over the polished surface , they journeyed on hour after hour and league after league , till they reached at length the great town of the Illinois , still void of its inhabitants . Footnote : Membre says that he was in the town at the time , but this could hardly have been the case . He was , in all probability , among the Illinois in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lonely scene ,  --  the river gliding dark and cold between its banks of rushes ; the empty lodges , covered with crusted snow ; the vast white meadows ; the distant cliffs , bearded with shining icicles ; and the hills wrapped in forests , which glittered from afar with the icy incrustations that cased each frozen twig . Yet there was life in the savage landscape . The men saw buffalo wading in the snow , and they killed one of them . More than this : they discovered the tracks of moccasons . They cut rushes by the edge of the river , piled them on the bank , and set them on fire , that the smoke might attract the eyes of savages roaming near . On the following day , while the hunters were smoking the meat of the buffalo , La Salle went out to reconnoitre , and presently met three Indians , one of whom proved to be Chassagoac , the principal chief of the Illinois . Footnote : The same whom Hennepin calls Chassagouasse . He was brother of the chief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French on the day after the nocturnal council with Monso . Chassagoac was afterwards baptized by Membre or Ribourde , but soon relapsed into the superstitions of his people , and died , as the former tells us , " doubly a child of perdition . " See Le Clercq , ii . 181 . La Salle brought them to his bivouac , feasted them , gave them a red blanket , a kettle , and some knives and hatchets , made friends with them , promised to restrain the Iroquois from attacking them , told them that he was on his way to the settlements to bring arms and ammunition to defend them against their enemies , and , as the result of these advances , gained from the chief a promise that he would send provisions to Tonty 's party at Fort Crevecoeur . After several days spent at the deserted town , La Salle prepared to resume his journey . Before his departure , his attention was attracted to the remarkable cliff of yellow sandstone , now called Starved Rock , a mile or more above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resolute white men might make good against a host of savages ; and he soon afterwards sent Tonty an order to examine it , and make it his stronghold in case of need . Footnote : Tonty , Memoire , MS . The order was sent by two Frenchmen whom La Salle met on Lake Michigan . On the fifteenth , the party set out again , carried their canoes along the bank of the river as far as the rapids above Ottawa ; then launched them and pushed their way upward , battling with the floating ice , which , loosened by a warm rain , drove down the swollen current in sheets . On the eighteenth , they reached a point some miles below the site of Joliet , and here found the river once more completely closed . Despairing of farther progress by water , they hid their canoes on an island , and struck across the country for Lake Michigan . Each , besides his gun , carried a knife and a hatchet at his belt , a blanket strapped at his back , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A store of powder and lead , and a kettle , completed the outfit of the party . Footnote : Hennepin ( 1683 ) , 173 . It was the worst of all seasons for such a journey . The nights were cold , but the sun was warm at noon , and the half-thawed prairie was one vast tract of mud , water , and discolored , half-liquid snow . On the twenty-second , they crossed marshes and inundated meadows , wading to the knee , till at noon they were stopped by a river , perhaps the Calumet . They made a raft of hard wood timber , for there was no other , and shoved themselves across . On the next day , they could see Lake Michigan , dimly glimmering beyond the waste of woods ; and , after crossing three swollen streams , they reached it at evening . On the twenty-fourth , they followed its shore , till , at nightfall , they arrived at the fort , which they had built in the autumn at the mouth of the St. Joseph . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he had sent from hence to Michillimackinac , in search of the " Griffin . " Footnote : Declaration de Moyse Hillaret , MS . Relation des Decouvertes , MS . They reported that they had made the circuit of the lake , and had neither seen her nor heard tidings of her . Assured of her fate , he ordered them to rejoin Tonty at Fort Crevecoeur ; while he pushed onward with his party through the unknown wild of Southern Michigan . They were detained till noon of the twenty-fifth , in making a raft to cross the St. Joseph . Then they resumed their march ; and as they forced their way through the brambly thickets , their clothes were torn , and their faces so covered with blood , that , says the journal , they could hardly know each other . Game was very scarce , and they grew faint with hunger . In two or three days they reached a happier region . They shot deer , bears , and turkeys in the forest , and fared sumptuously . But the reports of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , infested with war-parties of several adverse tribes , and none could venture here without risk of life . On the evening of the twenty-eighth , as they lay around their fire under the shelter of a forest by the border of a prairie , the man on guard shouted an alarm . They sprang to their feet ; and each , gun in hand , took his stand behind a tree , while yells and howlings filled the surrounding darkness . A band of Indians were upon them ; but , seeing them prepared , the cowardly assailants did not wait to exchange a shot . They crossed great meadows , overgrown with rank grass , and set it on fire to hide the traces of their passage . La Salle bethought him of a device to keep their skulking foes at a distance . On the trunks of trees from which he had stripped the bark , he drew with charcoal the marks of an Iroquois war-party , with the usual signs for prisoners , and for scalps , hoping to delude his pursuers with the belief that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warriors . Thus , over snowy prairies and half-frozen marshes ; wading sometimes to their waists in mud , water , and bulrushes , they urged their way through the spongy , saturated wilderness . During three successive days they were aware that a party of savages was dogging their tracks . They dared , not make a fire at night , lest the light should betray them ; but , hanging their wet clothes on the trees , they rolled themselves in their blankets , and slept together among piles of spruce and pine boughs . But the night of the second of April was excessively cold . Their clothes were hard frozen , and they were forced to kindle a fire to thaw and dry them . Scarcely had the light begun to glimmer through the gloom of evening , than it was greeted from the distance by mingled yells ; and a troop of Mascoutin warriors rushed towards them . They were stopped by a deep stream , a hundred paces from the bivouac of the French , and La Salle went forward to meet them . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Frenchman , than they cried that they were friends and brothers , who had mistaken him and his men for Iroquois ; and , abandoning their hostile purpose , they peacefully withdrew . Thus his device to avert danger had well-nigh proved the destruction of the whole party . Two days after this adventure , two of the men fell ill from fatigue , and exposure , and sustained themselves with difficulty till they reached the banks of a river , probably the Huron . Here , while the sick men rested , their companions made a canoe . There were no birch-trees ; and they were forced to use elm bark , which at that early season would not slip freely from the wood until they loosened it with hot water . Their canoe being made , they embarked in it , and for a time floated prosperously down the stream , when , at length the way was barred by a matted barricade of trees fallen across the water . The sick men could now walk again ; and , pushing eastward through the forest , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salle directed two of the men to make a canoe , and go to Michillimackinac , the nearest harborage . With the remaining two , he crossed the Detroit on a raft , and , striking a direct line across the country , reached Lake Erie , not far from Point Pelee . Snow , sleet , and rain pelted them with little intermission ; and when , after a walk of about thirty miles , they gained the lake , the Mohegan and one of the Frenchmen were attacked with fever and spitting of blood . Only one man now remained in health . With his aid , La Salle made another canoe , and , embarking the invalids , pushed for Niagara . It was Easter Monday , when they landed at a cabin of logs above the cataract , probably on the spot where the " Griffin " was built . Here several of La Salle 's men had been left the year before , and here they still remained . They told him woful news . Not only had he lost the " Griffin , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ship from France , freighted with his goods , valued at more than twenty-two thousand livres , had been totally wrecked at the mouth of the St. Lawrence ; and of twenty hired men on their way from Europe to join him , some had been detained by his enemy , the Intendant Duchesneau , while all but four of the remainder , being told that he was dead , had found means to return home . His three followers were all unfit for travel : he alone retained his strength and spirit . Taking with him three fresh men at Niagara , he resumed his journey , and on the sixth of May descried , looming through floods of rain , the familiar shores of his seigniory and the bastioned walls of Fort Frontenac . During sixty-five days he had toiled almost incessantly , travelling , by the course he took , about a thousand miles through a country beset with every form of peril and obstruction ; " the most arduous journey , " says the chronicler , " ever made by Frenchmen in America . " Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconquerable mind held at its service a frame of iron , and tasked it to the utmost of its endurance . The pioneer of western pioneers was no rude son of toil , but a man of thought , trained amid arts and letters . Footnote : A Rocky Mountain trapper , being complimented on the hardihood of himself and his companions , once said to the writer , " That 's so ; but a gentleman of the right sort will stand hardship better than anybody else . " The history of Arctic and African travel , and the military records of all time , are a standing evidence that a trained and developed mind is not the enemy , but the active and powerful ally , of constitutional hardihood . The culture that enervates instead of strengthening is always a false or a partial one . He had reached his goal ; but for him there was neither rest nor peace . Man and nature seemed in arms against him . His agents had plundered him ; his creditors had seized his property ; and several of his canoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the St. Lawrence . Footnote : Zenobe Membre in Le Clercq , ii . 202 . He hastened to Montreal , where his sudden advent caused great astonishment ; and where , despite his crippled resources and damaged credit , he succeeded , within a week , in gaining the supplies which he required , and the needful succors for the forlorn band on the Illinois . He had returned to Fort Frontenac , and was on the point of embarking for their relief , when a blow fell upon him more disheartening than any that had preceded . On the twenty-second of July , two voyageurs , Messier and Laurent , came to him with a letter from Tonty ; who wrote that soon after La Salle 's departure , nearly all the men had deserted , after destroying Fort Crevecoeur , plundering the magazine , and throwing into the river all the arms , goods , and stores which they could not carry off . The messengers who brought this letter were speedily followed by two of the habitans of Fort Frontenac , who had been trading on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unhappy La Salle rarely knew how to inspire , had travelled day and night to bring him their tidings . They reported that they had met the deserters , and that having been reinforced by recruits gained at Michillimackinac and Niagara , they now numbered twenty men . Footnote : When La Salle was at Niagara , in April , he had ordered Dautray , the best of the men who had accompanied him from the Illinois , to return thither as soon as he was able . Four men from Niagara were to go with him , and he was to rejoin Tonty with such supplies as that post could furnish . Dautray set out accordingly , but was met on the lakes by the deserters , who told him that Tonty was dead , and seduced his men .  --  Relation des Decouvertes , MS . Dautray himself seems to have remained true ; at least he was in La Salle 's service immediately after , and was one of his most trusted followers . He was of good birth , being the son of Jean Bourdon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his name appears on official records as Jean Bourdon , Sieur d'Autray . They had destroyed the fort on the St. Joseph , seized a quantity of furs belonging to La Salle at Michillimackinac , and plundered the magazine at Niagara . Here they had separated , eight of them coasting the south side of Lake Ontario to find harborage at Albany , a common refuge at that time of this class of scoundrels ; while the remaining twelve , in three canoes , made for Fort Frontenac along the north shore , intending to kill La Salle as the surest means of escaping punishment . He lost no time in lamentation . Of the few men at his command , he chose nine of the trustiest , embarked with them in canoes , and went to meet the marauders . After passing the Bay of Quinte , he took his station with five of his party at a point of land suited to his purpose , and detached the remaining four to keep watch . In the morning two canoes were discovered , approaching without suspicion , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foremost drew near , La Salle 's canoe darted out from under the leafy shore ; two of the men handling the paddles , while he with the remaining two levelled their guns at the deserters , and called on them to surrender . Astonished and dismayed , they yielded at once ; while two more who were in the second canoe hastened to follow their example . La Salle now returned to the fort with his prisoners , placed them in custody , and again set forth . He met the third canoe upon the lake at about six o'clock in the evening . His men vainly plied their paddles in pursuit . The mutineers reached the shore , took post among rocks and trees , levelled their guns , and showed fight . Four of La Salle 's men made a circuit to gain their rear and dislodge them ; on which they stole back to their canoe , and tried to escape in the darkness . They were pursued , and summoned to yield ; but they replied by aiming their guns at their pursuers , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and captured the remaining three . Like their companions , they were placed in custody at the fort to await the arrival of Count Frontenac . Footnote : The story of La Salle 's journey from Fort Crevecoeur to Fort Frontenac , with his subsequent encounter with the mutineers , is given in great detail in the unpublished Relation des Decouvertes . This and other portions of it are compiled , with little abridgment , from the letters of La Salle himself , some of which are still in existence . They give the particulars of each day with a cool and business-like simplicity , recounting facts without comment or the slightest attempt at rhetorical embellishment . This is the authority for the details of the journey : the general statement is confirmed by Membre , Hennepin , and Tonty . The Memoire of Tonty , though too concise , is excellent authority , and must by no means be confounded with the Relation de la Louisiane , to which his name is falsely affixed . CHAPTER XVI . 1680 .

And now La Salle 's work must be begun afresh . He had staked all , and all had seemingly been lost . In stern relentless effort he had touched the limits of human endurance ; and the harvest of his toils was disappointment , disaster , and impending ruin . The shattered fabric of his enterprise was prostrate in the dust . His friends desponded ; his foes were blatant and exultant . Did he bend before the storm ? No human eye could pierce the veiled depths of his reserved and haughty nature ; but the surface was calm , and no sign betrayed a shaken resolve or an altered purpose . Where weaker men would have abandoned all in despairing apathy , he turned anew to his work with the same vigor and the same apparent confidence as if borne on the full tide of success . His best hope was in Tonty . Could that brave and true-hearted officer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him , make good their foothold on the Illinois , and save from destruction the vessel on the stocks , and the forge and tools so laboriously carried thither ,  --  then , indeed , a basis was left on which the ruined enterprise might be built up once more . There was no time to lose . Tonty must be succored soon , or succor would come too late . La Salle had already provided the necessary material , and a few days sufficed to complete his preparations . On the tenth of August , he embarked again for the Illinois . With him went his lieutenant , La Forest , who held of him in fief an island , then called Belle Isle , opposite Fort Frontenac . Footnote : Robert Cavelier , Sr. de la Salle , a Francois Daupin , Sr. de la Forest , 10 Juin , 1679 , MS .

He ascended the River Humber ; crossed to Lake Simcoe , and thence descended the Severn to the Georgian Bay of Lake Huron ; followed its eastern shore , coasted the Manitoulin Islands , and at length reached Michillimackinac . Here , as usual , all was hostile ; and he had great difficulty in inducing the Indians , who had been excited against him , to sell him provisions . Anxious to reach his destination , he pushed forward with twelve men , leaving La Forest to bring on the rest . On the fourth of November , Footnote : This date is from the Relation . Membre says the twenty-eighth ; but he is wrong , by his own showing , as he says that the party reached the Illinois village on the first of December ,  --  an impossibility. he reached the ruined fort at the mouth of the St. Joseph , and left five of his party , with the heavy stores , to wait till La Forest should come up , while he himself hastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety possessed him . For some time past , rumors had been abroad that the Iroquois were preparing to invade the country of the Illinois , bent on expelling or destroying them . Here was a new disaster , which , if realized , might involve him and his enterprise in irretrievable wreck . He ascended the St. Joseph , crossed the portage to the Kankakee , and followed its course downward till it joined the northern branch of the Illinois . He had heard nothing of Tonty on the way , and neither here nor elsewhere could he discover the smallest sign of the passage of white men . His friend , therefore , if alive , was probably still at his post ; and he pursued his course with a mind lightened , in some small measure , of its load of anxiety . When last he had passed here , all was solitude ; but how the scene was changed . The boundless waste was thronged with life . He beheld that wondrous spectacle , still to be seen at times on the plains of the remotest West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stir the blood after the lapse of years . Far and near , the prairie was alive with buffalo ; now like black specks dotting the distant swells ; now trampling by in ponderous columns , or filing in long lines , morning , noon , and night , to drink at the river ,  --  wading , plunging , and snorting in the water ; climbing the muddy shores , and staring with wild eyes at the passing canoes . It was an opportunity not to be lost . The party landed , and encamped for a hunt . Sometimes they hid under the shelving bank , and shot them as they came to drink ; sometimes , flat on their faces , they dragged themselves through the long dead grass , till the savage bulls , guardians of the herd , ceased their grazing , raised their huge heads , and glared through tangled hair at the dangerous intruders ; their horns splintered and their grim front scarred with battles , while their shaggy mane , like a gigantic lion , well-nigh swept the ground . Footnote : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old buffalo bull under such circumstances . When I was within a hundred yards of him , he came towards me at a sharp trot as if to make a charge ; but , as I remained motionless , he stopped thirty paces off and stared fixedly for a long time . At length , he slowly turned , and , in doing so , received a shot behind the shoulder , which killed him . It is useless to fire at the forehead of a buffalo bull , at least with an ordinary rifle , as the bullet flattens against his skull . A shot at close quarters , just above the nose , would probably turn him in a charge . The usual modes of hunting buffalo on foot are those mentioned above . They are commonly successful ; but at times the animals are excessively shy and wary , while at other times they are stupid beyond measure , and can be easily approached and killed . The hunter must remain perfectly motionless after firing , as the wounded animal is apt to make a rush at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting buffalo is , however , on horseback , running alongside of them , and shooting them behind the shoulder with a pistol or a short gun . A bow and arrow are better for those who know how to use them ; but white men very rarely have the skill . I have seen , on different occasions , several hundred buffalo killed with arrows , by Indians on horseback . This noble game , with the tribes who live on it , will soon disappear from the earth . The hunt was successful . In three days , the hunters killed twelve buffalo , besides deer , geese , and swans . They cut the meat into thin flakes , and dried it in the sun , or in the smoke of their fires . The men were in high spirits ; delighting in the sport , and rejoicing in the prospect of relieving Tonty and his hungry followers with a bounteous supply . They embarked again , and soon approached the great town of the Illinois . The buffalo were far behind ; and once more the canoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunters were seen ; no saluting whoop greeted their ears . They passed the cliff afterwards called the Rock of St. Louis , where La Salle had ordered Tonty to build his stronghold ; but as he scanned its lofty top , he saw no palisades , no cabins , no sign of human hand , and still its primeval crest of forests overhung the gliding river . Now the meadow opened before them where the great town had stood . They gazed , astonished and confounded : all was desolation . The town had vanished , and the meadow was black with fire . They plied their paddles , hastened to the spot , landed ; and , as they looked around , their cheeks grew white , and the blood was frozen in their veins . Before them lay a plain once swarming with wild human life , and covered with Indian dwellings ; now a waste of devastation and death , strewn with heaps of ashes , and bristling with the charred poles and stakes which had formed the framework of the lodges . At the points of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by birds of prey . Footnote : " Il ne restoit que quelques bouts de perches brulees qui montroient quelle avoit ete l'etendue du village , et sur la plupart desquelles il y avait des tetes de morts plantees et mangoes des corbeaux. "  --  Relation des Decouvertes du Sr. de la Salle , MS . Near at hand was the burial ground of the village . The travellers sickened with horror as they entered its revolting precincts . Wolves in multitudes fled at their approach ; while clouds of crows or buzzards , rising from the hideous repast , wheeled above their heads , or settled on the naked branches of the neighboring forest . Every grave had been rifled , and the bodies flung down from the scaffolds where , after the Illinois custom , many of them had been placed . The field was strewn with broken bones and torn and mangled corpses . A hyena warfare had been waged against the dead . La Salle knew the handiwork of the Iroquois . The threatened blow had fallen , and the wolfish hordes of the five cantons had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Beaucoup de carcasses a demi rongees par les loups , les sepulchres demolis , les os tires de leurs fosses et epars par la campagne ; ... enfin les loups et les corbeaux augmentoient par leurs hurlemens et par leurs cris l'horreur de ce spectacle . "  --  Ibid . The above may seem exaggerated , but it accords perfectly with what is well established concerning the ferocious character of the Iroquois , and the nature of their warfare . Many other tribes have frequently made war upon the dead . I have myself known an instance in which five corpses of Sioux Indians , placed in trees , after the practice of the western bands of that people , were thrown down and kicked into fragments by a war party of the Crows , who then held the muzzles of their guns against the skulls and blew them to pieces . This happened near the head of the Platte , in the summer of 1846 . Yet the Crows are much less ferocious than were the Iroquois in La Salle 's time . Not far distant , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and roots of trees laid together to form a circular enclosure ; and this , too , was garnished with , skulls , stuck on the broken branches , and protruding sticks . The caches , or subterranean storehouses of the villagers had been broken open , and the contents scattered . The cornfields were laid waste , and much of the corn thrown into heaps and half burned . As La Salle surveyed this scene of havoc , one thought engrossed him : where were Tonty and his men ? He searched the Iroquois fort ; there were abundant traces of its savage occupants , but none whatever of the presence of white men . He examined the skulls ; but the hair , portions of which clung to nearly all of them , was in every case that of an Indian . Evening came on before he had finished the search . The sun set , and the wilderness sank to its savage rest . Night and silence brooded over the waste , where , far as the raven could wing his flight , stretched the dark domain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the spot , where , crouched around their with a fierce and dreary dissonance . More deadly foes were not far off , for before nightfall they had seen fresh Indian tracks . The cold , however , forced them to make a fire ; and while some tried to rest around it , the others stood on the watch . La Salle could not sleep . Anxiety , anguish , fears for his friend , doubts as to what course he should pursue , racked his firm mind with a painful indecision , and lent redoubled gloom to the terrors that encompassed him . Footnote : Relation des Decouvertes , MS . During the afternoon , he had made a discovery which offered , as he thought , a possible clew to the fate of Tonty , and those with him . In one of the Illinois cornfields , near the river , were planted six posts painted red , on each of which was drawn in black a figure of a man with eyes bandaged . La Salle supposed them to represent six Frenchmen , prisoners in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward at all hazards , in the hope of learning more . When daylight at length returned , he told his followers that it was his purpose to descend the river , and directed three of them to await his return near the ruined village . They were to hide themselves on an island , conceal their fire at night , make no smoke by day , fire no guns , and keep a close watch . Should the rest of the party arrive , they , too , were to wait with similar precautions . The baggage was placed in a hollow of the rocks , at a place difficult of access ; and , these arrangements made , La Salle set out on his perilous journey with the four remaining men , Dautray , Hunaut , You , and the Indian . Each was armed with two guns , a pistol , and a sword ; and a number of hatchets and other goods were placed in the canoe , as presents for Indians whom they might meet . Several leagues below the village they found , on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island made inaccessible by the marshes and water which surrounded it . Here the flying Illinois had sought refuge with their women and children , and the place was full of their deserted huts . On the left bank , exactly opposite , was an abandoned camp of the Iroquois . On the level meadow stood a hundred and thirteen huts , and on the forest trees which covered the hills behind were carved the totems , or insignia , of the chiefs , together with marks to show the number of followers which each had led to the war . La Salle counted five hundred and eighty-two warriors . He found marks , too , for the Illinois killed or captured , but none to indicate that any of the Frenchmen had shared their fate . As they descended the river , they passed , on the same day , six abandoned camps of the Illinois , and opposite to each was a camp of the invaders . The former , it was clear , had retreated in a body ; while the Iroquois had followed their march , day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his men pushed rapidly onward , passed Peoria Lake , and soon reached Fort Crevecoeur , which they found , as they expected , demolished by the deserters . The vessel on the stocks was still left entire , though the Iroquois had found means to draw out the iron nails and spikes . On one of the planks were written the words : " Nous sommes tous sauvages : ce 19  - -  1680 ; " the work , no doubt , of the knaves who had pillaged and destroyed the fort . La Salle and his companions hastened on , and during the following day passed four opposing camps of the savage armies . The silence of death now reigned along the deserted river , whose lonely borders , wrapped deep in forests , seemed lifeless as the grave . As they drew near the mouth of the stream , they saw a meadow on their right , and , on its farthest verge , several human figures , erect yet motionless . They landed , and cautiously examined the place . The long grass was trampled down , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which formed the ordinary sequel of an Iroquois victory . The figures they had seen were the half-consumed bodies of women , still bound to the stakes where they had been tortured . Other sights there were , too revolting for record . Footnote : " On ne scauroit exprimer la rage de ces furieux ni les tourmens qu'ils avoient fait souffrir aux miserables Tamaroa ( a tribe of the Illinois ) . Il y en avoit encore dans des chaudieres qu'ils avoient laissees pleines sur les feux , qui depuis s'etoient eteints , " etc. , etc.  --  Relation des Decouvertes , MS . All the remains were those of women and children . The men , it seemed , had fled , and left them to their fate . Here , again , La Salle sought long and anxiously , without finding the smallest sign that could indicate the presence of Frenchmen . Once more descending the river , they soon reached its mouth . Before them , a broad eddying current rolled swiftly on its way ; and La Salle beheld the Mississippi , the object of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes . It was no time for reflections . The moment was too engrossing , too heavily charged with anxieties and cares . From a rock on the shore , he saw a tree stretched forward above the stream ; and stripping off its bark to make it more conspicuous , he hung upon it a board , on which he had drawn the figures of himself and his men , seated in their canoe , and bearing a pipe of peace . To this he tied a letter for Tonty , informing him that he had returned up the river to the ruined village . His four men had behaved admirably throughout , and they now offered to continue the journey , if he saw fit , and follow him to the sea ; but he thought it useless to go farther , and was unwilling to abandon the three men whom he had ordered to await his return . Accordingly they retraced their course , and , paddling at times both day and night , urged their canoe so swiftly , that they reached the village in the incredibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about two hundred and fifty miles . The Relation des Decouvertes says that they left the village on the second of December , and returned to it on the eleventh , having left the mouth of the river on the seventh . Very probably , there is an error of date . In other particulars , this narrative is sustained by those of Tonty . The sky was clear ; and , as night came on , the travellers saw a prodigious comet blazing above this scene of desolation . On that night , it was chilling , with a superstitious awe , the hamlets of New England and the gilded chambers of Versailles ; but it is characteristic of La Salle , that , beset as he was with perils , and surrounded with ghastly images of death , he coolly notes down the phenomenon ,  --  not as a portentous messenger of war and woe , but rather as an object of scientific curiosity . Footnote : This was the " Great Comet of 1680 . " . Dr. B. A. Gould writes me : " It appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter part of February , 1681 , being especially brilliant in January . " It was said to be the largest ever seen . By observations upon it , Newton demonstrated the regular revolutions of comets around the sun . " No comet , " it is said , " has threatened the earth with a nearer approach than that of 1680. "  --  Winthrop on Comets , Lecture II . p. 44 . Increase Mather , in his Discourse concerning Comets , printed at Boston in 1683 , says of this one : " Its appearance was very terrible , the Blaze ascended above 60 Degrees almost to its Zenith . " Mather thought it fraught with terrific portent to the nations of the earth . He found his three men safely ensconced upon their island , where they were anxiously looking for his return . After collecting a store of half-burnt corn from the ravaged granaries of the Illinois , the whole party began to ascend the river , and , on the sixth of January , reached the junction of the Kankakee with the northern branch . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They now chose the latter , and soon discovered , by the margin of the water , a rude cabin of bark . La Salle landed , and examined the spot , when an object met his eye which cheered him with a bright gleam of hope . It was but a piece of wood , but the wood had been cut with a saw . Tonty and his party , then , had passed this way , escaping from the carnage behind them . Unhappily , they had left no token of their passage at the fork of the two streams ; and thus La Salle , on his voyage downward , had believed them to be still on the river below . With rekindled hope , the travellers pursued their journey , leaving their canoes , and making their way overland towards the fort on the St. Joseph . Snow fell in profusion , till the earth was deeply buried . So light and dry was it , that to walk on snow-shoes was impossible ; and La Salle , after his custom , took the lead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite his tall stature , he often waded through drifts to the waist , while the men toiled on behind ; the snow , shaken from the burdened twigs , showering them as they passed . After excessive fatigue , they reached their goal , and found shelter and safety within the walls of Fort Miami . Here was the party left in charge of La Forest ; but , to his surprise and grief , La Salle heard no tidings of Tonty . He found some amends for the disappointment in the fidelity and zeal of La Forest 's men , who had restored the fort , cleared ground for planting , and even sawed the planks and timber for a new vessel on the lake . And now , while La Salle rests at Fort Miami , let us trace the adventures which befell Tonty and his followers , after their chief 's departure from Fort Crevecoeur . CHAPTER XVII. 1680 . TONTY AND THE IROQUOIS . THE DESERTERS.  --  THE IROQUOIS WAR .  --  THE GREAT TOWN OF THE ILLINOIS .  --  THE ALARM .  --  ONSET OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  INTREPIDITY OF TONTY.  --  MURDER OF RIBOURDE.  --  WAR UPON THE DEAD . When La Salle set out on his rugged journey to Fort Frontenac , he left , as we have seen , fifteen men at Fort Crevecoeur ,  --  smiths , ship-carpenters , housewrights , and soldiers , besides his servant l'Esperance and the two friars Membre and Ribourde . Most of the men were ripe for mutiny . They had no interest in the enterprise , and no love for its chief . They were disgusted at the present , and terrified at the future . La Salle , too , was for the most part a stern commander , impenetrable and cold ; and when he tried to soothe , conciliate , and encourage , his success rarely answered to the excellence of his rhetoric . He could always , however , inspire respect , if not love ; but now the restraint of his presence was removed . He had not been long absent , when a firebrand was thrown into the midst of the discontented and restless crew . It may be remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Chapelle and Leblanc , at his fort on the St. Joseph , and ordered them to rejoin Tonty . Unfortunately , they obeyed . On arriving , they told their comrades that the " Griffin " was lost , that Fort Frontenac was seized by the creditors of La Salle , that he was ruined past recovery , and that they , the men , would never receive their pay . Their wages were in arrears for more than two years ; and , indeed , it would have been folly to pay them before their return to the settlements , as to do so would have been a temptation to desert . Now , however , the effect on their minds was still worse , believing , as many of them did , that they would never be paid at all . La Chapelle and his companion had brought a letter from La Salle to Tonty , directing him to examine and fortify the cliff so often mentioned , which overhung the river above the great Illinois village . Tonty , accordingly , set out on his errand with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malcontents destroyed the fort , stole powder , lead , furs , and provisions , and deserted , after writing on the side of the unfinished vessel the words seen by La Salle , " Nous sommes tous sauvages . " Footnote : For the particulars of this desertion , Membre , in Le Clerc , ii . 171 , Relation des Decouvertes , MS. ; Tonty , Memoire , MS. ; Declaration faite par devant le Sr. Duchesneau , Intendant en Canada , par Moyse Hillaret , charpentier de barque cy-devant au service du Sr. de la Salle , 17 Aoust , 1680 , MS . Moyse Hillaret , the " Maitre Moyse " of Hennepin , was a ringleader of the deserters , and seems to have been one of those captured by La Salle near Fort Frontenac . Twelve days after , Hillaret was examined by La Salle 's enemy , the Intendant ; and this paper is the formal statement made by him . It gives the names of most of the men , and furnishes incidental confirmation of many statements of Hennepin , Tonty , Membre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Le Meilleur , the blacksmith nicknamed La Forge , went off together , and the rest seem to have followed afterwards . Hillaret does not admit that any goods were wantonly destroyed . There is before me a schedule of the debts of La Salle , made after his death . It includes a claim of this man for wages to the amount of 2,500 livres . The brave young Sieur de Boisrondet and the servant l'Esperance hastened to carry the news to Tonty , who at once despatched four of those with him , by two different routes , to inform La Salle of the disaster . Footnote : Two of the messengers , Laurent and Messier , arrived safely . The others seem to have deserted . Besides the two just named , there now remained with him only three hired men and the Recollet friars . With this feeble band , he was left among a horde of treacherous savages , who had been taught to regard him as a secret enemy . Resolved , apparently , to disarm their jealousy by a show of confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , making his quarters in the great village , whither , as spring opened , its inhabitants returned , to the number , according to Membre , of seven or eight thousand . Hither he conveyed the forge and such tools as he could recover , and here he hoped to maintain , himself till La Salle should reappear . The spring and the summer were past , and he looked anxiously for his coming , unconscious that a storm was gathering in the east , soon to burst with devastation over the fertile wilderness of the Illinois . I have recounted the ferocious triumphs of the Iroquois in another volume . Footnote : " The Jesuits in America . " Throughout a wide semicircle around their cantons they had made the forest a solitude ,  --  destroyed the Hurons , exterminated the Neutrals and the Eries , reduced the formidable Andastes to a helpless insignificance , swept the borders of the St. Lawrence with fire , spread terror and desolation among the Algonquins of Canada ; and now , tired of peace , they were seeking , to borrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet it was not alone their homicidal fury that now impelled them to another war . Strange as it may seem , this war was in no small measure one of commercial advantage . They had long traded with the Dutch and English of New York , who gave them , in exchange for their furs , the guns , ammunition , knives , hatchets , kettles , beads , and brandy which had become indispensable to them . Game was scarce in their country . They must seek their beaver and other skins in the vacant territories of the tribes they had destroyed ; but this did not content them . The French of Canada were seeking to secure a monopoly of the furs of the north and west ; and , of late , the enterprises of La Salle on the tributaries of the Mississippi had especially roused the jealousy of the Iroquois , fomented , moreover , by Dutch and English traders . Footnote : Duchesneau , in Paris Docs. , ix . 163 . These crafty savages would fain reduce all these regions to subjection , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bartered for English goods with the traders of Albany . They turned their eyes first towards the Illinois , the most important , as well as one of the most accessible , of the western Algonquin tribes ; and among La Salle 's enemies were some in whom jealousy of a hated rival could so far override all the best interests of the colony that they did not scruple to urge on the Iroquois to an invasion which they hoped would prove his ruin . The chiefs convened , war was decreed , the war-dance was danced , the war-song sung , and five hundred warriors began their march . In their path lay the town of the Miamis , neighbors and kindred of the Illinois . It was always their policy to divide and conquer ; and these forest Machiavels had intrigued so well among the Miamis , working craftily on their jealousy , that they induced them to join in the invasion , though there is every reason to believe that they had marked these infatuated allies as their next victims . Footnote : There had long been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Membre , La Salle 's enemies had intrigued successfully among the former , as well as among the Iroquois , to induce them to take arms against the Illinois . Go to the banks of the Illinois where it flows by the village of Utica , and stand on the meadow that borders it on the north . In front glides the river , a musket-shot in width ; and from the farther bank rises , with gradual slope , a range of wooded hills that hide from sight the vast prairie behind them . A mile or more on your left these gentle acclivities end abruptly in the lofty front of the great cliff , called by the French the Rock of St. Louis , looking boldly out from the forests that environ it ; and , three miles distant on your right , you discern a gap in the steep bluffs that here bound the valley , marking the mouth of the River Vermilion , called Aramoni by the French . Footnote : The above is from notes made on the spot . The following is La Salle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , written in 1681 : " La rive gauche de la riviere , du cote du sud , est occupee par un long rocher , fort etroit et escarpe presque partout , a la reserve d'un endroit de plus d'une lieue de longueur , situe vis-a-vis du village , ou le terrain , tout couvert de beaux chenes , s'etend par une pente douce jusqu'au bord de la riviere . Au dela de cette hauteur est une vaste plaine , qui s'etend bien loin du cote du sud , et qui est traversee par la riviere Aramoni , do nt les bords sont couverts d'une lisiere de bois peu large . " The Aramoni is laid down on the great manuscript map of Franquelin , 1684 , and on the map of Coronelli , 1688 . It is , without doubt , the Big Vermilion . Starved Rock , or the Rock of St. Louis , is the highest and steepest escarpment of the long rocher above mentioned . Now stand in fancy on this same spot in the early autumn of the year 1680 . You are in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mat-covered lodges and thousands of congregated savages . Enter one of their dwellings : they will not think you an intruder . Some friendly squaw will lay a mat for you by the fire ; you may seat yourself upon it , smoke your pipe , and study the lodge and its inmates by the light that streams through the holes at the top . Three or four fires smoke and smoulder on the ground down the middle of the long arched structure ; and as to each fire there are two families , the place is somewhat crowded when all are present . But now there is space and breathing room , for many are in the fields . A squaw sits weaving a mat of rushes ; a warrior , naked , except his moccasons , and tattooed with fantastic devices , binds a stone arrow-head to its shaft with the fresh sinews of a buffalo . Some lie asleep , some sit staring in vacancy , some are eating , some are squatted in lazy chat around a fire . The smoke brings water to your eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked as young puppies , crawl about your knees and will not be repelled . You have seen enough . You rise and go out again into the sunlight . It is , if not a peaceful , at least a languid scene . A few voices break the stillness , mingled with the joyous chirping of crickets from the grass . Young men lie flat on their faces , basking in the sun . A group of their elders are smoking around a buffalo skin on which they have just been playing a game of chance with cherry-stones . A lover and his mistress , perhaps , sit together under a shed of bark without uttering a word . Not far off is the graveyard , where lie the dead of the village , some buried in the earth , some wrapped in skins and laid aloft on scaffolds , above the reach of wolves . In the cornfields around , you see squaws at their labor , and children driving off intruding birds ; and your eye ranges over the meadows beyond , spangled with the yellow blossoms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills still green with the foliage of summer . Footnote : The Illinois were an aggregation of distinct though kindred tribes , the Kaskaskias , the Peorias , the Cahokias , the Tamaroas , the Moingona , and others . Their general character and habits were those of other Indian tribes , but they were reputed somewhat cowardly and slothful . In their manners , they were more licentious than many of their neighbors , and addicted to practices which are sometimes supposed to be the result of a perverted civilization . Young men enacting the part of women were frequently to be seen among them . These were held in great contempt . Some of the early travellers , both among the Illinois and among other tribes , where the same practice prevailed , mistook them for hermaphrodites . According to Charlevoix ( Journal Historique , 303 ) , this abuse was due in part to a superstition . The Miamis and Piankishaws were in close affinities of language and habits with the Illinois . All these tribes belonged to the great Algonquin family . The first impressions which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1671 , were singularly favorable ; but a closer acquaintance did not confirm them . The Illinois traded with the lake tribes , to whom they carried slaves taken in war , receiving in exchange , guns , hatchets , and other French goods .  - -  Marquette in Relation , 1670 , 91 . This , or something like it , one may safely affirm , was the aspect of the Illinois village at noon of the tenth of September . Footnote : This is Membre 's date . The narratives differ as to the day , though all agree as to the month . In a hut , apart from the rest , you would probably have found the Frenchmen . Among them was a man , not strong in person , and disabled , moreover , by the loss of a hand ; yet , in this den of barbarism , betraying the language and bearing of one formed in the most polished civilization of Europe . This was Henri de Tonty . The others were young Boisrondet , and the two faithful men who had stood by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in the village , but at a hut a league distant , whither they had gone to make a " retreat , " for prayer and meditation . Their missionary labors had not been fruitful . They had made no converts , and were in despair at the intractable character of the objects of their zeal . As for the other Frenchmen , time , doubtless , hung heavy on their hands ; for nothing can surpass the vacant monotony of an Indian town when there is neither hunting , nor war , nor feasts , nor dances , nor gambling , to beguile the lagging hours . Suddenly the village was wakened from its lethargy as by the crash of a thunderbolt . A Shawanoe , lately here on a visit , had left his Illinois friends to return home . He now reappeared , crossing the river in hot haste with the announcement that he had met , on his way , an army of Iroquois approaching to attack them . All was panic and confusion . The lodges disgorged their frightened inmates ; women and children screamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than five hundred of them , for the greater part of the young men had gone to war . A crowd of excited savages thronged about Tonty and his Frenchmen , already objects of their suspicion , charging them , with furious gesticulation , with having stirred up their enemies to invade them . Tonty defended himself in broken Illinois , but the naked mob were but half convinced . They seized the forge and tools and flung them into the river , with all the goods that had been saved from the deserters ; then , distrusting their power to defend themselves , they manned the wooden canoes which lay in multitudes by the bank , embarked their women and children , and paddled down the stream to that island of dry land in the midst of marshes which La Salle afterwards found filled with their deserted huts . Sixty warriors remained here to guard them , and the rest returned to the village . All night long fires blazed along the shore . The excited warriors greased their bodies , painted their faces , befeathered their heads , sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brandished their hatchets , to work up their courage to face the crisis . The morning came , and with it came the Iroquois . Young warriors had gone out as scouts , and now they returned . They had seen the enemy in the line of forest that bordered the River Aramoni , or Vermilion , and had stealthily reconnoitred them . They were very numerous , Footnote : The Relation des Decouvertes says , five hundred Iroquois and one hundred Shawanoes . Membre says that the allies were Miamis . He is no doubt right , as the Miamis had promised their aid , and the Shawanoes were at peace with the Illinois . Tonty is silent on the point. and armed for the most part with guns , pistols , and swords . Some had bucklers of wood or raw hide , and some wore those corselets of tough twigs interwoven with cordage which their fathers had used when firearms were unknown . The scouts added more , for they declared that they had seen a Jesuit among the Iroquois ; nay , that La Salle himself was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were enemies and traitors . The supposed Jesuit was but an Iroquois chief arrayed in a black hat , doublet , and stockings ; while another , equipped after a somewhat similar fashion , passed in the distance for La Salle . But the Illinois were furious . Tonty 's life hung by a hair . A crowd of savages surrounded him , mad with rage and terror . He had come lately from Europe , and knew little of Indians ; but , as the friar Membre says of him , " he was full of intelligence and courage , " and when they heard him declare that he and his Frenchmen would go with them to fight the Iroquois , their threats grew less clamorous and their eyes glittered with a less deadly lustre . Whooping and screeching , they ran to their canoes , crossed the river , climbed the woody hill , and swarmed down upon the plain beyond . About a hundred of them had guns ; the rest were armed with bows and arrows . They were now face to face with the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was advancing on the open prairie . With unwonted spirit , for their repute as warriors was by no means high , the Illinois began , after their fashion , to charge ; that is , they leaped , yelled , and shot off bullets and arrows , advancing as they did so ; while the Iroquois replied with gymnastics no less agile , and howlings no less terrific , mingled with the rapid clatter of their guns . Tonty saw that it would go hard with his allies . It was of the last moment to stop the fight if possible . The Iroquois were , or professed to be , at peace with the French ; and taking counsel of his courage , he resolved on an attempt to mediate , which may well be called a desperate one . He laid aside his gun , took in his hand a wampum belt as a flag of truce , and walked forward to meet the savage multitude , attended by Boisrondet , another Frenchman , and a young Illinois who had the hardihood to accompany him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of them were aimed at him , on which he sent back the two Frenchmen and the Illinois , and advanced alone , holding out the wampum belt . Footnote : Membre says that he went with Tonty , " J'etois aussi a cote du Sieur de Tonty . " This is an invention of the friar 's vanity . " Les deux peres Recollets etoient alors dans une cabane a une lieue du village , ou ils s'etoient retires pour faire une espece de retraite , et ils ne furent avertis de l'arrivee des Iroquois que dans le temps du combat . "  --  Relation des Decouvertes , , MS . " Je rencontrai en chemin les peres Gabriel et Zenobe Membre , qui cherchoient de mes nonvelles. "  --  Tonty Memoire , MS . This was on his return from the Iroquois . The Relation confirms the statement , as far as concerns Membre : " Il rencontra le Pere Zenobe ( Membre ) , qui venoit pour le secourir , aiant ete averti du combat et de sa blessure . " The perverted Dernieres Decouvertes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was attended by a slave whom the Illinois sent with him as interpreter . Though this is not mentioned in the three authentic narratives , it is more than probable , as Tonty could not have known Iroquois enough to make himself understood . A moment more , and he was among the infuriated warriors . It was a frightful spectacle : the contorted forms , bounding , crouching , twisting , to deal or dodge the shot ; the small keen eyes that shone like an angry snake 's ; the parted lips pealing their fiendish yells ; the painted features writhing with fear and fury , and every passion of an Indian fight ; man , wolf , and devil , all in one . Footnote : Being once in an encampment of Sioux , when a quarrel broke out , and the adverse factions raised the war-whoop , and began to fire at each other , I had a good , though for the moment , a rather dangerous opportunity of seeing the demeanor of Indians at the beginning of a fight . The fray was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervention of the elder warriors , who ran between the combatants . With his swarthy complexion , and his half-savage dress , they thought he was an Indian , and thronged about him , glaring murder . A young warrior stabbed at his heart with a knife , but the point glanced aside against a rib , inflicting only a deep gash . A chief called out that , as his ears were not pierced , he must be a Frenchman . On this , some of them tried to stop the bleeding , and led him to the rear , where an angry parley ensued , while the yells and firing still resounded in the front . Tonty , breathless , and bleeding at the mouth with the force of the blow he had received , found words to declare that the Illinois were under the protection of the king , and the Governor of Canada , and to demand that they should be left in peace . Footnote : " Je leur fis connoistre que les Islinois etoient sous la protection du roy de France et du gouverneur du @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francois et qu'ils voulussent attendre ( sic ) a une paix. "  --  Tonty , Menoire , MS . A young Iroquois snatched Tonty 's hat , placed it on the end of his gun , and displayed it to the Illinois , who , thereupon , thinking he was killed , renewed the fight ; and the firing in front breezed up more angrily than before . A warrior ran in , crying out that the Iroquois were giving ground , and that there were Frenchmen among the Illinois who fired at them . On this , the clamor around Tonty was redoubled . Some wished to kill him at once ; others resisted . Several times , he felt a hand at the back of his head , lifting up his hair , and , turning , saw a savage with a knife , standing as if ready to scalp him . Footnote : " Il en avoit un derriere moi qui tenoit un couteau dans sa main , et qui de temps en temps me levoit les cheveux. "  --  Tonty , Memoire , MS . The Dernieres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ je vis bien a sa contenance et a sa mine que son dessein etoit de m'enlever la chevelure ... je le priai de vouloir du moins se donner un peu de patience , et d'attendre que ses Maitres eussent decide de mon sort . " A Seneca chief demanded that he should be burned . An Onondaga chief , a friend of La Salle , was for setting him free . The dispute grew fierce and hot . Tonty told them that the Illinois were twelve hundred strong , and that sixty Frenchmen were at the village , ready to back them . This invention , though not fully believed , had no little effect . The friendly Onondaga carried his point ; and the Iroquois , having failed to surprise their enemies as they had hoped , now saw an opportunity to delude them by a truce . They sent back Tonty with a belt of peace ; he held it aloft in sight of the Illinois ; chiefs and old warriors ran to stop the fight ; the yells and the firing ceased , and Tonty , like one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with loss of blood , staggered across the intervening prairie to rejoin his friends . He was met by the two friars , Ribourde and Membre , who , in their secluded hut a league from the village , had but lately heard of what was passing , and who now , with benedictions and thanksgiving , ran to embrace him as a man escaped from the jaws of death . The Illinois now withdrew , re-embarking in their canoes , and crossing again to their lodges ; but scarcely had they reached them , when their enemies appeared at the edge of the forest on the opposite bank . Many found means to cross , and , under the pretext of seeking for provisions , began to hover in bands about the skirts of the town , constantly increasing in numbers . Had the Illinois dared to remain , a massacre would doubtless have ensued ; but they knew their foe too well , set fire to their lodges , embarked in haste , and paddled down the stream to rejoin their women and children at the sanctuary among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river , took possession of the abandoned town , building for themselves a rude redoubt , or fort , of the trunks of trees and of the posts and poles , forming the framework of the lodges which escaped the fire . Here they ensconced themselves , and finished the work of havoc at their leisure . Tonty and his companions still occupied their hut ; but the Iroquois , becoming suspicious of them , forced them to remove to the fort , crowded as it was with the savage crew . On the second day , there was an alarm . The Illinois appeared in numbers on the low hills , half a mile behind the town ; and the Iroquois , who had felt their courage , and who had been told by Tonty that they were twice as numerous as themselves , showed symptoms of no little uneasiness . They proposed that he should act as mediator , to which he gladly assented , and crossed the meadow towards the Illinois , accompanied by Membre , and by an Iroquois who was sent as a hostage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambassadors some refreshment , which they sorely needed , and sent back with them a young man of their nation as a hostage on their part . This indiscreet youth nearly proved the ruin of the negotiation ; for he was no sooner among the Iroquois than he showed such an eagerness to close the treaty , made such promises , professed such gratitude , and betrayed so rashly the numerical weakness of the Illinois , that he revived all the insolence of the invaders . They turned furiously upon Tonty and charged him with having robbed them of the glory and the spoils of victory . " Where are all your Illinois warriors , and where are the sixty Frenchmen that you said were among them ? " It needed all Tonty 's tact and coolness to extricate himself from this new danger . The treaty was at length concluded ; but scarcely was it made , when the Iroquois prepared to break it , and set about constructing canoes of elm-bark in which to attack the Illinois women and children in their island sanctuary . Tonty warned his allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction . The Iroquois , on their part , grew hourly more jealous of him , and would certainly have killed him , had it not been their policy to keep the peace with Frontenac and the French . Several days after , they summoned him and Membre to a council . Six packs of beaver skin were brought in , and the savage orator presented them to Tonty in turn , explaining their meaning as he did so . The first two were to declare that the children of Count Frontenac , that is , the Illinois , should not be eaten ; the next was a plaster to heal Tonty 's wound ; the next was oil wherewith to anoint him and Membre , that they might not be fatigued in travelling ; the next proclaimed that the sun was bright ; and the sixth and last required them to decamp and go home . Footnote : An Indian speech , it will be remembered , is without validity , if not confirmed by presents , each of which has its special interpretation . The meaning of the fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright ,  --  " que le soleil etoit beau , " that is , that the weather was favorable for travelling ,  --  is curiously misconceived by the editor of the Dernieres Decouvertes , who improves upon his original by substituting the words " par le cinquieme paquet ils nous exhortoient a adorer le Soleil . " Tonty thanked them for their gifts , but demanded when they themselves meant to go and leave the Illinois in peace . At this the conclave grew angry , and , despite their late pledge , some of them said that before they went , they would eat Illinois flesh . Tonty instantly kicked away the packs of beaver skin , the Indian symbol of the scornful rejection of a proposal ; telling them that since they meant to eat the Governor 's children , he would have none of their presents . The chiefs , in a rage , rose and drove him from the lodge . The French withdrew to their hut , where they stood all night on the watch , expecting an attack , and resolved to sell their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begone . Tonty , with an admirable fidelity and courage , had done all in the power of man to protect the allies of Canada against their ferocious assailants ; and he thought it unwise to persist farther in a course which could lead to no good , and which would probably end in the destruction of the whole party . He embarked in a leaky canoe with Membre , Ribourde , Boisrondet , and the remaining two men , and began to ascend the river . After paddling about five leagues , they landed to dry their baggage and repair their crazy vessel , when Father Ribourde , breviary in hand , strolled across the sunny meadows for an hour of meditation among the neighboring groves . Evening approached , and he did not return . Tonty with one of the men went to look for him , and , following his tracks , presently discovered those of a band of Indians , who had apparently seized or murdered him . Still , they did not despair . They fired their guns to guide him , should he still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , then crossing the river , lay watching it from the other side . At midnight , they saw the figure of a man hovering around the blaze ; then many more appeared , but Ribourde was not among them . In truth , a band of Kickapoos , enemies of the Iroquois , about whose camp they had been prowling in quest of scalps , had met and wantonly murdered the inoffensive old man . They carried his scalp to their village , and danced around it in triumph , pretending to have taken it from an enemy . Thus , in his sixty-fifth year , the only heir of a wealthy Burgundian house perished under the war-clubs of the savages , for whose salvation he had renounced station , ease , and affluence . Footnote : Tonty , Memoire , MS . Membre in Le Clercq , ii . 191 .

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , followed them along the opposite bank , each night encamping face to face with them ; and thus the adverse bands moved slowly southward , till they were near the mouth of the river . Hitherto , the compact array of the Illinois had held their enemies in check ; but now , suffering from hunger , and lulled into security by the assurances of the Iroquois that their object was not to destroy them , but only to drive them from the country , they rashly separated into their several tribes . Some descended the Mississippi ; some , more prudent , crossed to the western side . One of their principal tribes , the Tamaroas , more credulous than the rest , had the fatuity to remain near the mouth of the Illinois , where they were speedily assailed by all the force of the Iroquois . The men fled , and very few of them were killed ; but the women and children were captured to the number , it is said , of seven hundred . Footnote : Relation des Decouvertes , MS . Frontenac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 147 . A memoir of Duchesneau makes the number twelve hundred . Then followed that scene of torture , of which , some two weeks later , La Salle saw the revolting traces .

Sated , at length , with horrors , the conquerors withdrew , leading with them a host of captives , and exulting in their triumphs over women , children , and the dead . After the death of Father Ribourde , Tonty and his companions remained searching for him till noon of the next day , and then , in despair of again seeing him , resumed their journey . They ascended the river , leaving no token of their passage at the junction of its northern and southern branches . For food , they gathered acorns and dug roots in the meadows . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , they set out on foot for Lake Michigan . Boisrondet wandered off , and was lost . He had dropped the flint of his gun , and he had no bullets ; but he cut a pewter porringer into slugs with which he shot wild turkeys , by discharging his piece with a firebrand ; and after several days he had the good fortune to rejoin the party . Their object was to reach the Pottawattamies of Green Bay . Had they aimed at Michillimackinac , they would have found an asylum with La Forest at the fort on the St. Joseph ; but unhappily they passed westward of that post , and , by way of Chicago , followed the borders of Lake Michigan northward . The cold was intense , and they had much ado to grub up wild onions from the frozen ground to save themselves from starving . Tonty fell ill of a fever and a swelling of the limbs , which disabled him from travelling , and hence ensued a long delay . At length they neared Green Bay , where they would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frozen squashes in the fields of an empty Indian town . It was the end of November before they found the Pottawattamies , and were warmly greeted by their chief , who had befriended La Salle the year before , and who , in his enthusiasm for the French , was wont to say that he knew but three great captains in the world , Frontenac , La Salle , and himself . Footnote : Membre , in Le Clercq , ii . 199 . Of the three , or rather four narratives , on which this chapter mainly rests , the best is that contained in the manuscript of 1681 , entitled the Relation des Decouvertes . This portion of it , which bears every evidence of accuracy , was certainly supplied by Tonty himself or one of his companions . The Memoire of Tonty is wholly distinct . It is a modest and simple statement , of which the chief fault is its brevity . He undoubtedly wrote another and more detailed narrative , which has been used by the editor of the Dernieres Decouvertes , printed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less liberties with his original in this part of the book than in many others . The narrative of Membre sustains that of Tonty , except in one or two unimportant points , where the writer 's vanity seems to have gained the better of his veracity . While Tonty rests at Green Bay , and La Salle at the fort on the St. Joseph , we will leave them for a time to trace the strange adventures of the errant friar , Father Louis Hennepin . THE ILLINOIS TOWN . The site of the great Illinois town .  --  This has not till now been determined , though there have been various conjectures concerning it . From a study of the contemporary documents and maps , I became satisfied , first , that the branch of the River Illinois , called the " Big Vermilion , " was the Aramoni of the French explorers ; and , secondly , that the cliff called " Starved Rock " was that known to the French as Le Rocher , or the Rock of St. Louis . If I was right in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established ; for there is abundant proof that it was on the north side of the river , above the Aramoni , and below Le Rocher . I accordingly went to the village of Utica , which , as I judged by the map , was very near the point in question , and mounted to the top of one of the hills immediately behind it , whence I could see the valley of the Illinois for miles , bounded on the farther side by a range of hills , in some parts rocky and precipitous , and in others covered with forests . Far on the right , was a gap in these hills , through which the Big Vermilion flowed to join the Illinois ; and somewhat towards the left , at the distance of a mile and a half , was a huge cliff , rising perpendicularly from the opposite margin of the river . This I assumed to be Le Rocher of the French , though from where I stood I was unable to discern the distinctive features which I was prepared to find in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely what I had expected to see . There was a meadow on the hither side of the river , on which stood a farm-house ; and this , as it seemed to me , by its relations with surrounding objects , might be supposed to stand in the midst of the space once occupied by the Illinois town . On the way down from the hill , I met Mr. James Clark , the principal inhabitant of Utica , and one of the earliest settlers of this region . I accosted him , told him my objects , and requested a half hour 's conversation with him , at his leisure . He seemed interested in the inquiry , and said he would visit me early in the evening at the inn , where , accordingly , he soon appeared . The conversation took place in the porch , where a number of farmers and others were gathered . I asked Mr. Clark if any Indian remains were found in the neighborhood . " Yes , " he replied , " plenty of them . " I then inquired if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than elsewhere . " Yes , " he answered again , pointing towards the farm-house on the meadow : " on my farm down yonder by the river , my tenant ploughs up teeth and bones by the peck every spring , besides arrow-heads , beads , stone hatchets , and other things of that sort . " I replied that this was precisely what I had expected , as I had been led to believe that the principal town of the Illinois Indians once covered that very spot . " If , " I added , " I am right in this belief , the great rock beyond the river is the one which the first explorers occupied as a fort , and I can describe it to you from their accounts of it , though I have never seen it except from the top of the hill where the trees on and around it prevented me from seeing any part but the front . " The men present now gathered around to listen . " The rock , " I continued , " is nearly a hundred and fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The front and two sides are perpendicular and inaccessible , but there is one place where it is possible for a man to climb up ; though with difficulty . The top is large enough and level enough for houses and fortifications . " Here several of the men exclaimed , " That 's just it . " " You 've hit it exactly . " I then asked if there was any other rock on that side of the river which could answer to the description . They all agreed that there was no such rock on either side , along the whole length of the river . I then said , " If the Indian town was in the place where I suppose it to have been , I can tell you the nature of the country which lies behind the hills on the farther side of the river , though I know nothing about it except what I have learned from writings nearly two centuries old . From the top of the hills you look out upon a great prairie reaching as far as you can see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following the course of a stream which enters the main river a few miles below . " ( See ante , p. 205 , note . ) " You are exactly right again , " replied Mr. Clark , " we call that belt of timber the ' Vermilion Woods , ' and the stream is the Big Vermilion . " " Then , " I said , " the Big Vermilion is the river which the French called the Aramoni : ' Starved Rock ' is the same on which they built a fort called St. Louis , in the year 1682 ; and your farm is on the site of the great town of the Illinois . " I spent the next day in examining these localities , and was fully confirmed in my conclusions . Mr. Clark 's tenant showed me the spot where the human bones were ploughed up . It was no doubt the graveyard violated by the Iroquois . The Illinois returned to the village after their defeat , and long continued to occupy it . The scattered bones were probably collected and restored to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE ADVENTURES OF HENNEPIN . HENNEPIN AN IMPOSTOR.  --  HIS PRETENDED DISCOVERY .  --  HIS ACTUAL DISCOVERY .  --  CAPTURED BY THE SIOUX .  --  THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI . It was on the last day of the winter that preceded the invasion of the Iroquois , that Father Hennepin , with his two companions , Accau and Du Gay , had set out from Fort Crevecoeur to explore the Illinois to its mouth . It appears from his own later statements , as well as from those of Tonty , that more than this was expected of him , and that La Salle had instructed him to explore , not alone the Illinois , but also the Upper Mississippi . That he actually did so , there is no reasonable doubt ; and , could he have contented himself with telling the truth , his name would have stood high as a bold and vigorous discoverer . But his vicious attempts to malign his commander , and plunder him of his laurels , have wrapped his genuine merit in a cloud . Hennepin 's first book was published soon after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still alive . In it , he relates the accomplishment of the instructions given him , without the smallest intimation that he did more , Footnote : Description de la Louisiane , nouvellement decouverte , Paris , 1683 . Fourteen years after , when La Salle was dead , he published another edition of his travels , Footnote : Nouvelle Decouverte d'un tres grand Pays situe dans l'Amerique , Utrecht , 1697 in which he advanced a new and surprising pretension . Reasons connected with his personal safety , he declares , before compelled him to remain silent ; but a time at length has come when the truth must be revealed . And he proceeds to affirm that , before ascending the Mississippi , he , with his two men , explored its whole course from the Illinois to the sea , thus anticipating the discovery which forms the crowning laurel of La Salle . " I am resolved , " he says , " to make known here to the whole world the mystery of this discovery , which I have hitherto concealed , that I might not offend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the glory and all the knowledge of it to himself . It is for this that he sacrificed many persons whose lives he exposed , to prevent them from making known what they had seen , and thereby crossing his secret plans .... I was certain that if I went down the Mississippi , he would not fail to traduce me to my superiors for not taking the northern route , which I was to have followed in accordance with his desire and the plan we had made together . But I saw myself on the point of dying of hunger , and knew not what to do ; because the two men who were with me threatened openly to leave me in the night , and carry off the canoe , and every thing in it , if I prevented them from going down the river to the nations below . Finding myself in this dilemma , I thought that I ought not to hesitate , and that I ought to prefer my own . safety to the violent passion which possessed the Sieur de la Salle of enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeing that I had made up my mind to follow them , promised me entire fidelity ; so , after we had shaken hands together as a mutual pledge , we set out on our voyage . " Footnote : Nouvelle Decouverte , 248 , 250 , 251 . He then proceeds to recount , at length , the particulars of his alleged exploration . The story was distrusted from the first . Footnote : See the preface of the Spanish translation by Don Sebastian Fernandez de Medrano , 1699 , and also the letter of Gravier , dated 1701 , in Shea 's Early Voyages on the Mississippi . Barcia , Charlevoix , Kalm , and other early writers , put a low value on Hennepin 's veracity . Why had he not told it before ? An excess of modesty , a lack of self-assertion , or a too sensitive reluctance to wound the susceptibilities of others , had never been found among his foibles . Yet some , perhaps , might have believed him , had he not , in the first edition of his book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voyage in question . " We had some designs , " he says , " of going down the River Colbert Mississippi as far as its mouth ; but the tribes that took us prisoners gave us no time to navigate this river both up and down . " Footnote : Description de la Louisiane , 218 . In declaring to the world the achievement which he had so long concealed and so explicitly denied , the worthy missionary found himself in serious embarrassment . In his first book , he had stated that , on the twelfth of March , he left the mouth of the Illinois on his way northward , and that , on the eleventh of April , he was captured by the Sioux , near the mouth of the Wisconsin , five hundred miles above . This would give him only a month to make his alleged canoe-voyage from the Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico , and again upward to the place of his capture ,  --  a distance of three thousand two hundred and sixty miles . With his means of transportation , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the following year , with a far better equipment , was more than three months and a half in making the journey . A Mississippi trading-boat of the last generation , with sails and oars , ascending against the current , was thought to do remarkably well if it could make twenty miles a day . Hennepin , if we believe his own statements , must have ascended at an average rate of sixty miles , though his canoe was large and heavily laden . He saw the difficulty ; but on the other hand , he saw that he could not greatly change either date without confusing the parts of his narrative which preceded and which followed . In this perplexity , he chose a middle course , which only involved him in additional contradictions . Having , as he affirms , gone down to the Gulf and returned to the mouth of the Illinois , he set out thence to explore the river above ; and he assigns the twenty-fourth of April as the date of this departure . This gives him forty-three days for his voyage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther , we find that , having left the Illinois on the twenty-fourth , he paddled his canoe two hundred leagues northward , and was then captured by the Sioux on the twelfth of the same month . In short , he ensnares himself in a hopeless confusion of dates . Footnote : Hennepin here falls into gratuitous inconsistencies . In the edition of 1697 , in order to gain a little time , he says that he left the Illinois on his voyage southward on the eighth of March , 1680 ; and yet , in the preceding chapter , he repeats the statement of the first edition , that he was detained at the Illinois by floating ice till the twelfth . Again , he says in the first edition , that he was captured by the Sioux on the eleventh of April ; and in the edition of 1697 , he changes this date to the twelfth , without gaining any advantage by doing so . Here , one would think , is sufficient reason , for rejecting his story ; and yet the general truth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might easily deceive a careless reader and perplex a critical one . These , however , are easily explained . Six years before Hennepin published his pretended discovery , his brother friar , Father Chretien Le Clercq , published an account of the Recollet missions among the Indians , under the title of " Etablissement de la Foi . " This book was suppressed by the French government ; but a few copies fortunately survived . One of these is now before me . It contains the journal of Father Zenobe Membre , on his descent of the Mississippi in 1681 , in company with La Salle . The slightest comparison of his narrative with that of Hennepin is sufficient to show that the latter framed his own story out of incidents and descriptions furnished by his brother missionary , often using his very words , and sometimes copying entire pages , with no other alterations than such as were necessary to make himself , instead of La Salle and his companions , the hero of the exploit . The records of literary piracy may be searched in vain for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have copied from the unpublished journal of Membre , which the latter had placed in the hands of his superior , or he may have compiled from Le Clercq 's book , relying on the suppression of the edition to prevent detection . He certainly saw and used it , for he elsewhere borrows the exact words of the editor . He is so careless that he steals from Membre passages which he might easily have written for himself , as , for example , a description of the opossum and another of the cougar , animals with which he was acquainted . Compare the following pages of the Nouvelle Decouverte with the corresponding pages of Le Clercq : Hennepin , 252 , Le Clercq , ii . 217 ; H. 253 , Le C. ii . 218 ; H. 257 , Le C. ii . 221 ; H. 259 , Le C. ii . 224 ; H. 262 , Le C. ii . 226 ; H. 265 , Le C. ii . 229 ; H. 267 , Le C. ii . 283 ; H. 270 , Le C. ii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 240 ; H. 295 , Le C. ii . 249 ; H. 296 , Le C. ii . 250 ; H. 297 , Le C. ii . 253 ; H. 299 , Le C. ii . 254 ; H. 301 , Le C. ii . 257 . Some of these parallel passages will be found in Sparks 's Life of La Salle , where this remarkable fraud was first fully exposed . In Shea 's Discovery of the Mississippi , there is an excellent critical examination of Hennepin 's works . His plagiarisms from Le Clercq are not confined to the passages cited above ; for , in his later editions , he stole largely from other parts of the suppressed Etablissement de la Foi . Such being the case , what faith can we put in the rest of Hennepin 's story ? Fortunately , there are tests by which the earlier parts of his book can be tried ; and , on the whole , they square exceedingly well with contemporary records of undoubted authenticity . Bating his exaggerations respecting the Falls of Niagara , his local descriptions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He constantly , it is true , magnifies his own acts , and thrusts himself forward as one of the chiefs of an enterprise , to the costs of which he had contributed nothing , and to which he was merely an appendage ; and yet , till he reaches the Mississippi , there can be no doubt that , in the main , he tells the truth . As for his ascent of that river to the country of the Sioux , the general statement is fully confirmed by allusions of Tonty , and other contemporary writers . Footnote : It is certain that persons having the best means of information believed at the time in Hennepin 's story of his journeys on the Upper Mississippi . The compiler of the Relation des Decouvertes , who was in close relations with La Salle and those who acted with him , does not intimate a doubt of the truth of the report which Hennepin , on his return , gave to the Provincial Commissary of his Order , and which is in substance the same which he published two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was written only a few months after the return of Hennepin , and embodies the pith of his narrative of the Upper Mississippi , no part of which had then been published . For the details of the journey , we must look on Hennepin alone ; whose account of the company and of the peculiar traits of its Indian occupation afford , as far as they go , good evidence of truth . Indeed , this part of his narrative could only have been written by one well versed in the savage life of this north-western region . Footnote : In this connection , it is well to examine the various Sioux words which Hennepin uses incidentally , and which he must have acquired by personal intercourse with the tribe , as no Frenchman then understood the language . These words , as far as my information reaches , are in every instance correct . Thus , he says that the Sioux called his breviary a " bad spirit "  --  Ouackanche . Wakanshe , or Wakansheclia , would express the same meaning in modern English spelling . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manzaouackanche , which he translates , " iron possessed with a bad spirit . " The western Sioux to this day call a gun Manzawakan , " metal possessed with a spirit . " Chonga ( shonka ) , " a , dog , " Ouasi ( wahsee ) , " a pine-tree , " Chinnen ( shinnan ) , " a robe , " or " garment , " and other words , are given correctly , with their interpretations . The word Louis , affirmed by Hennepin to mean " the sun , " seems at first sight a wilful inaccuracy , as this is not the word used in general by the Sioux . The Yankton band of this people , however , call the sun oouee , which , it is evident , represents the French pronunciation of Louis , omitting the initial letter . This , Hennepin would be apt enough to supply , thereby conferring a compliment alike on himself , Louis Hennepin , and on the King , Louis XIV. , who , to the indignation of his brother monarchs , had chosen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched upon by Hennepin , while recounting his life among the Sioux , seem to me to afford a strong presumption of an actual experience . I speak on this point with the more confidence , as the Indians in whose lodges I was once domesticated for several weeks , belonged to a western band of the same people . Trusting , then , to his guidance in the absence of better , let us follow in the wake of his adventurous canoe . It was laden deeply ; with goods belonging to La Salle , and meant by handing presents to Indians on the way , though the travelers , it appears , proposed to use them in trading of their own account . The friar was still wrapped in his gray capote and hood , shod with sandals , and decorated with the cord of St. Francis . As for his two companions , Accau Footnote : Called Ako by Hennepin . In contemporary documents it is written Accau , Acau , D'Accau Dacau , Dacan , and d'Accault. and Du Gay , it is tolerably clear that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hennepin , after his custom , thrusts himself into the foremost place . Both were somewhat above the station of ordinary hired hands ; and Du Gay had an uncle who was an ecclesiastic of good credit at Amiens , his native place . In the forests that overhung the river , the buds were feebly swelling with advancing spring . There was game enough . They killed buffalo , deer , beavers , wild turkeys , and now and then a bear swimming in the river . With these , and the fish which they caught in abundance , they fared sumptuously , though it was the season of Lent . They were exemplary , however , at their devotions . Hennepin said prayers at morning and night , and the angelus at noon , adding a petition to St. Anthony of Padua , that he would save them from the peril that beset their way . In truth , there was a lion in the path . The ferocious character of the Sioux , or Dacotah , who occupied the region of the Upper Mississippi , was already known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prayed that it might be his fortune to meet them , not by night , but by day . On the eleventh or twelfth of April , they stopped in the afternoon to repair their canoe ; and Hennepin busied himself in daubing it with pitch , while the others cooked a turkey . Suddenly a fleet of Sioux canoes swept into sight , bearing a war-party of a hundred and twenty naked savages , who , on seeing the travellers , raised a hideous clamor ; and some leaping ashore and others into the water , they surrounded the astonished Frenchmen in an instant . Footnote : The edition of 1683 says that there were thirty-three canoes : that of 1697 raises the number to fifty . The number of Indians is the same in both . The later narrative is more in detail than the former . Hennepin held out the peace-pipe , but one of them snatched it from him . Next , he hastened to proffer a gift of Martinique tobacco , which was better received . Some of the old warriors repeated the name Miamiha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way to attack the Miamis ; on which Hennepin , with the help of signs and of marks which he drew on the sand with a stick , explained that the Miamis had gone across the Mississippi beyond their reach . Hereupon , he says that three or four old men placed their hands on his head , and began a dismal wailing ; while he with his handkerchief wiped away their tears in order to evince sympathy with their affliction , from whatever cause arising . Notwithstanding this demonstration of tenderness , they refused to smoke with him in his peace-pipe , and forced him and his companions to embark and paddle across the river ; while they all followed behind , uttering yells and howlings which froze the missionary 's blood . On reaching the farther side , they made their camp-fires , and allowed their prisoners to do the same . Accau and Du Gay slung their kettle ; while Hennepin , to propitiate the Sioux , carried to them two turkeys , of which there were several in the canoe . The warriors had seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Frenchmen ; and two chiefs presently explained to the friar , by significant signs , that it had been resolved that his head should be split with a war-club . This produced the effect which was no doubt intended . Hennepin ran to the canoe , and quickly returned with one of the men , both loaded with presents , which he threw into the midst of the assembly ; and then , bowing his head , offered them at the same time a hatchet with which to kill him if they wished to do so . His gifts and his submission seemed to appease them . They gave him and his companions a dish of beaver 's flesh ; but , to his great concern , they returned his peace-pipe , an act which he interpreted as a sign of danger . That night , the Frenchmen slept little , expecting to be murdered before morning . There was , in fact , a great division of opinion among the Sioux . Some were for killing them , and taking their goods ; while others , eager above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knives , hatchets , and guns of which they had heard the value , contended that it would be impolitic to discourage the trade by putting to death its pioneers . Scarcely had morning dawned on the anxious captives , when a young chief , naked , and painted from head to foot , appeared before them , and asked for the pipe , which the friar gladly gave him . He filled it , smoked it , made the warriors do the same , and , having given this hopeful pledge of amity , told the Frenchmen that , since the Miamis were out of reach , the war-party would return home , and that they must accompany them . To this Hennepin gladly agreed , having , as he declares , his great work of exploration so much at heart that he rejoiced in the prospect of achieving it even in their company . He soon , however , had a foretaste of the affliction in store for him ; for , when he opened his breviary and began to mutter his morning devotion , his new companions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gave him to understand that his book was a bad spirit with which he must hold no more converse . They thought , indeed , that he was muttering a charm for their destruction . Accau and Du Gay , conscious of the danger , begged the friar to dispense with his devotions , lest he and they alike should be tomahawked ; but Hennepin says that his sense of duty rose superior to his fears , and that he was resolved to repeat his office at all hazards , though not until he had asked pardon of his two friends for thus imperilling their lives . Fortunately , he presently discovered a device by which his devotion and his prudence were completely reconciled . He ceased the muttering which had alarmed the Indians , and , with the breviary open on his knees , sang the service in loud and cheerful tones . As this had no savor of sorcery , and as they now imagined that the book was teaching its owner to sing for their amusement , they conceived a favorable opinion of both alike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestors of those who committed the horrible but not unprovoked massacres of 1863 , in the valley of the St. Peter . Hennepin complains bitterly of their treatment of him , which , however , seems to have been tolerably good . Afraid that he would lag behind , as his canoe was heavy and slow , Footnote : And yet it had , by his account , made a distance of thirteen hundred and eighty miles from the mouth of the Mississippi upward in twenty-four days. they placed several warriors in it , to aid him and his men in paddling . They kept on their way from morning till night , building huts for their bivouac when it rained , and sleeping on the open ground when the weather was fair , which , says Hennepin , " gave us a good opportunity to contemplate the moon and stars . " The three Frenchmen took the precaution of sleeping at the side of the young chief who had been the first to smoke the peacepipe , and who seemed inclined to befriend them ; but there was another chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having lost a son in war with the Miamis , was angry that the party had abandoned their expedition , and thus deprived him of his revenge . He therefore kept up a dismal lament through half the night ; while other old men , crouching over Hennepin as he lay trying to sleep , stroked him with their hands , and uttered wailings so lugubrious that he was forced to the belief that he had been doomed to death , and that they were charitably bemoaning his fate . Footnote : This weeping and wailing over Hennepin once seemed to me an anomaly in his account of Sioux manners , as I am not aware that such practices are to be found among them at present . They are mentioned , however , by other early writers . Le Sueur , who was among them in 1699-1700 , was wept over no less than Hennepin . See the abstract of his journal in La Harpe . One night , they were , for some reason , unable to bivouac near their protector , and were forced to make their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were soon beset by a crowd of Indians , who told them that Aquipaguetin had at length resolved to tomahawk them . The malcontents were gathered in a knot at a little distance , and Hennepin hastened to appease them by another gift of knives and tobacco . This was but one of the devices of the old chief to deprive them of their goods without robbing them outright . He had with him the bones of a deceased relative , which he was carrying home wrapped in skins prepared with smoke after the Indian fashion , and gayly decorated with bands of dyed porcupine quills . He would summon his warriors , and , placing these relics in the midst of the assembly , call on all present to smoke in their honor ; after which Hennepin was required to offer a more substantial tribute in the shape of cloth , beads , hatchets , tobacco , and the like , to be laid upon the bundle of bones . The gifts thus acquired were then , in the name of the deceased , distributed among the persons present . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited the chiefs and warriors to feast upon it . They accordingly assembled on a prairie , west of the river ; and , the banquet over , they danced a " medicine-dance . " They were all painted from head to foot , with their hair oiled , garnished with red and white feathers , and powdered with the down of birds . In this guise , they set their arms akimbo , and fell to stamping with such fury that the hard prairie was dented with the prints of their moccasons ; while the chief 's son , crying at the top of his throat , gave to each in turn the pipe of war . Meanwhile , the chief himself , singing in a loud and rueful voice , placed his hands on the heads of the three Frenchmen , and from time to time interrupted his music to utter a vehement harangue . Hennepin could not understand the words , but his heart sank as the conviction grew strong within him that these ceremonies tended to his destruction . It seems , however , that , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minority , the greater part being averse to either killing or robbing the three strangers . Every morning , at daybreak , an old warrior shouted the signal of departure ; and the recumbent savages leaped up , manned their birchen fleet , and plied their paddles against the current , often without waiting to break their fast . Sometimes they stopped for a buffalo-hunt on the neighboring prairies ; and there was no lack of provisions . They passed Lake Pepin , which Hennepin called the Lake of Tears , by reason of the howlings and lamentations here uttered over him by Aquipaguetin ; and , nineteen days after his capture , landed near the site of St. Paul . The father 's sorrows now began in earnest . The Indians broke his canoe to pieces , having first hidden their own among the alder-bushes . As they belonged to different bands and different villages , their mutual jealousy now overcame all their prudence , and each proceeded to claim his share of the captives and the booty . Happily , they made an amicable distribution , or it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each taking his share , not forgetting the priestly vestments of Hennepin , the splendor of which they could not sufficiently admire , they set out across the country for their villages , which lay towards the north , in the neighborhood of Lake Buade , now called Mille Lac . Being , says Hennepin , exceedingly tall and active , they walked at a prodigious speed , insomuch that no European could long keep pace with them . Though the month of May had begun , there were frosts at night ; and the marshes and ponds were glazed with ice , which cut the missionary 's legs as he waded through . They swam the larger streams , and Hennepin nearly perished with cold as be emerged from the icy current . His two companions , who were smaller than he , and who could not swim , were carried over on the backs of the Indians . They showed , however , no little endurance ; and he declares that he should have dropped by the way , but for their support . Seeing him disposed to lag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire to the dry grass behind him , and then , taking him by the hands , ran forward with him to escape the flames . To add to his misery , he was nearly famished , as they gave him only a small piece of smoked meat , once a day , though it does not appear that they themselves fared better . On the fifth day , being by this time in extremity , he saw a crowd of squaws and children approaching over the prairie , and presently descried the bark lodges of an Indian town . The goal was reached . He was among the homes of the Sioux . CHAPTER XIX. 1680 , 1681 . HENNEPIN AMONG THE SIOUX . SIGNS OP DANGER .  --  ADOPTION .  --  HENNEPIN AND HIS INDIAN RELATIVES .  --  THE HUNTING PARTY .  --  THE SIOUX CAMP .  --  FALLS OF ST . ANTHONY .  --  A VAGABOND FRIAR .  --  HIS ADVENTURES ON THE MISSISSIPPI .  --  GREYSOLON DU LHUT.  --  RETURN TO CIVILIZATION . As Hennepin entered the village , he beheld a sight which caused him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodges were certain stakes , to which were attached bundles of straw , intended , as he supposed , for burning him and his friends alive . His concern was redoubled when he saw the condition of the Picard Du Gay , whose hair and face had been painted with divers colors , and whose head was decorated with a tuft of white feathers . In this guise , he was entering the village , followed by a crowd of Sioux , who compelled him to sing and keep time to his own music by rattling a dried gourd containing a number of pebbles . The omens , indeed , were exceedingly threatening ; for treatment like this was usually followed by the speedy immolation of the captive . Hennepin ascribes it to the effect of his invocations , that , being led into one of the lodges , among a throng of staring squaws and children , he and his companions were seated on the ground , and presented with large dishes of birch bark , containing a mess of wild rice boiled with dried whortleberries ; a repast which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his lot since the day of his captivity . Footnote : The Sioux , or Dacotah , as they call themselves , were a numerous people , separated into three great divisions , which were again subdivided into bands . Those among whom Hennepin was a prisoner belonged to the division known as the Issanti , Issanyati , or , as he writes it , Issati , of which the principal band was the Meddewakantonwan . The other great divisions , the Yanktons and the Tintonwans , or Tetons , lived west of the Mississippi , extending beyond the Missouri , and ranging as far as the Rocky Mountains . The Issanti cultivated the soil , but the extreme western bands subsisted on the buffalo alone . The former had two kinds of dwelling ,  --  the teepee or skin lodge , and the bark lodge . The teepee , which was used by all the Sioux , consists of a covering of dressed buffalo hide stretched on a conical stack of poles . The bark lodge was peculiar to the eastern Sioux , and examples of it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the St. Peter 's . In its general character it was like the Huron and Iroquois houses , but was inferior in construction . It had a ridge roof framed of poles extending from the posts which formed the sides , and the whole was covered with elm-bark . The lodges in the villages to which Hennepin was conducted were probably of this kind . The name Sioux is an abbreviation of Nadouessioux , an Ojibwa word meaning enemies . The Ojibwas used it to designate this people , and occasionally also the Iroquois , being at deadly war with both . Rev. Stephen R. Riggs , for many years a missionary among the Issanti Sioux , says that this division consists of four distinct bands . They ceded all their lands east of the Mississippi to the United States in 1837 , and lived on the St. Peter 's till driven thence in consequence of the massacres of 1862 , 1863 . The Yankton Sioux consist of two bands , which are again subdivided . The Assiniboins , or Hohays , are an offshoot from the Yanktons , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teton Sioux , forming the most western division , and the largest , comprise seven bands , and are among the bravest and fiercest tenants of the prairie . The earliest French writers estimate the total number of the Sioux at forty thousand . Mr. Riggs , in 1852 , placed it at about twenty-five thousand . Lake many other Indian tribes , they seem practically incapable of civilization . This soothed his fears : but , as he allayed his famished appetite , he listened with anxious interest to the vehement jargon of the chiefs and warriors , who were disputing among themselves to whom the three captives should respectively belong ; for it seems that , as far as related to them , the question of distribution had not yet been definitely settled . The debate ended in the assigning of Hennepin to his old enemy Aquipaguetin ; who , however , far from persisting in his evil designs , adopted him on the spot as his son . The three companions must now part company . Du Gay , not yet quite reassured of his safety , hastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refused the offices of religion , which did not prevent the friar from embracing them both , as he says , with an extreme tenderness . Tired as he was , he was forced to set out with his self-styled father to his village , which was fortunately not far off . An unpleasant walk of a few miles through woods and marshes brought them to the borders of a sheet of water , apparently Lake Buade , where five of Aquipaguetin 's wives received the party in three canoes , and ferried them to an island on which the village stood . At the entrance of the chief 's lodge , Hennepin was met by a decrepit old Indian , withered with age , who offered him the peace-pipe , and placed him on a bear-skin which was spread by the fire . Here , to relieve his fatigue , for he was well-nigh spent , a small boy anointed his limbs with the fat of a wild cat , supposed to be sovereign in these cases by reason of the great agility of that animal . His new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with a buffalo robe , and showed him six or seven of his wives , who were thenceforth , he was told , to regard him as a son . The chief 's household was numerous ; and his allies and relations formed a considerable clan , of which the missionary found himself an involuntary member . He was scandalized when he saw one of his adopted brothers carrying on his back the bones of a deceased friend , wrapped in the chasuble of brocade which they had taken with other vestments from his box . Seeing their new relative so enfeebled that he could scarcely stand , the Indians made for him one of their sweating baths , Footnote : These baths consist of a small hut , covered closely with buffalo-skins , into which the patient and his friends enter , carefully closing every aperture . A pile of heated stones is placed in the middle , and water is poured upon them , raising a dense vapor . They are still , 1868 , in use among the Sioux and some other tribes. where they immersed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he thinks he derived great benefit . His strength gradually returned , in spite of his meagre fare ; for there was a dearth of food , and the squaws were less attentive to his wants than to those of their children . They respected him , however , as a person endowed with occult powers , and stood in no little awe of a pocket compass which he had with him , as well as of a small metal pot with feet moulded after the face of a lion . This last seemed in their eyes a " medicine " of the most formidable nature , and they would not touch it without first wrapping it in a beaver-skin . For the rest , Hennepin made himself useful in various ways . He shaved the heads of the children , as was the custom of the tribe , bled certain asthmatic persons , and dosed others with orvietan , the famous panacea of his time , of which he had brought with him a good supply . With respect to his missionary functions , he seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Sioux vocabulary is to be regarded as preparatory to a future apostleship . " I could gain nothing over them , " he says , " in the way of their salvation , by reason of their natural stupidity . " Nevertheless , on one occasion he baptized a sick child , naming it Antoinette in honor of St. Anthony of Padua . It seemed to revive after the rite , but soon relapsed and presently died , " which , " he writes , " gave me great joy and satisfaction . " In this , he was like the Jesuits , who could find nothing but consolation in the death of a newly baptized infant , since it was thus assured of a paradise which , had it lived , it would probably have forfeited by sharing in the superstitions of its parents . With respect to Hennepin and his Indian father , there seems to have been little love on either side ; but Ouasicoude , the principal chief of the Sioux of this region , was the fast friend of the three white men . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been unable to prevent , as the Sioux had no laws , and their chiefs little power ; but he spoke his mind freely , and told Aquipaguetin and the rest , in full council , that they were like a dog who steals a piece of meat from a dish , and runs away with it . When Hennepin complained of hunger , the Indians had always promised him that early in the summer he should go with them on a buffalo hunt , and have food in abundance . The time at length came , and the inhabitants of all the neighboring villages prepared for departure , To each several band was assigned its special hunting-ground , and he was expected to accompany his Indian father . To this he demurred ; for he feared lest Aquipaguetin , angry at the words of the great chief , might take this opportunity to revenge the insult put upon him . He therefore gave out that he expected a party of " spirits , " that is to say , Frenchmen , to meet him at the mouth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and he declares that La Salle had in fact promised to send traders to that place . Be this as it may , the Indians believed him ; and , true or false , the assertion , as will be seen , answered the purpose for which it was made . The Indians set out in a body to the number of two hundred and fifty warriors , with their women and children . The three Frenchmen , who , though in different villages , had occasionally met during the two months of their captivity , were all of the party . They descended Rum River , which forms the outlet of Mille Lac , and which is called the St. Francis , by Hennepin . None of the Indians had offered to give him passage ; and , fearing lest he should be abandoned , he stood on the bank , hailing the passing canoes and begging to be taken in . Accau and Du Gay presently appeared , paddling a small canoe which the Indians had given them ; but they would not listen to the missionary 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , cried out that he , had paddled him long enough already . Two Indians , however , took pity on him , and brought him to the place of encampment , where Du Gay tried , to excuse himself for his conduct , but Accau was sullen and kept aloof . After reaching the Mississippi , the whole party encamped together opposite to the mouth of Rum River , pitching their tents of skin , or building their bark huts , on the slope of a hill by the side of the water . It was a wild scene , this camp of savages among whom as yet no traders had come and no handiwork of civilization had found its way ; the tall warriors , some nearly naked , some wrapped in buffalo robes , and some in shirts of dressed deerskin fringed with hair and embroidered with dyed porcupine quills , war-clubs of stone in their hands , and quivers at their backs filled with stone-headed arrows ; the squaws , cutting smoke-dried meat with knives of flint , and boiling it in rude earthen pots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrill cries , the troops of lean dogs , who disputed the meal with a crew of hungry children . The whole camp , indeed , was threatened with , starvation . The three white men could get no food but unripe berries , from the effects of which Hennepin thinks they might all have died , but for timely doses of his orvietan . Being tired of the Indians , he became anxious to set out for the Wisconsin to find the party of Frenchmen , real or imaginary , who were to meet him at that place . That he was permitted to do so was due to the influence of the great chief Ouasicoude , who always befriended him , and who had soundly berated his two companions for refusing him a seat in their canoe . Du Gay wished to go with him ; but Accau , who liked the Indian life as much as he disliked Hennepin , preferred to remain with the hunters . A small birch canoe was given to the two adventurers , together with an earthen pot ; and they had also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robe of beaver-skin . Thus equipped , they began their journey , and soon approached the Falls of St. Anthony , so named by Hennepin in honor of the inevitable St. Anthony of Padua . Footnote : Hennepin 's notice of the Falls of St. Anthony , though brief , is sufficiently accurate . He says , in his first edition , that they are forty or fifty feet high , but adds ten feet more in the edition of 1697 . In 1821 , according to Schoolcraft , the perpendicular fall measured forty feet . Great changes , however , have taken place here and are still in progress . The rock is a very soft , friable sandstone , overlaid by a stratum of limestone ; and it is crumbling with such rapidity under the action of the water that the cataract will soon be little more than a rapid . Other changes equally disastrous , in an artistic point of view , are going on even more quickly . Beside the falls stands a city , which , by an ingenious combination of the Greek and Sioux languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Waters , and which , in 1867 , contained ten thousand inhabitants , two national banks , and an opera-house , while its rival city of St. Anthony , immediately opposite , boasted a gigantic water-cure and a State university . In short , the great natural beauty of the place is utterly spoiled . As they were carrying their canoe by the cataract , they saw five or six Indians , who had gone before , one of whom had climbed into an oak-tree beside the principal fall , whence in a loud and lamentable voice he was haranguing the spirit of the waters , as a sacrifice to whom he had just hung a robe of beaver-skin among the branches . Footnote : Oanktayhee , the principal deity of the Sioux , was supposed to live under these falls , though he manifested himself in the form of a buffalo . It was he who created the earth , like the Algonquin Manabozho , from mud brought to him in the paws of a musk-rat . Carver , in 1766 , saw an Indian throw every thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this deity . Their attention was soon engrossed by another object . Looking over the edge of the cliff which overhung the river below the falls , Hennepin saw a snake , which , as he avers , was six feet long , Footnote : In the edition of 1683 . In that of 1697 he has grown to seven or eight feet . The bank-swallows still make their nests in these cliffs , boring easily into the soft incohesive sandstone. writhing upward towards the holes of the swallows in the face of the precipice , in order to devour their young . He pointed him out to Du Gay , and they pelted him with stones , till he fell into the river , but not before his contortions and the darting of his forked tongue had so affected the Picard 's imagination that he was haunted that night with a terrific incubus . They paddled sixty leagues down the river in the heats of July , and killed no large game but a single deer , the meat of which soon spoiled . Their main resource was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many involuntary fasts . They once captured one of more than common size ; and , as they were endeavoring to cut off his head , he was near avenging himself by snapping off Hennepin 's finger . There was a herd of buffalo in sight on the neighboring prairie ; and Du Gay went with his gun in pursuit of them , leaving the turtle in Hennepin 's custody . Scarcely was he gone when the friar , raising his eyes , saw that their canoe , which they had left at the edge of the water , had floated out into the current . Hastily turning the turtle on his back , he covered him with his habit of St. Francis , on which , for greater security , he laid a number of stones , and then , being a good swimmer , struck out in pursuit of the canoe , which he at length overtook . Finding that it would overset if he tried to climb into it , he pushed it before him to the shore , and then paddled towards the place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turtle . He had no sooner reached it than he heard a strange sound , and beheld a long file of buffalo ,  --  bulls , cows , and calves ,  --  entering the water not far off , to cross to the western bank . Having no gun , as became his apostolic vocation , he shouted to Du Gay , who presently appeared , running in all haste ; and they both paddled in pursuit of the game . Du Gay aimed at a young cow , and shot her in the head . She fell in shallow water near an island , where some of the herd had landed ; and , being unable to drag her out , they waded into the water and butchered her where she lay . It was forty-eight hours since they had tasted food . Hennepin made a fire , while Du Gay cut up the meat . They feasted so bountifully that they both fell ill , and were forced to remain two days on the island , taking doses of orvietan , before they were able to resume their journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke the meat of the cow ; and the hot sun soon robbed them of it . They had a few fish-hooks , but were not always successful in the use of them . On one occasion , being nearly famished , they set their line , and lay watching it . uttering prayers in turn . Suddenly , there was a great turmoil in the water . Du Gay ran to the line , and , with the help of Hennepin , drew in two large cat-fish . Footnote : Hennepin speaks of their size with astonishment , and says that the two together would weigh twenty-five pounds . Cat-fish have been taken in the Mississippi weighing more than a hundred and fifty pounds . The eagles , or fish-hawks , now and then dropped a newly caught fish , of which they gladly took possession ; and once they found a purveyor in an otter which they saw by the bank , devouring some object of an appearance so wonderful that Du Gay cried out that he had a devil between his paws . They scared him from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Hennepin correctly describes it , a species of sturgeon , with a bony projection from his snout in the shape of a paddle . They broke their fast upon him , undeterred by this eccentric appendage . If Hennepin had had an eye for scenery , he would have found in these his vagabond rovings wherewith to console himself in some measure for his frequent fasts . The young Mississippi , fresh from its northern springs , unstained as yet by unhallowed union with the riotous Missouri , flowed calmly on its way amid strange and unique beauties ; a wilderness , clothed with velvet grass ; forest-shadowed valleys ; lofty heights , whose smooth slopes seemed levelled with the scythe ; domes and pinnacles , ramparts and ruined towers , the work of no human hand . The canoe of the voyagers , borne on the tranquil current , glided in the shade of gray crags festooned with blossoming honeysuckles ; by trees mantled with wild grape-vines , dells bright with , the flowers of the white euphorbia , the blue gentian , and the purple balm ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chattered . They passed the great cliff whence the Indian maiden threw herself in her despair ; Footnote : The " Lover 's Leap , " or " Maiden 's Rock , " from which a Sioux girl , Winona , or the " Eldest Born , " is said to have thrown herself in the despair of disappointed affection . The story , which seems founded in truth , will be found , not without embellishments , in Mrs. Eastman 's Legends of the Sioux. and Lake Pepin lay before them , slumbering in the July sun ; the far-reaching sheets of sparkling water , the woody slopes , the tower-like crags , the grassy heights basking in sunlight or shadowed by the passing cloud ; all the fair outline of its graceful scenery , the finished and polished master work of Nature . And when at evening they made their bivouac fire , and drew up their canoe , while dim , sultry clouds veiled the west , and the flashes of the silent heat-lightning gleamed on the leaden water , they could listen , as they smoked their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whippoorwills , and the quavering scream of the owls . Other thoughts than the study of the picturesque occupied the mind of Hennepin , when one day he saw his Indian father , Aquipaguetin , whom he had supposed five hundred miles distant , descending the river with ten warriors in canoes . He was eager to be the first to meet the traders , who , as Hennepin had given out , were to come with their goods to the mouth of the Wisconsin . The two travellers trembled for the consequences of this encounter ; but the chief , after a short colloquy , passed on his way . In three days he returned in ill-humor , having found no traders at the appointed spot . The Picard was absent at the time , looking for game , and Hennepin was sitting under the shade of his blanket , which he had stretched on forked sticks to protect him from the sun , when he saw his adopted father approaching with a threatening look and a war-club in his hand . He attempted no violence , however , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after which he resumed his course up the river with his warriors . If Hennepin , as he avers , really expected a party of traders at the Wisconsin , the course he now took is sufficiently explicable . If he did not expect them , his obvious course was to rejoin Tonty on the Illinois , for which he seems to have had no inclination ; or to return to Canada by way of the Wisconsin , an attempt which involved the risk of starvation , as the two travellers had but ten charges of powder left . Assuming , then , his hope of the traders to have been real , he and Du Gay resolved , in the mean time , to join a large body of Sioux hunters , who , as Aquipaguetin had told them , were on a stream which he calls Bull River , now the Chippeway , entering the Mississippi near Lake Pepin . By so doing , they would gain a supply of food , and save themselves from the danger of encountering parties of roving warriors . They found this band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on a grand hunt along the borders of the Mississippi . Du Gay was separated for a time from Hennepin , who was placed in a canoe with a withered squaw more than eighty years old . In spite of her age , she handled her paddle with admirable address , and used it vigorously , as occasion required , to repress the gambols of three children , who , to Hennepin 's great annoyance , occupied the middle of the canoe . The hunt was successful . The Sioux warriors , active as deer , chased the buffalo on foot with their stone-headed arrows , on the plains behind the heights that bordered the river ; while the old men stood sentinels at the top , watching for the approach of enemies . One day an alarm was given . The warriors rushed towards the supposed point of danger , but found nothing more formidable than two squaws of their own nation , who brought strange news . A war-party of Sioux , they said , had gone towards Lake Superior , and met by the way five " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hennepin was full of curiosity to learn who the strangers might be ; and they , on their part , were said to have shown great anxiety to know the nationality of the three white men who , as they were told , were on the river . The hunt was over ; and the hunters , with Hennepin and his companion , were on their way northward to their towns , when they met the five " Spirits " at some distance below the Falls of St. Anthony . They proved to be Daniel Greysolon du Lhut , with four well-armed Frenchmen . This bold and enterprising man , stigmatized by the Intendant Duchesneau as a leader of coureurs de bois , was a cousin of Tonty , born at Lyons . He belonged to that caste of the lesser nobles , whose name was legion , and whose admirable military qualities shone forth so conspicuously in the wars of Louis XIV . Though his enterprises were independent of those of La Salle , they were , at this time , carried on in connection with Count Frontenac and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's uncle , Patron , was one ; while Louvigny , his brother-in-law , was in alliance with the Governor , and was an officer of his guard . Here , then , was a kind of family league , countenanced by Frontenac , and acting conjointly with him , in order , if the angry letters of the Intendant are to be believed , to reap a clandestine profit under the shadow of the Governor 's authority , and in violation of the royal ordinances . The rudest part of the work fell to the share of Du Lhut , who , with a persistent hardihood , not surpassed , perhaps , even by La Salle , was continually in the forest , in the Indian towns , or in remote wilderness outposts planted by himself , exploring , trading , fighting , ruling lawless savages , and whites scarcely less ungovernable , and , on one or more occasions , varying his life by crossing the ocean , to gain interviews with the colonial minister , Seignelay , amid the splendid vanities of Versailles . Strange to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gout , which , for more than a quarter of a century , grievously tormented him ; though for a time he thought himself cured by the intercession of the Iroquois saint , Catharine Tegahkouita , to whom he had made a vow to that end . He was , without doubt , an habitual breaker of the royal ordinances regulating the fur-trade ; yet his services were great to the colony and to the crown , and his name deserves a place of honor among the pioneers of American civilization . Footnote : The facts concerning Du Lhut have been gleaned from a variety of contemporary documents , chiefly the letters of his enemy , Duchesneau , who always puts him in the worst light , especially in his despatch to Seignelay of 10 Nov. 1679 , where he charges both him and the Governor with carrying on an illicit trade with the English of New York , an example , which , if followed , would ruin the colony by diverting the sources of its support to its rival . Du Lhut built a trading fort on Lake Superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Perrot ) . It was on the north side , at the mouth of a river entering Thunder Bay , where Fort William now stands . In 1684 , he caused two Indians , who had murdered several Frenchmen on Lake Superior , to be shot . He displayed in this affair great courage and coolness , undaunted by the crowd of excited savages who surrounded him and his little band of Frenchmen. //
