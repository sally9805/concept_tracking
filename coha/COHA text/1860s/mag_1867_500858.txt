AMERICAN PAINTERS . TIlE NATIONAL ACADEMY EXHIBITION . Good pictures do not teach a nation : they are the signs of its having been taught . Good thoughts do not form a nation : it must be formed before it can think them . IN an essay upon any subject connected with the fine arts , the writer finds it almost essential to state without reserve what are his assumed grounds of judgment . In this paper , then , it is assumed that the pictures of a nation , like the pictures of an individual painter , are the evidences of its civilization : they are as the mind and , heart are that create them . Pictures which are simple and unaffected declare truly the nature of the man or the community that is behind them , whether it be childish or mature , gentle or vulgar . And even pictures which are affected speak truly of the nature they represent , in this respect-that it is capable of pretending to be what it is not . How far , indeed , the beautiful arts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as teachers , it is not now my purpose to inquire . But , in a general way , it is safe to believe that the appointed teachers of a man or of a nation are to be found nearer at hand than in a picture gallery . A good picture may generally be used for his own good by a good man , as nature may , as adversity may , or prosperity , or his own animal passions . Nevertheless , primarily , a picture is to be judged as an embodiment of gootl and bad qualities , and a picture gallery to be visited as a partial record of the national life for the time being . It is not my aim , however , to deduce any theory of our national character from the character of American art . It is rather because I think it usually more the community 's fault than the man 's , when a picture is bad , that I have put at the head of this paper those two sentences from Ruskin , and have expanded what seems to me their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fine arts , which he regards as a common and all-sufficient standard from which to judge them , is that the artist is the embodiment of his era . It is true in the sense that whatever his art does embody is of his era , and more or less truly representative of it . But the theory fails in this , that some eras are but imperfectly represented by their fine arts , and some hardly at all . This present decade , for instance , in the United States , is but poorly expressed by the pictures , taken together , which are produced here and now . The only thing the pictures of the day truly represent is a comparatively unformed national mind // and character  --  a want of national individuality . And so long as our art shows that , it will not show much else . Very few of our pictures represent anything or are about anything . As yet , our faculties are not in order , nor do we , as a people , know what facultics we have or might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some respects , at least , more matured . It is no matter what excellent traits we may have as a people , how much flexibility and strength , how much of that savage energy that helps toward civilization ; so long as we do not understand ourselves , or cur needs , better than now , we shall have no good art . We are far behind the best culture of Europe in those refinement* and in that training that make some good art sure , and great art possible . But it is possible that we may be as near as Europe-though by a different road  --  to the ideal Christian civilization of the future . We are far enough from any remarkable force or subtlety of trained intellect , as shown in the formative arts , but our picture galleries disclose a natural temperament so kindly , so amiable , and so capable of honest enthusiasm that we can forgive all the crudities and weaknesses , a of half-educated people , that reveal all the more clearly the inborn worth which high culture while it developed would also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibition of the National Academy , which can be said to have a subject , it is hard to find one that has a vulgar or even an unworthy subject . There are none which disgust or offend . It is very seldom , indeed , that a picture appears in any of our exhibitions , whether alone or among many , which is offensive in any way . Absence of interest is common enough . No subject at all is the general rule . To have nothing to say is the first and gravest fault of most of our palYiters . Most of their work , to be sure , is now only experimental , and especially so with those who promise best . But , even in studies and experiments and practice work , there is less to tell than one would like to see . Here is , for instance , Mr. Vedder 's little picture in the east gallery . Very rarely do we see the work of an American artist that is on the whole so skilful . The disposition , and the mere drawing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of our figure painters . The delicate and highly-finished painting , too , the mere laying of color , is not only almost unknown here , but is ahead of any but the very best English work , and partakes of that wonderful dexterity which is at once the strength and the weakness of the great French school of the day . This dexterity is the strength of that school , not for its own sake , but because it gives the painters who possess it the power of going straight to their aim , the power of easily distributing and combining the scenes they wish to present , and finally the power of finishing their work quietly and without annoying and destructive changes of plan ; powers // quite out of the reach of painters whose technical skill is less perfect . But this same dexterity is the weakness of the French school , because it seems to be inseparably allied , in all but a very few masters , with grayness and deadness of color ; and because it seems to lead straight to this conclusion , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of Paul Veronese and nature in full color , and of Turner and nature in full light , and give their lives to painting a gray abstraction . Mr. Vedder used to teem with clever thoughts and wild and quaint fancies . There was the Arab listening with his ear at the lips of the great Sphinx ; there was St. Simeon Stylites , lonely upon his column , with the dangling rope of communication and the lower columns in the distance which he had lived upon before ; there was the great sea serpent sunning himself upon the beach ; the monk upon " The Gloomy Path ; " the sea-shore cedar , bowed and bent by storm , but struggling lustily for the life which nature intended it to live ; the " Lost Mind " wandering among the waste places of the earth ; the white fortress , with the red and gold flag of Spain shuddering in the wind , relieved against a stormy sky . In all these pictures , and in many more , were evident both quickness and fervor of fancy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of worthy subjects is more the community 's fault than the fault of individual painters ; so that he who finds worthy subjects is the more to be praised . I think the greatest difficulty in Mr. Vedder 's way , and the one which has hitherto kept him from being a complete artist , has been lack of the requisite technical skill . Now that he has gained it , or gained much , he has the chance to paint pictures which will be of permanent value . The canvas before us , " The Musician , " is only tentative work  --  a careful study of tapestry , silk , folds of drapery , and accessories . But here a skill is displayed which would have made the Sphinx picture of 1864 a most remarkable and valuable work of art . And yet , just so far as this picture shows signs of the French depression of tone , of shadows deepened , not with transparent warmth , but with a gray chill of color , just so far it is harmful and bad . If we do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painters can not draw the figure ( how should they , with no models ? ) ; they have no picturesque costumes to help them , nor any beauty of architecture ; and the lines of our most accessible American landscape are not very lovely . But our American sky and sunshine are unmistakable , and nature surrounds us with lovely colors . If our painters lose sight of these , and think that French pictures are better because soft and gray , or even that they are not much worse for their coldness , they might better have studied of the Japanese than of the French . It must not be denied , though , that painting in full color is dliiicult ; // so much more difficult than painting with gray shadows and lowered color , that I should think the very arduousness of it would tempt more painters to strive with it . Mr. G. C. Lamb din would like to paint in pure color and to paint truly ; so much is evident from his pictures every year . But his pictures this year-for instance , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van Ambergh " in the north gallery-are very feeble . The latter is a very pretty thought , the bold " Van Ambergh " of a small boy who has made up his mind to feed the half-grown bull-calf ; and is with hesitating hand patting the beast 's head while he distracts his attention with a branch of leaves , the girls looking on . And in nearly all Mr. Lambdin 's work there is much that seems so well-meant , so pleasant in thought , that one is sorry to feel how weak it all is . But how can there be pictures when one can not paint and draw ? And in truth that is the matter with all Mr. Lambdin 's work . Nothing in it is rightly drawn , not even a tree-branch in the " Dorothea " ; nothing is rightly painted , not even the spray of red leaves she holds in her hand . Mr. H. P. Gray 's work is a little more dexterous in appearance than Mr. Lambdin 's , but is not superior to it in any important respect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " are graver and quieter , and look more finished , and , according to the usual standard , are much more successful as " pictures . " But in reality there is no excellence , no delicacy or subtlety of figure-drawing , in these pictures . They do not pretend to brilliancy of color , and are entirely uncomposed in line . Mr. Gray has not exhibited his portraits of late years . I suppose them to be much better than his other pictures . If they are better , then a principal reason for the lack of merit in the same artist 's pictures in this exhibition is , perhaps , that they are of no particular subjects . This pensive young woman does not become Coleridge 's Genevieve merely because a little piece of the armed man , The statue of the armed knight ; is visible in the left-hand upper corner of the picture . Mr. S. J. Guy also seems to be astray for want of a subject . lie came very near having one last year when he saw and painted the little girl " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of a big tin pan . This year his picture is less interesting . A simple incident is nothing to one painter , which is a whole history to another . Mr. Guy does not invest his simple scenes with beautiful light and color to make them delightful , and does not draw or paint well enough to make his work admirable . Under those circumstances , there is nothing left for them but to be made interesting by quiet , domestic incident , happy or sad , or just tender and pathetic . 15 // Mr. Hennessy 's picture demands the attention and the notice due to singleness of purpose and refinement of feeling . The picture before us is not a successful one , and is hardly suited to public exhibition . It seems to be merely a study of two or three figures ; and those two or three are full of expression and are well drawn . The persevering way in which Mr. Henuessy keeps his studies " flat , " seeking probably , true roundness and projection or none , and aiming to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects , " is significant of good . If he is trying to gain through an almost Japanese flatness a more than Japanese brilliancy of color , and to add this to delicate and forcible drawing , he is trying or what is good , and there is nothing to prevent him from succeeding . Mr. Boughton 's sketch in the corridor serves merely to remind the spectator , by little things in it that show his hand , of the very charming pictures of his that have been exhibited in New York during the last two or three years . This one is sketchy in a disagreeable way , and not admirable or desirable for itself . His oil pictures of Breton life are full of interesting character . It is not the least of the regrets that follow Mr. Avery to Europe , that there is no longer in his gallery a chance to see very often Mr. Boughton 's pictures . Mr. Eastman Johnson 's pictures are of those few American pictures which seem to have sufficient subjects . The picture of this year , " The Pension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war , and of New England domestic life . These cottage and farm-house interiors are worthy to rank with Fr*re 's in interest and in faithfulness of representation . A collection of Mr. Johnson 's pictures would probably be more interesting to visit than one of any other American painter . His work , taken together , is more truly representative of his countrymen ( because almost completely representative of one class of his countrymen in their quiet lives ) , than any painter 's work that I know . His reach has gone on steadily increasing , since his energy remains constant , while his power of vigorous conception strengthens , and his sympathies widen . There is no painter , not even among the younger men who are just coming into sight from behind the horizon , who get on faster , or who leave the past of a year or two back more decidedly and forever behind . In this year 's picture , there is a directness and simplicity of aim , and a manly energy , that are quite worthy of very high admiration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we are the richer for having it , just as we are in getting a new volume of poems from Emerson . There are , perhaps , no other figure pieces this year of which that would be at all true ; and very few such , certainly , there are at any exhilaition . As to technical qualities , the drawing is skilful , and is sufficient for the painter 's purpose , though in final analysis it may // not be in every respect of the highest excellence . Probably there are not half a dozen living men who can thoroughly well draw the naked figure . But it is noticeable in Mr. Johnson 's pictures that he never avoids the human face , or shuns to give full human expression . Scarcely ever does he evade difficulties of pose and gesture , but will draw an arm abruptly foreshortened rather than disturb his group to get it in profile ; and in general he sees his subjectthe little drama he composes-clearly before him , and works to that idea . In the picture before us he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four characters which his story needed : the business-like country squire of a " claim agent , " excited beyond reserve , and full of momentary enthusiasm ; the maimed soldier , so calm about his own story that stirs up the lawyer ; the charming , peaceful old lady who , moved , as one may suppose , more by her boy 's sufferings than by his services , keeps her eyes fixed down upon her work ; finally , the other members of the family , also steady at their wonted tasks , paring apples , or busied about dishes , or else simply sitting , in unoccupied old age , to listen . Full , natural daylight pours in through the window , filling the room . This is true realistic work , out of which , in good time , comes true work of all sorts . We should find that the painter who has painted the real with all his strength , and has mastered it , would paint the ideal too . We do not know of what conceptions of angelic or superhuman beauty Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could paint ; and that is a great step gained . It seems , however , that he would not paint angelic conceptions in very rainbowlike or very pearly colors . Mr. Johnson* s is unquestionably a sadcolored muse , strange though it always seems to me that it should be so . The shadows of the world , shown by his pictures , are gray and dun ; the cheeks and lips of childhood a harsh red . Probably this is matter of love or want of love . Observation of nature will teach you only what you observe . Look at the eyes and the faces of men for the thoughts and passions within them ; look at the limbs and bodies of men for their changing forms ; look at external nature for relative darkness of shade and shadow , and relative brightness of broad and of sparkling lights , and all these you may see . But it may be that you will not see the strange mixture of a thousand colors , indefinable , indescribable , not to be named as red , purple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , in the picture under discussion , the face of the pension agent is nobly designed and imagined , both in type and momentary expression ; only less interesting are the faces of the old lady on the left and the child in front , and they are not less rightly conceived . Yet none of these faces are made lovely as a colorist , in other words as a born painter , would have made them . The born // painter may love humanity more or less than he loves external nature , may be more or less strongly impressed with truths of form , and of light and shade , but one thing of necessity he is , namely , a decorator , a beautifier , a lover of lovely things , and in particular , of lovely color . A great school of painting can hardly exist unless its disciples love to paint as well as to draw and to imagine . In the hands of a true painter , a picture grows to be a jewel , a bright and beautiful thing , whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the true painter is based upon the study of color for itself alone . The sheep feed on the lawns at the Central Park , each with its shadow beneath it , surrounded by a stretch of sunlighted grass . Scholars make drawings of them , and so far do well ; but it is possible to make careful drawings and yet not see all that is to be seen . The sheep pass for whitish things on a green ground ; but that is not at all the state of the case . The sun-lighted grass is not green , the shadows under them are not green ; and how many colors would really be needed to represent one lamb with his entourage perhaps a Summer day 's study might show . There is , in the crude works of some very young and unaccomplished painters , a palpable striving to get all the wonderful contrasts and all the wonderful harmonies of color in which nature is fond of indulging . They are right ; for if they can ever be good painters , they will be all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without this , they can never be good painters at all . If indeed , " the business of a painter is to paint , " then even Mr. Johnson is not a good painter in the best sense . If it be true that " every painting , in which the aim is primarily that of drawing , and every drawing in which the aim is primarily that of painting , must alike be in a measure erroneous , " then this charming picture of the claim agent falls within the latter class , as being less of a design in color than in light and shade , although passing for a fully realized picture . Landscape is , perhaps , as it is continually said to be , the principal American fine art . Be this as it may , no landscape work , probably , that we have , is nearer to complete rightness than this picture of Mr. Johnson 's . I suppose the truth to be that landscape art is so many-sided , so complicated , so enormously difficult , so hard to grasp in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so hard to judge of moreover , even for the painter himself and , finally , so poor aud undesirable unless triumphantly successful ; that as a great landscape painter must always be " the Phznnix of a century of centuries , " so even very good landscape painters must be few and seldom coming . It is a question with some true lovers of art if landscape subject can ever be made sufficiently interesting by itself , and whether some human emotion is not always necessary to make the interest and influence of the picture deep and lasting . // However that may be , it is certain that , other things being equal , the landscape painter deals with what is of inferior general interest ; and , moreover , that he is in great danger of falling into a method of work that can give absolutely no active enjoyment to any one . It is possible to put good thought and faithful work into landscape , and yet waste it all . It is harder to make a landscape pleasurable to the eye than any other kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , in looking at the landscapes in our exhibitions . In these pictures it often seems as if much skill and knowledge had been used in vain , where a little more would have achieved success . In Mr. Mc Entee 's Autumn picture , in the south gallery , the drawing of the large trees is very good . They have the rigid curves of natural trunks and boughs , they branch from naturally-drawn forks , and they do not taper , but grow smaller as they branch . They are full of spirit , and full of the strange , fantastic , untraceable waywardness of forest boughs ; a little overdone in some places among the larger limbs , but delightful in the switchy , smaller branches . The mystery of the purplish entanglement of little boughs , where the grove beyond the brook shuts in the picture , is well expressed . In Mr. Colman 's Autumn picture , there is evidence of great delight in the purple shadows of trees and rocks , in the blue distance , and in the swells and hollows of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with houses up*n it . Both these pictures are full of a true and noble appreciation of nature , and express sympathy with something more than her superficial and easily-seen aspects . In both there is a very pleasant suggestiveness of color , and in one , more than a hint at noble form . The right feeling , the good purpose , the power of color shown in both , ought to have given the world two better pictures . Sketchy and suggestive they aim at being ; but they might have been sketches to bett**r purpose , and suggestive of much more than they are . In Mr. MeEntee 's picture , the foreground is almost wholly meaningless . There is no character in the brook , whether in flow of water , curve of shore , or formation of bank . There is nothing expressive of dry leaves , except the general color , where dry leaves seem meant ; and this approximately right color is found in irregular splashes only , without even the most imperfect and incomplete drawing . In Mr. Colman 's picture , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the foreground bushes and herbs ; but here the trunks and branches of the trees are also very badly drawn , and the shadows , whose color has been spoken of above , are not accurately defined , the trunks casting shadows which come to a point , as if the foliage were tI-ansparent . Whoever remembers Mr. Colman 's " Tow-Boats in the highLands , " which was at Mr. Avery 's in the Winter , recalls a very // faithfully rendered cluster of steamboats and canal-boats , crowded in an inextricable tangle , full of character , and the true character thoroughly enjoyed and in many respects rightly painted . But if the vessels in that picture had not been portrayed with more determined accuracy than has gone to the trees and their shadows in this Autumn picture , no one could have been sure what sort of vessels were represented . Strangely enough , the rule of drawing things as they are , of " making portraits " of them , is observed in respect to objects of general interest , like steamboats , by the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects which , like trees and shadows , are not of general interest . People in general care about trees for their shade , for the music of the wind among their branches , for their greenness sometimes , for their general gracefulness rarely , and almost never for their beauty of form and for the character of their growth . It ought to he the painter 's delight to show people what they will not see without him . As for shadows , at which hardly anybody looks , there is nothing more essential to the beauty of landscape or of landscape art than they . The artists who study the whole of external nature with equal care , who slur nothing , who seek to portray everything , who have for their chief aim the representation of all they can possibly represent , and the truthful suggestion of that which can not be represented-these painters , whatever their shortcomings , individually or as a body , are worthy of respect , and their works deserve care . fill study . Such an one is Mr. C. IL Moore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in the west room , attest . Of these , the larger is a picture of Catskill Mountains , seven or eight miles away , with an " October Snow Squall " sweeping over the highest summits , while all the rest of the mountains , and all the middle distance , are in full sunlight . The spectator will see that the mass of the mountain rises above and further to the right hand of the picture than that part of it which is clearly shown , and that this mass is partly hidden by the veil of thin snow mist , while the only fallen snow in the picture is high up , and is seen through a rift in the clouds . Over the lower ground , yet further to the right , it seems to be raining , and there is a small part of a rainbow-all of it that can be seen by the spectator , because the sun is not directly behind him . The lower hills and spurs of the mountain are covered with Autumn woods , and at its foot is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right and left , also dressed for October . All this makes up an unusually extensive subject , and is painted with extraordinary minuteness ; and what I have described is very successful as topographical landscape . The picture lacks unity and concentration , and is so badly injured by the colors of its foreground that nine in ten of picture-lovers must be offended by it at // first sight . It should be framed with nearly the whole foreground hidden ; and if the frame could have a jutting piece to hide the cornfield and pumpkins , it might be well . The extraordinary faithfulness of the painting of clouds and autumnal mountain-slopes burning in sunlight , and of distant evergreens , is rewarded by a resulting picture of unusual beauty . In the smaller picture , there is no such sunniness and glow as in this . In that the light of the picture is pale and cold . The distance , moreover , is comparatively poor ; and the rippled water is heavy , while the still is untransparent . But the clouds are equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purest blue that even Mr. Moore has painted . In this matter of sky and clouds his work seems to me the best in the galleries , as it has been in exhibitions before this . The foreground , here , contains a vast amount of elaborate detail . The shaly beach of sharp stones , so different from a sea-beach , is entirely right in all except sunshine ; and certainly our galleries have never seen subtler drawing than this of the boat , with its hollow curves . The work in these pictures , I suppose to be , as truly as that of any painter , experimental , educational . I suppose that no living painter , unless it be John Brett , abandons himself wholly to topographical landscape as an end . Perhaps the most remarkable manifestation of the spirit of absolute portraiture was the Pre-Raphaciitism of from 1850 to 1855 ; but even this scarcely recognized direct representation of nature as an end , and hardly admitted landscape as a principal subject . It is the will of all true artists to worthily express worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be tha4 these are seldom mere descriptions of visible things . The " stern and true discipline of Pre-Raphaclitism " has been the main cause of the unquestioned advance of art in England since 1850 . And , in America , where there is not a single painter , so far as I know , who is a " Pre-Raphaelite " in any sense of the word , there are a few painters who obey one good law of the P. R. B. , namely , to paint nature as you see it , in the minutest subdivisions and in the broadest harmonies . There are many painters who have gifts as valuable as those of Mr. Moore , yet , simply for want of doing what he has done , fail in doing as well as they might . Nor merely " as well as they might , " but they even fail of doing well at all , in any high and broad sense . Such is , for instance , Mr. Griswold , a painter whose work I always seek with eagerness since the production of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have constant opportunities of seeing , and always see with new enjoyment . In his picture in the west gallery- " August at Newport , "  --  the local colors are about as they would be on a very cloudy day , though there are shadows thrown by trees and rocks , though there is a bit of harsh green // that seems intended for sunshine color down in the valley , and the tree branches seem meant to be sun-lighted . On the other hand , the " Meadow Scene in early Autumn , " in the corridor , is the most truly sunny picture in all the exhibition , not even excepting Mr. Moore 's " October . " Mr. Griswold 's work is always best when he does not have Summer green to represent ; that troublesome color seems to trouble him especially . Here , without it , he has glow and warmth and light , and almost wholly excellent shadow color . But in both these pictures there is nothing rightly drawnthat is , drawn with full detail , or even with exact accuracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just misses of a high place among landscape painters . Mr. Weir 's picture , " The Eastern Sky at Sunset , " shows all of evening sunlight that can be shown without greater mastery over color . his other picture I had rather not describe , as it seems to me more entirely bad than I am willing to believe a picture of Mr. Weir 's can be . Mr. Kensett 's large landscape , of White Mountain scenery , is one of his most agreeable pictures . They are always gray , but a clear , pleasant , inoffensive gray ; and they are always quiet , unexaggerated and refined in feeling . It is a polite and wellbred landscape that Mr. Kensett paints , and the trees , the mountains and the country seats are of an almost millennial propriety . It is rather general truths , as exemplified in pictures , than the special merit of individual pictures themselves , that I have been trying to consider in the present article . Within limits so restricted , those pictures only could be discussed which best illustrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I have done , Mr. Kensett and other painters , and to mention with only a woP*d landscapes as interesting as Mr. Brevoort 's and as Mr. Williams 's " Old Tannery on the Road to Franconia ; " figure pictures of as much cleverness as Mr. Wood 's three Contrabands ; and pictures of detail so valuable as the best of Mr. Farrer 's , and so powerful as Mr. Lafarge 's . There is also much work by the younger artists that one would like to praise as it deserves , and there are miscellaneous pieces demanding notice , as , particularly , Mr. Moore 's admirable picture of three apples on a Japanese tray , and Mr. Baldwin 's very interesting " Interior of the Baptistery of St. Mark 's . " The two portraits by Win . H. Furness , both unfinished-left so at the time of his early death , two months ago-are yet by far the best portraits exhibited . His portraits in former exhibitions have been the worthiest American portraits , with the nearest approach to the greatness of the great masters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition , to be classed with the few American pictures worthy to be kept for posterity . It seemed that America needed Furness very much , but he is taken away .
