NEW ENGLANDERJS No . XCVII . OCTOBER , 1866 . ARTICLE 1. - THE RELATIONS OF ART TO EDU CATION . THE elegant and costly building designed for the use of the Yale School of Art is now completed . Its founder , Mr. Street , of New Haven , chose to bear unassisted , the burden of its erection ; and in so doing has built for himself a name for large-hearted liberality . Few men could have given so much for an object of pure benevolence ; fewer still would have had the breadth of mind to do so much for an educational object , and especially for a department of education so imperfectly understood and appreciated as that of Art . Mr. Street was not permitted to live to see the completion of this beautiful edifice , so that it has now become his monument-a most fitting monument of his mind and charaeter . Nothing that is low , or false , or unsightly , should enter its doors . All things that are true , that are pure , that are lovely , that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be found within it . Mr. Street possessed the means and the opportunity of cultivating his mind to an uncommon degree . He did this for his children 's sake as well as for his own , He was the indefatigable superintendent of his children 's education , and their personal friend and guide in all that is worthy and beautiful , and was thus made to be the instrument of guiding // and educating others . A fine classical scholar , a man of extensive and accurate reading in English literature , and of exquisite taste in all matters pertaining to art ; he was also a man of decided will , and of quiet but independent opinions . Kept from the active pursuits of business lif&amp; by long-continued ill health , his mind assumed a more thoughtful and meditative cast , in which fruitful soil ideas respecting the meaning and limits of a true education sprang up . He deeply felt the want in our systems of education of the practical elerneiit , of something which might unite educated men with the present time and the present world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need of classical and scientific studies , as forming the foundation of education ; but he thought that there were men who lived now as well as in the days of Greece and Romemen who spoke their own living languages , and wrought their own living works , which were well worth knowing and studying , He endowed a pm fessorship of modern languages in Yale College ; and instead of spending his fortune in erecting a costly palace for himself he built a " Palace of Art , " free to all who would enter with earnest mind to learn more of the beauty of truth . It was well said by one of the speakers at the last meeting of the alumni of Yale , " that this art-building might , indeed , in the course of time cr*umble and decay , but it would have then reproduced itself ; and still live on in far more beautiful structures , and above all in its silent influence in building up the imperishable fabric of ' a finished , ennobled , and educated mind . " We would add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that a sincere and humble Christian faith sustained him through the labors and trials of an age lengthened out amid great suffering and bodily infirmity to seventy-foilir years , and sheds a cheering , mild , and blessed light upon his memory . The building , whose cost is estimated to approach the stun of two hundred thorisand dollars , may be described as composed of two principal parts or wings , one forty-six by eighty-six feet , the other thirty-one by seventy-seven feet , connected by another part containing the entries and chief staircases . This arrangement gives quite an irregular surface of wall , thus lending light and shade and picturesque cifect . The bnilding is // plain and solid , with points , however , of judicious ornamentation . Its principal material is the New Jersey sandstone , relieved by darker Connecticut sandstone for the architectural lines and courses . The corridors are pointed Gothic , which , with the hipped roof and the turrets at the angles , characterize the structure as a Gothic building with special adaptation to a modern use . Thus the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are other novel and original features ; indeed , for a successful and beautiful adaptation of the Gothic to the purposes of a modern art-building the architect deserves great praise . The basement , which is twelve feet high , has rooms well lighted and fitted for lecturing and modeling . The first story is devoted to studios , library room , and official apartments . The second and highest story contains two galleries for the exhibition of pictures and works of art , the larger one seventy six by thirty , the smaller sixty-eight by twenty-two . While the principal entrance is upon the town side , the finest aspect of . the buildino ' is upon College ** and , the grounub when the architectural plans in respect to the College grounds and the other new buildings to be erected are carried out , the effect will be attractive and noble . The inauguration of this building for the purpose of instruction in art in Yale College brings up naturally the general subject of the relations of art to education . Perhaps sotnething may be said to place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at present in the minds of some , even intelligent men . True education , we hold , aims to produce a harmonious development of the nature , neglecting nothing essential , and cultivating nothing disproportionately , to the total exclusion of other things . One may be educated to a certain extent and in a certain direction , and be far from being a man of true culture ; whole regions of his nature may still lie barren and waste , unresponsive to the desi*u of their Creator . A good mathematician is not a thoroughly educated man , nor is a good philologian . The culture of the pure intellect is not the sole object of education . Even physical culture is not to be overlooked . We can not tell how great an influence a manly physical training exerts upon character . The Christian world seems to be just now beginning to see what the Greeks per ceived // ages ago , that physical culture has a moral value , that the healthy perfection of the body has its influence upon the soundness and beauty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For bodily exercise profiteth little " refers to those ascetic tendencies and bodily mortifications which were introduced by gnostic teachers in the place of true godliness and a Christian life . And yet we would not make too much of physical culture , nor believe that the renovation of humanity will spring from it . We would not seek to change the relative value of things . The training of the moral and religious nature , of the conscience and will , of those faculties which have an immediate relation to God and the profoundest principles of character ,  --  this undoubtedly lies at the foundation of any true idea of education . It may be also taken for granted that the discipline of the intellect , of the knowing and reasoning powers , comes next in point of importance , and indeed occupies that middle place which makes education to mean nothing , unless it means the right , development and orderly exercise of the distinctively intellectual faculties . But this is not all . There is still left an important portion of the being whose place is harder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affectional nature ; it is the region more peculiarly of the imagination and sentiments , in which lie the springs of feeling for the true , the beautiful , and the good . How broad a region is this . How narrow the view which would suffer this to run to waste , which would allow this vital portion of our human nature , that which makes it genuinely human , to be forgotten . The imagination is one of the noblest of the faculties . It is the creative power of the mind assimilating us to God . It is that which makes all things new . How grand a quality in an orator ! It is that which gives one man 's sermon a freshness and vital power , which another preacher 's sermon of equal force of thought does not have . The greatest preachers , like Chrysostom , Augustine , Luther , Robert Hall , and Chalmers , have all had this quality in a high degree , not only lighting up their words and thoughts with marvelous brilliancy , but enabling them to cast original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Should , this noble quality of the mind be left out of the account in any // comprehensive idea of education or life ? The Germans say that " the true art is to live beautifullv ; " if so we can ill afford to neglect the cultivation of the more purely imaginative and aesthetical part of the nature , or of that true art , which presents to us so many hints of a beautiful life , and which gives harmony , glory , and finish to the whole . Art has been heretofore in a great degree excluded from our system of education from the fear that , in the future as in the past , it may lead to a refined but degenerate civilization . This was the case in Greece and Modern Italy , and history has frequently repeated the lesson . The intelligent Puritan mind had read this lesson , and repudiated the art which enfeebles while it refines ; and with all our love of art we had rather stand in the judgment of history and of God with the stern Puritan , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupies an incomparably higher place in history and in the history of mind . He is the true American who does not give up one iota of his Puritanism , but who engrafts upon the strong and sturdy stock of Puritanism a richer and more generous culture . But in every instance where art has aided in degrading a people , it can be proved , we contend , that other deeper moral causes were at work ; and that the art in question was in no case that of the true type , but was connected with some corrupt philosophy , or fatal error of Christian doctrine , or grossly perverted public sentiment . It was moreover as a general thing an incomplete conception of art itself ; formed chiefly upon the sensuous idea ; it was not that true art which combines the sensuous with the higher rational and ideal qualities of the mind , which is built on ideas and has a dcep moral element in it . 1 . The study of true Art , or aesthetic culture , should be introduced into education because art comprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is as genuine a dcpartment of the mental nature as logic or mathematics . Who will deny that it took as munch mind to build St. Peter 's cathedral , or to compose the music of Sebastian Bach , as to write the " Neckanique Geleete Y " In treating of the artistic mind we are not confined to architects , or musicians , or sculptors , but we must reckon in the poets . ilomner , Euripides , Dante , Shakes*. // peare , Milton . creating fresh worlds of the imagination , bodying forth new forms of beauty , truth , and power , were as true artists as Michael Angelo and Beethoven . The artistic mind is seen in literature . It is mind moving in the region of ideas , and from the pure impulse of delight in beauty and truth , creating ideal works that reflect the nobler inward emotions , hopes , and conceptions of the mind . Could any one be called a truly educated man who had never studied Shakespeare , and who knew nothing and felt nothing of the new world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , which his works reveal ? No more , in truth , than a man could be called a Biblical scholar who had never read the poetical parts of the Bible , the psalms , and the prophecies . The knowledge needed by a true artist ,  --  for example , by a good painter ,  --  proves to us at a glance that no ordinary amount of intellectual preparation and ability is demanded . He is required to make himself master of anatomy , of optics and light and shade perspective , of geology and botany , of chemistry and the science of colors , of the principles of gravity , harmony , expression , and the deeper laws of the mind . Added to these a wide reading of history , and general literature , and a cultivation of the mind , so that it can grasp the formative ideas or spirit of an age , or of an heroic character , or of a grand and beautiful scene of nature . A great painter is a great poet . The colors he uses are his language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glowing with the light of mind . A work of art is not only the product of strong feeling but of pure intelligence . 2 . True aesthetic culture would introduce into our system of education a new spirit of freedom . The highest idea of life even in the Christian sense is the union of law with liberty , the obedience of duty because one sees the beauty of truth and delights in it from the heart . It is the province of education to bring out this real beauty of truth so that it shall meet the best desires and susceptibilities of the mind , and shall be followed freely by the truth-seeker . As a people we have freedomn much on our tongues but not so much in our spirits . We have brought down everything to the dead level of the actual . It is the thing which is , which answers the present purpose , // which meets the present emergenc*y , which constitutes the present success , which is visible and palpable , and not the thing which should be , which aims at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would flow into our educational systems as an ennobling influence , freeing us from our ntilitanan spirit and elevating the national mind . Our practical character is our strength , and it is the glory and strength of our American system of education as contradistinguished from much that we find in the highly theoretical European systems . But while we would not disparage or weaken this strong practical American quality , we would counteract its tendencies towards an ignoble and materialistic conception of life . Art would come in to aid in this contest against the money-making and money-worshiping spirit . It would tend to free us from this gross bondage of materialism . It would inspire us to follow truth because of truth 's own superior attractions , because of the real delight which the sight of the intrinsic loveliness of truth inspires . It would raise us into the higher world of ideas , and give true freedom and play to the spirit . We are an intensely earnest and practical people , why should we not also become a free and happy people ? 3 . A genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring into education an ethical element and influence of no mean power of value . Art is not often regarded as a moral power ; but in man 's complex nature everything which bears upon the formation of character assumes a moral importance . Our life is not altogether made up of moral acts , but also of more subtle antecedent conditions , affections , tastes , and sympathies . The will is moved by a thousand invisible cords of motive and imagination . These bear an important , though sometimes indefinable , part in the general working and moulding of character . Schiller says that " every man has a pure ideal man within himself ; " and if so , it is the part of true education to recognize and arrive at this pure ideal of manhood . As Christians , we see in Christ in his character , and in his divine humanity , the pure ideal of manhood , and through Christ received into the heart by faith , we see the true and fhe only way of reaching this ideal , and of perfecting our humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new and higher life , but to assist in training and educating this higher life  --  the aid of those ennobling ideas which true Art brings ; especially , since much of its own power lies on that very side of the nature , the imaginative side , that of the tastes and sentiments , which is the peculiar province of Art ? Let Christianity then purify this portion of the nature ; let it elevate these affections and susceptibilities into moral affections ; let it purity Art itself , and use it in the great plan of a higher and more perfect Christian idea of education . It will not do for the taste and imagination of a man to be in direct opposition to his sense of religions duty . If so he must then sternly deny his taste and follow the path of duty ; but he is incomparably a stronger man when taste and duty harmonize , and when he can give all his powers to the glad obedience of Truth . This portion of our nature claims to be recognized by Christianity , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savonarola centuries ago conceived this idea , but the idea seemed to have been almost extinguished with his life . lie held that the imaginative faculties had a place in our being , and that external nature was the symbol of internal ideas , and was made for the education and joy of the mind . In education , he claimed " that youth should not receive a lesson of Paganism without receiving at the same time a lesson of Christianity , and that they should be equally instructed in eloquence and truth . " Dante , two centuries before , had wrought upon the same high conception of art as a moral and educational influence . From him the religious painters of his epoch , Simon Memmi , Cimabue , Giotto , Orcagna , drew their inspiration . The sculpture gallery of the " Purgatorio " stands as a monument of his belief in the power of art to assist in the purification and elevatIon of the struggling human mind ; and why some of those noble subjects for sculpture with which he adorned the cornice of the mountain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put into marble , we know not . We may see how art can aid morality , and a Christian education in many practical ways . A man , for example , does not commit a mean , or dishonest , or indecent act , because it is an // offense against good taste . This , you say , is a very inadequate motive , but if the motive really stops the man from a wrong action , an outwardly wrong action , it is worth something , and it is not to be thrown entirely out of the account . The principle of Good Taste , or of fitness in all things , is not , it is true , the highest or strongest principle of action , but it may come in to aid , and to mould , and to restrain , together with deeper influences , and perhaps sometimes to take their place in cases where they do not operate . We know that many would continue to imitate the manneristic boorishness of some good men , thinking it perhaps to be an essential part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general and thorough appreciation ( having nothing in it of servility or effeminacy ) of that " Grand old name of gentleman . " This is manliness ennobled and gentled . It is a combination of strength and mildness . It does not consist in the supple knee nor the diddling and fawning manner , but in the refined mind , the kind , brave , and courteous heart , the absence of all pretension and snobbery . It is the noble tact of a heart that instinctively discerns the beauty and fitness of things , and that scorns what is base and low . It is " John Halifax , gentleman . " Let a young man 's taste be so cultivated that he sees that everyt1*ing bad is deformed , and everything good is beautifol , and it must be confessed that he is not far from the kingdom of Heaven . True aesthetic culture develops those feelings and those tendencies of mind that are thus favorable to virtue , and good manners , and even a higher faith . Education should give this impulse , this direction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beauty of virtue , and recognize the nobleness of truth , and follow after goodness from a love of its own intrinsic loveliness . Evil thus loses its false attractions . Its power is disenchanted by the spell of a mightier . True beauty will be mightier than false beauty . Satan will cower and shrink and reveal his falsehood at the touch of the celestial spear of true goodness . The young will be attracted by some kind of beauty , and will love and follow if not the true , then the false . And here let us speak of the decidedly corrupting influence of some works of art . Much evil flows from // them . The indiscriminate visitation of the great galleries of* Europe by our young people of both sexes , traveling abroad without educational or hardly moral supervision , has doubtless done great injury . Some works of European art that have gone through this country , originating from a corrupt mind and a debased French taste , have been the more pestilential because they possessed a certain kind of artistic beauty . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art ; that the best art , springing from a pure source , and built upon true artistic ideas , is never immoral in its tendency . A poor lithographic painting of a corrupt nature exposed in a shop window , will do more harm to good morals , than the most beautiful work of art that has in its fearless truth copied the innocence of nature . But we think that here , even in regard to true art , since humanity has so much innate corruption , art must be held under severe restraint and censorship , must not rely too much upon transcendental ideas of the innocence of nature , and should avoid even the appearance of evil , and above all when employed for educational purposes . But how shall we meet these corrupting influences of false art ? Shall we , in the spirit of the Caliph Omar , destroy all the works of art in the world , and declare that there shall be no more art so long as the world stands ; or shall we meet false art with true artshall we head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art that shall overpower and defeat depraved principles ? It is an unmanly argument that we should give up what is good because it has been , or may be , wrested to a false use . Poetry has been made the instrument of immense evil ; shall we have no more poetry ? Oratory has been turned into a powerful agent of wrong by the accomplished demagogue , and the fiery partisan of oppression , and shall the voice of true eloquence be for this reason hushed ? Shall the holy strains of sacred music cease because evil passion has breathed through music to light unhallowed fires ? The blessed and perfect One did not pray that his disciples should be taken out of the world , but that they shoul*l be kept from evil . 4 . The study of art affords a counterpoise to certain narrowing and injurious tendencies in the common forms of education itself by presenting truth in a more natural and concrete form . // The first thing , doubtless , in a practical education is hard study ,  --  the thorough discipline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It sharpens its powers . It teaches it how to think . It is the purely scientific process , whether employed in the study of mathematics , or the languages , or any other branch of education . This , undoubtedly , comes first . The mind must learn to analyze , to separate , to reflect , to arrive at facts by the severe and narrow path of logical induction . Science comes before art in education , as it does in life . There is first truth , then beauty . There is first utility , then art . Art itself is in no slight degree built upon science , and one important department of art is the scientific analysis of nature . But the scientific process , every thoughtful mind will acknowledge , has its evils and its perpetual evil tendencies . Dealing almost entirely with analysis , it inclines to overlook and sometimes to lose the beautiful synthesis and wholeness of truth . It fi*ils often with all its patient labors to come to the unity of knowledge , and the clear light and perfection of truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is often in a striking degree partial and incomplete . It sometimes leaves the mind totally in the dark . Employing almost exclusively the logical and reasoning faculties , it leaves out of account the freer intuitions of the mind and the illuminating power of the imagination . Art makes use of these , and frequently through its clear and rapid intuitions it comes at the wholeness of truth , where science sees but in part darkly . Art aims at unity . It looks to the beautiful whole . It is nothing if it do not arrive at distinct results , at well-rounded and perfect forms of truth . It can not stop half way . It can not abide in partial or confused ideas , and it strives always for the highest ideal perfection . While it has much then to do , even as science has , with the sensible and the material , it does not so much incline to materialistic conceptions of truth as science does , but is seeking for higher things , is ever climbing toward the region of ideas , is ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the ideal and spiritual . While , therefore , art can and should never take the place of science , nor is it at all of such primary importance in education , yet art may conic in to correct and modify whatever evil and sceptical tendencies there may be in // the one-sided processes of science . It comes in to show to the , learner the glorious truths of nature in their entireness and living forms . True art does not lead to scepticism , but rather to reverence and truth . It finds beauty and goodness in all the works of God , even in the least of his works , in the stone and the weed as well as the mountain and the sky ; in the sentiment of the heart , as well as the thought of the brain and labor of the hand . 5 . The study of art leads to the more careful cultivation of the perceptive powers of the mind . These should not be neglected in a true system of education , any more than the training of the reflective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art . It is a great thing to teach the young to observe accurately , to observe nature , not merely to see , but to perceive , the objects of nature ,  --  to see them with the inner eye of the mind . Art is formed on nature . Close study of nature is the solid foundation of an artistic education . The artist must learn the structure of the earth , the structural character of rocks , the laws of light and color , the principles which govern the botanical and vegetable world , in fine , the laws of the natural world . Art leads the mind from the study of books which are the works and ideas of mcii , into the free unbounded fields of nature - into the study of God 's ideas . This is always a healthy and liberalizing process . It affords mental exercise and discipline of most pleasing kind . It introduces variety and freshness into a course of education . It lets God 's sunlight and air into the study . Young men would not come out of college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh , and independent minds , with the eye open to see the beauty and glory of the universe lying about them . 6 . Art in educatioim assists in the study of other j3ranches of knowledge , especially in the formation of a good style of writing and speaking . The arts are one . The principles of the art of sculpture are also the principles of the art of style . Form is the great aim in art , and so it is in oratory . Beauty of investiture lends force to truth . Good taste in speaking gives untold efficiency to the spoken word . The laws of thought and expression in the manifestation of truth , flowing from an inner // law , are the same in the writer as in the artist strictly speaking ,  --  the same elements of vital unity , fitness , proportion , and the like . All kinds of culture tend powerfully , though it may be insensibly to the forming of a clear , vigorous and elegant style of writing , without false ornament or false strength . In classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful study of the Colosseum forms a chapter in Roman history just as important as a 1 ) 00k of Livy or Tacitus . Some one has said that it would be a good plan to hang up in every Latin school in the land a correct representation of Julius C*sar marching into Gaul at the head of the 10th Legion ; for many boys , doubtless , imagine C*sar , in his looks and costume , to be not unlike General Scott or General Grant . Our classical school books and dictionaries are taking advantage of art in their illustrations of ancient architecture , coins , costume , and manners and customs . The history of the human mind is written in art . In no department of knowledge are stamped more wonderfully the features of a changing and progressive civilization , of the great progressive steps of history . The spirit of an age is caught and rendered with fidelity in the buildings , sculptures , pictures , poetry , and aesthetic literature of that age . The subtle life of humanity has expressed itself in art more faithfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great artist is the true expression of the feeling and thought of his age . Prince Albert said in his address at the opening of the Crystal Palace : " The flue arts have so important an influence on the development of mind and the feeling of the people , and are so generally taken as the type of the degree and character of that development , that it is in the fragments and works of art come down to us from bygone nations that we are wont to form an estimate of the state of their civilization , manners , customs , and religion . " Art aids yet again in the pursuits.of natural philosophy and the industrial sciences . Accuracy of eye , good taste in form , color , proportion , comparison , actual skill in drawing-these further in a hundred ways the studies of the astronomer , the geographer , the mnechanician , and the civil engineer . We once heard a distinguished geologist lament that he had neglected the art of drawing when young , so that in his travels and re // searcl ) es @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sketch rapidly the broad physical conformation of new lands , and the more minute details of rock and vegetable phenomena . How often , too , in coin mon life , the skill of the ready draughtsman is called in requisition , from the planning of a house and the laying out of public grounds and ce*eteries , to the sketching of a simple article of furniture , of a passing scene of travel , or of a rare tree , plant , or leaf , met in the daily walk . 7 . Art in education has an interesting social bearing , and exerts a powerful and genial influence on the common intercourse and life of a community . It draws out kindly feelings , and softens natural harshness of temper . It rebukes the tendency to indulge in small rivalries , by affording a broad theme of conversation and of rational enjoyment , in which there is little opportunity for petty controversy , or where all can enjoy a feast of good things prepared by him who made all things good and beautiful in their time . Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tends to unite the sympathies of man , and to awaken interest for everything human . Those very things in man that philosophy and even morality are sorrietimes inclined to pass by and despise , Art kindly takes up and cherishes-like trampled flowers . It would be an improvement when Art could enter somewhat more into the common conversation and intercourse of young men . It might take the place ot other things , not , perhaps , so improving . Music and singing are already doing good in this direction , tending to promote kind feeling , and to increase the rational happiness of social life among the young men of our American colleges as in those of the old world . It is surely better for students to sing in companies , making the streets echo with the well-sustained and ringing chorus , than to make night hideous as formerly with calithumpean bands and brutal yells . When we come to speak of the actual introduction of Art into our present system of education , or of the establishment and working of a School of Art in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparatively a new field . Although separate schools of art exist such as the Royal Academy of Eondon , the Ecole des Beaux Arts of Paris , the Munich School of // Art , and the Schools of Design in New York , Philadelphia and Chicago , yet we believe the School of Art about to be established in connection with Yale College , is the first of the kind directly connected with a university place of education in the world . There is some movement to institute a similar school in Oxford , but we do not learn that it has been as yet carried out . There are new questions to be met . How far shall the study of Art enter into a regular academic course ? How can it find a place without displacing more important studies ? Should it constitute a purely professional school , by itself , rather than an academical course of study ? What system or process should there be to produce emulation and interest ? Ought actual exercises in drawing , painting , modeling , and the praxis of art be required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most elementary illustrative class-instruction be sufficient ? Should a thorough education in any one department of Art , say of Architecture , be aimed at , or only the general presentation and discussion of the subject of Art ? Ought scholarships to be instituted for the continuous prosecution of artistic study by those who evince decided talent or desire to study ? Should such a school aim to make professional artists of a few , or confine itself simply to a general diffusion of the refining and elevating influences of such an institution among the many ? These and similar practical questions are to be settled before a University School of Art can work itself into the general plan of study , and go into successful operation . It may be , however , that by once making a beginning , these questions would settle themselves . In any systematic study ot Art , therewould necessarily be three grand departments : first , the theoretical , or instruction in the fundamental principles of *sthetics , in what might be called the philosophy of Art as related to the constitution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , the historical , or instruction in the development and progress of Art in the various epochs of the world 's civilization , and in connection with the different phases of humnan thought and life ; third , the practical , or instruction in the practice of Art , and the varied details of artistic education . Of course each particular branch of art // would demand its own special course of study and instruction . Architecture as a useful art , would perhaps form the chief study and every-day employment of an Art School . It would be its central theme . The rules of Architecture are definite and scientific , more capable of being taught to the many than those of any other branch of Art , and its study would produce certain and direct results *n general education . Why should not good architects be reared by a college , as well as good chemists or physicians ? To aid this course of artistic instruction , there should be good models in all the departments . A gallery of pictures is indispensable , but only if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of quantitatively . On no point , we think , should there be a stricter censorship than here . A man may be allowed to have a tolerable painting in his private parlor , for , perhaps , it is the best he can afford ; but good models are imperatively needed in a school of Art . To be sure , we can not expect to have the riches of the Old World galleries , or the best pictures in the world at first ; but no absolutely bad picture , false in drawing , crude in conception , glaring and unnatural in coloring should be admitted . In sculpture , since original works of great merit are at first out of the question , plaster casts of the most celebrated statues , taken from the originals , and not second hand , are required . In architecture , models , elevations and plans , with a good collection of architectural photographs , would be needed . A room devoted exclusively to engravings , illustrating the history and progress of that interesting art , would also be an important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appliances requisite for the thorough fitting out and furnishing of a School of Art , and above all , proper instruction in the different departments , would be an affair of considerable magnitude , and would call largely upon the generosity of the true patrons of education in the land . We have no royal or noble patrons of our schools and seats of learning , but there is a strong spirit of affectionate loyalty among the alumni of our colleges towards the parent institution , and a desire to make them all that the needs of an advancing civilization demand . There is also a growing liberality among our merchant princes // towards all that fosters a broad idea of education . There is also an increasing love of art in this class . The steadily growing appreciation of art and artists in the city of New York , from the time of Jarvis and the founding of the Academy , to the present , when such great sums are given for the paintings of our native artists , forms in itself a remarkable history . In conclusion , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will give an extract from a letter recently received from an able , practical instructor in one of our American Schools of Design . " My idea respecting art studies is that every one ought to take drawing as a regular part of his education at school , thus developing the judgment in regard to form , proportion , &amp;c . This is useful in every walk of life , and needs but little time , being at the same time a rest for the brain after severer study . Then , when the usual common course of study is completed a youth will know whether he has power to pursue those branches where drawing is requisite-such as engineering , architecture , &amp;c . I would , as far as possible , discourage the pursuit of art as a means of livelihood . The brilliant success of a Bierstadt or a Church ( after long years of foreign study and travel , which are lost sight of by aspirants ) has lured on many students , who would have been far better in a surveyor 's office or an iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fates because they can not sell their poor pictures .
