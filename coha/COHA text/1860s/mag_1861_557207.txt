We bring these works together as illustrative of modern theoretical astronomy . Were Hipparchus or Ptolemy to rise from the dead , and turn over their pages , he would fail to perceive any indications , other than the occasional name of a planet or a star , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he spent his life . Could he observe the men who wrote them engaged in their scientific avocations , astronomy would be the last branch of knowledge to the cultivation of which he would assign them . So complete a revolution has been wrought in this science by the reduction of all the important celestial phenomena to exact mathematical laws , that a man may rise to the highest eminence as an astronomer without being able to tell one star from another , and without thinking of the heavens otherwise than as they are contained in his mathematical formuke . In order that we may clearly understand the relation in which purely theoretical astronomy stands to other branches of the general science , let us take a brief view of the different classes of operations in the construction of a perfect inductive science . These may be enumerated as follows . 1 . The collection of facts derived from experience . These will form an exact history of the phenomena relating to the science , and have indeed been included by Bacon in the general // term Natural History . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions and aspects of the heavenly bodies . 2 . The inference , by collation of and induction from the facts of natural history , of general laws , and the construction of hypotheses respecting the causes of phenomena . Lord Bacon has given a body of rules for determining systems of empirical relations among phenomena . But these alone are not sufficient for all the purposes of science . It may be advantageous to know , in addition , the mechanism by which such relations are established , or , in other words , the proximate causes of those relations . An exact analysis of the distinction between phenomenal laws and their causes is not within the scope of the present paper , and we shall only remark , that the theory of gravitation properly comes under the former class , since it does not assign any cause for celestial phenomena , but only reduces them to an empirical law . 3 . The next process is one of deduction . Starting from the general principles which have been inferred or guessed at , in the operation of induction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and thus attempt the prediction of as great a variety as possible of unknown phenomena . The deduction must be made , if possible , by mathematical reasoning , in order that the results may be given in quantity as well as in kind . Modern science is not satisfied with general statements respecting the kind of result ; it also demands , How much ? And before an hypothesis can be received , its results must agree in quantity as well as quality with those derived from experience . 4 . Finally , the consequences which the mathematician or other deductive reasoner has found to flow from the hypothetical principles are compared with observations , and their agreement or disagreement noted . If the agreement is perfect within the unavoidable errors of observation , the hypothesis may be regarded as an established theory ; if not , it must be modified or rejected . In the former case , the theory will form the basis of the whole or part of an exact science , and we may then be able to predict phenomena with as much certainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is principally to the deductive branch of astronomy that we propose to call attention in the present article . It is developed by Le Verrier in the Annales and by Hansen in the Auseinandersetzung , in the most nearly perfect form to which h*an ingenuity has yet succeeded in bringing it . Consistin* as it does almost entirely in carrying out the results of the law of gravitation , it might almost be considered a branch of pure mathematics . The problem may be expressed as follows . A certain number of bodies , one of which is very much larger than all the rest , start from given positions , with given velocities , and in given directions , and are then left to their mutual attraction , each being supposed to attract all the others according to the law of gravitation : - to find general rules for calculating their motions during all time . The solution of this problem may be regarded as one of the greatest triumphs of the human intellect . Nothing can be conceived of more hopeless than an unaided attempt to solve it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest genius . He might pass from his cradle to his grave in constant efforts toward this end , without seeing himself any nearer a solution than when he started . Patience and perseverance may , indeed , remove a mountain of sand ; but the task we have supposed would be like the removal of a mountain of solid rock , which , when raised at all , must be raised by a single effort . It was not till nineteen centuries after Apollonius discovered the properties of the conic sections , and four centuries after the revival of letters in Europe , that the mind of man succeeded in inventing an instrument by the aid of which it could grapple with the problem . Simultaneously with the invention of the calculus came the discovery of gravitation ; and even then , with the problem and the instrument for its solution clearly before them , three generations of mathematicians were required to complete the outline of the solution . The method was finally developed , with as much rigor as the problem admitted , by Lagrange and Laplace , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained with much detail , and with great rigor and accuracy , in the first and second volumes of the Annales de 1 ' Observatoire , in such a way as not to require in the reader a more extended knowledge of mathematics than may be obtained from college text-books published in this country . // The solution thus presented is general ; that is , all the perturbations in the motions of planets are expressed algebraically , and all the quantities that differ in differeift planets are expressed , not by separate numbers for each planet , but by algebraic letters which include them all . By substituting for t*se letters the numbers which relate to any particular planet , we ascertain the perturbations of that planet . Unfortunately , however , the possibility of this solution depends on two assumptions , - first , that the planetary orbits are nearly circular , and , secondly , that they are nearly in the same plane . Both these assumptions hold good as to the larger planets and their satellites . But the present century has witnessed the discovery of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are extremely eccentric , and wander beyond the limits of the zodiac . Here the general solution is no longer practicable by any method yet discovered , and we are obliged to confine ourselves to an arithmetical solution for each asteroid separately . To develop the most improved and exact way of doing this is the object of Hansen in the Auseinandersetzung . It is a little remarkable , that , if we take a geometrical view of the mathematical formula which give the position of a planet , we shall find them to represent systems of epicycles analogous to those of Hipparchus and the Greek philosophers . It will be remembered that these early speculators represented the motions of the planets by the conception of a movable circle rolling on the circumference of one that was fixed . A point on the circumference of the moving circle represented , approximately , the motion of a planet . Th* modern mathematician " Girds the sphere With centric and eccentric scribbled o'er Cycle and epicycle , orb in orb , " to a degree of which the ancients never dreamed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the number is theoretically infinite . The centre of a large circle coincides with that of the sun , while its circumference is at a distance equal to the mean distance of the planet . Around this circumference moves the centre , of a small ellipse ; around the perimeter of the latter revolves the centre of a second ellipse , still smaller ; and so on to any extent . From fifty to two hundred // ellipses are practically sufficient , as all beyond are so small as to be inappreciable . The planet is supposed to move around the perimeter of the last ellipse . It is impossible , by any known mathematical methods , to reduce the solution to a more simple form . So complex a motion might at first sight seem incompatible with the simplicity which characterizes the laws of nature in general , and that of gravitation in particular . But it must be remembered that this simplicity pertains to the causes , not the effects . A few of the most simple causes may , by their numerous successive combinations with the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects . A child can comprehend Boscovisch 's atomic theory of matter ; no mortal mathematician can trace its consequences , else it is quite possible that chemistry would cease to be an experimental science . One effect of the perfection of theoretical astronomy has been to render the ancient observations of the positions of the planets nearly valueless . In order that the testimony of an observer may be of any value , he must be able to tell us what he saw with more exactness than we can determine it ourselves . But with respect to most of the ancient observations respecting time and position , - the two great astronomical elements , - a mathematician of the nineteenth century can tell what the observers saw better than they could tell themselves . Of a phenomenon of which they can give only the hour , he can determine the minute . Owing to uncertainties respecting the changes in the orbit of the moon , solar eclipses still furnish an exception to this rule ; but there is little doubt that , after another century , we shall be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , future , to his sight At once their wondrous scenes display , " as well with respect to eclipses as to other celestial phenomena . One of the most interesting questions which has arisen from the investigations of modern science in the general laws of nature , is that of the stability of our universe as at present constituted . Is this system fitted to run on forever , in accordance with its present laws , or will these laws , // in the end , lead to its subversion ? The conclusion was reached by Laplace , and has been confirmed by subsequent investigators , that , so far as the force of gravitation alone is concerned , the system is stable . Every change which the attraction of one planet produces in the orbit of another will finally induce its own compensation , and bring the system back to its original state . But the discoveries of the present century respecting the correlation of the different forces of nature , the conservation of force in general , the nature of the solar light and heat , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is by no means the only force by which the motions of the heavenly bodies are influenced , and that causes which slowly , but surely , undermine the system are in operation ; - that the latter is not , therefore , a self-winding clock , which may run forever , but that it must ultimately lose all motion , unless some power , capable of controlling the laws of material nature , shall interfere to preserve it . We shall give some examples of these destructive forces . In the first place , the sun is radiating heat into space in quantities incomparably greater than it receives . If it were not so , we should receive , on the average , as much heat from every other quarter of the heavens as from the sun , and no vicissitudes of temperature could ever occur on the earth . From what we know of the nature of heat , it is impossible that the supply contained in the sun should be absolutely infinite . The sun must , therefore , as centuries advance , grow cooler and cooler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by the cooling of the earth , and thus all life on our planet must cease , or the conditions of its existence must be completely changed . It may be asked , Is it certain that the heat of the sun is not returned to it in some other form ? It is , of course , impossible to give any absolute and direct proof that the sun does not receive heat , or its equivalent , from some unknown source ; but it is certain that we can trace the operation of no natural law which would tend to return heat to the sun , and that the existence of any such operation seems improbable . It has bben suggested , that the sun may be supplied with fuel by comets or other bodies falling into it . But there are two objections to this hypoth // esis , either of which would be fatal . In the first place , a supply of some supporter of combustion , such as oxygen , is as necessary as is a supply of combustible matter . In the next place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun in sufficient quantities to keep up its supply of heat ; for a mass of bituminous coal of the size of our globe , would , by its combustion , supply the sun for about thirty days , and the largest comet would not furnish it with fuel for an hour . The mechanical force with which a body as heavy as our globe would fall into the sun from an infinite distance would , if converted into heat , supply a quantity of this agent sufficient to last the sun only about sixty years . If , then , the heat of the sun is kept up at all , it must be by means of some invisible influence , inscrutable to mortals ; a supposition which we may well reject , in view of the fact that we have no more reason to suppose that the Deity intended the sun to be eternal , than that he intended the earthly life of man to be so . Another element of destruction probably exists in the form of a very rare resisting medium . It is true that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with certainty , yet we have some evidence in its favor . There is no reason , a priori , why we should suppose the planetary spaces to be perfectly void ; on the contrary , the general analogies of nature would lead us to suppose that they still contain something material . Now there are two classes of phenomena which point to the existence of an ether , filling all space , and possessing the property of inertia . These are as follows . 1 . The phenomena of light and heat . These seem to be due to a vibratory or oscillatory motion among the molecules of an ethereal medium . By the heat-vibrations force may be communicated from one body to another distant body having no material connection with it ; it is therefore concluded that the ether is possessed of the property of inertia . In our ignorance of the exact nature of its motion , and the amplitude of its vibrations or oscillations , we have not sufficient data for determining the density of the hypothetical medium . But this density , however small , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies moving through it . // 2 . The observations of Encke 's comet made during the last thirty or forty years show that its motion is continually undergoing acceleration * from some cause , and that , if this continues , it will in a few centuries fall into the sun . This comet , being a small nebulous mass of excessive tenuity , is precisely the object which would be most affected by a resisting medium , and Encke attributes its acceleration to this cause . His view is controverted by other astronomers , some of whom attribute the anomalies of the comet to the repellent action of the sun in driving off the comet 's tail , - a subject to which we shall presently revert . In view of these controverted points , it will be hardly fair to consider it certain that the motions of the planets will ever be affected by the ether , especially as it is possible that , even if the ether exists , it may not affect their motions . Yet another cause , slowly producing an entire change in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon and the tide-wave . As the latter glides over the oceans , and rushes into the numerous indentations of the coast , the motions which it produces in the waters necessarily involve an expenditure of power , or vis viva , in overcoming the effects of friction . The vis viva thus expended must be drawn from the set of machinery which produces the motions , that is , from the motion of revolution ' of the moon and the motion of rotation of the earth . It can not be returned to this machinery , because all that is not spent in triturating the sand or other material which forms the bed of the ocean is turned into heat and radiated off into space . Its loss will manifest itself in exactly the same way in which a resisting medium would take effect ; that is , the motion of revolution of the moon will be accelerated , and the rotation of the earth retarded , till the day and the lunar month become equal . The action of such a cause is traceable in the rotation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our satellite has always , since the earliest records of its appearance , presented * It may appear paradoxical that a resisting medium should cause the motion of a body moving through it to be accelerated . It produces this effect indirectly . If the medium retards the body by the smallest amount , the latter will fall slightly toward the centre of attraction , and the increase of velocity caused by this fall will more than compensate for the retardation which produced it . // the same face to the earth . It is in the highest degree improbable that its rotary motion was in the beginning exactly adjusted so as to produce this effect . But if the moon were liquid , or covered by a liquid , the immense tides produced by the earth would in time produce the effect which we now see . The hypothesis that the equality in the times of revolution and of rotation of the moon is to be attributed to this cause , derives additional strength from the fact that the satellites of Jupiter seem to follow the same law . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence of the acceleration of the moon 's motion and the consequent diminution of the lunar month , she will in a few thousand years be half a month ahead of the place in which she would be if her month were to remain constant , and will therefore be on the opposite side of the earth . If her time of rotation remained constant during that period , the side which is now hidden would then be presented toward the earth , so that our posterity of two hundred centuries hence would have an opportunity of unveiling its mysteries . But analysis has answered the question for them , and demonstrated to us that the hemisphere of our satellite which is now turned from the earth will so remain , hidden from mortal eyes , to eternity . Poets then may let the imagination run unlicensed over its scenes of ineffable beauty , and people it with giants or genii of any order of magnitude or intelligence , walking through Elysian Fields of boundless extent ; or they may make it into Tartarean depths , compared with which the fiery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrid crew " will sink into insignificance , without the slightest apprehension that the most remote posterity will ever see anything inconsistent with their descriptions . Viewing the system of the world , then , with the aid of all the light that can be thrown on it by science and by philosophy , selecting the most probable causes for those phenomena of nature which we can not deduce from the known general laws of the.universe , and tracing these and all known causes to their most remote and latent effects , - making at every step all due allowance for our ignorance , and giving proper weight to every sound philosophical principle which bears on either side , - there seems to be a decided preponderance of // evidence in favor of the doctrine that this system is not entirely self-sustaining and self-compensating , but is subject to actions which must lead to its ultimate subversion . We may compare the counter effects of the sustaining and destroying processes to the chemical and physiological actions which are at play during the life of an animal . On a first examination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , we should find it composed of materials subject to speedy decomposition , - wasting from every pore , liable to a thousand accidents which would insure its speedy dissolution , and to all outward appearance destined , under the most favorable circumstances , to live but a few hours . A more extended examination into the laws and conditions of its existence , into the operations of those organs whose office it is to repair the waste by the admission , digestion , and assimilation of food , and into the means of counteracting the effects of all destructive chemical and mechanical action to which the animal would ordinarily be subjected , would seem to show that these objects were perfectly fulfilled , so that every day might find the animal in exactly the same bodily state in which it was left on the day previous . As far as physiology could determine , the animal might continue to exist forever . Yet , if we were able to perceive the intimate mechanism by which the operations of repair were effected , and not its correlations with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which each new particle replaced the previous one , we should find certain imperfections in the operations . We should find that every successive cell , by a necessary law of the organism , was in some way different from the previous one ; and although the progressive changes thus produced in the organism might at first sight seem insignificant , a careful examination would show that they would necessarily , at some future time , lead to the dissolution of the animal . So with the cosmos , the first thought of a system of bodies moving among one another in every direction , and entirely given up to their mutual attractions , would lead us to apprehend that by virtue of this attraction they must speedily fall intQ one another , and form themselves into a single mass . But a careful examination , by mathematical analysis , of the combined effects of the destructive force of gravitation and // of the motions with which the bodies were originally endowed , shows that these are so combined that under their influence alone the system might continue to eternity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extend our investigations beyond the law of gravitation which regulates the great and salient phenomena of the universe , to the less obtrusive mechanisms discovered by a more minute examination of the lesser phenomena , we find little leaks of power , which , unless counteracted in some way no*yet discovered , must ultimately lead to subversion . Another cosmical question which theoretical considerations have greatly aided us in limiting is that of the infinite extent of our system of stars . To the reflective astronomer , as he sounds depth after depth of starry systems , to all appearance bottomless , no subject of speculation would appear more attractive . As in all other questions which we are not able to solve by direct experiment , we must begin by asking what consequences would follow from the affirmative and the negative of the question respectively . Starting from the hypothesis that infinite space was scattered with stars , mathematicians had no difficulty in proving that , unless the light were absorbed in its passage through space , the whole celestial vault would be one blaze of light , brilliant as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would appear as dark patches . It was therefore concluded by Ch6seaux and Olbers , that the celestial spaces probably contained some ether which possessed the power of absorbing light . This theory was subjected to a test by Struve , in his work entitled Etudes d'Astronomie Stellaire , in the following manner . If the stars are equably distributed through space , and are of equal absolute brilliancy , the number of stars of each magnitude would be at least four times as great as that of the next larger magnitude , supposing that no light were lost . An extinction of light would lessen the proportionate number of small stars . Now , this is precisely what is found to be the case ; whence it is concluded , either that the stars are more numerous in the neighborhood of our system , or that light is absorbed . Considering the former horn of the dilemma very improbable , Struve adopts the iatter , though it can not yet be considered as an established theory . 32 * // One object of Struve 's investigation was to show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appearance of the heavens . But this is not the only difficulty to which the hypothesis of such an infinite universe as we have supposed would lead . Unless heat as well as light is absorbed , we should experience a temperature compared with which that of a reverberatory furnace would be as the frozen pole . The principal difficulty , l*iowever , would be that resulting from the attraction of the infinite mass of stars . The attractions of the different parts of such a mass could not counterbalance themselves everywhere , and some systems would be exposed to an infinite attraction . True , it is difficult exactly to define what stars would come into this category . At first sight it might appear that , since each star is equally surrounded by an infinite series of other stars , each ought to be equally attracted in all directions . This conclusion would be correct , if the combined attractions of the more distant stars gradually diminished , so as to vanish at infinity . But , although the attractions of the separati* bodies do diminish as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be contained in a spherical surface , at any given distance , will increase in the same proportion that the attraction will diminish , so that the combined attraction will not vary at all . Now , if we examine the reasoning on which the conclusion cited above is based , we shall find that it tacitly assumes that for every attracting mass of stars on one side of any star , taken at pleasure , there is an equal attracting mass on the other side to counterbalance it . We thus profess to compare two infinite magnitudes , and pronounce them absolutely equal . But two magnitudes can be pronounced absolutely equal only when certain relations exist between their boundaries . Now , by hypothesis , our magnitudes are infinite , therefore without bounds , and therefore without means of comparison , so that the whole reasoning is illusory . Moreover , it is mathematically demonstrable that , if the stars in any one position were in an equilibrium as to the opposing forces , this could be the case in no other position . It rhust be understood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars as scattered indiscriminately , but with // a certain approach to uniformity , through space . But the hypothesis of an infinite increase does not necessarily involve this arrangement , or any of its attendant difficulties . We need only suppose , with Lambert and others , that the mode of formation which we see carried out in those portions of the universe visible to our eyes is continued to infinity , that out of a proper number of systems of a lower order systems of a higher order are formed , and that the separate systems are always placed at vast distances compared with the dimensions of the system . The lowest systems in this series are composed of a planet , with one or more satellites , the dimensions of which , astronomically speaking , are inconsiderable . The separate planets are formed into the solar system , being placed at distances of hundreds , or even thousands , of millions of miles . The fixed stars , which are supposed to be the centres of solar systems like our own , are placed at distances so great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point in the comparison . There may be great numbers of other starry systems or milky-ways like ours formed into a system , a collection of these systems into another , and so on , without end . Of course we are now in the domain of pure speculation , as all systems of a. higher order than those composed of individual stars must remain forever invisible to mortal eyes , and while man dwells on our planet he has no more means of becoming acquainted with their existence than he has of seeing the inhabitants of Neptune . The subject may therefore be dismissed with the remark , that the arrangement is not , so far as can be seen , carried out with perfect regularity . Other starry systems seeM to merge insensibly into clusters forming part of our Milky-Way . A few words with regard to late efforts to make " our refractory satellite " travel in the paths prescribed for her by algebraic formuhe . In speaking of the perfection to which Lagrange and Laplace brought the theory of the system of the world , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's motion . Although Laplace found a number of observed inequalities to result from the law of gravitation , and materially lessened the discrepancies between theory and observation , there were yet some quantities the computation // of which he found SO complicated that he concluded it to be entirely impracticable , and had recourse to observations to determine their value . Damoiseau seems to have been the first who attempted to construct tables of the moon founded entirely on the theory of gravitation . These were published in 1824 ; but , as they never displaced those of Burckhardt , published in 1812 , they can not be regarded as successful . The next laborer in this field was the celebrated Hansen of Gotha , of whom we have already spoken . In a work , published in 1838 , entitled Fundamenta nova Investigationis de Orbitce vera ? quam Luna perlustrat , he gave a general method of computing the lunar inequalities from the theory of gravitation . From that time till 1857 he seems to have been principally occupied in the performance of the numerical computations which he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of a set of lunar tables which should excel all previous ones in fulness and accuracy . So long and intricate was this process , that , notwithstanding the patience which could devote nineteen years to such a task , Hansen would have found it impracticable but for the assistance of the British government . Through the influence of the Astronomer Royal , the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty furnished Hansen , from time to time , with considerable sums for the employment of assistance , and when the work was finally completed , they undertook the entire expense of its publication , and liberally distributed copies throughout the world . About the time that Hansen commenced the construction of his tables , Professor Airy undertook a somewhat different investigation , with the same *nd in view . This was nothing less than the reduction of all the lunar observations made at Greenwich from 1750 till 1830 , and their comparison with the most approved theory , in order to discover what differences still existed between the theoretical and observed positions . The theory adopted was that of Plana , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method . One of the principal results arrived at was , that an inequality which no astronomer had yet found to ensue from gravitation , and on the very existence of which doubts had been cast , did undoubtedly exist . Airy wrote to Hansen , requesting him to // make this inequality the sub , ject of special investigation . This astronomer finally found that two inequalities , each having a period of about two hundred and forty years , would result from the attraction of Venus , and on calculating their amount , and correcting the theory of the moon to accord with them , the discrepancies which had for half a century bade defiance to all the efforts of the mathematician were found to disappear . The satellite was right , after all , as she had been found to be in former contests , and she now performs her monthly course in exact accordance with the theory of gravitation . On the establishment of the American Nautical Almanac in 1849 , one of the most important objects was the preparation of the Lunar Ephemeris . The reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , was completed by Airy , and the results had just been given to the world . The discoveries of Hansen respecting the newly discovered inequalities were now at the command of the astronomer ; but a painful doubt still existed respecting the time when his Tables of the Moon would be completed . All the large European Ephemerides still used the tables of Burckhardt , forty years old , and , though the best systematic set yet published , giving places of the moon so erroneous that their continued use has been lately pronounced a disgrace to scienc* . Under these circumstances , it was determined to make a new set , based on Plana 's theory , which had been used by Airy in computing the theoretical places of the moon for the purpose of comparison with observation , and adding such terms as were shown to be necessary by the theoretical investigations of Hansen and the comparisons of Airy with observation . The object which would thus be attained would be the prediction of places of the moon very nearly exact , rather than of those places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their value in a purely scientific aspect , because , unless a set of tables is constructed on the last-mentioned principle , their comparison with observation can neither lead to any very definite result respecting the corrections to be made in the fundamental elements of the theory , nor throw any light on the question whether any unknown sources of disturbance affect the motion of the moon . // It does not appear that the American tables were expected , at the time of their construction , to continue sufficiently accurate for permanent use ; but they have thus far passed well through some severe tests . They have furnished data for the prediction of solar eclipses , with unexampled precision . The average differences between the positions of the moon observed at Washington and Greenwich , and those given by the tables , during 1856 , 1857 , 1858 , and 1860 , are as follows - II II 1856 . . . 3.5 1858 . . . 3.6 1857 . . 2.8 1860 . . 3.7 The absolute errors of the predicted places must , however , be less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heavenly bodies with entire accuracy . The ephemeris computed from Hansen 's tables for 1852 has been found to agree with observation about as well as that from the American tables in 1857 , and therefore better than the American tables in other years . No complete comparisons of those tables with observations made in years subsequent to 1852 have yet been published ; we have , therefore , no data for comparing the practical values of the two tables . To give an idea of the absolute accuracy of these modern tables , and the fidelity with which they furnish positions of the moon , we may remark that the smallest round object visible to the unassisted eye subtends an angle of about a minute , and that two such objects will to an ordinary eye seem like a single object if their distance apart is less than three minutes . To the naked eye , the two stars E Lyrw* present the appearance of a single star somewhat elongated . Their distance apart is somewhat more than three and a half minutes . Yet this seemingly inappreciable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each portioi* may be equal to the average difference between the real position of the moon and that predicted from theory . Notwithstanding the apparent slowness of the diurnal motion* the time of rising of the theoretical moon will very seldom differ half a second from that of the real one . An example of the amount by which a planet must wander from its assigned orbit to produce a commotion in the astro // nomical world , is furnished by those anomalies in the motion of Uranus which led to the discovery of Neptune . After being for thirty years a source of perplexity to astronomers , they were measured with such accuracy as to indicate to within a degree the direction of the planet producing them . Yet , if two stars visible to the naked eye had moved through the heavens during those thirty years , one keeping in the position of the actual Uranus , the other in that of the theoretical Uranus , the naked eye could at no time have perceived any indication that the two did not form a single star . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be satisfactorily accounted for by the theory of gravitation . But the last few years have given birth to a most singular mathematical controversy , which may reasonably justify a suspension of judgment on the point to which we have referred . Common consent would no doubt place mathematicians at the extremity of the scale of agreement directly opposite that assigned by the proverb to doctors . But common consent must revise its notion of the remorseless rigor of every step in every course of math*matical reasoning ; for we now have the singular spectacle of half a dozen of the greatest of living mathematicians disputing for years on a point of pure mathematics . With the possible exception of an attack by Mr. Ivory , some forty years ago , on a proposition of Laplace respecting the attraction of spheroids , such a dispute is , we think , without a precedent in the history of mathematics . The puerile contest between the English and the Continental philosophers , in the days of Leibnitz , respecting the force of a moving body , was purely a question of terminology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except as an example of the mental blindness , in one direction , of the greatest intellects of that age . It is well known that , since the earliest recorded observations , the moon has from century to century been gradually increasing its rate of motion . This acceleration has been traced by Laplace to the secular diminution of the eccentricity of the earth 's orbit , from which we conclude that it has been going on for fifteen thousand years past , and will continue for twenty-four thousand years to come . Its amount was calculated by Laplace at about ten // seconds in a century . The calculations of subsequent astronomers gave values varying from 10 " to 12 " , the differences proceeding from the different estimates of the fundamental data , such as the distance of the sun , and from the completeness with which the large number of very small terms were included in the final result . These values were found , on the whole , to agree as well as could be expected with certain ancient eclipses , observed at Babylon and elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Thus , up to 1854 , the theoretical amount of this acceleration was considered as perfectly determined . But in the Philosophical Transactions for that year Mr. John C. Adams published a paper , contending that the solution of Laplace and his successors was erroneous , and giving a new computation of his own , in which he reduced the amount of acceleration to 6 " . It was soon found that M. Delaunay , an eminent French astronomer , who had for many years been engaged on a new theory of the moon , brought out a result exactly agreeing with that of Adams , although his method of investigation was radically different both from that of Mr. Adams and from those of preceding astronomers . This might naturally be expected to settle the question in favor of the new determination . The fact that every step in a course of mathematical reasoning is a vigorous logical deduction , does not preclude all possibility of error , because even the mathematician may , in conducting a very complicated course of analysis , be guilty of some inadvertence involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it does lead us to suppose that , when the error is once pointed out , it will be recognized as an error by every one capable of fully comprehending the reasoning . Several such instances are found in the history of mathematics . In the present case , however , the arguments of Adams and Delaunay , instead of being assented to , were attacked on all sides . De Pont6coulant began by vigorously sustaining the old theory , and iii the Gomptes Bendus of the French Academy and the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society poured into the ranks of the innovators a hot fire of mathematical formula , and profound distinctions between the different meanings of the term " mean motion . " // B ut a careful recalculation of the acceleration led him to a result which differed from both the old and the new one , being about 8 " . This value he vigorously supports . Plana seems to have vacillated considerably , and to have promised an extended memoir on the subject . This paper , so far as we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be entirely satisfied of the accuracy of the old theory , and the consequent inaccuracy of the new one . Le Verrier attacked his associate , M. Pelaunay , in person , for his mendacity in bringing out a theoretical result which did not agree with observation . On the other hand , the attacking party has always answered " gun for gun " ; and , so far as can be judged from an outside view , has rather the best of the argument . We are not aware that any reply has yet been made to Mr. Adams 's paper in the ' Monthly Notices for May , 1860 . So the discussion may , for the present , be regarded as dropped , if not settled . It seems to be well established that the new theory is inconsistent with the observations of ancient eclipses , and if it should prove to be correct , we may be driven to the conclusion , that a portion of the acceleration proceeds from some other cause than the attraction of gravitation , or that the length of the day is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cause to which we have already referred . if , as centuries roll by , the day should gradually increase , the moon would move a little farther in the course of a day than if no such increase should take place . Since , in our calculations , we suppose the day constant , the apparent acceleration would be greater than the real , - precisely the effect observed . The difference can be entirely accounted for by supposing an increase of something less than one thousandth of a second per century in the length of the day , and a corresponding diminution in the lunar month . It may be asked , Why have not a sufficient number of mathematicians entered on so singular and interesting a question to decide it in less than seven years ? The answer may be found in the general fact that mathematical scholarship is not held in high esteem by mathematicians . The poet , the essayist , and the historian expect their works to be read both by those who are and those who are not themselves poets , // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a subject as the theory of the moon can not reasonably expect his work to be read either by those who are or those who are not mathematicians . The latter class have no taste for it , while the former , if they are able to read the work at all , will prefer making original investigations of their own to poring over those which have been made by others . In no other science is the maxim Sordet cognita veritas more fully acted on . A mathematician is estimated , not by what he knows , but by what he has added to the sum total of knowledge . It thus happens that , in a case like the present , although there may be fifty men capable of coming to an independent conclusion , if they would spend time and trouble to read up on the general subject , there are but four or five sufficiently familiar with it to enter into the discussion without much preparation . We pass now to the consideration of a question which has excited considerable public interest in the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun and Mercury ? The history of such a supposed planet is fresh in the recollections of almost every one . Le Verrier aiinounced c*rtam secular changes in the eccentricity of the orbit of Mercury for which he could not account by the attractions of the known planets ; he therefore suggested that they might be caused by the attraction of a ring of planets within the orbit of Mercury . He also recommended that observers should systematically note all minute spots on the surface of the sun , with a view of seeing whether they might not be planets in transit . Shortly after the publication of these remarks , in the latter part of 1859 , Le Verrier received a letter from iDr . Lescarbault , a physician and amateur astronomer of Org*res ( a village about sixty miles from Paris ) , stating that he had on the 26th of March previous seen an intramercurial planet cross the sun . He gave his observations with considerable particularity , and they were seized upon by Le Verrier as furnishing proof of the existence of the supposed planet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supposition that its path was a circle , and even a name was selected for it and proposed to the Bureau des Longitudes . Articles were // published in newspapers and magazines , in which the new planet was spoken of as if it had really been discovered , and as if its existence had been actually predicted by Le XTerrier . The public were thus led to believe in its actual existence , and in another great triumph of celestial mechanics in the discovery of an unseen body . How did astronomers view the matter ? At first they were doubtless raised by the sudden wave of evidence into the belief that the supposed planet might actually exist . No reason is known why the series of planets should end at Mercury , and the work of raking up old observations similar to that of the village physician was vigorously prosecuted . Many cases were found in which persons in England and elsewhere had seen spots cross the sun 's disk ; but , unfortunately , in no case were the circumstances recorded with the detail necessary to furnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . It was soon seen , however , that the new planet was by no means large enough to produce any sensible effect on the orbit of Mercury ; indeed , Le Verrier , in stating his original hypothesis , had supposed a group of planets , for the reason that , had there been but one , its magnitude and brilliancy would have been such that it could not have escaped discovery . The more numerous the planets , the more frequently they ought to cross the sun 's disk , and thus the more singular it seems that no recognized astronomer should , within the last twenty years , have seen a single transit . Indeed , Lescarbault 's planet alone must , according to Le Verrier 's elements , cross the sun 's disk , on an average , about once every eighteen months . Thirteen transits of that one planet , if it exists , must therefore have occurred within twenty years ; and does it seem credible that , if this were so , they would all have escaped the eagle eyes of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from a quarter whence it was least expected . After several months , copies of scientific periodicals containing the accounts of Lescarbault 's observation were borne to Brazil , and there fell into the hands of M. Liais . This gentleman had formerly been an astronomer in the observatory of Paris , but was now chief of // the Coast Survey of Brazil . He at once remembered that he had been engaged , in the spring of 1859 , in making careful observations of the surface of the sun . On referring to his records , he found that , at the very time when Lescarbault had , according to his account , been viewing the transit of a planet , he had himself been examining the same part of the sun , without seeing anything of the kind . This would seem to render it reasonably certain that Dr. Lescarbault was in some way mistaken ; but what the nature of the mistake might be it is of course impossible to determine . It by no means follows that he was guilty of dishonesty . It is proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Academy of Sciences of Paris as leading to a discovery . The doctrine that gravity is the only force which acts on the heavenly bodies has received a rude blow from late investigations respecting the motions of the tails of comets . These motions were as great a source of perplexity to modern astronomers as the apparitions of the comets themselves were to the ancients . They whisked around with such enormous velocity as to give rise to grave doubts whether they were really material . Certainly their movements could be controlled by no force like gravitation . And why did they always persistently point in the direction opposite that of the sun ? It was reserved for Bessel to frame an hypothesis which should account for these anomalous phenomena . In his view , the tail is not a single persistent object carried along with the comet , but a stream of matter , poured from the nucleus , and driven off by the repulsive force of the sun . When the comet is far from the sun , its coldness is such that little nebulous or vaporous matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a tail . As it approaches the sun , and is exposed to a more intense heat , the vapor rises with greater and greater rapidity , and a larger and more splendid appendage is thus formed . Like every other theory which is not a vera causa , this must be tested by the completeness with which all its consequences agree with observation . Bessel first made its application , mathematically , to the comet of Halley , in 1835 , and found that , by assuming a proper intensity for the repulsive force of the sun , the form and motions of the tail could be represented with considerable fidelity . // Upward of twenty years seem to have elapsed without any serious attempt either to prove or disprove the hypothesis of Bessel . In 1858 , the splendid comet of Donati , which for more than a month filled the western heavens with its splendor on every clear evening , excited as much interest among astronomers as among the public . The magnitude , brilliancy , and fineness of outline of its tail , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peculiarly fitted it for the application of Bessel 's theory . The subject was at once taken up by Professor Peirce , who commenced by deducing more rigorous mathematical formuhe for the motion of the tail than those given by Bessel . He soon found that all the observations could not be satisfied without supposing the repulsive force to be variable for different points of the tail . On the front edge it seemed to be half as strong again as the regular attraction of the sun , while on the back edge it seemed to vanish entirely . With this form of the hypothesis the positions of the tail during a period of several weeks were found to be quite well satisfied . It can scarcely be doubted , then , that Bessel 's theory leads to a law which gives the form and position of the tail ; in other words , that the tails of comets exhibit the same phenomena that they would if Bessel 's hypothesis were true . This , however , does not absolutely prove the hypothesis itself , bccause it sometimes happens that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least two serious , though not fatal , objections present themselves to the hypothesis . In the first place , the comet must lose at every revolution a small but appreciable portion of its matter . On any probable hypothesis respecting the age of our system , some of the comets which still exhibit tails must have revolved around the sun millions of times . Why was not all the tail-forming matter contained in them dissipated millions of years ago ? In every other branch of the system , all the uncompensated changes are , as we have seen , excessively slow , so as to require enormous periods of time to produce any sensible effect ; in this hypothesis , comets would seem to fall out of the range of this rule , if they lose a considerable portion of their matter in every revolution . It may be replied , either that in the begin-33* // fling all comets were of such prodigious magnitude as not yet to have lost all their volatile matter by the heat of the sun ; or that , in the celestial spaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoption of either of these alternatives would , however , weaken the hypothesis . It is a general principle in induction , that every theory which is obliged to assume a number of subsidiary facts or conditions not otherwise known to exist , is , ceteris paribus , weakened in proportion to their number , even though no positive objection can be raised against any one of them . This is , in fact , but an application of the law of parsimony . Another answer to the objection is , that we see indications of such a process as the theory supposes . Many bright comets have been seen to pour forth streams of matter from the side of the nucleus next the sun , which matter seemed to spread around the nucleus , and to assist in the formation of the tail . Bright hemispherical envelopes also rise from the same side of the nucleus , and seem to assist in the formation of the coma . The fact that all comets which exhibit a large tail are of long period , is also accounted for by supposing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sun . Another objection to the theory is , that we have no evidence that the sun exerts a repulsive force on any other celestial bodies . In the motions of all the planets , and their satellites , it is distinctly seen that the attraction of gravitation is the only force exerted by the sun upon them ; and the exertion of a repulsive force stronger than that of gravitation is entirely anomalous . The cause assigned for the supposed repulsion is electricity . If this explanation is correct , the sun must be either positively or negatively electrified to a degree sufficient to make its repulsion felt at a distance of hundreds of millions of miles . We have thus briefly noted the more prominent arguments for and against Bessel 's hypothesis , without pretending to determine which side is entitled to the greatest weight . Until more decisive results are obtained , and the changes which go on in the nuclei and the tails of comets are more minutely ascertained and reduced to law , the opinions of astronomers will differ on this point .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
