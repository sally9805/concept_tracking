A TALK WITH OUR NEXT PRESIDENT . A WHOLE year intervenes between our words and the next presidential eleclion . You , therefore , whom we address , our future President , are a distant impersonal presence , to which we can give no name . You remain to us a mere nominis umbra . It may be that we are addressing our most distinguished General , known and tried , a man whose modesty is only surpassed by his worth ; or it may be that the responsibilities of the presidential office will devolve upon our present Chief Justice , who was a prominent candidate for nomination in the Chicago Convention of 1860 , who , while the nation was distracted by an exhausting civil war , succeeded in establishing our credit upon a secure and permanent foundation ,  --  a work which , considering its peculiar difficulties , required for its accomplishment a high order of genius , a sublime faith in the honor as well as in the power of the Republic , and the most indomitable perseverance ; and who is well qualified to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irreproachable purity of character , but also by his experience as a statesman . But here , and for the purposes of this paper , we may not venture to speak with confidence as to any particular candidate ; and , even if we might , we prefer that our argument should proceed according to general principles , and independently of the success of any individual leader . Our destiny does not hang upon the fortunes of any single man . The most exalted popular idol is not exempt from mortal chance . Once already we have been cheated by death , and we may be again . Possibly  --  and it would not be a case without precedent  --  the people may be defrauded of their especial choice by that despotic party machinery upon which presidential nomina tions too frequently depend . Let us hope that we may be deluded neither by fate nor by partisanship : but , if we are , our faith still remains , the great argument still holds good . Your Excellency , in any event , must in an important sense represent the popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its opportunities certainly justify that . The honors which you assume are not empty ornaments , such as kings are crowned with , but positive and substantial powers . You are elected by the whole people . Senators represent States , Congressmen represent districts ; but you represent the whole , the unit . You are bound by no local interests ; you owe not to these your elevation . No faction can claim you , for no faction could have elected you . Your fealty is to the Constitution , which you are sworn to defend ; to the laws , which you are sworn to execute ; to the principles which controlled your election ; to the interests of the whole people-of those who opposed as well as of those who supported you . This position is a commanding one , and in yourcase it is likely to be so in a special sense . For we may assume that your election , following upon the repudiation by the people of the extremists of both parties , will represent the best sense of the nation . In the constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government it has been wisely arranged that your endowment is the largest so long as you retain the popular support , while it is almost insignificant when you lose that support . By the duty constitutionally imposed upon you of communicating to Congress your views on all important national questions , you become , ex officio , a legislative leader . You suggest , if you can not // directly originate , laws ; and your suggestions can only lack force through your own weakness or want of judgment . Your restrictive power over legislation is so large that it may defeat any congressional majority less than two thirds . In regard to our foreign policy , you may-as Lincoln did in the Franco-Mexican difficulty-disregard the unanimous vote of the Lower House , and need only the co√∂peration of the Senate . You originate all official appointments , and here also depend upon the Senate alone for their confirmation . With the people at your back , you are more than half of the government . The issues which govern your election are so well defined , that your very elevation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Difficulties there are in your path , but they are not insurmountable . The peculiar position which you occupy , by reason of the circumstances which have made you the popular choice  --  a position occupied by no President since James Monroe-will assist you in overcoming these obstacles and enable you to secure that triumphant success which the people anticipate . For you are permitted to enter upon a field of independent action , untrammelled by any pledges save those which bind you to the principles which have hitherto governed your public life . Neither of the two great parties which divide the nation can , by the prestige of its name alone , elect a President . The result of the election must , therefore , be decided by the candidates nominated rather than by the political organizations which nominate them . The party inscribing your name upon its b*nners will succeed through you , and not you through the party . This is a rare case , and to you it affords the most important opportunities . We should have to go far back in our history to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his election to mere party strength , or who could forget his obligations to certain prominent politicians . But with you the case is different : you are not the debtor but the creditor , and are therefore independent , unfettered . The first great result of this independence is your opportunity to effect a complete and radical revolution in the system of official appointments . Indeed , it is possible for you to restore to this system , the purity which characterized it in the earliest years of the Republic , but which so long since vanished that it has come almost to be looked back to as the golden crown of our golden age . But its return is one of the chief objects of the popular desire . The people are disgusted with the flagrant abuses of this system , which if they are continued must terminate in a carnival of corruption . These evils have grown out of our republican institutions . The frequent recurrence of change in our presidential administrations-in itself an excellent feature of our government-affords an opportunity for this abuse of official power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitated the nation have been of such a nature as to give a fearful intensity to party strife-an intensity sufficient to terminate finally in civil war ; and this circumstance has led each successful presidential candidate to the unscrupulous use of every means for the perpetuation of the power of his party . Thus the opportunity furnished by the rotation of Administrations became an irresistible temptation . To the partialities of party was soon added personal favoritism ; so that even where a President succeeded to one of his own party , his accession to power became the occasion for a general decapitation of subordinate officials , to give place for the endowment of personal adherents . The enormity of this evil , of course , reacted upon our politics , until the latter degenerated into a strife for the mere spoils of office . The significance which should belong to the political life of a great nation , and the larger motives which should govern our public men , were lost sight of and our best and purest statesmen retired from a field occupied by mercenary antagonists . In // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and awakened all the latent moral forces of the people . President Lincoln , movcd both by choice and by necessity , called about him the best men of the nation . It is a memorable fact , that every one of his party rivals for the presidential office received a seat in his Cabinet . Nor did he stop here , but went out of the limits of his own party for some of his most important subordinate officers . He not only sought a prominent Democrat to manage the war-office , but the generals most prominent in the first stage of the war were also Democrats , and were only removed after a complete demonstration of their incompetency , when their places were filled by others whose military ability rather than their politics recommended them for the succession . This policy was carried out by Mr. Lincoln in every department of his administration , and ought to have becm* continued by his successor . The close of the war was no reason for a return to the abuses of former years . On the contrary , all the , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The heat of party conflict had spent itself in battle . The whole people , North and South , stood upon the verge of an era of good feeling . President Johnson had it in his power to introduce that era . Instead of doing this , he seemed deaf to every suggestion of the time . The open door to a bright future he shut and locked . Scarcely had he taken the reins of government when he undertook to drive the national team backward . He revived the old shibboleth of party , and every subordinate official who would not support his policy of obstruction was removed . Past fidelity counted for nothing . Neither honesty , capacity , nor experience could save an officer whom the Procrustean test of " my policy " had found wanting . Dishonesty and incapacity stood in the way of no man 's elevation who supported that policy . The last three years afford a record of official corruption unparalleled in the annals of our political history . Fol President Johnson found ready to his hand opportunities for corruption more extensive than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has availed himself of them without limit or scruple* Our immense debt had created a vast and complicated system of internal revenue , and every cog and wheel of this intricate machinery has felt the touch of the President 's hand , and been forced to respond to his wilL Let it be understood that we are not here making an attack upon Secretary MeCulloch or Commissioner Rollins . These officers seem powerless to resist the obstinate will of the President , and over their heads have flown his relentless arrows , piercing our revenue system through and through . This abuse will not long be suffered by the people in silence . Sooner or later reform must come ; and for youas we have said  --  the inauguration of this reform will be comparatively easy . In this matter we shall do wisely if we study the English method . In England , as in this country , there is a complicated system of taxation ; and there the experience of years has taught the important lesson that appointments to offices of trust must depend upon the capacity and integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incoming Administration produces scarcely any change in subordinate offices . The consequence is seen both in the honesty and capacity of the officers employed . Similar results will follow in this country from a radical reform in our system of official appointments . If the abuses of former times-when the number and responsibility of our subordinate officers were comparatively insignificant-resulted in the debasement of our politics , how much more ruinous must these abuses prove under our altered circumstances . We are not surprised that Senator Sumner , in view of these altered circumstances , recently recommended the institution of commissioners , for the examination of candidates as to their qualifications for civil office . // The political difficulties , as well as those to which we have adverted , have not necessarily grown out of the war , but are due to the unfortunate administration which followed the assassination of Lincoln . At the close of the war the harmonious adjustment of our national affairs was comparatively easy . The conquerors only asked of the conquered such guarantees as seemed neces*. sary to permanent union and peace ; and these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is scarcely necessary to remind you of the far different course of events which followed . When the office of President devolved upon Andrew Johnson , whose nomination for Vice-President had been secured by Mr. Seward 's friends in the Baltimore Convention , but who certainly could never have been nominated in view of the sad chance which so soon befell us , two plans for " reconstruction " had already been proposed : one was involved in President Lincoln 's Amnesty Proclamation , and was repudiated by Congress ; the other was the " Wade and Davis Bill , " which passed both Houses , but was virtually vetoed by the President . Both were conceived while the war was yet in progress , and before it had passed its doubtful period , and were therefore premature . Retroverting to the congressional plan , it is somewhat curious that both of its authors-Wade and Davis-distinctly declared against the theory that rebellion could in any manner affect the rights of States-pronouncing it a dangerous heresy ; and yet , among the objections raised by Lincoln against this plan , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that body , by a declaration of universal emancipation ! But when , in the presence of overwhelming victory , the people pondered the subject of reconstruction , the necessities of the problem grew more tang'lble and definite . Long before the Constitutional Amendment of 1866 was proposed , every one of its provisions lad been adopted as an article in the popular creed . It seemed strange to the people that Congress should occupy eight months in deciding upon a policy , the necessity of which was as evident 4 the beginning as at the close of its long session . If they were impatient of this congressional delay , they were more than impatient with-they were indignant at  --  the attempt made by the President to thwart their purpose by insisting upon his narrower views . And the Cabinet , with two or three exceptions , supported this attempt . Even Secretary Stanton , though somewhat noncommittal , publicly expressed his disapprobation of the congressional policy , before the latter had been fully matured . The people alone grasped the great problem . Next stood Congress , cautiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sort of siege . And far , very far remote , stood the President with his constitutional advisers . In the meantime a conflict had developed between the executive and legislative departments of the government ; bitter denunciations were hurled against the President by prominent and apparently leading members of Congress , and the President in return fulminated against these his retaliatory denunciations , and spoke of Congress as a body " hanging upon the verge of the government ; " until where once the difference could have been easily removed , there now yawned a chasm across which it was idle to halloo a reconciliation . It needed only the President 's western tour to the tomb of Douglas to disclose the full extent of his folly ; it needed only the New Orleans riot to reveal the danger which lurked in the encouragement , which , without either congressional or popular sanction , he had held out to men who had just been defeated on the battle-fields of their rebellion , to look upon the war as a myth and upon its results as vanishing shadows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of the Constitutional Amendment . When the Fortieth Congress met it held a peculiar position . There was no prospect of a ratification of the // Amendment by the Southern States , in their present temper . Some means of speedy restoration must be adopted . Either Congress and the people must surrender every thing , or proceed one step farther . Under these circumstances the Military Bill was passed . Its primary object was to effect restoration through popular conventions in the Southern States . In order to accomplish this , all distinctions based upon race or color in the election of the conventions were ignored , and those only were excluded from a vote who had voluntarily participated in rebellion . As to the necessity . of the latter feature there was certainly room for doubt ; as to the necessity of the former there could be no question . We have taken this retrospective glance , because the events of the present administration have enhanced the difficulties and responsibilities which you must meet as our next President . You can not , even if you would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1865 . The conflict of two years between the President and Congress has had its results , which you must meet , for you can not obliterate them . One of these results has been the Military Bill , the primary object of which will be accomplished . The Southern conventions will meet and will form constitutions , which will be ratified by the Southern people . We may assume that these constitutions , framed by delegates thus elected , will provide for universal or impartial suffrage . The action of Congress respecting them will be attended with delay , if in no other way than by the President 's vetoes ; for it is far from probable that measures against which there appears to be so much opposition even in the Northern States , will receive the support of a two-thirds majority in both Houses . This question of the extension of the suffrage must , then , in an important sense , be decided by your voice . In the election both of yourself and of the Forty-first Congress , the people will decide whether they will maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage of the Military Bill . That they will not withdraw from that position seems to us as certain as any political , event can well be before it transpires . You will not therefore be permitted to shift the responsibility by asking , What can I do against the people ? In this connection we do not wish to look upon you as the leader of any party-though we feel sure that you represent that purpose which carried the people on to triumph after four years of war , in spite of the Chicago Convention of 1864 . We prefer to meet you upon the higher plane of principles , far above the dust and turmoil of party antagonisms . From this higher ground we shall more clearly discern the popular purpose , for we shall not be whirled about in any particular eddy of the tide , or thrown back by every refinent wave , but shall see whither the great current tends through all these eddyings and partial repulses . We must not lose sight of this current , of the channels through which it may run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course or another . We shall gain nothing-for nothing is ever thus gained-by that sort of balloon-ascension into the region of abstract principles , so foolishly attempted by a certain class of our statesmen . It is idle to go forth to the people from the temple of Absolute Justice , where we have caught a glimpse of the unveiled goddess , and ask them to be translated into Utopia ; for they will not and can not thus be translated . If we fight in the air , we must be satisfied with phantom antagonists and phantom victories ; and upon descending to the common earth we find that we have to fight our battles all over again under far different conditions . We gain nothing by chafing at these conditions . History rather teaches us a lesson of patience and of faith . For , however slowly , the stream still moves on . Obstacles become only the test and measure of the strength of the current . As they tower and cumulate , it also gathers // up its forces in reserve until some coming storm , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , though its overflow brings momentary desolation to the fields along its banks , yet aftei*vard it subsides within regular and peaceful channels , and flows freely and slowly onward until again compelled to measure its strength against opposing mountains . These periods of convulsion , when , either by its own momentum or by the aid of storms , the progress of an idea triumphs over prejudice , are the grand opportunities of history . It was such an opportunity that President Lincoln embraced when he issued the Emancipation Proclamation . The tendency of the national sentiment has been from the first toward universal freedom . An entire section of the country arrayed itself in opposition , and interposed a check . Up rose the obstacle with menacing front ; up rose also the people , and bore down upon the impediment . Then at length descended the storm of our civil war , invoked at first by the advocates of human slavery , who were confident of riding the whirlwind and controlling the issue . But the magnitude of the conflict brought us face to face with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongest prejudice even in the North against this measure . Almost unanimously Congress had at the beginning of the war determined against interference with Southern institutions . But the necessity was imperative , and Lincoln , almost reluctantly , obeyed . That he was in advance of the people seemed clear from the autumn elections of 1862 , which showed a falling off of the vote from the Administration . But this opposition had no depth and withered away ; it was the last kick before death of Northern sympathy with slavcry . The real sentiment of the people soon began to develop itself . Thus , under the pressure of necessity , the principles of justice and expediency had united , and slavery was abolished . The case of negro suffrage is likely to prove a parallel one to that of negro emancipation . If the Southern people had not , under the effect of Johnson 's policy , refused to adopt the Constitutional Amendment-if the Military Bill had not become a necessity-this question would have been postponed until after restoration . The Fortieth Congress was no more in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in favor of giving him his freedom . Since the close of the war the subject had been mentioned only to be repudiated , not simply as an idle vagary , but as a dangerous innovation . But here again necessity confronted us . As permanent union could not be hoped for without emancipation , so also it was found that Johnson 's policy and the defiant attitude of the South would not admit of restoration and permanent peace , unless the negro was given a voice in the preliminary stage of reconstruction . Congress obeyed a mandate which was just as obvious and imperative as that which compelled Lincoln , and it obeyed it with equal reluctance . Necessity again married Expediency to Justice . To carry out the parallel , the elections of 1867 are to be construed as were those which in 1862 followed the Emancipation Proclamation . The latter , as we have said , were the last kick of slavery ; and in the former the sympathy with class-domination is going through precisely similar ante-mortem convulsions . But you will perhaps say , Mr. President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tendencies of the age are as plainly toward impartial suffrage as they have been toward universal freedom . You are ready to admit the necessity of the Military Bill , and that when the formerly dominant class of the South refused to sit down at the feast to which they were invited , we were obliged to go into the " highways and h*dges " to beat up guests of a different color ; but you will not , perhaps , so readily perceive the application of this necessity beyond the preliminary stages of restoration . We are obliged to ask the negroes to help us in this inceptive act of reconstruction ; // but must we not stop there , and let the power in the States , once restored , revert back to the whites ? If we do this , on the other hand , is it not clear that we go back to the point from which we started ? If we refuse to accept constitutions because they give political power to those whom we have allowed a voice in their formation , we not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must go back again to the very beginning ; and there the old alternative confronts us , of either a complete surrender to Mr. Johnson 's policy , or of a resort to the extension of the suffrage in the South . So far as to the necessities of the case . But what is the popular tendency ? You say the people are opposed to such an extension of the suffrage . Well , even admitting this to be the case , have they not as emphatically declared against the opposite alternative ? One swallow does not make a summer ; sand a single election is not a perfect indication of popular purpose . We think , as we have already intimated , that the late elections represent a refluent wave , which in its next movement will overleap the bar . Besides , the repudiation of negro suffrage in a Northern State is not quite pertinent as an argument applicable to Southern affairs . When the people of Ohio voted upon this question , it was simply a conflict between a prejudice of race on the one side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prejudice triumphed . If , however , one half of the population of Ohio had been colored , the conditions of the conflict would have been altered , and there would have been opposed to prejudice something more than an abstraction ; the question would then have been a vital one for the State , involving considerations of expediency as well as of justice . We will not insult the intelligent white people of Ohio by the supposition that , in that case , they would have determined upon the exclusion of the entire black population on account of color . But to make our hypothesis applicable to the present situation in the South , we must sup . pose that Ohio extends over an entire section of the country ; that one third of its population is colored , and has been emancipated during a war in which the whites of that section threatened to destroy the national government ; that , after a complete national victory , the whites , encouraged by a recreant President , have refused to assent to a constitutional amendment , the principal purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from having nearly twice the power which would belong to those who had remained loyal ; and that , upon this , the nation , compelled to choose between a surrender of this amendment or a resort to the negrovote , has chosen the latter . This is ex4lctly the Southern situation . The question of negro suffrage is there not simply a vital one to each of the Southern States for its own sake , but to the entire nation in the interests of peace . In New York or Connecticut , where no such important issues are depending , it is of comparatively little consequence . But , even if you admit that both the necessities of the momeiit and the popular tendency decide in favor of an extension of suffrage to negroes in the South , you may , perhaps , have your doubt as to the results of immediate and universal suffrage . The risk is undoubtedly great ; but , after all , is it as great as was to be anticipated from sudden and universal emancipation ? President Lincoln had many fears as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclamation , he declared to Congress his preference for a system of gradual emancipation . But Congress , wisely , as the event proved , took the risk . And here also , in this other matter , the risk must be taken . We are confident that the dangers feared are imaginary . Some sagacious politicians predicted , and many feared , that the proclamation of emancipation would be followed by a negro insurrection ; but not a single instance occurred to justify this fear . The apprehension which now exists in the minds of some , that negro suffrage will // bring on a " war of races , " will prove in like manner to have been only a political bugbear . The motive for such a war is far stronger if the blacks are excluded from political rights ; but give them these rights , break down the barrier of caste in the South , and the very occasion for such violent antagonism disappears . We shall find that the very means by which alone we are able to obtain a just basis of restoration , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have the largest proportion of the colored population . There is another consideration from which we may gather hope . So soon as the nation is restored upon the large basis of equal rights for all men , the negro will cease to be an element of . political agitation . Not only so , but the very questions which are now so prominent , and which divide between the two races at the South , will be forever set at rest . As new problems arise , pertaining to finance , commerce , labor , and education , this inveterate prejudice of race-never so strong at the South as it has been at the North - will be ignored as a political element . What opportunity for division can occur between whites and blacks ( as such ) , upon the questions of Free Trade , of Taxation , of Currency , of Common Schools , or of Foreign Policy It will not be a matter of surprise to us , if this measure of negro suffrage should become popular among the Southern whites , when the latter come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our national councils than they could otherwise expect , and that , in all their local interests , they can depend upon the support of a race , the interests of which , by its admission to the body politic , have become identical with their own . The idea that the numerical superiority of the negro population in a few of the Southern States will lead to agrarianism , or to the success of other wild schemes which haunt our too active imaginations , is simply absurd . Intelligence and the advantages of wealth are always more than a counterbalance against an ignorant majority , except in those cases where they are arrayed against the interests of that majority , and then they ought to be defeated . The imumerical majority of the blacks can effect nothing against the whites , except in so far as an attempt is made by the latter to oppress the former . Measures directed against the blacks will unite them in a solid phalanx of resistance . That is fortunate ; we must in such a case pay our reverence to the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority will be divided , and , in proportion to the ignorance of the negroes , the intelligence of the whites will command . That also is fortunate ; in all such cases we pay our reverence to intelligence . As the blacks become educated , and as they advance in industry , they will participate in this higher sovereignty . And ought they not ? Thus , in being just , we accomplish also that which is expedient . If we do right , if we build up the nation anew upon an equitable basis , if we make oppression in this Republic an impossibility , we may feel secure as to consequences , for these will take care of themselves . If we adopt any other course , we must fail , and our proper work will have to be done by those who come after us . Have we been talking too much of the negro ? Well , we need scarcely to apologize for that . Has not the nation for thirty years been nader a black nightmare ? And why ? Simply because there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national conscience . We only did part of our work in emancipation . To complete it , we must insist upon political equality . Social equality will take care of itself ; we need not meddle with that But the hag which has ridden us for so many years refuses to depart and give us peace until we proclaim equal political rights to all men without distinction of color . If we do that , we are free indeed ; if we do less than that , we do nothing . Every page of human history proves // the expediency of universal suffrage . The record is crowded with intestine commotions growing out of the exclusion of large classes from the political community . To-day Great Britain rocks to and fro with agitations which have no other cause than the exclusion of the masses from political power . Imperial , monarchical , and aristocratic governments are all based upon this principle of exclusion ; and they guard themselves against the dangers of their system only by fortifying intelligence , wealth , and power against the ignorant , the poor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thur Republic ? Have we abolished slavery if the principle upon which slavery rests still prevails ? Must four millions of the human race , who are so unfortunate as to be born black , be unfettered by us , because it has been for our convenience , and yet be deprived at once of the benefits of slavery and the privileges of fieemen ? If so , then emancipation was an abortion . If so , then we still have among us a race of pariahs , not protected by the interest which might attach to them as " chattcls , " and yet having no means of self-protection . Such a system is no less prejudicial to us than the negro . We shall become selfish and tyrannical ; he will become malignant and dangerous . A race suddenly freed from slavery , naturally aspires toward intelligence and dignity . Which is better  --  to repress these aspirations and force them to creep in darkness toward their end , and by base means , or to give them place for development in the free air and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of equal rights must be settled , or postponed to some indefinite future : now , it can be settled peaceably ; then , it may reach its solution through a second upheaval of the Republic . If evils threaten in the event of your decision in one way , still greater dangers loom up on the other hand . Is it not better to do right now , when the opportunity invites , than to hesitate , where procrastination seems even more perilous than prompt execution ? The question is thrnst before you by fate-it does not come at your bidding or at ours . Is it any safer , is it any wiser ; for you to disregard the necessities of peace , in this connection , than it would have been for Lincoln to have disregarded those of war , in the matter of emancipation ? There are two clearly defined careers which your administration may run , accordingly as you respond to this important question . There is no room for compromise . You must choose one or the other . Only one is right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You must either go back to the point from which Johnson . set out , and attempt to revive his policy , by rallying about it the forces of Congress and the people ; or you must begin where Congress left off , and rally the people about a far different policy . The popular voice now seems to be doubtful ; last year it murmured against Johnson , this year it appears to murmur against Congress . It is barely possible that , by your superior tact , or by the greater weight of your influence , you may succeed in galvanizing into life a policy once strangled by the people , and thus the nation may be restored upon the principle of class-domination in the South . We do not believe that you will attempt that , or that you really will succeed if you do . But ig on the other hand , you throw the weight of your abilities , character , and influence in favor of equal rights for all men , and the readjustment , upon that basis , of the harmonies so violently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper chord in the popular heart , and will surely meet with a response . No President , no Emperor , ever had an opportunity so significant and so important as yours ; and if you do right , you will receive a support such as has never been accorded to any ruler in the history of the world . You may possibly postpone the ultimate triumph of justice , and take the consequences ; the people may assist you in this , and also take the consequences , in whatever shape God may choose to thwart defiant men . // In any event , our faith is undisturbed in the ultimate triumph of right , whether it come soon and in this dawn of peace , or after whatsoevcr storms in the hereafter . You must have faith in the peoplesuch faith as Lincoln had  --  and which , after Paul 's definition , is " the evidence of things not seen . " This is only possible , in so far as you are in sympathy with the great under-current of human progress , the profound pulsations of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if you would have faith in their might , you must feel them . Having this sympathy , you will always appear to be a little in advance of the people , when you are most in unity with their purpose . You will thus be , in the true sense , a leader . While others fluctuate this way and that way in the surface eddies of popular opinion , your hand will steadily guide to one sure end , and to the people such guidance is insj*iration . On the whole , the situation , both for you and for us , is full of hope . You hold the key to the citadel of Wrong . At your bidding , the forces will again be marshalled , and , under your guidance , will fight the one great battle which must consummate the victories of the past , by securing the results of the battles already fought . There are no foreign complications to be feared or avoided ; you enter upon your administration at a time when the iRepublie is at peace with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are already disarmed , and can only fret and chafe within their fixed bounds ; they can neither check you by direct opposition , nor harass your rear . In indulging this hope as to your future , we have in view no ideal or model President , but one whom the necessities of the time have brought forth ; one chosen with great national issues clearly in view ; chosen by the people to do their work , and by God to do His . Our ex pectations are not of the Utopian sort ; we doubt not but your administration will leave plenty of work and arduous responsibilities for your successors ; but we may reasonably hope that it will establisli a firm foundation for a healthy national development , undisturbed by agitation concerning matters which , as being primary , ought to be settled first of all . The same principles which will lead you to favor equal rights , will also lead you to oppose any financial policy that will violate the pledges upon which rests our national credit . Restoration based upon the principles of justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence in all our public pledges , while a vacillating administration will , to an equal degree , depreciate them . We have not discussed in detail many of the specific issues of your administration , but have confined ourselves almost entirely to the more important problems which you are called upon to solve . We have not for a moment supposed that any thing which we might say would alter or in any way affect your convictions . But the voices of all the people go up to their President . You will listen to our plea as one of these many voices . Or you will listen , perhaps , as you would in your military camp , on the eve of battle to the report of a scout who brings in to you his quota of impressions as to the lay of the ground , or the disposition of the enemy 's forces . Possibly , if your scout impresses you with the conviction that an immense army in reserve is marching to the front , and will come to your support at the sound of your cannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impending conflict , and enter upon it with larger hopes . Whether or no , you have our impressions . The scout 's report is before you , General .
