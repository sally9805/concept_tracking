WHO WAS CASPAR IJAUSER ? RECENT publications have again attracted our attention to a subject which about thirty years ago was the cause of great excitement and innumerable speculations . The very extraordinary advent , life , and death of Caspar Hauser , the novelty and singularity of all his thoughts and actions , and his charming innocence and amiability , interested at the time all Europe in his behalf . Thrown upon the world in a state of utter helplessness , he was adopted by one of the cities of Germany , and became not only a universal pet , hut a sight which people flocked from all parts to see . It became a perfect fever , raging throughout Germany , and extending also to other countries . The papers teemed with accounts and conjectures . Innumerable essays and even hooks were written , almost every one advancing a different theory for the solution of the mystery . But his death was still more the occasion for their appearance , and for some time thereafter they literally swarmed from the press . Every one who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great many who knew him by reputation only , thought themselves called upon to give their views , so that in a little while the subject acquired almost a literature of its own . But this excitement gradually disappeared , and with it most of the literature which it had called forth . There are a few names , however , which occur frequently in connection with that of Caspar Hauser , to whose opinions we shall subsequently call attention . They are Fenerbach , Daumer , Merker , Stanhope , Binder , Meier , and Fuhrmann. * Of these , Binder was his earliest protector ; Ecuerbach conducted the legal investigations to which Caspar 's mysterious am pearance gave rise ; Daumer was for a * Daumer , in his Disclosures c cernissg Casper Ilauser , refers to a great many more than these ; but it is impossible to follow his example in so limited a space . long time his teacher and host ; Stanhope adopted him ; Meier afterwards filled Daumer 's place ; and Fuhrmann was the clergyman who attended his death-bed . Merker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Prussian Counsellor of Police , and as such his opinion may perhaps have more than ordinary weight with some . Most of them published their various opinions during Caspar 's life or soon after his death , and the subject was then allowed to sink to its proper level and attract no further attention . Within a few years , however , it has again been brought into prominent light by some new publications . One of these is an essay written by Fenerbach and published in his works edited by his son , in which he endeavors to prove that Caspar Hauser was the son of the Grand Duchess Stephanie of Baden ; another is a book by Daumer , which he devotes entirely to the explosion of all theories that have ever been advanced ; and a third , by Dr. Eschrieht , contends that Caspar was at first an idiot and afterwards an inipostar . Before considering these different theories , let us recall the principal incidents of his life . These have , indeed , been placed within the reach of the English reader by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ecuerbach 's " Kaspar Hauser . Beispiel eines Verbrechens am Seelenleben des Menschen , " * published in Boston in 1832 ; but , as the former has , we believe , obtained little circulation in this country , and the latter is now probably out of print , a short account of the life of this singular being may not be deemed amiss . On the 26th of May , 1828 , a citizen of INuremberg , while loitering in front of his house in the outskirts of the town , saw , tottering towards him , a lad of sixteen or seventeen years , coarsely and * Casper heuser . Au Example of a Crime against the Lffe of Mae 's kSoul. // poorly clad . He held in his hand a letter , which he presented to the citizen ; but to all questions as to who he was , whence he came , and what he wanted , he replied only in an unintelligible jargon . The letter was addressed to the captain of a cavalry company then stationed at Kuremberg , to whom he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been left at the writer 's door on the 7th of October , 1812 , that the writer was a poor laborer with a large family , but that he had nevertheless adopted the boy , and had reared him in such strict seclusion from the world that not even his existence was known . The letter said further , that , so far from being able to answer , the lad could not even comprehend any questions put to him . It therefore discouraged all attempts to obtain any information in that way , and ended with the advice , that , according to his desire , he should be made a dragoon , as his father had been before him . Inclosed in this letter was a note , professedly by the mother , and pretending to have been left with him , when , as an infant , Caspar ilauser was first cast upon the world , but , in reality , as it was afterwards proved , written by the same person . This note gave the date of his birth , pleaded the poverty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and contained the same request as to his joining a cavalry regiment when he should arrive at the a0e of seventeen . The first impression produced by Caspar 's appearance and behavior was , that he was some idiot or lunatic escaped from confinement ; it remained only to be shown whence he had escaped . In the mean time he was placed under the protection of the police , who removed him to their guard-room . There he showed no consciousness of what was going on around him ; his look was a dull , brutish stare ; nor did he give any indication of intelligence , until pen and paper were placed in his hand , when he wrote clearly and repeatedly , " Kaspar Hauser . " Since then he has been known by that name . WThen it became evident that the first conjectures concerning him were rong , strenuous efforts were made by the police to sound the mystery , but without the slightest success . He himself could give no clue ; for he neither understood what others said nor could make himself understood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caspar uttered were entirely meaningless . He recognized none of the places where he had been , no trace could be obtained of him elsewhere , and the most vigilant search brought nothing to light . The surprise which his first appearance produced increased as he became better known . It then became more and more evident that he was neither an idiot nor a lunatic ; at the same time his manners were so peculiar , and his ignorance of civilized life and his dislike for its customs so great , that all sorts of conjectures were resorted to in order to explain the mystery . It was ascertained that he must have been incarcerated in some dungeon , entirely shut out from the light of the sun , which gave him great pain . The structure of his body , the tenderness of his feet , and the great difficulty and suffering which he experienced in walking , indicated beyond a doubt that he had been kept in a sitting posture , with his legs stretched straight out before him . His sustenance had been bread and water ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , but the smallest quantity affected his constitution in the most violent manner . It was also evident that he had never come in contact with human beings , beyond what was necessary for supplying his immediate wants , and , strange to say , teaching him to write . That these inferences were well-founded was proved by the subsequent disclosures of Caspar himself , after he had acquired a sufficient command of language . The account he then gave was as follows . " He neither knows who he is nor where his home is . It was only at Kuremberg // that he came into the world . Here he first learned , that , besides himself and the man with whom he had always been , ' there existed other men and other creatures . As long as he can recollect , he had always lived in a hole , ( a small , low apartment , which he sometimes calls a cage , ) where he had always sat upon the ground , with hare feet , and clothed only with a shirt and a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound , whether produced by a man , by an animal , or by anything else . He never saw the heavens , nor did there ever appear a brightening ( daylight ) such as at Nuremberg . He never perceived any difference between day and night , and much less did he ever get a sight of the beautiful lights in the heavens . Whenever he awoke from sleep , he found a loaf of bread and a pitcher of water by him . Sometimes his water had a bad taste whenever this was the case , he could no longer keep his eyes open , but was compelled to fall asleep ; and when he afterwards awoke , he found that he had a clean shirt on , and that his nails had been cut. * " He never saw the face of the man who brought him his meat and drink . In his hole he had two wooden horses and several ribbons . With these horses he had always amused himself as long as he was awake ; and his only occupation was , to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribbons about them in different positions . Thus one day had passed the same as another ; but he had never felt the want of anything , had never been sick , and-once only excepted - had never felt the sensation of pain . Upon the whole , he had been much happier there than in the world , where he was obliged to suffer so much . How long he had continued to live in this situation he knew not ; for he had had no * When he resided with Professor Danmer , a drop of opium in a glass of water was administered to him . After swallowing a mouthful , he exclaimed , " That water is nasty ; it tastes exactly like the water I was sometimes ohli , ed to drink in my cage . " knowledge of time . He knew not when or how he came there . INor had he any recollection of ever having been in a different situation , or in any other than in that place . The man with whom he had always been never did him any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken away , when he had been running his horse too hard , and had made too much noise , the man caine and struck him upon his arm with a stick , or with a piece of wood ; this caused the wound which he brought with him to Nuremberg . " Pretty nearly about the same time , the man once came into his prison , placed a small table over his feet , and spread something white upon it , which he now knows to have been paper ; he then came behind him , so as not to be seen by him , took hold of his hand , and moved it backwards and forwards on the paper , with a thing ( a lead pencil ) which he had stuck between his fingers . He ( Hanser ) was then ignorant of what it was ; but he was mightily pleased , when he saw the black figures which began to appear upon the white paper . When he felt that his hand was free , and the man was gone from him , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could never grow tired of drawing these figures repeatedly upon the paper . This occupation almost made him neglect his horses , although he did not know what those characters signified . The man repeated his visits in the same manner several times . " Another time the man came , lifted him from the place where he lay , placed him on his feet , and endeavored to teach him to stand . This he repeated at several different times . The manner in which he effected this was the following : he seized him firmly around the breast , from behind , placed his feet behind Caspar 's feet , and lifted these , as in stepping forward . " Finally , the man appeared once again , placed C par 's hands over his shoulders , tied them fast , and thus carried him on his back out of the prison . He was carned // up ( or down ) a hill . He knows not how he felt ; all became night , and he was laid upon his back . " - By the expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he faintcd away . The little which Caspar was able to relate in regard to his journey is not of any particular interest , and we omit it here . This is all that is known with any certainty of the early life of this unfortunate being . The conjectures to which it has given rise will be considered later . Let us first finish his history . As was to be expected , Caspar Hauser s faculties developed very gradually . His mind was in a torpor , and , placed suddenly amid , to him , most exciting scenes , it was long before he could understand the simplest phenomena of Nature . The unfolding of his mind was exactly like that of a child . Feuerbach , in his book on Caspar Hauser , gives the main features of this gradual development . We can only pick out a few . It is remarkable that in the same proportion as he advanced in knowledge and acquaintance with civilized life , the intensity of all his faculties diminished . It was so with his memory . He was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment , thirty , forty , and , on one occasion , forty - five names of persons were mentioned to him , which he afterwards repeated with all their titles , - to him , of course , entirely meanmn*-less . So , too , with his power of sight . At first , he was able to see in the dark perfectly well , and much better than in the light of the sun , which was very painful to him . lie very frequently amused himself at others groping in the dark , when he experienced not the slightest difficulty . On one occasion , in the evening , he read the name on a door-plate at the distance of one hundred and eighty paces . This keenness of vision did not , however , retain its entire vigor , but decreased as he became more accustomed to the sun . For some time after he made his appearance he had no idea of perspective , hut would clutch like a child at objects far off . Nor had he any conception of the beauties of Nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him like a mass of colors jumbled together . Nothing was beautiful , unless it was red , except a starry heaven , - and the emotion which he felt , on first beholding this , was truly touching . Until then , he had invariably spoken of " the man with whom he had always been " with feelings of affection ; he longed to return to him , and looked upon all his stu ( lieS as merely a temporary thing ; some day he would go back and show the man how much he had learned . But when he first looked upon the heavens , his tone became entirely changed , and he denounced the man severely for never having shown him such beautiful things . All his senses were thus at first wonderfully keen . It was so with his hearing and smell . The latter was the source of most of his sufferin0s ; for , being so exceedingly sensitive , even the most scentless things made him sick . He liked but one smell , that of bread , which had been his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , indeed , before he could take any other food at all , and lie only became accustomed to it very gradually . The effect produced upon Caspar Hauser by contact with or proximity to animals was also very curious , lie was able to detect their presence under singularly unfavorable circumstances . Metals , too , had a very powerful effect upon him , and possessed for him a strong magnetic power . But it is impossible to give all the details , however interesting ; for them we must refer to Fenerbach . His mind , as has been already said , was at first sunk in almost impenetrable darkness . He knew of but two divisions of earthly things ,  --  man and beast , " bua " and " ross . " The former was a word of his own . The latter , which is the German for horse , included everything not human , whether animate or inamiimate . Between these he for a long time saw no difference . He could not understand why pictures and statues did not move , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things impelled by foreign forces he ascribed volition . Religion he , of course , had none . He possessed naturally a very amiable character , and his thoughts and conduct were as pure as though guided by the soundest system of morality . But he knew nothing of a God , and one of the greatest difficulties Daumer had to encounter was instructing him on this point . His untutored mind could not master the doctrines of theology , and he was constantly puzzled by questions which he himself suggested , and which his instructor often found it impossible to answer satisfactorily . Physically he was very weak . The shortest walk would fatigue him . At first he could scarcely shuffle along at all , on account of the tenderness of his feet , and because his body had always been kept in one position . He so far overcame this , however , as to be able to walk a little , though always with an effort . But on horseback he never became tired . From the first time that lie mounted a horse , he showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endurance utterly at variance with all other exhibitions of his strength ; and lie very soon acquired a degree of skill which made him an object of envy to all the cavalry - officers stationed in the neighborhood . So inconsistent and incomprehensible was everything about Caspar Hauser ! In October , 1829 , while residing in the family of Professor Daumer , an attempt was made upon his life , which was only so far successful as to give a very violent shock to his delicate constitution . The perpetrator of the crime was never discovered . Caspar was afterwards adopted by the Earl of Stanhope , and by him removed to Anspach . Feuerbach gives a very interesting description of him , as he appeared at this time . " In understanding a man , in knowledge a little child , and in many things more ignorant than a child , the whole of his language and demeanor shows often a strangely contrasted mingling of manly and childish behavior . With a serious countenance and in a tone of great im portance , he often utters things which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be called stupid or silly , but which , coming from him , always force upon us a sad , compassionate smile . It is particularly farcical to hear him speak of the future plans of his life ,  --  of the manner in which , after having learned a great deal and earned money , he intends to settle himself with his wife , whom he considers as an indispensable part of domestic furniture . " " Mild and gentle , without vicious inclinations , and without passions and strong emotions , his quiet mind resembles the smooth mirror of a lake in the stillness of a moonlight night . Incapable of hurting an animal , compassionate even to the worm , which he is afraid to tread upon , timid even to cowardice , he will nevertheless act regardless of consequences , and even without forbearance , according to his own convictions , whenever it becomes necessary to defend or to execute purposes which he has once perceived and acknowledged to be right . If he feels himself annoyed in any manner , he will long bear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of the person who is thus troublesome to him , or will endeavor to effect a change in his conduct by mild expostulations ; but , finally , if he can not help himself in any other manner , as soon as an opportunity of doing so offers , he will very quietly slip off the bonds that confine him ,  --  yet without bearing the least malice aouinst him who may have injured him . He is obedient , obliging , and yielding ; but the man who accuses him wrongftilly , or asserts to be true what he believes to be untrue , need not expect , that , from mere complaisance , or from other considerations , he will submit to injustice or to falsehood ; he will always modestly , but firmly , insist upon his right ; or perhaps , if the other seems inclined obstinately to maintain his ground against him , he will silently leave him . " But the fate which had been pursuing this unfortunate being , and without which the tragedy of his life would have been // incomplete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1833 , he was induced by some unknown person to meet him in a retired spot in the city of Anspach , under the pretence that he should then have the secret of his parentage revealed to him . The real object was his murder , and this time it was successful . Caspar was stahbed to the heart . lie still had sufficient strength left to walk about a thousand paces ; and , indeed , the wound was outwardly so insignificant , that it was at first believed to be a mere scratch . This strengthened an opinion which was then gradually gaining ground , that Caspar was an impostor ; for it was firmly believed by some that he had inflicted this wound upon himself , as well as the one received in 1829 , in order to quicken the somewhat languishing interest taken in him . Nor did they give up this opinion when the wound was found to be fatal . They then boldly asserted that he had wounded himself more severely than he had intended . And not content with simply maintaining this absurd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that he was not even allowed to die in peace . Nothing was wanting to fill his bitter cup . How terrible must have been the mental torture to wring from so resigned a soul the exclamation , " 0 God ! 0 God ! to die thus with contumely and disgrace ! " The German is still more expressive , - " Ack , Gott ! cdi , Gottl so obkratzeu miissen mit Scldrnpf und Scizande ! " Such was the life of Caspar Hauser . For nearly seventeen years the inmate of a dreary prison , shut out from the light , without a single companion in his misery , drugged when it was necessary to change his linen , with no food but bread , - for seventeen years did he thus exist , - his mind a perfect blank . Suddenly cast upon the world , amid strange beings whom he could not understand and by whom he was not understood , he long knew scarcely a sensation save that of pain . And when at last he did become accustomed to civilized life , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that found entrance into his intellect , it was only to awake to a knowledge of the utter misery of his position . He then saw himself a helpless orphan , the inferior of all with whom he came in contact , and a dependant upon the charity of others for his support . He awoke to find that he had lost seventeen years of this beautiful life , seventeen years which he never could recall ,  - -  that he never could take his stand amongst men as their equal , but would always be regarded as an unhappy being meriting their pity , - much like that felt for the pains of some suffering brute . Nor was this all . 1 ) uring the few years that were granted him in our world , perscented by some unknown person , against whom he was helpless , - knowing that his life was aimed at by some one , but unable to protect himself , and at last falling a victim to the threatened blow ,  --  and , worst of all , charged on his death-bed with being an impostor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among the different opinions which h'ave existed in regard to his origin , the most noticeable are those advanced by Stanhope and Merker , and by Daumer , Eschricht , and Fenerbach . The Earl of Stanhope 's connection with Caspar Hanser was a rather peculiar one . He made his appearance in Nuremberg at the time the first attempt was made upon Caspar 's life , but took no particular notice of him , and left without having shown any interest in him . On a second visit , about seven months later , he suddenly became passionately attached to Caspar , showed most unusual marks of fondness for him , and finally adopted 1dm. lie then removed him to Anspach , and remained his protector until his death in December , 1833 . The day after his burial , Stanhope appeared in Anspach , and took particular pains to proclaim then , and subsequently at a judicial investigation in Munich , and in several tracts , his belief that Caspar was an impostor . This had already been maintained by Mei-ker , the Prussian Counsellor of Police . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a journeyman tailor or glover , from some small village on the Austrian side of the river Saizach . The reasons which he assigns for his belief in the impos-. ture are all derived from Caspar 's supposed want of integrity and veracity . They impeach the character of Caspar living , and not of Caspar dead . Why , then , did Stanhope wait for his death before he proclaimed the imposture ? Why did he remain his protector , and thus make himself a party to the fraud ? His conduct is not easily explained . On the other hand , there is little ground for Daumer 's conclusions . These are given at length in his " Disclosures concerning Caspar Hauser , " published in 18*9 , a book called forth by attacks made upon him by Eschricht . Considering Stanhope 's conduct , and his endeavor after Caspar 's death to induce Daumer to support his views as to the imposture , and , upon his indignant refusal , making him twice the object of a personal attack , Daumer thinks that there is reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legitimate heir to some great English estate and title , that he was removed in order to make way for some one else , and that his murder was intrusted to some person who had not the courage or the wickedness to perpetrate it , but removed him first to Hungary and afterwards to Germany , and supported him in the manner indicated , hopin* that he would not long survive . When , however , he grew up , his support became irksome and he was cast upon the world . There he attracted so much attention , that the instigator of the crime , dreading a disclosure , sought his life again . When this proved unsuccessful , lie was removed to Anspach Feuerbach , who had shown the greatest determination to sound the mystery , was removed from the world , and at last the tragedy was made complete in Caspar 's own death . All this points to Stanhope . And yet Daumer has not taken the trouble to inquire whether it agrees with the family history . It is possible that he may be right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of improbability , that we can not give it credit without further proof . In the seventh volume of Ilitzig 's " Annals of Criminal Jurisprudence , " there is a communication from Lieutenant von Pirch , disclosing Caspar 's acquaintance with certain Hungarian words . A little while before this announcement was made , a story had gone the rounds of the papers of Germany , that a governess residing in Pesth had fainted away , when the account of Caspar Hauser 's appearance was related to her . All this naturally attracted attention to Hungary as the probable place of his birth ; and it is for these reasons , that Fenerbach , IDaumer , and others , suppose that he spent some part of his childhood in that country . After his death , Stanhope sent Lieutenant Hickel to Hungary to investigate the matter , but no traces were discovered , - a proog as Stanhope has it , that these conclusions were groundless , and , according to Daumer , another proof of Stanhope 's complicity , lie believes that the very superficial search made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent a more strict search being made . To return to the opinion advanced by Merker , and subsequently adopted by Stanhope , - the thing is simply impossible . In the first place , it would have been impossible for an impostor to elude discovery . To trace him would have been the easiest thing in the world . With a vigilant police , in a thickly settled country , how could a man leave his place of abode , and travel , were it for ever so short a distance , without being known ? But this is the least consideration . Caspar 's whole life , his intellect , his body , the feats which he accomplished , when submitted to the most searching tests , were a refutation of the charge . But when it is added that he wounded himself in order to do away with suspicion , the accusation becomes so absurd as scarcely to merit refutation . It is answered by the fact , that it was proved , from the nature of the wounds , in both cases , that selfinfliction was impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been able so long to deceive people who were constantly with him and always on the alert . And it is remarkable that they who saw most of Caspar , and knew him best , were most firmly convinced of his integrity , - whilst his traducers were , almost without an exception , men who had never known him intimately . Feuerbach , Daumer , Binder , Meier , Fuhrmann , and many others , maintain his honesty in the strongest terms . On the other hand , it is said , that it is equally impossible for a person to have becn kept in any community in the manner in which it is asserted that he was kept ; discovery was inevitable . But it must be remembered that this instance does not stand alone . If search were made , many cases of the same kind might be collected . It is by no means so rare an occurrence for persons to be kept secluded in such a manner as to conceal their existence from the world . Daumer mentions two similar cases which happened about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the son of a lawyer , named Fleischmann , just deceased , was dis2overed in a retired chamber of the house . He was thirty-eight years 01 ( 1 , and had been confined there since his twelfth year . The other case , also mentioned by Fenerbach , was still more distressing . Dr. Horn saw , in the infirmary at Salzburg , a girl , twenty-two years of age , who had been brought up in a pig-sty . One of her legs was quite crooked , from her having sat with them crossed ; she grunted like a hog ; and her actions were " brutishly unseemly in human dress . " IDaumer also relates a third case , which was made the subject of a romantic story published in a Nuremberg paper , but which , he says , lacks confirmation . It was the discovery , in a secret place , of the grown-up son of a clergyman by his housekeeper . Whether this be true or not , both Fenerbach and iDaumer believe that many similar instances do exist , which never come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caspar Hauser was confined in a cellar to which none but his keeper sought entrance . Who would suspect the existence of a human bein * , taught to be perfectly submissive and quiet and to have no wants , in such a place , when even the existence of the subterranean prison itself was probably unknown ? The cases mentioned above were certainly more singular in this respect . But Eschricht 's opinion is the most peculiar of all . In his " Unverstand und schlechte Erziehung , " he maintains that Caspar was an idiot until he was brought to Nuremberg , that his mind was then strengthened and developed , and that he was then transformed from an idiot into an impostor . This is still more impossible than Stanhope 's theory ; for in this case Daumer , Feuerbachi , Ililtel the jailer , Binder the mayor , and indeed all Caspar 's earliest friends , instead of being victims of an imposture , are made partakers in the fraud . No one acquainted with the irreproachable character of these men could entertain the idea for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , but many , who must have been parties to it , it becomes doubly impossible . We come now to consider the opinion of Fenerbach ; and we shall do it the more carefully , because in it , we feel confident , lies the true solution of the question . He was at the time President of the Court of Appeal of the Circle of Rezat . He had risen to this honorable position gradually , and it was the reward of his distinguished merit alone . His works on criminal jurisprudence , and the penal code which he drew up for the kingdom of Bavaria , and which was adopted by other states , had placed him in the first rank of criminal lawyers . It was he who conducted the first judicial investigations concerning Caspar Hanser . He was , therefore , intimately acquainted with all the circumstances of the case , and had ample opportunity to form a deliberate opinion . How the idea originated , that Caspar Hauser beloiiged to the House of Baden , it is difficult to say . Feuerbach never published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caspar Hauser he makes no mention of it ; but in 1832 he addressed a paper to Queen Caroline of Bavaria , headed , " Who might Caspar Hauser be ? " in which he endeavors to show that he was the son of the Grand-Duchess Stephanie . This paper was , we believe , first published in 1852 , in his " Life and Works , " by his son . The first part of it treats of Caspar 's rank and position in general , and he comes to the following conclusions . Caspar was a legitimate child . Had he been illegitimate , less dangerous and far easier means would have been resorted to for concealing his existence and suppressing a knowledge of his parentage . And here we may add , that the supposition has never prevailed that he was the offspring of a criminal connection , and that these means were taken for suppressing the mother 's disgrace . A note which Caspar brought with him , when he appeared at Nuremberg , indicated that such was the case , but it was so evidenta piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second conclusion at which Feuerbach arrives is , that people were implicated who had command of great and unusual means , - means which could prompt an attempt at murder in a crowded city and in the open day , and which could over-bribe all rewards offered for a disclosure . Third , Caspar was a person on whose life or death great interests depended , else there would not have been such care to conceal his existence . Interest , and not revenge or hate , was the motive . He must have been a person of high rank . To prove this , Fenerbach refers to dreams of Caspar 's . On one occasion , particularly , he dreamt that he was conducted through a large castle , the appearance of which he imagined that he recognized , and afterwar ( ls minutely described . This Fenerbach thinks was only the awakening of *5 AKSELM BITTER YON FEUERBACH ' 5 Leben and Wirken , eus semen eesqedrucktea Briefen , Tagebiickern , Vertrdgea and Denksclzrfften , rer*ijTentlicht ron seinem Sekne LUDWIG FEIJERBACH . Leipzig , 1852. past recollections . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the description given exists . In the absence of such knowledge , this point of Feuerbach 's argument appears a rather weak one . From the above propositions he concludes that Caspar was the legitimate child of princely parents , who was removed in order to open the succession to others , in whose way he stood . The second division of the paper relates to the imprisonment , and here he takes a ground entirely opposed to the opinions of others . lie believes that lie was thus kept as a protection against some greater evil . his wants were supplied , he was well taken care of , and his keeper is therefore to be looked upon as his protector . Daumer sees in the keeper nothing but a hired murderer , whose courage or whose wickedness failed him . It is certainly difficult to imagine a kind friend immuring one in a dark subterranean vault , feeding one on bread , excluding light , fellowship , amusement , thoughts , - never saying a word , but studiously allowing one 's mind to become a dreary waste . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer death . We are therefore inclined to think that Daumer is here in the right . But whatever the nature of his imprisonment , the principal argument does not lose its force . In the third place , Fenerbach speaks of the family to which Caspar must have belonged . Just about the time of Caspar 's birth , the eldest son of the GrandDuchess of Baden died an infant . His death was followed in a few years by that of his only brother , leaving several sisters , who could not inherit the duchy . By these deaths the old House of the Z*hringer became extinct , and the offspring of a morganatic marriage became the heirs to the throne . It was , therefore , for their interest that the other branch should die out . In addition to this , the mother of the new house was a woman of unbounded ambition and determined character , and had a bitter hatred for the Grand-Duchess . Without laying too much // stress , then , upon the nearness in date of the elder child 's death and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is reason to suppose that they were the same person . There was every feeling of interest to prompt the deed , there was the opportunity of sickness to accomplish it in , and there was an unscrupulous woman to take advantage of it . Is it , then , impossible that she , having command of the household , should have been able to substitute a dead for the living child ? Accept the proposition , and the mystery is solved ; reject it , and we are *till groping in the dark . Nevertheless , there are circumstances which , even then , are incapable of explanation ; hut it is the most satisfactory theory , and certainly has less objections than the others . Fenerhach came to this conclusion early ; for his paper addressed to Queen Caroline of Bavaria was written in 1832 , the year before Caspar 's death . Delicacy forbade the open discussion of the question ; hut , even at the time , this theory found many supporters . Some even went so far as to say that Feuerhach 's sudden death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he was ferreting out the mystery . Of all the different explanations , then , which have been given , that of Feuerbach seems to he the most satisfactory . At the same time , like the rest , it is founded on conjecture . Its truth may never he proved . They whose interest it was to suppress the matter thirty years ago , and who resorted to such extreme measures in doing so , no doubt took ample precaution that every trace should he erased . It is barely possible that some confession or the discovery of some paper may cast light upon the subject ; hut the length of time which has elapsed renders it exceedingly improbable , and the mystery of Caspar ilauser , like the mysteries of the Iron Mask and Junius , will always remain a fruitful source of conjecture only . It may not he uninteresting to close this sketch with the consideration of a point of law raised by Feuerbach in connection with the subject . It will he rec ollected that he calls his hook " Caspar Hauser . An Example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The crime committed against Caspar Hauser was , according to the Bavarian code , twofold . There was the crime of illegal imprisonment , and the crime of exposure . And here Feuerbach advances the doctrine , that it was not only the actual confinement which amounted to illegal imprisonment , hut that " we must incontestably , and , indeed , principally , regard as such the cruel withholding from him of the most ordinary gifts which Nature with a liberal hand extends even to the most indigent ,  --  the depriving him of all the means of mental development and culture , - the unnatural detention of a human soul in a state of irrational animality . " " An attempt , " he says , " by artificial contrivances , to seclude a man from Nature and from all intercourse with rational beings , to change the course of his human destiny , and to withdraw from him all the nourishment afforded by those spiritual substances which Nature has appointed for food to the human mind , that it may grow and flourish , and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must , even quite independently of its actual consequences , be considered as , in itself , a highly criminal invasion of man 's most sacred and most peculiar property , - of the freedom and the destiny of his soul . Inasmuch as the whole earlier part of his life was thus taken from him , be may be said to have been the subject of a partial soul-murder . " This crime , if recognized , would , according to Femmerbach , far outweigh the mere crime of illegal imprisonment , and the latter would be merged in it . Tittmann , in his " Hand-Book of Penal Law , " also speaks of crimes against the intellect , and particularly mentions the separation of a person from all human society , if practised upon a child before it has learned to speak and until the intellect has become sealed up , as well as the intentional rearing of a person to ignorance , as reducible to this head . This was written // before Caspar 's case had occurred . He says , also , that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punished for destroying the rational being , and not the physical man . Murder and the destruction of the intellect are , therefore , equally punishable . The one merits the punishment of death as well as the other . Nor are we to take the possibility of a cure into consideration , any more than we do the possibility of extinguishing a fire . But where the law does not prescribe the punishment of death irrespectively of the possibility of recovery , the punishment would rarely exceed ten years in the House of Correction . We must understand Tittmann 's remarks , however , to refer entirely to the law of Saxony ,  - -  that being the government under which he lived , and the only one in whose criminal code this crime is recognized . Fenerbach wished to have this murder of the soul inserted in the criminal code of Bavaria as a punishable crime ; but he was unsuccessful , and the whole doctrine has subsequently been condemned . Mittermaier , in a note to his edition of Fenerbach 's " Text-Book of German Criminal Law , " denies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and Tittmann . He says , that , in the first place , it has not such an actual existence as is capable . of proof ; and , secondly , all crimes under it can easily be reached by some other law . The last objection does not , however , seem to be a very serious one . If , as Feuerbach says , the crime against the soul is more heinous than that against the body , it certainly deserves the first attention , even if the one is not merged in the other . The crime being greater , the punishment would be greater ; and the demands of justice would no more be satisfied by the milder punishment than if a murderer were prosecuted as a nuisance . The fact , therefore , that the crime is reducible to some different head , is not an objection . We meet with the most serious difficulty when we consider the possibility of proof . Taking it for granted that the crime does exist in the abstract , the only question is , whether it is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take cognizance of it . The soul being in its nature so far beyond the reach of man , and the difficulty of ever proving the effect of human actions upon it , would seem to indicate that it were better to allow a few exceptional cases to pass unnoticed than to involve the criminal courts in endless and fruitless inquiry . Upon the ground of expediency only should the crime go unnoticed , and not because it can be reached in some other way . For proof that it does exist , we can point to nothing more convincing than the life of Caspar Hauser itself . No one can doubt that his soul was the victim of a crime , for which the perpetrator , untouched by human laws , stands accused before the throne of God .
