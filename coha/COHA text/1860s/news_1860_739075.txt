txt Both Houses in session last evening , made some progress in the transaction of the public business  --  at least , such is the popular expression . I confess , for myself , that I am never half so much convinced that legislators are serving the people " to the best of their knowledge and belief , " as when they take a long recess . and go home to their constituents . The excitement among the Anti-Renters increases . Every day petitions are presented , asking for the enactment of laws " to protect them in their rights of operty . " During the twenty years that this AntiRent fever has raged , the tenants have exhausted all the legal modes of obtaining redress , and invariably they have been defeated . They have at times abandoned all party allegiance , and gone en masse for men who promised , through the enactment of new statutes , to obtain for them a recognition of their rights , and they claim non-payment of rent as the first of " their rights . " Some of them have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have paid enough money to have quit-claimed all the lands in the distiict worth cultivating . But they persevere yet in the one thought of being released from all liabilities by virtue of promised legislative interference . They might as well expect to sing down the northwest wind , but you can not so persuade them . If the poor fellows could only realize that they are in meshes from which no legislation can release them , and that they can not hope to obtain even the rights they undoubtedly have , they would be far better off . They would then apply themselves diligently to the liquidation of the claims held against them , and so obtain the fee of the land . I fear your Central Park is destined yet ? to be the football of politicians , and that taste , industry and c pacity must give way before the " irrepressible con filet " which corner groceries and pot-house politi. clans wage for the possession of public works , and the dispensing of public patronage . Every day some amendment is noticed to " the act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park/ Mr. Amen/tams had one last night of a bill limiting the outlay upon the Park to a sum , the interest upon which will not exceed $150,000 a year . This may not mean exactly what it says  --  but if it does propose to restrict the entire expenditures upon the Park to such a sum , it certainly never should pass . I do not believe the people of New-York will begrudge twice that amount , if the improvements yet to be completed are prosecuted with the same ability and economy as those now brought into use . The Manhattan Gas Company gives notice that it will apply to the Legislature for permission to extend its mains and pipes through all the streets and avenues of the City . It is now , I think , restricted to a line south of Fourteenth-street When this proposition takes a tangible form , it would be well to attach a whereas and a preamble , through which the Legislature and the people of the City of New-York , who have suffered . so much from the extortions of that Company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits , as well as the exertions the managers have put forth to break down competition , and retain the monopoly of the business . It would be well , too , in case such a privilege is granted as that asked by the Manhattan Company , to provide for a reduction in the price of gas . When the same Company , in 1855 , applied for and obtained permission to water it stock , in order to increase the surface over which dividends must be spread , I was successful in procuring the incorporation of a proviso requiring the Company , after a certain date , to furnish gas at $2 50 per thousand feet , instead of $3 , the price they were then charging . Notwithstanding tile increased capital , and the decreased price , I believe they have since declared higher dividends than before  --  indicating that they can endure another paring down , and still enjoy a large return upon the amount they have bona fide investedI am radical enough to fancy a crusade against such an overgrown monopoly as something to be commended , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure for gas that must have a prominent place on your ledger without feeling to bless the hand that smites the monster . What member is emulous of the gratitude of the living masses of New-Fork ? How can he better entitle himself to the regard of all men than by standing ready with a little rider to this application of the Manhattan Company , that will secure a supply of light at a price which , while it will amply compensate the Company , will be just and reasonable ' . There Are the regulars ? Has " Blue Pill " and " Phlebotomy " succumbed  --  quit the field , and retired before the unblushing front of the new " inns ? " Here is Senator MANIERRE pressing forward a bill to incorporate a Homoeopathic Medical College , and to locate it in the very centre of the " Regular Faculty , " and no voice is raised against it . Are we really to be permitted to die in our own way le Are we to be accorded the privilege of choosing whether we will be wagged away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence with " ipecac , " lured into the phantom world by those little globules of belladonna , or may life ebb out of a huge lancet gash , made in due form and according to established teachings ? Is it safe to allow human beings a license to betake themselves to the other world by any road that they choose to travel ? It would seem so , when a serious proposition to make homoeopathic sheepskin the equivalent of allopathic parchment can be made unrebuked on the floor of the Senate . One would think that the political spirits of the M. D. 's that in Senate and Assembly have for years battled down this innovation , would be heard from the obscurity of private life protesting against giving these quackeries a hearing . Where is Dr. BRADFORD , that type of " calomel and jalap ; " where is Dr. Tunnel. , that pleasant stickler for regularity , that they do not " object ? " The Assembly was a political arena for some hours , to-day  --  the reference of the Governor 's Message , in Committee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No very new ideas were given birth . Squatter Sovereignty was denounced by those from the rural districts , while the City representatives pitched into the Metropolitan Police bill and the Registry Law . This was all I could gather from the debate , ? I suppose courtesy demands that I should call it debate , " and I must , though it grates a little to do it . The State Military Association is in session here to day . Generals and Colonels , and Majors. ( being a Major myself I was forced to acquire a knowledge of the order in which military gentlemen take rank , ) and Captains , and Lieutenants , are as thick in Albany as they are in popular assemblages at the South . Tonight they listen to an address from Adjutant-General TOWNSEND . As Gen. TOWNSEND has made the military system of our State his study , and as he thoroughly understands the science of fighting , ( and could practice it too without flinching , ) and as he believes in the " pomp and circumstance of war , " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where he is to deliver it has not yet been determined . An application for the use of the Assembly Chamber was as promptly denied as was a similar application from the promoters of the Union meeting . So you see " fuss and feathers , " the bristling bayonet and the rolling drum , have no preihninence over the patient watchers of the Union . The weather is mild , and it is pleasant overhead ; but even the natural declension of Albany sideways is not tufficient to carry off the slush . That is overshoe dcep , at least .
