A NEW *EDIPUS . BEN ACuMET , a little old renegade Jew of no principles whatsoever , and cherishing a religious faith curiously compounded from every system that has ever flourished in the East , whereby he was able to adapt himself with the utmost readiness to the diverse prejudices of all conditions of customers , was the person who gave me the earliest inkling of the following narration . Achmet had once been a sort of viceconsul at Aleppo , and in that capacity had made a large acquaintance among Eastern travellers . Having been turned out of office on account of some unauthorized speculations with the public funds , he had moved to Beyrout , where he took up the profession of moneychanger and broker in couriers , passports , and outfits generally , and thereby , of course , 500fl further extended his sphere of knowledge . And being somewhat of a gossip , and moreover a fellow of plausible conversation , it was his habit to pleasantly entertain his customers with some long-winded narration , and so distract their attention while he cheated them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was while pretending to give good Eastern change for some napoleons , that he told me what he knew of the affair of Monroe Gillespie . It entertained me for the momentso much so , indeed , that , as 1 have hinted , I suffered greatly in my small change ; but , as the circumstances he narrated were , after all , only fragmentary , I soon laid aside all memory of them . But it happened that during the ensuing month , being in Smyrna , I came across and hired one Alexander , who had once been courier or dragoman to Gillespie ; and the fellow happening to hint at matters which revived what I had already heard , I felt convinced that , putting all the stories together , there was a mystery which might be worth un ravelling , if I could gain the clew to the other scattered threads . This put me upon a vigorous search , and after awhile I was able to supply all the needful omissions in the affair . One of my principal informants was IRokely Yernon , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the civil service , but within the past few months a resident of Staffordshire , having become Lord Varley by the unexpected and almost concurrent ending of three intermediate lives . Another informant was an old antiquarian at Cairo . I never could ascertain whether he was an European who had become easternized by long residence there , or an Egyptian who had adopted a few European customs and observances* so curiously were his costume , language , complexion , and , in fact , every thing about him , a compound from both races . Nor can I recollect his name . I only now remember that he lived in an upper story , on the right hand of the principal street leading to the gate from which we emerge to go to the Catacombs ,  --  that he seemed always studying books full of ancient Egyptian characters ,  --  and that he smoked a long brown pipe , which he usually held partially thrust out of the window , and the bowl of which was so large that , to any one coming down the street , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a few others who contributed their evidence to supply deficiencies , but those whom I have mentioned were the ones to whom I am more especially indebted . And I will here state my belief that I am the only person who has ever gathered those fragments of mystery into one com* pact , rounded form . No other travellers seem to have had the curiosity to do so ; while among the people of the East , where the scattered facts have been most currently whispered from ear // to ear , there is such a constitutional and almost religious shrinking from meddling with any thing presenting or pretending to a supernatural aspect , that calm and collected investigation must have ever remained an impossibility . The story ,  --  and I will here state that this is no ghostly or demoniacal tale , but simply the record of a distempered fancy . crushed beneath the weight of a few singular coincidences and distorted impressions ,  --  the story may be said to date from some ten years back , at a time when Rokely Vernon , then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandered up the Nile as far as the second cataract . There he had fallen in with Gillespie , who had preceded him about a week , and been there detained by some necessary repairs to his boat . Both the travellers were socially inclined by nature , and free from any of that disagreeable stiffness or distance of manner with which tourists so often make themselves repulsive ; so that they soon struck hands in friendship , and , in the end , came down the river in the same boat . Together upon the downward route , they renewed their first impressions of Thebes , and , at the end , together visited the Pyramids ; - for , by a singular chance , they had both departed from the usual routine , and had postponed their examination of those giant wonders until the end of their river-tour . And having made the customary investigations , calculated the height with the eye , compared their estimate with the more accurate statement of the guide-books , crawled inside , been boosted up outside , and the like , they at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused to dine , for the afternoon was now drawing on apace . Already the sun had travelled far down the western slope , and its rays , striking aslant along the sandy desert , were robbed of much of their noontide fervid power ; while , at the base of the Sphinx , a broad shade had stretched out , sufficient to shelter not only the two travellers , but also all their attendants , camels , and donkeys . It was to be the last day together , for Vernon 's leave of absence was at an end , and on the morrow he must return to Constantinople ; while Gillespie also intended soon to leave Egypt , having agreed to meet tourist-friends at Palerrno . These were a Mr. Ralston and his daughter Helen ; and it was no secret that between the latter and Gillespie there had been a pleasant intimacy that had gradually ripened into an engagement . Duty and affection , therefore , thus drawing the two young men asunder , there could be no respite to the parting , and fpr the moment the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elasticity of youth , they soon dashed aside all disagreeable reflections ,  --  spoke only of the chances of meeting again ,  --  arranged a correspondence , and drank glass after glass to mutual future success . It was this repeated convivial pledging that was perhaps the source of much that afterwards happened . Vernon was a cool head , and could take his bottle or two without betraying any undue excitement ; but Gillespie was of a more impressible nature , and not used to the habit of taking wine , and it needed , therefore , but a glass or two to bring a sparkle into his eyes , and a flush into his face , and before many minutes had elapsed , he was overflowing with unnatural animation . " Let us go , now , " said Vernon at length , proceeding to repack the hamper . " We have many miles to travel yet ,  --  and these Arabs may not prove very pleasant companions after nightfall . " " Not until I have had one more look at this old creature , " exclaimed Gillespie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of wild , restless fever he then wandered around the base , and , finally , his excitement appearing to increase , insisted upon mounting to the top . With the assistance of the Arabs he did so , and took his position upon the crown of the head , standing up in affected , solemn attitude , and commencing a mock oration upon the antiquities in sight about him , " Ne*'er mind that subject any lon // ger , " cried Vernon at last . " Come down , and let us start . " " Will you not wait until I have done due honor to this place , as well as to those further off ? " was the answer . With that , in obedience to a gesture , one of the attendants , climbing halfway up , reached to him a partly emptied bottle of champagne . Then , sitting down , Gillespie once more took a full bumper , and then recommenced his wild talk ; gliding , however , from an oratorical vein into a personal address to his giant supporter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cried , patting the cold stone , and knocking with his overhanging heels upon the broad forehead . " Why so silent ? Why sit century after century gazing with such lack-lustre eyes upon this lifeless desert ? Can you no longer speak ? " " Come , Gillespie , enough of that . See ! the sun is about to set . " " Can you not speak ? " he repeated , unregardful of his companion 's entreaties . " There was a time , they say , when you could talk . And why not now ? Where are those riddles with which you used to embarrass poor old ( Edipus , worrying him to his death at last with their unutterable stupidity ? Can you not once more wake up , old lady , and give me also a riddle to guess ? I will grapple with it like a hero , be assured , and will ever charitably forbear to make fun of its clumsiness and want of point , which , like all your other heavy jests , it will so surely display . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would serve you out with a riddle you should never forget , " cried Vernon , with a laugh . " But come down , now . The light is already fading away . " Yielding at last to his companion 's wishes , Gillespie prepared to descend , first giving a farewell kick at the inanimate stone forehead . Then he hurled the empty bottle far off on the sand , stooped to grasp some of the inequalities of the surface below him , and so began to clamber down . It was an easy task , and had been achieved by thousands before him without injury . But , as has been stated , he was not himself exactly ; while the officious hands of the Arabs reaching up to him rather embarrassed his efforts than otherwise , so that , towards the end , he missed his footing . At least , that was what the others said , though Gillespie , in speaking of it subsequently , always insisted that he had suddenly felt the figure shake beneath him , so that it became impossible for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , that at the time he gave no such excuse . It was only afterwards , when his singular chimera had gained full sway over him , that his unsettled fancy looked back , and , in the trivial incident of an accidental fall , unconsciously invented new coincidences and supernatural effects . Be that as it may , he now rolled heavily down , striking his head on the way against a portion of the rough stone face . He was at once picked up ,  --  not insensible , and apparently but little injured ; though , for the moment , somewhat confused , and naturally a great deal sobered from his late vein of merriment . His only real injury seemed to be a deep cut or contusion in the centre of his forehead , from which the blood flowed freely for a minute or two . But this was soon stanched , and , binding a handkerchief around his temples , the party set off on its return to Cairo . " At least , the old lady-as you call her-has set her seal upon you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they slowly rode homeward . " But enough of that . Will you write to me from Palermo ? " With that , the conversation took a new turn , and , as they had eften before done , they began discussing their plans for future life , and so , after a while , entered the city-gate , discharged their retinue , and gained their hotel . And here , before many minutes , they parted , not to meet again ; for Gillespie , still a little confused with his wound , retired early to his room , and , before the next morning had well broken , Vernon had departed for Alexandria , there to take th' steamer for Constantinople . // It was nearly broad noon before Gillespie awoke , for his sleep had been heavy . His first movement , after he had collected his memories of the previous day , was to look into his glass and ascertain the extent and progress of his wound . To his dismay he found that his forehead was very much swollen and discolored , and that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , showing that the skin had been cut . This naturally gave apprehension of scars and disfigurement , and he sent at once for a physician . The one who came at his call was of European birth , and , in general , a well-educated man . He examined the wound , washed and dressed it , thought that possibly there might be a slight scar , but that more probably the injury would heal by what is called first intention , and prescribed quiet for a few days . So far the treatment was well enough . But it happened that , from long practice in the Eust , the physician had acquired a little too much aptitude for the use of some of its peculiar remedies , and that when he now advised quiet , he proceeded to assist nature with some subtle , soothing potion . What it was that he administered can not , at this distance of time , be known ; but it is probable that it was compounded of drugs which , while aiming to compose the body , too severely stimulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been given to a person of Gillespie 's excitable disposition . To no other influence can be attributed that peculiar distemper of fancy , buried like a poisonous seed in his mind , and which , at first budding forth into a simple idiosyncrasy , thence gradually , but surely , overshadowed with madness his whole life and being . For three days Gillespie remained confined to his room , under the care of the doctor , who daily visited him , and dressed his wound . During most of this time the patient lay in a pleasant languor , caring but little to go out . At the beginning of the fourth day he somewhat revived , became nervously impatient to be released , and manifested an almost childish joy when the physician informed him that he was cured . " But I must tell you-I am sorry to be obliged to say it- " remarked the doctor , as he left the room , " that your wound will leave a slight , a very slight scar . " At hearing this , Gillespie once more consulted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented from doing so , to any purpose , by the bandages upon his forehead . Now , at last , it was free for observation . But at the first glance he started back horrified . The swelling upon his forehead had gone down , to be sure , and the discoloration had nearly faded away . But the lines of the cut skin had not , been healed , becoming , if any thing , broader with the shrinkage of their edges , and now glowed deep and red , crossing eaeh other in a series of almost mathematically exact right-angles , with a terrible suggestion of undesirable permanency . He stood transfixed . Always an ardent lover and frequenter of society , and hence naturally careful about his appearance , how could he ever show himself with that dreadful brand fixed upon him ? And as he looked , a chance acquaintance came in , and , with that want of tact which peculiarly distinguishes some people , blurted out , half jokingly , " Why , what the dickens is the matter ? Have you been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ? Who is thc guilty man that struck you ? And now that I look closer , it is not the blow of a fist , after all , but rnther a signet of evil set upon you . What is it all about ? Are you the original Cain now come up again with his warning sign ? Or ,  --  for it is a veritable hieroglyphic ,  --  have you incurred , in some way , the wrath of the Egyptian gods , that you have been thus branded with their cipher ? " At the new idea thus suddenly presented to him , Gillespie shuddered , and once more peered into his glass . Yes , - there it was ,  --  no ordinary bruise , but a veritable , unmistakable hieroglyphic // fastened upon him , like the brand of a galley-slave ! It seemed as though every mark had been drawn with subtle meaning , so clear and well defined were the outlines ; and , above all , glowed a single thread , turned into loop-like shape , with a straight , sharp termination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird . Could it be any thing other than a doom upon him ? Was it then true , as he had somewhere read , that the old Egyptian deities still had ability to avenge themselves for mortal insults ? Must it not be that the great stone Sphinx , calm and impassive as it seemed to others , had fixed upon him for a display of her powers ? Why , oh ! why , in his foolish mirth and recklessness had he thus taunted her ? Thoughts and speculations like these came boiling into his brain with lightning speed , severally giving way in turn to successors yet ; more startling *nd absurd , and each leaving behind some traces of its unwelcome presence , until , in a moment , as it were , the great doom of his life had become fixed . Even now , as he stood , the mysterious brand upon his forehead seemed to grow darker and more deeply set . Inflamed with one desperate idea , he rushed out , fled wildly up the street , and did not rest until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he happened already to know by fame . There throwing off his hat , he pointed to his forehead , and exclaimed : " Look ! What is that ? " " It is a scar or bruise , " responded the old man , drawing his long pipe in from the open window . " Or is it something that you have painted there for mystification ? For if it were anywhere else than on your forehead , I should say that it was an Egyptian hieroglyphic . " " And what does it stand for ? Tell me at once . " " Such questions can not always be answered at once , " was the response . " I have often spent months in deciphering a simpler sign than that . Let me look closer . There is here a line , which , by itself alone , would signify continuity . And here seems to be the head and beak of a bird . I can hardly tell what it all means . I think I have seen that sign somewhere , but can not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone , I know . Wait , though , a minute . " With that the old scholar pulled down some of his tattered vellumvolnines , and made diligent search . After half an hour he drew himself up with an exclamation of satisfaction . " It is here . I thought I had seen it before ,  --  the very same character . It is found on the north tells me nothing " cried Gillespie . " What must I seek l " " How should I know ? " retorted the other , a little put out at the sharpness of the question , more especially as , at the first , he had been interrupted in the perusal of a most interesting chronicle . " Better seek for manners , or for some way to get that brand off from you-if you have not , as I am inclined to suspect , put it there yourself . " With that the old man turned away , thrust the bowl of his pipe once more out of the window , and resumed his studies . And Gillespie , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel . There he found a letter awaiting him . It was postmarked " Naples , " and was from Mr. Ralston , informing him of their approaching departure for Palermo , and of their desire to meet him there upon a certain specified day Enclosed was a note from Helen , with the usual lively gossip . She had bought a set of pink corals . And she had given some carlini to a blind beggar , who , after all , could see well enough to pick her pocket . And Gillespie must bring her something from Egypt -- not a mummy , for mummies - were ugly things , and there would be no place at home to put it , unless they moved away the music-stand . But she would like a scarab*eus , such as the Egyptian women *vore , and perhaps * model of something or other . Gillespie read the dainiy little note hurriedly , // and then crushed it wildly in his lingers . How , in his prerent state , could he appear at Palermo upon the designated day ? And in his agitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vague , rambling reply , full of unmeaning excuses , with n* real , open , sufficient explanation in any part of it ; alluded to some stigma upon him , of which perhaps time alone would clear him , speaking of it as something they should have known about , and seeming entirely unconscious that they would naturally apply the remark in a moral rather than in a physical sense ; and so , on the spur of the moment , sent off his letter . Daily , almost hourly , his thoughts gained a more horrible dominion over him . He reflected how he had tauntingly requested the great stone monster of the Desert to give him some stupid riddles to guess . Had she not now done so ? And had not his friend Vernon told him that , in her place , he would have given a riddle that should never be forgotten l Could there be any doubt that there was now a mystic brand upon him , never , perhaps , to be removed ? Nay , not quite as terrible as that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , the bitter curse would depart from him . And by anxiously dwelling upon the subject during his waking moments , and dreaming about it when asleep , this fancy became firmly fixed in his brain . He had been told to " seek . " What was it that he must seek for ? He could not tell ; but if he tried his best to fathom the mystery , could there be a doubt that , in the end , he would succeed ? And when the object of his search stood before him , he would surely recognize it . Its identity would be borne upon him by some unmistakable prescience . And then , then only , his toil having met its due fruition , the doom would be lifted from him , the mystic inscription would fade away from his forehead , and he would depart a free , untainted man once more . That thing to be sought for-was it a legend of the Sphinx ,  --  some vital philosophic truth ,  --  magic cures ,  --  material wealth ,  --  or what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cunningly as possible , trusting that new light would gradually gleam upon him . And first , doubtless , he must make himself acquainted with the mystic signs everywhere written upon the desertarchitecture . There , more surely than elsewhere , might be the truth . With that intent he once more visited the old student , with singular cunning humored the old man so successfully as to ingratiate himself into his favor , and soon managed to be entered as his pupil . And now , for weeks , he gave himself up to the study with a zest and diligence which were not without their reward . His earnest , fierce enthusiasm and longing , stimulated by the peculiar bent of his mind , enabled him , almost by inspiration , to grapple with difficulties which would have overwhelmed many professed and practised philologists . He soon mastered much that the old man could tell him ; had read most of those discolored vellum volumes and sheets of inscriptions , and panted for more . In Alexandria there were many stores of such treasures , many of them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some , which he could not buy , he procured copies . All this was expensive , and his means were small ; for in making his European tour , he had already vastly encroached upon his income . But with this passion of his mind ungratified , he hesitated at nothing , and drew drafts which , at any other time , would have horrified him , and the payment of which must have seriously crippled his principal . Gradually , through close association with his old preceptor , he acquired some of the Eastern habits . Almost from the first he assumed the close turban ; but this was partly for concealment , as thereby more easily than with any ordinary cap or hat he could hide the glowing cipher upon his forehead . Then , for further disguise , he let his beard grow , not wishing during his labors to be recognized by former friends , who , with their advice or ridicule , would // doubtless discommode him . Soon , by a natural sequence , to the turban were added the flowing Eastern robes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety , and his eye more piercing with the strange light gleaniing within it . In a single month , indeed , all was changed with him ; and no one would have recognized the light , alert young American in that thin , gaunt , stooping man , with the ragged beard and flowing dress , stealthily creeping along in slippered feet , at the dusk of each day , with long , stained rolls of parchment clutched nervously in his bony hands . And Helen , all this while ? At first she wrote apart from her father , asking what was to be understood by the singular language of his letter . Her father also wrote , demanding , in less affectionate words , an explanation . Probably Gillespie fully intended answering these letters , but postponed the duty from day to day , in hope of making that discovery which would clear him of his brand , and thereby enable him to write more cheering and satisfactory explanations . So day after day passed on . Then came a note from the father , coldly informing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which they could be met , if desired . Thea silence for a month . Still no answer from Gillespie , for he was more and more emersed in his desperate and apparently fruitless toil ; and so , what seemed to be the last ties between himself and his native land were slowly and rudely breaking . At last there suddenly came to him what seemed a gleam of success , or rather a suggestion of success , magnified by his hopes almost into a certainty . In some old parchment MS. , probably as yet untranslated , he found the record of how some one , in an early and now forgotten war long before the Christian era , had discovered vast treasures , guarded by the Sphinxes which flanked the great avenue at Thebes . Not beneath or even in front of the monsters had these treasures been found , but behind , ma thematically placed at a dis tance , represented by the square of some particular base-line . . There was hope , indeed . Why should not every Sphinx be the guardian of similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest of all be the keeper of the greatest wealth ? If so , it should still be untouched ; for there was no record of its removaL Even those most thorough explorers of all , the French philosophers , had merely delved about the edge of the figure , and thence , following the base-lines , had excavated for a few yards in front . No one had thought of clearing away the collected rubbish behind ; and yet what more natural than that the guardian of a treasure should sit watchful in front of it ? Could Gillespie now seize these buried stores , would the curse pass from him ? Nay , may not the mark , after all , have been put upon him in kindness , that the treasure might fall to the one who , first of all during many centuries , had spoken to the monster with recognition of powers still surviving in it ? He said not a word about his discovery or the ideas connected with it-not even to his old preceptor , who , as the chance might be , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But cautiously keeping the secret to himself he sought and procured authority from the Pacha to make any explorations he desired , within the limits of the Nile country , with permission to retain in his own possession the results of his labors . This , of itself , was a costly matter , for in Egypt , as elsewhere , there are occasional evidences of a circumlocution office ; and , before he had ended , much of his remaining little property had been drawn from home and spent . But what of that , to one who knew , at last , where to seek , and , consequently , would soon be wealthy , perhaps beyond his most ardent expectations ? The rest of his patrimony he expended in engaging a hundred or so native laborers , the necessary tools , and beasts of burden , and , lastly , a picked escort of well-armed and trusty men to guard his expected treasure . Thus provided , he set out one morning from Cairo , with a retinue of at- // tendants and camels hardly inferior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded to the Sphinx . The initial line of measurement was speedily ascertained , its square calculated , the proper distance accurately measured off ; and the command to dig given . The work went on merrily at first , for the impression had already gone around that he was striving , not from vain curiosity merely , but for some settled , specific object ; and each moment the crowd stood intent upon the development of some great discovery . Then little by little , as the day wore on and nothing came of it , there was discouragement and lack of interest . The few spectators who had been drawn thither by curiosity , returned to Cairo , and the laborers pursued their task with less alacrity . But still , being well paid , they toiled on , and , by evening , a large opening in the sand had been excavated , but nothing found . That night Gillespie slept upon the spot , and early the next morning gave orders to renew the work . And so , during all that second day , they widened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Then the laborers began to be disheartened , for even paid men do not like to toil unavailingly ; and at last Gillespie was obliged to call upon his armed guards to compel them to their duty . And the second night was one of striet watchfulness in the camp , lest the men should desert . The third day the labor was renewed , still more sluggishly and dispiritingly than before . Wearied out with baffled expectation , there were probably none among the spectators who longer looked for any discovery . Even Gillespie , perhaps , now began to despair ; for , as he stood and endeavored to encourage the work , his face grew paler and his lips more rigidly drawn down ; but throughout all , he let no word of discomposure escape him . Soon , too , there were some who , with low murmurs , began to taunt him . Why labor longer , indeed l Was he not mad l flow , from such a source , could success be expected ? But sud denly there came a change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been mad ; and for once it happened that those tattered hieroglyphics , so long left untranslated , had spoken the truth ; for , toward noon , there came a loul cry from the man who stood lowest down in the pit . His instrument had struck against a flat stone , in which was an iron ring . With alacrity the surface of the stone was cleared away , so that it could be lifted , and then appeared the commencement of a flight of stone steps . It was more like a recollection ef the Arabian Nights than an incident of the present century ; and even Gillespie , though he had fo* so long , in spirit , lived in the ancient world , stood for a moment paralyzed and aghast , hardly knowing whether or not to believe his eyes . Then taking with him the implements for kindling a torch , and beckoning one of his most trusty guards to accompany him , he descended . The way was long and narrow , the steps leading to a close passage , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the divergence of the stone sides , that he had entered into some sort of a chamber . Here , then , for the first time , he lighted his torch , and looked around . It was a vaulted room , about fifteen feet in width and height . As far as could be judged , it must have lain in almost a right line beneath the Sphinx . There were no joints or seams in the stone sides , the whole being evidently hollowed from the solid rock . The sides were smoothly polished , and here and there frescoed with the usual uncouth figures . There was no sign of treasure to be seen , but in the centre of the chamber , upon a pedestal , rested a stone sarcophagus , its surface richly carved . With the assistance of his companion , Gillespie lifted off thecover , and , lowering his torch , disclosed within , a mummy , encased in the ordinary manner . To lift it out was the work of a moment ; and between them the two men dragged it *slowly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Feb. above . There , with the crowd of expectant attendants and laborers thronging around in rapt amazement , they rudely broke open the case , unwound the bitumenized cerements , and so , at last , came to the body ,  --  a prince or princess , most likely , from the care with which it had been given a sepulchre , though now it differed little from any other meaner figure of the period . Upon the forehead , however , rested a scarab*nus ; not of the ordinary stone , but cunningly wrought from the finest gold , with emeralds set into the head for eyes . The sunlight gleamed upon it as Giflespie lifted it , and gold and jewels both glistened with dazzling brightness . Turning it over , he saw that there was a mystic character engraved upon the under side . This he eagerly attempted to decipher , for doubtless it would prove the key to further discovery . But as he held it still nearer to the light and strove to cleanse the characters from the pitchy substance which had somewhat obscured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot wildly through his temples , and , with a feeble groan , he sank upon the sand . Fainting upon the sand ; and when he awoke again , it was to find himself in bed , in a low caravanseri of Cairo . How long he had been ill he knew not , but every circumstance served *o show that the sudden paralysis with which his mingled agitation and joy of the moment had acted upon his body , so enfeebled by study , watchfulness , and want of care , must have been a severe one . His head had been shaved , and his face and hands were now more emaciated and shrivelled than ever . his beard had grown longer , and was torn and tangled ; and , with the exceeding pallor of his skin , the mystic cipher upon his forehead seemed to glow more ruddy than ever  --  a beacon , as it were , of his disgrace . Upon the table lay a letter from Helen , a calm and partly affectionate letter , but still breathing farewell in every line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lost any powers to afflict him . Beside it was a folded paper ,  --  a bill for those necessaries of his sickness which be was now unable to pay ; and in partial discharge of its items , he found that his watch , his manuscripts , and some of his clothes had already been seized upon . The weight of accumulated misery was upon him , and he turned his face to the wall . He could not weep ,  --  he was long past that . And he could not die , as he would have wished to do . When , a week later , be was able to get out and look more calmly about him , he found himself more than ever a stranger in a strange land . As has been said , his books and most of his other effects had been taken for the debts of his illness . The last drafts drawn upon his rapidly dissolving patrimony had been returned protested . The Government permit to search the ruins had been revoked , - in itself but a little matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase assistance . The excavation behind the Sphinx had been partially refilled by the order of the Pacha , and the winds , sweeping the sand before them , had completed the work , smoothing the surface to the level of the surrounding desert . What had been done in the secret chamber ,  --  . whether it had been left untouched , or whether the Pacha himself had it explored and removed its possible tre*sures ,  --  could not now be ascertained . And , worse than all else , perhaps , the golden scarab*eus , the mystic cipher upon which might have been the secret for which he had been destined to seek , and which , in its interpretation , might have told him so much , was gone . And here , perhaps , most properly , ends the story ; for here is fixed the termination of all the victim*s hopes , and struggles , and systematized labors . But there are those who will never rest content until they have gleaned up the last scattered grains of a chronicle , though before them stands the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral that need be known . For these , therefore , I will try to set forth all I could ever learn of that subsequent , necessary , and well-assured downfall . // Wearied with waiting , and , in the end , doubting not that Gillespie 's silence was only a cowardly method of severing himself from a distasteful tie , Helen Ralston at last returned home , and there , after two years , married one doubtless more worthy of her . A year later she moved to INew Orleans , and only a few months ago I read the notice of her untimely death . Her father , too , has passed away . And as Gillespie had none but distant cousins to inquire after him , and they naturally lost all interest in him as soon as he had exhausted his little patrimony , there remained soon not the slightest tie to bind him to his native land . Therefore he remained in Egypt . I doubt , iadeed , whether there was any power that could have drawn him away from that scene of his trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sobered man ; not sane , indeed , but perhaps more nearly in his right mind than for many weeks past .
