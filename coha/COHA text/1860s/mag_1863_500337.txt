txt THE BUCCANEERS OF AMERICA . II . A STILL more terrible name to the Spaniards , as a leader of the buccaneers , was Francis Lolonois , a Frenchman , who in his youth was transported as a slave to the Caribbean Islands . Passing thence to Tortuga , he became a common mariner , and conducted himself so well in several voyages as to win the confidence of the governor , NI . de la Place , who gave him a ship in which to seek his fortune . The beginning of his career on his own account was favorable ; but his cruelties toward the Spaniards were such as to make his name terrible throughout the Indies ; and the Spanish mariner preferred death in any form to falling into his hands . Fortune , however , being ever inconstant , Lolonois did not escape reverses . Encountering a tempest on The Buccaneers of Amertca. // the coast of Campeachy , his ship was wrecked , and himself and crew cast on shore . Scarcely had he dried his dripping clothes when he was met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle . Being wounded , and concealing himself among the dead bodies of his companions , he escaped , and arrived at Campeachy in disguise , in time to take part in the . thanksgiving and religious rejoicings of the Spaniards on account of his supposed death . Here he succeeded in enticing some slaves from their masters , with whom he again put to sea , with the design of ravaging the small town of De los Cayes , on the south side of Cuba . Divining his project , however , some fishermen conveyed information to the governor at Havana , who immediately despatched a vessel of war of ten guns in pursuit , with orders not to return until the pirates were captured , and every man executed except Lolonois himself , who was to be brought to Havana . This vessel entered the port of De los Cayes while the pirates were yet at sea ; but they were advised of every particular of the pursuit , and concerted their measures accordingly . It was on a clear , starlight night , when the Spaniard lay quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secure that nought of evil could delight To walk in such a scene on such a night , ' that the pirates entered the harbor in two canoes . Stealing upon their intended prey so silently as to escape observation , they boarded her on both sides at once , and , after a sharp conflict , succeeded in her capture . Lolonois then informed the prisoners that he knew their orders , and it was his purpose to execute them upon those who were to have enforced them upon him . Supplications and entreaties were in vain . Tie successively struck off the heads of every one with his own hand - sucking , at each stroke , the drops of blood that trickled from his sabre . Only one person was saved , whom he sent back to the governor with a letter stating what he had done , and declaring his determination thenceforward to show no quarter to a Spaniard , adding : I have great hopes I shall execute on your own person the punishment I have upon those you sent against me . Thus have I retaliated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor was much troubled at the message , and declared that no quarter should ever again be granted to a pirate ; but knowing who would have the advantage in such a war of retaliation , the inhabitants induced him to change his determination . Encouraged by his success ; Lolonois forthwith set about organizing a force to make a descent upon the main , with a view of taking Maracaibo itself . While engaged in these preparations , he formed a connection with Michael de Basco , who , having retired from the sea , was living upon his gains . Do Basco had served in the wars of Europe as an officer with distinguished gallantry ; and he now engaged with Lobnois as the land commander . When the expedition sailed , it consisted of eight vessels and six hundred men . On their passage they fell in with a Spanish armed ship from Porto Rico for New Spain . Lobonois parted from the fleet and insisted on engaging the Spaniard alone . He did so , and carried the ship after an engagement of three hours . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was , moreover , richly laden with specie , jewels , and merchandise . Shortly after another vessel was taken , when on her voyage to Hispaniola to pay the troops . This was a valuable capture , the prize being laden with arms and ammunition as well as specie . The prize vessels were sent into Tortuga , where they were unladen ; and one of them was immediately armed and sent back to join the main squadron as the flagship . Their marine thus augmented , they sailed first into the Bay of Venerada , the fort guarding the entrance to which was taken , the guns I // spiked , and the garrison , numbering two hundred and fifty men , put to the sword . The pirates next sailed into the Lake of Maracaibo , landed their forces , and proceeded at once to attack the castle that guarded the entrance to the harbor . The governor had made judicious dispositions for its defence , having formed an ambuscade for the purpose of bringing the pirates between two fires . his design , howcver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ambuscade , being discovered and routed , fled to the town , the inhabitants of which , remembering the former visitation of the pirates , deserted in wild consternation , and fell back upon Gibraltar , thirty leagues distant . Meantime the pirates , though armed with swords and pistols only , attacked the castle with such impetuosity as to compel its capitulation . The slaughter was great . After the surrender the guns were spiked , and the castle demolished . The next day the invaders advanced upon the town , which they found desolate . It was well stored with provisions , but all the valuables had been removed or buried . Lolonois demanded information of the prisoners where the plate , jewels , and money were concealed , and attempts were made to extort confessions by the rack , but to little purpose . He then hacked one of the prisoners to pieces with his sword , declaring that such should be the fate of all , unless the hidden treasures of the town should be forthcoming . Bnt the poor wretches were unable to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could , changing their own hiding places , and taking away their valuables . Having remained fifteen days in Maracaibo , and supposing that the people had carried their treasures with them to Gibraltar , Lolonois determined to sail to that town . The deputy governor , however , without the knowledge of the pirates , had made vigorous preparations for its defence ; and accordingly , on their arrival in sight of the town , they unex pectedly discovered the royal standard floating from two strong batteries guarding a very narrow channel through which the pirate squadron must pass . A council of war was called , at which , after a spirited speech from Lolonois , it was agreed to land and carry the works by storm  --  the leader declaring that he would pistol any man who should flinch , with his own hand . The Spanish forces numbered eight hundred men , well appointed ; but nothing could daunt the resolution of the pirates . The Spaniards conducted themselves bravely ; and not until five hundred of their number had fallen did they yield . The buccaneers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter recovering-an evidence of the desperation with which they fought . The town of Gibraltar , of course , fell into their hands ; but it was a bootless conquest , inasmuch as during the time the pirates had wasted at Naracaibo , the people had secured their treasure by carrying it away . To save the town from the torch , however , the inhabitants paid a ransom of ten thousand pieces of eight , yet not until a portion of it had been burned . After spending two months on shore , the buccaneers reCmbarked , carrying away all the crosses , pictures , and bells of the churches , for the purpose , as they alleged , of erecting a chapel in the island of Tortuga , to which pious object a portion of the spoils was to be consecrated ! The amount of their booty , during their expedition , was two hundred and sixty thousand pieces of eight , together with vast quantities of plate , jewels , and merchandise-most of which was soon dissipated , after their return , in debauchery , and other rude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lolonois was the capture , in the mouth of the Guatemala river , of a Spanish ship , carrying fortytwo guns , and manned by one hundred and thirty fighting men ; the pirate carrying only twenty-two guns , and being attended by a single small vesseL // The Spaniard made a good defence , and the pirate chief was at first repulsed . Yet afterward , under cover of a thick mist , rendered more dense by the smoke of the powder , the pirates boarded the Spaniard from their small craft , and bravely accomplished their purpose . The career of this desperado was soon to come to an end . Shortly after this last exploit , while cruising in the Bay of Honduras , his own ship was wrecked , and he , together with his crew , were thrown upon an island . Their next business was to build a boat from the remains of the broken ship  --  a work which occupied them six months , and when finished she would carry but half their number  --  the other half remaining behind by lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashore at Darien , he was made prisoner by a wild tribe of Indians , who became the instruments of divine justice in avenging his many cruelties . They were not ignorant of his character , and , believing that no trace or memorial of such a wretch ought to remain upon earth , they tore him in pieces alive , throwing his body limb by limb into the fire , and afterward scattering his ashes to the winds . Fitting death for such a horrible mon-ster ! But the career of the most formidable chief in this bloody catalogue remains yet to be described . It was that of Henry Morgan , whose very name , as it has been justly remarked , spread such terror abroad , that with it the old women frightened their children asleep , and then lay awake themselves through fear . ' Morgan was the son of a wealthy farmer in Wales , but not satisfied with his secluded condition , he sought a seaport , and sailed for Barbadoes , where he was sold for a term of years for his passage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jamaica , where the temptations spread before him by the buccaneers of rapidly arrivbig at wealth and fame , induced him to join their community . In the course of several voyages , which were attended with great success , he evinced so much intrepidity , skill , prudence , and judgment , as to win the confidence of his companions , several of whom proposed the purchase of a ship on joint account , the command of which was conferred on him . About this time , also , Morgan became acquainted with Mausvelt , an old pirate , and who had now on foot an expedition destined for a descent upon the Spanish main . Mausvelt induced Morgan to join him as his vice-admiral , and they were shortly at sea with a fleet of fifteen sail , great and small , and five hundred men , chiefly French and Maroons . Their course was first directed against the two small islands , nearly contiguous , of St. Catharine 's , on the coast of Costa Rica . These , though strongly fortified , were easily taken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his troops , *superinduced by the terror inspired by the very name of the pirates . The design of Mausvelt in the acquisition of these islands , was to fortify and hold them as a place of rendezvous . Leaving , therefore , a garrison of one hundred men in the forts , Mausvelt and Morgan continued their course to the main ; but as a knowledge of their intentions had preceded them , such preparations had been made by the Spaniards on the coast for their reception , as induced them to return to St. Catharine 's . Thence they sailed back to Jamaica for recruits ; but not being favored by the governor , Mausvelt repaired to Tortuga , where he died . The command now devolved upon Morgan , who endeavorcd to prosecute the designs of his predecessor ; but the Spaniards having regained possession of St. Catharine 's , his projects were for a time defeated . Not only had the Spaniards recovered the island , but a large English ship , despatched thither from Jamaica for the aid of the buccaneers , and well supplied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also fell into their hands . This was a severe disappointment to Morgan , who had made extensive arrangements for preserving St. ( iatharine 's as a storehouse and place of refuge , and had opened a correspondence with Virginia and New England upon the subject . These events took place in 1665 . But , far from relinquishing the profession he had chosen , Morgan had only just entered upon it . He soon succeeded in organizing another fleet of nine sail of different-sized vessels , manned by four hundred and fifty men . With these he made sail for Porto Bello , the third strongest post at that time in the American dominions of Spain . In order to secure secrecy , Morgan had communicated his purpose to no living soul , until he came almost in view of the town . Some of his bold spirits then faltered for a moment ; but he had the power to dissipate their doubts of success , even against odds so great . Landing his forces in the night , Morgan arrived at the very citadel before he was discovered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least alarm . The castle was summoned to surrender on pain of putting every man found therein to death . The summons being disregarded , the assault was begun , and bravely repelled for a time ; but the fortress was at length compelled to yield to the impetuous assaults of the pirates . But there were yet other castles , and one of the strongest , to be subdued . With this latter Morgan was hotly engaged from daylight until noon-losing many of his men , and at times almost despairing himself of success . At length another of the lesser castles gave way , and Morgan was encouraged and strengthened by the return of the detachment that had been engaged against it . As a device , moreover , to compel the Spanish governor to yield the principal castle , the pirate chief caused its walls to be planted round with scaling ladders , upon which , in front of his own men , the religious prisoners in his hands , priests and nuns , were irced to ascend . But although these people called to the governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save their lives , his determination was inflexible . He declared he would yield only with his life , and that the castle should be defended to the last . Night approached , and the contest yet raged ; but finally , after performing prodigies of valor , the assailants succeeded in scaling the walls , and the castle was entered sword in hand . The garrison thereupon submitted , all but the governor , who , deaf to the entreaties of his wife and daughter , fought on , killing several of the pirates with his own hand , and also some of his own soldiers for surrendering , until he was himself killed . The entire town was now in possession of the rapacious invaders ; and all the treasures of the churches , having been placed in the castles for safety , of course fell into the hands of the victors , as also did a vast amount of money and plate . Amazed that a town so strongly fortified as Porto Bello , and so well garrisoned , should have been captured by so small a force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , desiring a pattern of the arms by which he had performed so desperate an exploit . Morgan treated the messenger with courtesy , and returned to the president apistolandseveralbullets , as*slender pattern of the arms he had used , requesting his Excellency to preserve them carefully for a twelvemouth , when he promised to come to Panama and bring them away . The president , however , sent the articles back again , to save the pirate chief the trouble of coming after them . He also sent him as a gift a gold ring , with a civil request that he would not trouble himself to come to Panama at the time mentioned , since he would not be likely to fare so well as he had at Porto Bello . Morgan , after having destroyed the military walls at Porto Bello , reembarked with his numbers greatly dimin // ished by battle , debauchery , and disease , and returned to Jamaica . The fame of exploits like these caused the name of Morgan to resound throughout Europe ; and large numbers of the English chivalry , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either to mend dilapidated fortunes , or to acquire new ones , and to participate in the unlawful glory which even the darkness of the deeds by which it was won could not eclipse . These recruits attached themselves to Morgan , and eagerly accepted commands under him . The bold rover gave them commissions in the name of the king of England , authorizing them to commit hostilities against the Spaniards , whom he declared to be the enemies of the British crown . To such an amazing extent did the buccaneering system increase , that more than four thousand men were now engaged in it , two thousand of whom were under Morgan , with a fleet of thirty-seven vessels , divided into squadrons , and appointed with all the formality of an independent sovereignty . Their place of rendezvous was between Tortuga and St. Domingo , the coast of the latter being plundered for provisions . A squadron of four sail was also sent to the region of the iRio de la Hacha upon the same errand , where a large ship was captured , the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in former instances , by the most exquisite tortures . All things being in readiness , the expedition sailed in December , 1670 , the ultimate destination of which was to pay the promised visit to the governor of Panama  --  the richest city of Spanish America . Preliminary , however , to their landing upon the isthmus , a detachment of the fleet was sent against a fortress at the mouth of the Chaguwhich river it was necessary to ascend before disembarking for Panama . This fortress was built upon a steep rock , against which the waves of the sea were continually breaking , and was de fended by an officer of distinguished ability and courage , and by a garrison in all respects worthy of such a commander . Por a time the contest was doubtful , but the fates favored the freebooters . The Spanish commander was slain , and , the fort taking fire , the position fell into the hands of the besiegers . The manner in which the fire was communicated to the fortress was very remarkable . During the fight , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodged in the eye of one of the pirates , standing near his chief . Extracting the barbed shaft from his head with his own hand , and binding some cotton around the missile , he set it on fire , and shot it back into the fortress from the barrel of his gun . The burning arrow fell upon the roof of a house thatched with palm leaves , which were dry , and a conflagration ensued , which the garrison strove in vain to resist . But for this untoward occurrence , it was believed that Brodley , the pirate vice-admiral , would have been repulsed . Brodley was now joined by the main fleet under Morgan himself ; and the vessels , having been brought to anchor , were left with a sufficient guard , while the commander , with twelve hundred men , embarked in boats and canoes. and commenced the ascent of the river toward the capital , the sacking of which was to be the crowning act of his career of outrage and blood . They were compelled soon to leave their boats ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations ever successfully encountered by man . The country was desolate , villages and plantations being alike deserted , and in the flight of the people nothing had been left behind that could possibly be converted into food , or in any wise minister to the cupidity of the invaders . The hardships they underwent in climbing mountains almost inaccessible , and traversing morasses nearly impassable , while in a state bordering upon starvation , exceed the power of language to describe . The carcass of an ass found ( // by the way afforded an uncooked tempting meal ; and such cats and dogs as did not flee with their owners , were considered delicious morsels . On the eighth day a narrow defile was feebly defended by a company of Indians , by whom ten of the pirates were killed , and fourteen others wounded . On the ninth , having gained the summit of a lofty mountain , to their infinite delight they came in view of the great Southern ocean , and saw beneath them the glittering spires of Panama , and the shipping in the harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several days , was now lighted up by the most extravagant demonstrations of joy . They leaped , and sang , and threw up their hats , and blew their trumpets , and beat their arms , as though the prize were already their own without a struggle . Seemingly refreshed in strength by the sight of the object cf their desires , the pirates rushed eagerly forward , and before nightfall encamped upon the great plain on which stood the city , dispersing with ease severaj strong reconnoitring parties who had thrown themselves in their way . The Spaniards had evidently been preparing for their reception , and they played their artillery upon the invaders all night , but with little effect ; the pirates sleeping on the grass wi*th great composure , anxious for the arrival of the day which was to reward their sufferings with untold riches . The invaders were early on foot on the morning of the tenth day , and in full march for the city . Arriving upon the summit of a little hill , they were brought to a pause by a force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers had been reduced on the march to less than a thousand effective men ; and they now beheld an army consisting of two squadrons of horse and four regiments of foot , led by the governor in person , and preceded by a large herd of wild bulls , the design of which singular description of light troops was to throw the buccaneers into confusion . Beyond these , in immediate proximity to the city , they discovered the people of Panama in arms , in yet greater numbers . The action with the advanced army , under the governor , soon commenced , the wild cattle being of no avail against the pirates , who shot them all down in a very brief space of time . But the Spaniards , especially the cavalry , fought bravely for more than two hours . The horse having at length been compelled to yield , the infantry fled , after a brief resistance . Six hundred Spaniards lay dead upon the field , and the buccaneers suffered so severely that they were forced to desist from an immediate pursuit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city was defended by two thousand five hundred men , with a large number of heavy guns , planted at different points . But the buccaneers , though sadly diminished in numbers , were determined to finish the work they had begun on the same day ; and taking an oath that they would stand by each other to the last , they again advanced , and a second fierce and bloody encounter took place at the very buccaneers . Neither party gave or received quarter , and after the conquest the pirates killed nearly all who fell into their hands , sparing neither ecclesiastics nor women . The city was at that time one of remarkable splendor , containing two thousaad houses of great magnificence . The private dwellings were chiefly built of cedar , and embellished with hangings , paintings , and everything that luxury and taste could supply . It was the see of a bishop , with two large churches , and seven monasteries , all richly adorned with altar pieces , paintings , gold , silver , and precious stones . But the gorgeous palaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of Morgan himeslg although he afterward endeavored to fix the act // of vandalism upon others . They were probably burned in revenge because found empty , for many of the inhabitants had sought refuge in flight , carrying away such of their valuables as they could . Still , by the horrible processes of torture , immense discoveries were made of treasures concealed in the wells and caves , and in the woods . Some valuable freights were taken from boats in the harbor , which had been left aground at low water ; and rich deposits were frequently discovered in the earth , under the excruciating tortures of the rack . Morgan lingered at Panama for a considerable period , until , indeed , his men began to murmur at their protracted inactivity . The cause of this inaction will hardly be divined from the character thus far developed of this stupendous freebooter ; but it was the tender passion ! He had among his prisoners a beautiful Spanish lady , who attracted his particular attention . She was a native of Spain , and the wife of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called him to Peru . According to the historians of that day , she was still in the bloom of youth ; Her cheeks , naturally ruddy , were heightened by a tropical sun into a warmer glow ; and her fine black eyes , dazzling with uncommon lustre , gave animation to the noblest countenance that ever the hand of nature delineated , or poet 's fancy conceived . The interest which her unhappy situation excited was heightened into admiration by her elevated mien ; and her whole deportment indicated a soul incapable of being degraded from its native rank , by any reverse of condition , or any depth of misery . ' Morgan , rude as he was , and unused to the melting mood , was nevertheless charmed with her conversation , and the admiration which he felt for her bearing was ere long changed into yet more tender emotions . He provided a house for her , and assigned to her service a retinue of domestics . Shortly afterward he attempted to open such a correspondence with her as might favor his desires , but failing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which her delicacy revolted . Her rebuke , firm and noble , drove him back abashed ; but his impetuous temper could not well brook disappointment , and in the ardor of his passion he subsequently attempted to force her into compliance with his brutal desires . But . with a virtue as exalted as that of the Roman matron , who resisted , but in vain , the advances of the son of Tarquin , and with a yet higher courage , she sprang from his attempted embrace , exclaiming , Stop ! Thinkest thou , then , that thou canst ravish mine honor from me , as thou hast wrested from me my fortune and my liberty ? Be assured that I can die and be avenged ! ' Having said this , she drew from her bosom a poniard , which she would have plunged into his breast , had he not avoided the blow . From that moment she became an object not only of his hate , but of his cruelty , until at length she was ransomed by some of her friends . History @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female purity and honor ; but , like that of Lucretia , it deserves the topmost niche in the temple of virtue . At length , in the month of February , Morgan took his departure from Panama , having one hundred and seventyfive beasts of burden laden with silvcr and gold , jewelry , and other precious things . He also took with him six hundred prisoners , men , women , and children , for the purpose of extorting enormous ransoms for them by the way ; the cries of the women and children were pitiful to hear ; but the freebooter 's heart was steeled against every humane emotion . Returning down the river Chagre , he destroyed the castle at its entrance , and prepared to re*mbark for Jamaica . Before going on board , however , a division of the plunder was made , which gave great dissatisfaction . It seemed unaccountable to his men that so large an apparent amount of I // booty should yield only about two hundred pieces of eight per capita , and rumors of foul play were rife . Meantime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the course of the following night , while his companions were in a deep sleep , he put to sea and escaped to Jamaica , *and thence to England . Such an instance of treachery had never been before known among the buccaneers , and the rage and resentment that ensued can not be described . His departure was the signal for the dispersion of the fleet . The French returned to Tortuga . Some of the English attempted to overtake the mighty robber and make him disgorge , but were unsuccessful . Others of the crews dispersed with their vessels to seek their fortunes as best they might . Morgan ultimately returned to England laden with wealth , and was well received . He afterward became a commander in the naval service of his country , and obtained the honor of knighthood from William III . The capture of Panama , however , was the last great land expedition successfully undertaken by the buccaneers . A few other land expeditions , it is true , were begun by chiefs of lesser note ; but the indifferent success which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations more exclusively to the water , and there was no sea left untraversed by them , from the Atlantic to the Indian ocean . The commerce of almost all nations was annoyed by them , although their depredations continued more particularly to be directed against the first objects of their hate , the Spaniards . It is a curious fact , illustrating the corruption of the Roman Catholic Church at that time , that in one of the Spanish ships captured while on her way to South America , by an Englishman named White , there were found no less than two millions of Papal bulls , granting indulgences to the Spaniards of the New World ! These were a royal trade , and had been purchased by the king of Spain for three hundred thousand forms , prime cost , and by him were designed to be retailed for five millions . Thus , by their capture , his Catholic Majesty lost the benefit of a fine speculation . Had these indulgences been captured by Yankees , they would have contrived to barter them away at a profit ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ravaged the whole continent with very quiet consciences , having the Pope 's pardon already in their pockets. * It is a curious fact , not , I believe , very extensively understood , that the great English circumnavigator Dampier was for a considerable period connected with the buccaneers after the flight of Morgan . iDampier found himself among them at first by accident , having gone ashore on the Spanish main in great distress to procure provisions . Falling in with a party of the marauders , he was induced to join them . He was at the taking of Porto Bello ; and afterward crossed the Isthmus of Darien with Sawkins , Sharp , and others . Sawkins , the commander , was killed in an attack on Puebla Nova in 1679 . Dampier , in his Voyages , ' gives an interesting account of their subsequent course along the coasts , and among the islands of the Pacific , which was rather disastrous . A mutiny , however , occurring among those of the buccaneers engaged in the expedition , Dampier returned across the Isthmus and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and his companions had dissipated all their wealth , they fitted out another piratical expedition for the South seas , doubling Cape Horn in the spring of 1684 . Proceeding northward to Panama , Dampier 's party were joined by large numbers of buccaneers who had just crossed the Isthmus ; and obtaining a number of additional vessels , they * . An indulgence was never granted in advance of any crime yet to be committed . It was simply a rcm*seion or commutation of a part of the temporal penalty attached to crime , after the sin itself had been repented , confeesed , renounced , and forgiven . Two millions of Papal hulls lI-Ed. // prepared to intercept the Plate fleet on its departure from Lima for Spain . After a few successes , and several disasters , Dampier and his companions sailed to the Philippine Islands in 1686 ; and subsequently visited most of the islands in the Pacific , sometimes rioting in luxury , and at others brought to the verge of starvation . Dampier quitted the buccaneers at the island of Nicoba , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined them , as the commander of a fine vessel ; but the treachery of his officers and crew defeated the objects of the cruise . Returning from this bootless voyage , he was presented to Queen Anne , and well received . He subsequently made a fourth voyage to the Pacific , during which he discovered and took from the island of Juan Fernandez the celebrated Alexander Selkirk , the hero of iDe Foe 's Robinson Crusoe  --  a story ever delightful and cver new to readers old and young . The actual experience of Selkirk , as related by Dampier , corresponds more closely with the narrative , probably , than has generally been supposed . The last great enterprise of this remarkable race of men was directed against Carthagena in 1697 . It was planned in France , from one of the ports of which a squadron of twelve vessels sailed , under the command of Pointis . It was joined by twelve hundred buccaneers in the West Indies ; and although Carthagena was then the strongest city in the New World , its forts and castles were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired by Pointis amounted to one million seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling , with which he embarked and made sail . But they had not been long at sea before the buccaneers discovered that their rapacious commander was meditating how he should deprive them of their share of the plunder . Exasperated at this treatment , they at first determined to put him to death . This purpose , however , was diverted by a sug0estion to return to Carthagena and demand a heavy ransom to save the city from destruction , that they might fill their pockets in that way . This project was carried into execution . Entering the city without resistance , the men were confined in the great church , and a ransom demanded of more than two hundred and eighteen thousand pounds sterling . A venerable priest ascended the pulpit , and by his eloquent address persuaded the people to comply with the demand , by surrendering all their remaining money and jewels . But the amount fell short of the demand , and the city was sacked a second timc . Having amassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more put to sea . But they did not long enjoy their ill-gotten riches . Meeting with a fleet of ships belonging to England and Holland , both of which nations were then in alliance with Spain , an engagement ensued , in which several . of the pirates were taken and sunk , and among them were lost the treasure ships , so that the booty went to the bottom of the sea . This was the last memorable event in the history of the buccaneers of America , although a lower order ' of piracy prevailed , both in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans , for many years afterward . Tbere had been for the most part a separation between the English and French buccaneers on the revolution of 1688 , which brought William and Mary to the throne of England , and termi-. nated the friendly relations between that nation and the Gauls . By the peace of Ryswick , moreover , in 1697 , peace was restored between France and Spain , and it then became the interest as well as the policy of Europe to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of men who ever trod the earth . History affords no parallel to the buccaneers . Without any regular system , without laws , without any degree of subordinalion , and even without any fixed reve* I // flue , they l ) ecame the astonishment of the age in which they lived , as they will be of l ) osterity . ' In their actions is to be found a mixture of the most oppdsite feelings and principles . They were at once undauntedly brave , and cowardly brutal ; full of justice and honor to each other , and yet a lawless banditti . As an evidence of their feelings of honor , it is related that on a certain occasion a company of their fraternity- ' Brothers of the Coast , ' as they styled themselves-had stipulated , for a certain sum , to escort a Spanish ship richly laden . One of them ventured to propose to his companions to enrich themselves at once by taking the ship . Montauban , the commander of the troop , had no sooner heard the proposal , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore . What ! ' replied the freebooters , would you then leave us ? Is there one among us who approves of the treachery you abhor I ' A council was thereupon called , and it was agreed that the person who had made the proposition should be thrown upon the first coast they should reach . The history of past times , ' says a quaint writer , doth not offer , nor will that of future times produce , an example of such an association , almost as marvellous as the discovery of the New World . Their swords and their daring spirit , which they exercised with such terrible effect , were the only fortune they possessed in Europe . In America , being enemies of all mankind , and dreaded by all , perpetually exposed to the most extreme dangers , and considering every day as their last , their wealth was dissipated in the same manner in which it was acquired .

It was a matter of indifference to them whether they left their bodies upon the earth or beneath the waters , and they consequently looked upon life and death with the same composure . Ferocious in mind , misguided in conscience , destitute of connections , of relatives , of friends , of fellow citizens , of country , of an asylum ; without any of those motives which moderate the ardor of bravery by the value which they attach to existence , they were ever ready to rush , as without sight , upon the most desperate attempts . Equally incapable of submitting to indigence or quiet ; too proud to employ themselves in common labor ; they would have been the scourge of the Old World , had they not been that of the New . ' In closing this paper , it remains to glance for a moment at the real history of William Kidd , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked in the former part of this article , * has for a hundred and fifty years stood at the head of the pirate legends of the North , but who , in reality , must have been one of the smallest members of the fraternity . I have not been able to ascertain the place of Kidd 's nativity . He was , however , the captain of a merchant vessel , trading between New York and London , and was celebrated for his nautical skill and enterprise . The first mention of him , in our authentic criminal history , occurs in t691 , in which year , as we learn from the journals of the New York Assembly , much was allowed to be due him for the many good services done for the province in attending with his vessels . ' But in what capacity , or for what object , he attended with his vessels , ' does not appear . It was also declared that he ought to be suitably rewarded . Accordingly , in the same year , it was ordered by the Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p*id to Captain Kidd , as a * See CONTINENTAL for June , 1863. // suitable acknowledgement for the important benefits which the colony had derived from his services . ' The presumption is , that those services were in some way connected with the protection of the colonial merchant ships from the attacks of the pirates , who were even yet hovering along the coasts of the Northern colonies . Indeed , the harbor of New York itself was no stranger to the pirate vessels , and the commerce between them and the people of figure'in the city was not inconsiderable . It was no secret that the pirates were freely supplied with provisions by the inhaNtants of Long Island . Further yet , it was well known in the year 1695 , that the English pirates had fitted out the vessels in the harbor of New York . On the arrival of the pirate vessels from their cruises , their goods were openly sold in the city , and the conduct of the Colonial Government was such , that collusion , if not actual partnerships between them and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poor and profligate man , was governor at that time . He was beyond doubt concerned with the freebooters , as also was William Nicoll , a member of the privy council . Complaints upon this subject having reached England , Fletcher was succeeded , in 1695 , by the Earl of Bellamont , the appointment being made in the belief that , from his rank and the wealth of his character , he would be able to retrieve the character of the Colonial Government . Justice , however , to the memory of Kidd requires it to be said that he was not at that period , so far as it is known , a pirate himself . Before Lord Bellamont sailed from England for his government , he met with Robert Livingston of New York  --  the ancestor of the Livingstons of Livingston 's Manorwith whom he held a conversation respecting the pirates , and the best means that could be adopted to put them down . The project *f employing a swift-sailing armed ship of thirty guns , and one hundred and fifty men , to cruise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lordship to Kidd , as a man of integrity and courage , acquainted with the prates and their places of rendezvous , and as one in all respects fit to be intrusted. with the command of a vessel engaged in such a difficult service . He had , indeed , commanded a privateer , in regular commissi&amp;n , against the pirates in the West Indies , in which service he had acquitted himself as a brave and adventurous man . The project not being entertained by the Board of Admiralty , a private adventure against the pirates was suggested by Mr. Livingston , one fifth part of the stock of which he would take himself besides becoming security for the good conduct of Kidd . The proposition was approved by the king , who became interested to the amount of one tenth ; and the residue of the expense was supplied by Lord Chancellor Somers , the Duke of Shrewsbury , the Earls of Romney and Oxford , and Sir Edmund Harrison and others . The ship having been procured and equipped , Kidd sailed for New York under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the enterprise being committec*t to the Earl of Bellamont and himself . For a time he served faithfully and with advantage to the commerce of the colonies and mother country ; for which services he received much public applause , and another grant from the colony of two hundred and fifty pounds . Tradition , moreover , says that , on visiting the government house , he was received with public honors , and invited to a seat with the speaker of the House of Assembly . On his next voyage , howev*er , he stretched away to the Indian ocean , and turned pirate himself . Selecting the island of Madagascar as his principal place of rendezvous , and burning his own ship after having captured one that suited him better , his depredations upon the commerce of all nations were I // represented to have been great . It is said that he ranged over the Indian coast from the Red sea to Malabar , and that his depredations extended from the Eastern ocean back along the Atlantic coast of South America , through the Bahamas , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long Island . ' But it will presently be seen that this statement must have been an exaggeration , as time was not afforded for operations so extensive before his arrest . It is beyond doubt true that Long Island contained several of his hiding places . Kidd 's Rock'is well known at Manhasset , upon Long Island , to this day . Here he was supposed to have buried some of his treasures , and many have been the attempts of the credulous to find the hidden gold , but it could not be found . There is also no doubt that he was wont to hide himself and his vessel among those curious rocks in Sachem 's Head Harbor . called the Thimble islands . There is also upon one of those rocks , sheltered from the view of the Sound , a beautiful artificial excavation of an oval form , holding perhaps the measure of a barrel , called Kidd 's Punch Bowl . ' It was here , according to the legend of the neighborhood , that he used to carouse with his crew . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was accustomed to anchor his vessel in Gardner 's bay . On one occasion , in the night , he landed upon Gardner 's island , and requested Mrs. Gardner to provide a supper for himself and his attendants . Knowing his desperate character , she dared not refuse , and fearing his displeasure , she took great pains , especially in roasting a pig . The pirate chief was so pleased with her culinary success , that , on going away , he presented her with a cradle blanket of gold cloth . On another occasion , also , when he landed at the island , he buried a small casket of gold , silver , and precious stones in presence of Mr. Gardner , but under the most solemn injunctions of secrecy . 187 Repairing soon afterward to Boston , where Lord Bellamont happened to be at the time , he was summoned before his lordship , and directed to give a report of his proceedings in the service of his company . Refusing to comply with this demand , he was arrested on the third of July , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have disclosed the fact of having buried the treasure at Gardner 's island , for the same was demanded by his lordship , and surrendered by Mr. Gardner . I have conversed with a gentleman who has seen the original receipt for the amount , with the different items of the deposit . The amount was by no means large , and affords evidence of no such mighty sweepings of the seas as have been told of in story and in song . Of gold , in coins , gold dust , and bars , there were seven hundred and fifty ounces . Of silver , five hundred and six ounces , and of precious stones about sixteen ounces . Lord Bellamont wrote home for a ship of war , to carry Kidd to England for trial . Th* Rochester ' was des patched upon that service , but being obliged to put back , a general suspicion prevailed in England that there was collusion between the pirates and the ministers , and , in fact , that they dared not bring the sea robber home for trial , lest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble associates in the enterprise were confederates in the piracies also . Party spirit ran high , and the opponents of the ministers brought a resolution into the House of Commons for excluding from place all the partners of Kidd in the original enterprise . And although this resolution was voted down , yet the Tories contrived afterward to impeach the Whig lords upon the charge of having been concerned with Kidd . But the articles were not sustained . Meanwhile Kidd had been taken to England , tried on an indictment for piracy and murder , and hung in chains , with six of his crew . In addition to the indictment for piracy , he was indicted // for the murder of one of his own subordinate officers , named Moore , whom he killed in a quarrel , by striking him over the head with a bucket . He was convicted upon both charges , but protested to the last that he was the victim of conspiracy and perjury . But , after all , suspicions were entertained by the public that the execution was a sham-that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to avoid disclosures , a man of straw was hung in his place . In proof of this assertion , it was gravely and strongly alleged that Kidd had been seen alive and well , many years *afterward , by those who could not be mistaken as to his identity . I think there is no doubt , however , of his having been honestly hung at Execution Dock , ' in London , on the 12th of May , 1701 . Yet , when compared with the nobler villains , Lolonois and Morgan , Kidd must have been a pirate upon an insignificant scale  --  a mere bottle imp by the side of Satan , as portrayed in stupendous grandeur by Milton I , 1 UNDER THE PALMETTO . Ox Saturday , the 31st of January , 1863 , the steamer ? 5* R. Spaulding , ' flagship of General Foster 's fl&amp;et , left the harbor of Morehead City , N.

Only those who have witnessed such scenes can realize the eager interest and intense excitement which attend the preparation for a naval expedition .

The successes of Burnside , Du Pont , and Farragut were fresh in memory , and why should not we win new laurels for the old flag , and place our eommander ' * name high on the list of fame ? And so , with feelings of pride and expectation , we gladly saw the shores of North Carolina with their forests of pines recede from sight , as , under a cloud ! ess sky and over a waveless sea , we glided on toward the hated mother State of the rebellion .
