txt Our dispatches from the West are of a most startling character . Gen. BRAGG is said ; to have escaped from Gen. BUELL , and to be marching rapidly on Louisville , Ky. , which city is naturally thrown into a tremendous excitement . And this excitement , instead of being confined to the populace , who are mostly non-combatants , and chiefly interested in saving their lives and property if the city is attacked , has seized upon the military commandant , Brig. - Gen . NELSON , and caused him to commit the most plarenzied and absurd actions . He has issued an order directing the women and children of Louisville to bP prepared to leave the city without delay . And to add to the confusion and alarm which such an order must bring upon a city of 70,000 inhabitants , aroused to a sudden danger , he instantly adds that Jefferson ferry ( the only ferry by which the people could escape ) is to be used " exclusively for military purposes . " We submit that a proceeding so cruel and irrational was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place , it does not appear inconteetibly that BRAGG is marching on Louisville . If it does , then it appears , on the same authority , that BUELL is only some hours ( the dispatch says " several hours " ) behind . Could not Gen. NELSON have sent out and felled trees across the roads ? it is a heavily wooded country the city is approached through  --  and obstructed BRAGG 'S approach for " several hours ? " Or , if lie had not coolness , sagacity and courage enough for this , need he clear out all the women and children from Louisville , SO as to have it ready for BRAGG to batter down as soon as he reached it ? All civilized military men who mean to assault a town give the women and children notice and time to get away . BRAGG would have done the same ; he would have been compelled to do the same , for he has Kentuckians in his army whose families are in Louisville . And this delay would have come out of BRAGG 'S time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The time allowed to the women and children to leave a city like Louisville could hardly have been less than forty-eight hours , considering the necessity and the means of their exit across the Ohio River . And all this delay would have served Buell in his race to oucrtakc Bragg ; and would have enabled him to attack BRAGG before he could have opened fire in Louisville . But no ! Our opaque , dense-headed madmen of military leaders , must forget all duty to delay BRAGG 'S approach if he is coming ; must terrify- the entire population  --  men who are to fight as well as their families who are to flee  --  with visions of shot and shell raining on their roofs ; must close to the latter the only means of quick escape from supposed danger ; and all , to have the city ready fur 13aario'e batteries to play upon it without any violence to the rules of civilized war and without hindrance from the men in his army who would otherwise have revolted at his cruelty ! What may we not expect when fools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States and nations in their hands ?
