J7*ORTY years of " evangelism " have made the name of Elder 12 Knapp somewhat familiar to the American religions world , and especially to the Baptist denomination , to which he belongs . During twoscore years he has literally " stumped " the whole North , from the St. Lawrence down to Richmond and Louisville , and from Massachusetts to California , where now , a veteran of seventy , he charges against " the strongholds of infidelity " with all the lire of youth . It is fair to say , however , that even with his own sect , it is a disputed point whether this eccentric evangelist employs the best method of presenting religion to his fellow-men . He has met warm support , but also determined opposition , from his brethren , and perhaps not even his admirers would like to call him a representative clergyman . As an evangelist , however-whose mission is to move from point to point and excite religious revivals-Elder Knapp is emphatically a representative man . Twenty years ago , he stirred up in many Atlantic coastwise cities-Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richmond  --  and in many interior towns , religious excitements of a sort almost unparalleled in America ; in several places he was attacked by mobs . Times have changed now , and no itinerant would be likely to arouse to-day either the fervor or the opposition he thea succeeded in evoking . The Elder himself has subsided into comparative obscurity , and , no longer the figure or power he was , has restlessly , in his old age , gone to California , to seek " fresh fields and pastures new . " In the leisure of his later and quieter preaching tours , the Elder pens and publishes * his autobiography . Autobiographies are of those books whereof great numbers should be written , and , now and then , though rarely , one published . However , the pioneer in any illustrious enterprise is likely to be of the few whose self-written records are entitled to public perusal : his story will be fresh , as he treads fields untrodden ; and probably full of incident , because a record of obstacles . Elder Knapp may at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who performs the friendly task of editing him and toning him down , declares that , till the Elder 's time , " the institution of protracted meetings was comparatively unknown , " and that " posterity will speak of him as the pioneer and champion of modern evangelism . " He further tells us // that the Elder " challenged the conscientious scruples of nearly all the leaders in that portion of the American Zion to which he belonged . " He was , in short , the first of professional revivalists , and the originator of " protracted meetings " in the denomination of Baptists . As to the opposition he met , the Elder quaintly says of most of his brethren , " they exercised themselves mainly iii finding fault with those who had a mind to work ' for God , and made me think of a goose who would sit all Summer on a few round stones , hiss off any who might propose to supply her with eggs , and finally get up without hatching a gosling . " The Elder has something to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversions-100 , 200 , 500 in a week ; 1,000 , 2,000 , 5,000 in a town . Wherever he went , he had converts at once by the hundreds ; if only by the tens or the scores , he regarde ditas a relative waste of labor . Up to July , 1867 , he had held about 150 " protracted meetings* " i. e. , revivals ; he had preached about 1,360 sermons , beside prayers made , of which no reckoning iskept . And as to his total conversions , he says : " For a time , I endeavored to keep an approximate account of the persons who professed conversion in my meetings , but after my reckonings took in more than ioo , ooo , I gave up the attempt . " One hundred thousandand then gave up the tally ! These are enormous figures . But they are not impossible . Elder Knapp is the most rapid of all revivalists , and has had forty years of constant work . lie tells us , with some humor , how , in New York , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new members convene in the vestry below , while the revival was going on above , and " as fast as they found peace in believing , I sent them below to present themselves to the church . " And thus , in one and the same evening , a person might be a scoffer , then convicted , converted , examined and received as a member of the church . " Sometimes thirty or forty would present themselves of an evenino " he tells us , and they " took me to task for sending the converts faster than the church could receive them . " We can hardly doubt the Elder , therefore , when , under the h*ad of " numl ) er of conversions , " he says that , after counting about 100,000 , he " abandoned the effort to reckon numbers more than twenty years ago . " And he adds , " I found the attempt to number Israel an impossibility , and suspected that it might be a sin . I must , therefore , refer the answer to this inquiry to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truthfully remarks , " will be more accurate than my most careful endeavors could possibly make it . " Touching the number of immersions he administered , he tells us that he has only baptized about 5,000 persons . But his energy was not at fault here-he chose to allow the pastors of churches , in gen // eral , to administer the ordinance . He says , in one place , in speaking of his revival in Orleans , Jefferson County , N. Y. , in 1832 : " At the close of this meeting , I baptized sixty persons in thirty minutes . " But this is going too far . To anybody at all familiar with the ceremony , with its inevitable losses of time in its various parts , this feat , on which the Elder plumes himself seems to partake rather of indecorous haste , than to be cause of congratulation . There is no need of such rapidity . Less criticism , however , may be passed on another interesting anecdote the Elder relates of himself of the same order : " On one occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Potomac , and , locking arms , they walked with me abreast down into the water . On reaching suitable depth , I commenced baptizing them ; and , each one standing in the water till all had been buried with Christ , ' we then locked arms again and returned to the shore . " But we must now give more particular attention to the Elder 's account of the way he himself embraced Christianity , and began his ministerial labors . He was born in 1799 , in Otsego County , New York , of Episcopal parents , who taught him the Creed and Catechism from infancy . " From the first of my remembrance , " he says , " I bad seasons of secret prayer , and of deep anxiety about the future welfare of my soul ; " but at the age of seventeen lie " saw the emptiness and vanity of all terrestrial enjoyments , " and " betook himself to the Bible , hymn-book , prayer , and the house of God . " One particular day , he went into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my soul , " and there prayed and read and read and prayed . " The result was all that *e had desired . I felt my vileness ; all my sins rose before me like mountains . I thought I h*&amp; prayed , read the Bible , attended meetings , and done all that was in my powex to do ; and yet I seemed to grow worse and worse , and more and more des*h*able in the sight of God . I saw clearly the righteousness of God in sendlag *ie to the lowest hell . At this moment the earth seemed to open beneath me , and hell appeared to be yawning for my reception . I closed my eyes fully expe'Jii g to open them no more until I opened them in hell , and lifted them up with the rich man in torment . But , to the joy and rapture of my soul , after a - shoi*t space of time passed in this condition , my load of guilt was gone . I rose up quickly , turned my eyes toward heaven , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception . My soul leaped within me , and I broke forth into singing praises to the blessed Saviour . About *lhis time , there was a revival among the Baptists near by , and what with the immersions he then witnessed and his own Biblical resear*ohes , he saw clearly that his " having been sprinkled in infancy would not answer the commands of God , to believe and be baptized7 ' He " continued to enjoy the presence of Jesus for some length . of time , say some ten or twelve months . But , beginning *about then to *enter into the ranks of young company , and joining // heartily in many of their amusements , " he experienced " a serious decline in spirituality . " Within a few months he " often delivered orations and made speeches concerning religion for sport . " In the same paragraph , however , the Elder says : " But I never could , even in my most distant wanderings , hear religion ridiculed without great pain . " This part of the autobiography the editor should revise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of nineteen he joined a Baptist church . The Elder now bent himself manfully to get enough education to preach . Little was required , and , by dint of hard labor and rigid economy-chopping wood , doing chores , going in shirt sleeves to save the coat , teaching school , etc. - he found himself at a Theological Institute at Hamilton , in 1822 , and in the pulpit of a Baptist church three years later . For the first eight years thereafter , the Elder farmed on week days and preached on Sundays ; at the end of that time , he says , " I looked upon the past eight years of my ministry as comparatively wasted . I felt that I had turned aside for filthy lucre . " I-Ic had " baptized about two hundred and sixty converts , " or an average of thirty-two a year . And , besides , he adds , " the church being small and poor , they failed to give me enough for the current support of my family . " He reso'lved to sell his farm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was thought by some , " he says , " that not less than two thousand souls were converted during the first eighteen months " of his evangelizing ministry ; but with his fame began also his . lifelong troubles . " I was called on to encounter great opposition , alike from professed Christians and the avowed enemies of Christ ; ay , even from ministers of the gospel . My motives were impugned . I met with several severe losses , also , in pecuniary matters . it seemed as though all the devils in hell were let loose upon me . " It was at this time that he received confidence in a way which we should not like to describe except in his own language. : After spending one whole day in fasting and prayer , and continuing my fast till midnight , the place where I was staying was filled with the manifested glory of God . His presence appeared to me , not exactly in visible form , but as really to my recognition as though he had come in person , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou ever lacked a field in which to labor ? " I answered , " Not a day . " " Have I not sustained thee , and blessed thy labors ? " I answered , " Yea , Lord . " " Then learn that henceforth thou art not dependent on thy brethren , but on me . " . . . In this manifestation of God 's presence to me , he cast no reflections on those of my ministerial brethren who differed from me , but , in the most tender manner , bade me leave them to pursue their own way , and cleave only to him . One of the most striking features of the Elder 's story , as narrated by him , consists in its exemplifications of what to him and to many others appeared as special providences . He tells us that Pennyan , // N. Y. , was once " the seat of infidelity for that entire region , " and " I learned , after the danger had passed , that a drunken Universalist , armed with a knife and pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but God delivered me out of his hands by leading me to go to my lodgings by a different route each night , though , at the time , I did not recognize any particular reason for doing so . " In the same place another infidel " left the meetinghouse swearing that he would have nothing to do with religion . Shortly after he had reached home he was taken ill . His skin turned as yellow as saffron ; his tongue became so swollen that he could not speak a word , nor keep it within his mouth . On the second day after he was seized he died . " On one occasion , while baptizing some converts , Elder Knapp saw a young man perched up in a tree , looking on . " I prayed that God would speak to that Zaceheus , ' and make him come down . On the following Lord 's day he was baptized in the same place . " At one time , as he was preaching , a youth began to draw the Elder 's portrait on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his hand was seized with palsy , so that he was unable to lift it . lie came out for prayers , and was hopefully brought to Christ . " A company of infidels were chopping wood , and one was mimicking the Elder 's sermon , when " something seemed to speak to him in audible tones , saying , You wicked wretch ! His axe dropped from his hands , and he fell helpless to the ground . He was carried to his home , and Brother Eaton was sent for to pray for him . He became a penitent and pardoned man . " Again , the Elder speaks of a reformed drunkard who left his business , and spent all his time in the revival . One day his wife told him that there was nothing for dinner . He assured her that God would provide for those who were intent on doing his will . As he turned to leave , he espied a five-dollar bill which some one had thrust in under the door . On another occasion his wife reminded him that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a few minutes afterward a friend sent to the house money enough to meet the rent . " In this trustful way he worked all Winter . His daily wants were provided for , and he was busy in winning souls . " At Bennington , in 1836 , two youths took out the tongue of the church bell , as a joke . " Much prayer was offered " for them , says the Elder , " and I ventured to utter a prediction that within one year from that time the young men , who had thus attempted to silence the voice of God , would be in hell . In less than a year afterward they both died without hope . One of them arose from his bed in the night , and , opening a door in the dark , fell headlong and broke his neck . " Iu this case , however , onr sym // pathies are less with the Elder than with those who offered the " much prayer . " At Yale College , the annual ball of the junior class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroused in passing through New Haven . However , " it was said by one of them that the ball should come off in spite of Knapp , the devil , or the Almighty ! ' But one of the managers was taken sick suddenly , and died . On the day appointed for the ball his schoolmates followed him to the grave . " An " infidel , " riding by the Elder 's meeting in Lowell , " seemed to hear a voice saying to him , Behold how these Christians love one another ! ' He trembled , and , had he not held on to his horse 's mane , he would have fallen to the ground . " He was converted . At the same meeting the Elder asked all who were " willing to live and die by Universalism " to rise . One woman arose ; " but a sense of her awful temerity overwhelmed her . She sank down on her seat , convicted by the Spirit of God . " Shortly afterward she was converted . A man who once collected a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " on his way was taken sick ; lie lingered a short time , and on the day appointed for his wedding he was a corpse . " In Erie , in 1847 , a Universalist minister arose and disputed some of the Elder 's doctrines . The latter dropped on his knees , and prayed that " if this servant of the devil was within the reach of mercy , he might be converted on the spot ; but if he was never to be converted , that his mouth might be closed , so that he would not be able to lead others down to hell . " The Elder adds that this minister lost his power of speech that very night , could only speak just above a whisper , and that " the Universalists sought to keep these facts from the knowledge of the community . " H* adds that " he has remained speechless for at least fifteen years . I have recently heard that his power of speech is somewhat improving . " And we are referred , in fine , for corroboration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , the bass-viol player at the church left it , after the opening music , " to perform on the fiddle at a ball . Much prayer was offered . " The musician , cute ring the ball-room , informed the manager that Elder Knapp had just been praying that " the right arm of the fiddler might be palsied , and that the music might sound like the shrieks and groans of the damned in the vaults of hell . " The fiddler took his stand ; but before the first set was half through , was seized with a tremor , and his arm fell palsied by his side . The music ceased , and , turning to the manager , he exclaimed , " I am under conviction . My restora tion doctrines will not serve me . I am resolved to seek the salvation of my soul , and I advise you all to do the same . " The ball was broken up . The fiddler and the manager came directly // over to the church . The musician made known his case , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cited from the Elder 's story . Some of them appear rather too " pat , " and in some , doubtless , the interpretation of the incident rather than the incident is remarkable . In his preaching " campaigns " - for such a word is appropriate to the warfare he waged  --  the Elder was much aided by a ready wit , a great skill at repartee , and a natural tact at humor in illus. tration , which served him many a good turn , and always made his sermons lively . And , by the way , there is an anecdote on this point not generally known , and which the Elder does not tell , but for whose authenticity we can ourselves vouch . A brother clergyman , who also liked popularity , once asked him , in Boston , in a tone of fraternal suggestion , whether it would not be better if he should " leave more of the Knapp out of his sermons , and put in more of Christ . " " Why , " instantly retorted the veteran Evangelist , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would be as threadbare as yours ! " The keenness of the repartee is so obvious that it is almost " gilding gold " to explain that there is also a pun in the reply , on the word nap . But to return to the autobiography . On one occasion , while holding a meeting in the Mulberry Street church , in New York , a young man , to raise a laugh , arose and asked prayers for the devil . " Brethren , " instantly responded the Elder from the pulpit , " this young man has asked you to pray for his father . " In his introduction , the Elder , alluding to his age , says , " On reflection , I could see that I was outliving my generation , and that another had already risen , which knew not Jacob . ' " The reader may , perhaps , remember Lowell 's " Elder Joash Q. Balcom , 2d , " who is unhappily only outlined for posterity , but whose portrait , if fully drawn , might marvellously resemble that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the Rev. Shearjashub Scrimgour , he will recall also Parson Wilbur 's sermon against their opinions , upon the text ( ileb. xiii. , 9 ) , " Be not carried about with diz'er8 and strange doctrines . " In one Southern city it was expected the mob would attack the Elder for his habit of preaching anti-slavery wherever there were any pro-slavery people . A number of ministers were in the pulpit when he entered the church , " and two of them , " he says , " were skulking down behind the desk lest they should be hurt by any missiles that might be sent at me . I gave one of them a jog , and told him to sit up , for he had not religion enough to make him worthy of martyrdom yet . " In speaking of the advice which the physicians gave him to abstain from preaching , or at least from shouting , on account of a serious affection of the throat , he dryly says he could not consent , and so " continued to preach fifteen ser // ELDER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by praying , preaching , and drinking freely of cold water , my complaint was broken up . " Once , in hannibal Centre , N. Y. ( by-the-way , " Hannibal Centre " is good ) , the wood in the church stove would not burn , and the congregation " was small , and their hearts as cold as the weather . After a few of them had prayed as much as they could , I rose up and remarked that such prayers as these will freeze us all to death . ' " This , we may add , was the place of which the Elder remarks , " I pitched into Universalism as usual . Two of the leading members of that sect came in to take notes for their newspaper . The power of God confounded his enemies . Both of these reporters were convertefh " This , however , was after both the literal and the metaphorical fire burned more brightly . Of the Congregationalists in Rutland , he says " they were old fogies . ' They would invite neither Finney nor Burchard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during this meeting . They did not believe in young converts speaking or praying , for fear they might become proud . The old fogies ' went poking along like an old lazy yoke of oxen , keeping a little ahead of the converts , and hooking them back lest they should go too fast . " The Elder was impatient of honorary titles for clergymen . He speaks , as has been seen , of a brother clergyman , as Finney , and invariably refers to hiiuself* , if possible , as plain " Knapp . " In one of his sermons he asks , " Who ever heard of Rev. Mr. Paul , D. D. ? or of the Right Rev. Simon Peter , D. D. ? " And he adds , with some pungency : In numerous cases the very association of this title with certain names involuntarily excites the mental inquiry , How did they get it ? In some cases ministers of the Ciospel have fallen so low as to solicit the board of a college to bestow on them the title . In other cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter . Nor will it be denied that in many cases the college board have as much regard to pecuniary returns as they do to the deservedness of the candidate . There are many D. D 's in modern times who can not preach a sermon without murdering the Queen 's English. , and whose chief distinction in the ministry is their want of success in winning souls . It is in his sermons , however , that eccentricity of expression is chiefly to be found . One series of these claims to be a complete statement of what goes to producing a revival of religion , and the one especially on " How to Get Up a Revival , " is as precise and definite in its " receipts , " if we may so speak-we had almost said , as Professor Blot 's cook-book . But there is an obvious sincerity in all his eccentricity . He declares " those who have imagined that I have depended for effect on eccentricities of speech , or tactics of management , have utterly misapprehended me , and done me great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's truth . " And , ludicrous as are sonic of his sensational sentences , yet // there is some cohesion in their logic ( if the premises be granted ) , and a nervous English in their phraseology , which are surely better than refined twaddle with neither ideas nor racy English to recommend it . At all events , those who have ever heard the man himself will like to read his discourses . The slap-dash style of discourse and doctrine of this Baptist Boanerges , undoubtedly does lose something in type , lacking there the visage and voice the extempore wit , the up-country enunciation , which made the very word " Knapp " different in the pulpit from its look on the page . A friendly hand ( perhaps his own ) seems to have pared down certain telling points in the famous " Ox Sermon , " " TI en Sermon , " " Devil Sermon , " and some others , as originally delivered ; and we miss in print some recurrences of the word h-ll , d-n , and so forth , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mentioned " to ears polite , " but with which the Elder was not ashamed to plenteously besprinkle his sermons . And , after all , as to the matter of extravagance , we can hardly see much to choose , as to that particular quality , between his sensational , and , so to speak , " New York Herald " style of go-aheadativeness in religion , and the dense ignorance and crass stupidity of those against whom his career was a re-action . He says " Believing that the salvation of the elect was determined by an eternal purpose , irrespective of agencies , our fathers taught that an attempt to instruct an inquirer , or plead with an impenitent person , would be a presumptuous interference with the inscrutable purposes of God . Parents studiously avoided religious conversation with their children ; family prayer was rarely observed . In many instances the logic of the creed made parents doubt the propriety of praying for the conversion of their children , while the idea of teaching an unregenerate child to pray for himself was deemed an approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Delaware , and Maryland . " However , when the Elder first began his work , he preached for all " evangelical " denominations , " leaving , " as he snys , " the division of the spoils with the pastors and churches after I had gone . " But this method had " serious evils . In the first place , the different churches were almost always sure to quarrel about their respective share of the converts . This contention would stop the revival , the wicked would triumph , and devils hold a jubilee in helL " Hence he afterward confined his attention mainly to Baptist churches . But he met opposition . One class of his brother clergymen , he says , " opposed me from jealousy , " feeling " their own want of pulpit power . " Others " disliked my peculiar methods // of presenting the gospel , " thinking it better to " say but little about total depravity and hell torments , and not to make too free a use of the name of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But , the Elder goes on , " I can only say that God had cast me in a different mould , and called me to do a work which men of that plastic type would not be adapted to perform . " The Elder , in truth , evidently relished opposition , and regarded a preaching tour as a kind of pitched battle with all the powers of darkness . He tells , with evident gusto , a prediction made to some Universalists by a " shrewd infidel , " on his entering Concord , that " Knapp would whip them all out " as to success . In his sermon on " How to Get Up a Revival , " he says you must " pour in God 's truth , hand over hand , thundering out hell and damnation " - we leave the italics as we find them . This was the method he employed in practice . He relates with pleasure that a Salem Universalist who had come to Boston to hear him preach , went home and told his friends that " Knapp was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " here , however , is perhaps the best illustration of the kind of match-game , as it were , which the revival seemed to him Whenever a professed Universalist was converted , the other Universalists were accustomed to say that he was not a real Universalist . Finally , the brethren challenged the ; m to select out one whom they would acknowledge to be sound in their faith . They made choice of one , and instantly the brethren united in making him a subject of special prayer to God . The remit was that he , too , came out and renounced Universalism , and gave his heart to God . When he was disposed to remove his family to a permanent home , " after praying and reflecting for some time on the subject , " he selected Hamilton , N. Y. One of his main reasons was characteristic . " Hamilton was the seat of a strong prejudice against me , and one which , unless dissipated , would seriously affect the after ministry of the young men who would go forth from the Theological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always took pains to denounce gambling , intemperance , and slavery precisely where that denunciation was least relished . In Rochester he spoke of the gambling in the town , and one of the leading gamblers rose , and , in distinct tones , exclaimed , " That is a d-d lie . " The Elder promptly replied , " If you had kept still , sir , we should not have known that you belonged to the gang ; a hit bird always flutters . " It must not be imagined , however , that when the Elder speaks of " gamblers , " " drunkards , " " infidels , " and " scoffers , " in his anecdotes and sermons , that he always employs these terms in their accepted signification . He often means simply men who now and then play a game at billiards , or drink a glass of wine , or do not // ELDER KNAPP , THE REVIVALIST . hold the religious opinions that he does , or are amused with his eccentricities . So , in his stories of " infidels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons of undecided religious convictions . A man of the Elder 's stamp and style , of course , was continually the mark for mobs . In Auburn " the wicked organized their forces , " and threatened to ride him on a rail . In Turin ( America ) the Elder told a story about the son of a Universalist widow of that town , the purport of which was that the boy stole money and then denied it , but , on being found out , replied : " I do n't care if I do lie and steal ; there is no hell ; my mother told me so . " This was near exposing him to an action for slander , He expected to be arrested in meeting , but he preached as usual . If I ever felt that I stood between the living and the dead , I felt so that night . Some sank down in their seats , helpless , before I had finished my sermon . Not a dog moved his tongue . We spent a season in prayer , and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get home without assistance . Colonel F. , a dry goods merchant , could not stand on his feet ; several of the brethren helped him to his house , and staid with him all night . He was brought into light and liberty before morning . Strange to say , his wife continued hardened . . . . The lawyer who offered to carry on the suit was among the converts . A confirmed Universalist , who had subscribed five dollars toward the suit , and who laid his hand on the Bible , and swore that he would cowhide any man who should darken his door to talk with him or his family on the subject of religion , was made a signal trophy of redeeming grace . In Richmond they made it so hot for him that he had to leave , and " we shook the dust of the city from off our feet as a witness against them . " In Providence he told a story , on incorrect information from " a good brother , " about a woman of that city , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair was settled by paying a hundred dollars . The Elder says that he has since regretted that he gave bail , and that " it would certainly have been more apostolic to have gone to jail . " In Rochester he attacked the " gamblers " and " Universalists " in such terms that a mob gathered to oppose him . Here is the account of the way he got rid of them : One company was stationed in a back yard , armed with stones . At three minutes before eight o'clock a stone came whizzing through the window toward the pulpit . Simultaneously with its passage came a flash of lightning , followed by a peal of thunder ( this was in the month of February , and snow was on the ground ) . In about a minute afterward another stone came through the window , accompanied by another flash of lightning , and followed by a still louder clap of thunder . Scarcely had another minute elapsed before another stone entered the building , when instantly the heavens pealed out its thunder more terribly than before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the earth trembled beneath their feet . Fear seized hold on the ungodly crew , and , dropping their missiles , they hastened from the spot , as if they would hide themselves from the presence of God , lest he should " cut them off with a stroke . " // This being perfect in itself ; the Elder does not improve the story by ' frankly relating that the same infidels so far recovered their spirits as to stone the house of Deacon Sage , where the Elder lodged , the same night , arranged to escort him out of town to the tune of " The Rogue 's March " next day , and actually procured his arrest . On the way to the sheriff 's office he " took occasion to warn the sheriff of the value of his ( the sheriff 's ) soul , " and when the office was reached , the Elder suggested that , , before they proceeded any further they had " better spend a season in prayer . I fell on my knees , and poured out my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The room was full of people . " In Baltimore he had hardly less trouble fi-oni " the mob . " In New Haven he preached against the billiard saloon which some of the students patronized , and these latter made quite a row in the church , on one occasion having a scuffle with " the tithing-men . " The Elder says that , thirty-eight students " entered into a solemn covenant that they would break up the meeting at the risk of their lives , " and appeared in church " with clubs , bowie-knives , and other instruments of death , " avowing " their purpose to kill inc . " But the Elder 's expressions need not always be taken aupied de la lettre . However , one " mob " in the church-one of whose members projected a missile at the Elder-was broken up in this way . A brother had just read a letter which " called me the prince of liars , ' because I had related publicly how God had broken up the mob in Rochester by sending thunder and lightning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Rochester , who was providentially present , rose and corroborated my statement . No sooner had silence been regained than a flash of terrific lightning blazed through the house , followed by awful peals of thunder and torrents of rain . " Soon after , " two of the gang were converted . " In Boston a vast mob gathered in Bowdoin Square , in front of the church where the Elder preached , threatening him . Here there were more noteworthy things in the Elder 's experience . One of Paine 's disciples sat up all night preparing clubs with which to break my head , but , coming in to hear me , God broke his heart . The chief officer who called out the Lancers to quell the riot and disperse the mob , confessed that his heart was in sympathy with the mob . He was convicted of his sins . The man who drew the plan of the house , and who was mingling sympathizingly with the mob , suddenly broke away from them , came into the prayer-meeting , and begged the prayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article without quoting many passages we had marked for citation in the Elder 's sermons-some for humor , some for strength , some for truth , some for absurdity . There are many other curious passages , too , in the course of the main narrative , to which we might refer . In one case , he defends the idea // that on the day of Pentecost the " 3,000 " converts could have been baptized , by saying " I beg my dear readers to bear in mind that there were present on this occasion at least eleven apostles , and these alone could have immersed the whole of them in less than three hours . I have myself immersed in the Crooked Lake , N. Y. , sixty persons in twenty-eight minutes , by the watch , and that , too , without undue haste . " In his " Ox Sermon , " he vividly speaks of the result when " a long-horned deacon gets into the minister 's stall , and commences goring him ; others get into the deacon 's stalls , and all is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives five distinct reasons why not only " all novels , " but " all light reading " should be shunned . TIe takes strong ground ( stronger than Mr. Parton 's ) against tobacco , declaring it " was made to kill insects , not human beings . There is none of the brute creation that will eat it , except the long-haired goat , that climbs the side of the mountains of the East . " He claims , by converting Mitchell , in Baltimore , to have started the great Washingtonian temperance reform . " If it had not been for that old rum-seller damning Knapp , and cursing the Baptists , that great Washingtonian reformation would never have commenced , so far as we can see ; and if so much good could be brought about by their heaping their anathemas upon your unworthy servant , I say , let them curse . " He speaks of a " pork-shop " used for an inquiry-meeting , and says " the ungodly called it the finishing-off-room ! ' " Unless the Elder had thought there was some humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetuated it , so many years after it had probably been forgotten . TIe refers with contempt to those whose " religion is a white-gloved religion . It can attend sociables , donation and surprise parties , and enjoy a good religious time generally , in which they can outdo the world , and keep close upon the heels of the devil . " He describes a Presbyterian minister , a co- worker , of whom it was feared that his reason would be destroyed , and who " sometimes would preach when bordering on the verge of insanity , " so that , says the Elder , " never did I hear from mortal lips the realities of eternal truth so solemnly portrayed . " But the Elder never lost reason or health . His vigorous frame was equal to what must have been amazing labors . For aught we know , many years of toil and trophies remain to him , and newer and fuller editions of his Autobiography .                    @
