txt In the House of Lords on the 10th , the Earl of Derby said , there is another question which I should like to put to the noble Earl , but , as I have given him so notice , I will eitheetake his answer now , or rePeat my question on Thursday . The noble Earl has laid various papers on the table of the House , and among others , the correspondence with the Government of the Federal States of America on the subject of the Alabama . I have seen elsewhere that a considerable amount of correspondence has taken place upon /another subject  --  namely , the remonstrances made as to injuries apprehended or sustained by American commerce from vessels salting from British ports . I wish to know whether the Government are prepared to lay upon the table that correspondence as well as the dispatches relating to the Alabama ; and , further , whether they are prepared to produce any correspondence containing representations on the part of the Government of the apparent violation of the law by American cruisers in enforcing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions which have been come to in the prize courts of the United States . Beat Ittisszei , ? I can answer that question better on Thursday ; but if the noble Earl refers to any discussions with the American Government about the iron  --  clads at Birkenhead , I can only say that as that natter is about to be brought before a court of law , I shall object to produce that correspondence . As the noblelEarithas raised that question , I may say that on the first night of the session he referred to a dispatch of the Secretary of State , Mr. SEWARD , and expressed a hope that I had answered that dispatch in becoming terms . Now , at the moment I did not remember having seen any such dispatch , and I find since that it was R dispatch written by Mr. SEWARD to Mr. ADAMS , but Mr. ADAMS never thought proper to lay that dispatch before me , hear , hear , and laughter ; and therefore I was spared the difficulty and the pain of giving an appropriate answer to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Derby ? I esume that it has now been laid before the noble Earl , because I see that reference is made by Mr. ADAMS to the noble Earl as having received toward the latter end of August an answer to several dispatches , among which he includes the dispatch of July 11. to which I referred . He could hardly have received such an answer if the dispatch had not been presented . Earl RUSSELL.  - -  I certainly do not find among the papers the dispatch of July 11 , and Mr. ADAMS informed me expressly that he did not hand it to me . That being so , I should not do so useless a thing as endeavor to get up a wrangle with Mr. ADAMS on a dispatch which was never presented . " Hear , hear , " and laughter . The Earl of Derby. ? The whole correspondence appears to have been laid before Congress . In the House of Commons on the 9th , Mr. PEACOCHE asked what course the Government intended to take in reference to the correspondence with the United States Government respecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted to Congress ? Mr , LAYARD said it was not desirable to lay on the table any correspondence in reference to the Alexandra , as that case was undergoing judicial investigation . He had no objection to produce the papers in reference to the Alabama . Mr. LAYARD also . in response to Sir H. CAIRNS and Lord it . CECIL . said that no dispatch had been received from Mr , Szweep , stating that the American Government would hold England responsible for the depredations of the A tabama , nor had any verbal corn munication to that effect been made by Mr. ADAMS . In the House of Comb : tons on the 10th , Mr. PEACocas ask- ? d the Under Secretary of State for Foreigh Affairs whether the Government would lay upon the table of the House copies of their correspondence with the Government of the United States , and more especially that portion of it relating to the case of the Alexandra , and the claim by the United States Government for compensation for the losses inflicted by the Alabama and other Confederate crullers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular to ' present tapers referring to a case which was still under the consideration of our courts . The papers relating to the Alabama had already been presluced . If any others had been received since , he was not aware that there would be any objection to lay them upon the table . Mr. PEAEOCRE asked the honorable gentleman whether he would lay on the table the answer of tier Majesty 's Government to the dispatch of Mr. SEW . MID relating to the seizure of the Alexandra , which Lad already appeared in the newspapers . Mr. LAYARD said that he was advised that it would not he right to produce any papers relating to a case which was still under judicial inquiry . ? Oh , oh ! " I THE DINO-GERMAN WAR . Lord It . CECIL asked what steps Government had taken w , th respect to the proclamation of the Duke of Augustenburg in Schleswig under the protection of the Prussian troops ; and also , whether it was true that the Prussian Government had intimated that the outbreak of hostilities had put art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Government had remontrated with Austria and Prussia on the steps taken in Schleswig and Holstein to proclaim , under the protection of Prussian troops , the Duke of Augustenbu re , such a proceeding being contrary to good faith , and the admission that they were bound under the treaty of 1e52 to acknowieage the King of Denmark as Sovereign over all the dominions of the late King . The Prussian Government replied that it disapproved of the proceedings in Schleswig , and orders would be sent to put a stop to them , but Holstein was occupied by the troops of the Diet . over which it had no control . With respect to the other question , the Prussian Government had made a positive declaration that it would respect the integrity of the Danish monarchy . The dispatch read by Earl RUSSELL the other night was not very clear ; but its conclusion was that , whatever contingencies might arise , the Great Powers should be consulted with respect to them . It was stated in Berlin that , if resistance led to a war , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a most preposterous doctrine , for any power had only to provoke a war to put on end to it . That was a doctrine which no , Poweiliteeineregitrd to its good faith would pretend . to maintain . Since the commencement of hostilities the Prussian Government had informed her Majesty 's Government that It would adhere to the Treaty of 1852 , and respect the integrity of the Danish monarchy . Lord MALMESBDRY put some questions as to thVi Schleswig-Holstein difficulty , and asserted that th Duke of Augustenburg and his son were bound in honor to adhere to the Treaty of 1852 . Earl Hessen contended that it was not in the power of Austria and Prussia , by an act of war , to abrogate the Treaty of London , to which so many Powers were parties ; but Austria and Prussia had given no guarantee that that treaty would be upheld . Earl DERBY trusted Government would continue to press for such a guarantee . Lord PALMERSTON said that Government dispatches contradicted the report of revolutionary riots at Copenhagen , owing to the Danish retreat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , and the police and military had to put down some street rioting . Lord PALMERSTON also  --  in reply to Mr. DISRAELI  --  gave similar views to those uttered by Earl RUSSELL in the Upper House , as to the inability of Austria and Prussia to abrogate the treaty of 1852 . AFFAIRS IN CHINA AND JAPAN . In the House of Commons . on the 8th , some inquiries were made as to affairs in China , the massacre at Foo Chow , &c.; Mr. LAYARD promised to produce papers on the subject shortly . Mr. BOSTON , on the 9th , moved his resolution de nouncing the destruction of Kagosima , Japan , and after a debate , in which Lord PALMERSTON defended the course adopted by Government and by Admiral KOPER. although be regretted the destruction of Kagosima , the resolution was lost by a vote of 164 to 85 . The Africa brought out intelligence that the Aleaandra case was taken up in the Exchequer Chambers on the 6th February , and that Sir Hum ' CAIRNS , who appeared for the defendants , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertain the appeal . The Judges deferred their decision until the 8th , when , by a majority of one in a court of seven Judges , they decided to dismiss the appeal on the ground of want of jurisdiction . The case will , therefore , be carried up to the House of Lords . CLAIMS FOR INDEMNITY , The Liverpool Post has a long article on the American demands for indemnity for the losses sustained by the Alabama , and says that Earl RUSSELL 'S attempt to stop the Alabama , although it failed , must be accepted as a fact that he considered her departure a violation of neutrality . It is happy , however , to believe that , if there should arise a dispute on the subject , it will be amicably settled . ANOTHER REBEL PIRATE . From the London Star , Feb . O. A dispatch from Bombay , received in Liverpool on Saturday , states that the ship East had arrived there , and reported being boarded by a Confederate bark on the 9th of October , in latitude 3 , N. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shells , solid shot , and bullets at the East , and brought her to .
