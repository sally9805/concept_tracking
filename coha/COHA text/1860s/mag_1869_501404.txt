ET me tell you how I found myself in a box , one summer 's night . It was not La watch-box , or a sentry-box , or a box at the opera , or indeed that metaphorical " pretty box " which the vulgar use to signify an unpleasant predicament , although , to be sure , my situation was for a time decidedly disagreeable . The box to which I refer was literally a box . It was six feet long , I should say , three feet wide and two feet and a half deep , and was made of rough pine . It was rather roomy , viewed as a box , but when one came to regard it as a place of confinement for a human being , the space within was certainly very limited . I was an undergraduate in those days , a Freshman , in point of fact , but it was toward the close of the last term of the year when this happened , and I already looked forward with fond anticipation to the time when I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell what college it was , for illiterate people bark enough already at institutions , of learning and the manners in vogue within their walls , and this story might be used as an argument against a liberal education . Besides , this happened ages ago-it seems a thousand years to me , I have since passed through so many adventures  --  and no such thing could possibly occur in these times , when public opinion and the college government have changed so much for the better , and when , I am told , all the young men go to bed regularly at ten o'clock , and take long walks before breakfast , if the weather is not too boisterous . You may consider it to have been a fresh-water or a salt-water college , as you please-I use Dr. Holmes 's grand divisions  --  but at least you may believe , my dear sir , that it was not the university whence you graduated with so much honor ; and you , my dear madam , may rest assured that it was not that seat of learning where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosines , parabolas , Greek roots , and the like , with such praiseworthy diligence . I was a Freshman , in my last term , and my name , let us say , was Blaize McTrevor . Not that this was my real name , you know , for you will not find it , or indeed any name mentioned in these pages , in any triennial or biennial or annual catalogue of any university to whose records I have access . There are good reasons why I should keep my own counsel , in this particular at least , as von will presently understand , if you have not guessed already . Well then , Mr. Blaize McTrevor was a young man of nineteen , remarkably well-grown for his age , and , I dare say , rather conceited , although I only conclude this on general principles , and not because Mr. McTrevor was aware of any such failing at the time . Mr. McTrevor had been in society a year or two already , following the precocious fashion of young Americans ; and he was also in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlion , the youngest d*ughter of an eminent ship-chandler , and already a belle , although this was her first season . Mr. Mc Trevor 's passion did not manifest itself in effusions of poetry , the customary manner with young gentlemen in novels , when similarly afflicted . It showed itself mainly in the more reasonable way of dancing with her as often during the winter as she would permit , of running up a terrible bill at the livery stable , for horses to drive him from college to the paternal mansion for the purpose of calling upon the young lady , and of spending a large proportion of his allowance in adorning his manly person . // I was pretty seriously in love , I remember , and I think Miss Bessie did not altogether act the coquette when she encouraged me , but I could not be absolutely sure of that , because , you see , I was still a Freshman and had a name and fame yet to make in the world ; and honor forbade me to declare my passion . And young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when they have any to maintain . But I carried on a very serious flirtation with Miss Bessie that winter , and my friends used to rally me about it to my great inward satisfaction . Now , there was a rival in the way , a great two-fisted , broad- chested , big-limbed Senior , with red hair , commonly called Dick Brashford ; but although 4. he was a great man on the river , or in the cricket-field , he was clumsy enough in the drawing-room , and in the end I cut him out . There was no doubt about this , for as I afterward heard from Tom Eaton , who somehow knows everybody and everything , Dick 's friends joked him unmercifully about his being worsted by a Freshman . One occasion I remember in particular . It was the last party of the season , and Mrs. Bullfish gave it . I remember the salmon salad to this hourah , I had an appetite in those days ! At this party Dick Brashford could only get a single quadrille from Miss Bessie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally I led her off for the German from under his very nose . Dick turned as red as a piece of underdone roast beef ; and as I took my charmer away , I heard him mutter something about " the confounded impudence of these blank little Freshmen . " I dare say my own cheek burned at this , but I thought it wiser to take no notice of it afterward , for Dick Brashford was much too large for me to be able to pull his nose with impunity , and , besides , as I had won the prize , I could afford to overlook his ill-nature in some degree . Spring came , and Dick Brashford had his hair cropped . He was a rowing man and would have taken his place in the university crew only they could not make him train , and he was sent into the country nearly as often as once a year , by the college faculty , for some infraction of the laws . He was not a handsome man at any time , and it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not improve his personal appearance . He used to scowl at me now in the most ferocious way , whenever we met , but I only smiled at it . We had had a slight acquaintance , but we cut each other now by mutual consent , or at least I instinctively divined that he was no longer going to recognize me , and so I anticipated him . Yet I think , in spite of the savage disposition he showed toward me , he was not naturally ill-humored . He was liked in his class , and ill-temper and ni ( **ardhiness are two faults which young men in college will never tolerate in any person . Matters were going on in this way , when one evening I went to the theatre with Charley Steeple , of my class . I can not now recall the month , but I remember the weather was quite warm . After the performance was over , we had a little supper , as'was the fashion in those days with young gentlemen of the college who could afford it-I believe , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone out of vo*ue and v has long ago , ery properly , too . In our time , however , we thought it no harm , and I sul ) ped very satisfactorily at Charley 's expense . We had something light-frogs , perhaps , or a cold bird , with crisp , thin , fried potatoes , smoking hot , and possibly an exhilarating fluid , in a tall glass ; it did not so much matter to us young fellows what name it had , so long as it beaded and sparkled ; and it must be remembered that greenbacks had not been invented in those days , and the cost was comparatively little . Why , such a supper as we had that evening would cost to-day at the club  --  but never mind ; let us get on with our story . // XVe ate and drank with moderation , considering our appetites and our powers of digestion , but we lingered long at the table , and it was quite late when we reached home . I admit , to save discussion , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betimes next morning and go to prayers . I admit also that it would have been much better for us if we had kept in our rooms , burning the midnight oil in the pursuit of knowledge , but it must be remembered that this happened ages and ages ago , before young men had reformed their fashions , and , besides , we did not indulge in those amusements every night in the week . I used to be very fond of talking about Miss Bessie to Charley ; for he was my bosom friend , and knew all about my little affair of the heart from its earliest stage . I dare say I used to bore him extremely , too ; for when we stopped that evening at the door of the house where I lodged , and I wanted to stay there and continue my vaporing , in spite of the darkness , he broke in upon me very abruptly with the excuse that he should get into trouble if he cut any more prayers that term , and he wanted to get up the next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his own room , which was not very far away . I took out my latch-key and went slowly U* the stel ) 5 which led to the door of what we used , in Homeric language , to ' style Mrs. Quigmans " high-roofed abode . " I was in a very dreamy state , thinking of the last time I had seen Miss Bessie and of how pretty she looked when I had bid her farewell under the leafy porch of her father 's house-Mr . Carlion lived out of town , in an old-fashioned dwelling , which I feel bound to say was not in such good repair as the residence of a gentleman of his means ought to have been . Being in this absent frame of mintl , my surprise and dismay may be easily conceived when I suddenly became conscious of a man standing behind one of the larre pillars which ornamented the entrance to Mrs. Quigman 's mansion , and when the next moment this dark figure suddenly threw one arm around me and clapped a hand over my mouth , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " St , st ! " At this , another man ran across the street from where he had been concealed in the darkness , and in another moment they had me down in the street . Of course I struggled ; and , as I was pretty large and stout for my age , I flatter myself I gave them some trouble . Once I got the suffocating hand off my mouth and called out , as loud as I could scream , to Charley for help ; but the next moment they put something , which seemed to be a woollen comforter , over my face , and I was thenceforth dumb . I have read about the gag , called the " the pear of anguish , " in one of the novels of M. Dumas , and I should think it might be very disagreeable . judging from the inconvenience caused me by that woollen comforter . My arms were held tight , and when they caught one of my feet in a noose and rapidly ran a rope around that and its fellow , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was quite helpless . Once during this time I heard the sound of some one running toward me . Then there was the noise of a blow , and somebody said , " Take that , you little beggar , and mind your business next time . " I knew by this that Charley , who was a plucky little fellow , had heard me and run to my rescue , and had been brought to grief thereby . And all this time Mrs. Quigman 's household slept serenely . When they had me securely bound , one of my persecutors said , in a gruff whisper , " There , that will do , brother . Now for the wagon . " I was taken up and carried off rapidly-around the corner and down the lane which led by Mrs. Quigman 's house , as I guessed , although I could see nothing , for the woollen comforter was tied tight around my face . ln a half-minute they stopped , and the same voice said , " Wait , brother , whiie I get in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then into what I may say , without more ado , I subsequently found to be the box described in my opening paragraph . The cover was hastily put on , and the wagon started at a rapid pace . The feeling of being shut up in such a way was , in itself ; intensely disagree . able , and my face was muffled so closely that , in the confined air of the box , I could scarcely breathe . Add to this the fact that I was bound hand and foot , and could save myself very little from the jolts of the wagon , and it can be easily imagined how great was my discomfort . Fortunately , the road was tolerably smooth and I was kept in this way only a few minutes before the wagon stopped again . The cover of the box was lifted , and my muffler was pushed down from my eyes and nose so as to make respiration easier . " Cut off a piece , brother , " said a voice . " It will be safer ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In pursuit of this humane suggestion , a hasty hand cut off with a knife so much of the comforter as was likely to prevent my breathing , but still leaving my mouth carefully secured . The same hand gave the cords which held me a little twitch , to see that they were tight ; and then the cover was put on again , and I heard them screwing me in . It was a very unpleasant sound , I can assure you . There were six screws , two at the top , on each side of my head , two in the middle , and two at the bottom . I think I wept and groaned and raved for a few minutes , although , by reason of the muffler there could not have been any sounds very distinctly audible . On reflection , I do not feel ashamed that I gave way to a momentary panic . There is something frightful , to any person not utterly destitute of nerves , in the idea of being closed up in a tight box ; and here I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , besides being carried off to some unknown destination . I only felt this sensation of utter despair for a few moments . In the first place , a very dim light came in at some holes which had been bored in the cover just where it came over my head . That is , there was no light in the interior of the box , but I could presently make out the holes , with some difficulty , as I lay on my back . There were nine of them , and they were bored in the form of the Greek cross , with one hole in the centre and two to form each of the arms . With the help of them , I could breathe without very great difficulty , although the atmosphere was intolerably close and warm . The horse had been started at a walk , apparently , and the motion of the wagon was not very uncomfortable . I had thus a little time for reflection , and I presently became quite cool and collected , considering the peculiar position in which I found myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first that I was in the hands of some men of the older classes , who were out on what was called in those days a hazing expedition . I had no means of knowing who they were . The larger man , who had seized me first , had heavy black whiskers and , I judged , black hair , but these might be , and probably were , false ; and by his size and strength I thought it more than likely that he was Dick Brashford . He seemed also to be the leader of the expedition , and I knew of no man so likely to venture on such a bold scheme . Who the other was I could not guess , for he wore a half-mask ; but from their calling each other " brother " I imagined they belonged to some secret organization . Very likely this business of the box was only introduced to terrify me , and I knew they would not venture to do me any bodily injury . I had already experienced very rough usage at their hands ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for there had been no very notorious cases of hazing that year . One or two Freshmen had been made to rise at untimely hours of the night and attempt to construe a page of very crooked Greek , and several // windows had been broken ; but this was all that had happened , and nobody was much the worse for it the ne*ct morning . It was , nevertheless , true that I could not tell what was in store for me , and I made up my mind that , come what would , I would put on a bold face , and not allow Dick Brashford the small triumph of having frightened me , even with a whole club at his back . Of course , in my excitement these thoughts did not follow each other in regular sequence ; but this was the conclusion to which I presently came . There was room enough in the box for me to roll about in it , and I acted very early on a natural impulse to free myself from the ropes which held me . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were large , and in their hurry they had tied me tightly , indeed , but not very securely . By dint of struggling , twisting , and squirming , I presently worked the ropes which held my arms around so that I could get hold of the knots with my fingers . It was then only a work of time to untie them . When my arms were free I quickly tore off the stifling bandage from my mouth ; and in half a minute more I had my feet free , and stretched out my cramped limbs with a feeling of immense relief . When I had made a rough pillow of the ropes , with the comforter over them , my condition was greatly improved . It is true , the air was still very warm and close ; but I was astonished , and actually smiled at the thought , shut up and screwed in as I was , to find how comfortable a man might make himself in a box . All this time , I had paid very little heed to what was going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion of the *vagon , that we were going at a very slow l ) ace-probably at a walk . I tried to hear if my captors were talking , that I might catch and remember the tones of their voices . But they said very little , and then they spoke so low that , with the rattle of the vehicle , I could only understand now and then a word , in my confined position , and I could not in the least make out whether it was in bass , baritone or tenor . After a while , I gave up listening , and went to thinking very fast and hard . I thought of Genevra , of the Man in the Iron Mask , of that other prisoner , the walls of whose cell gradually closed in upon him day by day , until he was squeezed to death in their cold embrace . I believe I thought of every disagr*eable story of the kind that I had ever read or heard of and I should undoubtedly have given considerable time to reflection upon the singular profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invented it . Then I came near melting at the idea of Miss Bessie , and what she would think if she could see her gay cavalier , her admirer , her adorer , her slave-if she could look in upon him in his box ! I never realized until that miserable moment how much I loved the girl , and I made a vow that if I ever got away from the clutches of my persecutors alive , I would tell her of my passion . Yes , and I would marry her , undergraduate though I was , if it were only to spite Dick Brashford ! Finding this line of thought rather dangerous for the preservation of my courage , I fell to speculating as to where we were driving , at this slow pace . They might be going to leave me on the doorsteps of the President 's house , and were , perhaps , only driving me round and round to prolong my agony . They might be taking me to some remote and secret haunt , where they would propound to me all kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers . They might be intending to sacrifice me , in my youth and innocence , as a victim in their secret , midnight mummeries . They might be going to shave my head . There was a dim tradition of the past that such a cruel joke had been perpetrated in mine or some other college . They might be going to cut off my moustache  --  and here I felt of that " hairy nothing , " and was forced to // confess that even if they did , I should not be much disfigured , and that my friends would still be able to recognize me . Then I attempted to sleep , but it was useless , although I tried all the tricks which I had ever heard were used to bring drowsiness upon the wakeful . I repeated the alphabet back*vard , I counted up to seven or eight thousand , and then gave up in disgust and went to work on the lists of prepositions and words , which we used to learn out of the Latin grammar when I was a school boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . They are the only Latin which I can remember at this day , except that line of Horace , " atra cura " and the rest of it , which Mr. Thackeray is so persistently and perpetually quoting . It was of no use ; I could not sleep . I went back to my old occupation of thinking again , and I believe , at one time , I went through the record of my sins . Fortunately for me , I was then only a young man . Heaven help us ! How would some of us like to be shut up in a box now , I wonder , with such food for thought as that ? How long we went on in this way , I had no means of knowing , but the time seemed to me insufferably long . I afterward reckoned that it could not have been more than an hour or an hour and a half at the most , but I should not have been surprised at any moment to see daylight streaming in through the cracks of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising on my elbow and putting my ear to the br*thing holes in the box , I made out that my captors were disputing as to the road they ought to take . I lay down more puzzled than ever , for we could not be near the college and we could not be going to any established rendezvous . In either case , they would have known the way . I was not kept in suspense much longer , for , after going a short distance further , at a quick pace , we stopped , and the box , with myself inside , was taken out and carried some little distance . We appeared at first to be going through a door or a gateway , for the box struck against one of the posts-through a gate it must be , I thought , as I heard their feet crunching the gravel immediately afterward . They carried me a little way , and then set me down roughly . The next moment I heard a sound which I imagined to be a bell handle flying back , after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then , in the quiet that succeeded , I heard the wagon driven rapidly away . At the instant the truth flashed upon me . They had left me at the door of the Garlions / A cold sweat broke out at the thought . It was like some horrible nightmare , and I came near shrieking aloud . Pressing my knees up against the cover of my box , I strove with all my might to burst it off but my frantic efforts accomplished nothing . Pausing a moment to gather my strength for a new struggle , I heard a window open overhead , and a gruff voice exclaimed twice , " Who 's there ? " I held my breath to listen . The window was closed again , and all was still . I waited breathlessly , but nobody came to the door . Then I remembered that the trellis over the door would probably conceal my box from the owner of the voice . Evidently I had a short reprieve granted me . I tried again to see the hour ; but my watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough inside my prison . One thing was certain ; it could not be morning , for these men would undoubtedly take the middle of the night to play their trick , and would time their movements so as to reach home before daybreak . I must have at least two or three hours before I should be discovered . And then the servants would be up first , and perhaps I could bribe them to keep the matter secret . I wondered if Miss Bessie was an early riser , and whether she // was allowed to go out in the morning before the dew was off the grass . I wondered whether it was the custom in that household to have the doorsteps washed or swept before breakfast . These and other thoughts flashed through my mind as I again tried to force off the lid . I very soon made up my mind that the screws were too strong for me ; and although I had a sufficient knowledge of mechanics to understand the force of the knee lever , I could not arrange my fulcrum so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I had a pretty strong one in my pocket , and in another moni*nt I was whittling away at the breathing holes over my head . I suppose , in my anxiety , I was too eager , for I had accomplished very little beyond getting some saw-dust in my left eye , when snap went the blade at the point . The bit of steel fell on my cheek , and I was just congratulating myself that I had not put out the sight of my right eye , when a voice exclaimed , close to the breathing holes , " Sh . Are you there , old fellow ? " " Yes ! " I exclaimed . " Who is it ? Oh , for heaven 's sake , get me out of this ! " " Sh . Do n't make any noise . It 's I , Charley-Charley Steeple . I 've followed you all the way over . " It was like a new lease of life to me to hear Charley 's voice . I knew very well he would not leave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . " No ; I 'm all alone . " " What time is it ? " " Two o'clock . " Two o'clock ! I could scarcely believe him . But there was plenty of time before us . " By Jove , they have screwed you up tight , have n't they ? " " Yes . Have you got a screw-driver ? " " No ; and I do n't know where I can get one at this time of night . " " Wait half a minute , " I whispered . I had still the larger part of my knifeblade left , and I very soon enlarged one of the holes in my box sufficiently to pass the knife through to him . To my inexpressible joy , he whispered back to me that he could use it . The screws had not been pressed hard , either through haste or from the fear of making the box dangerously tight , and with carefulness and patience Charley succeeded in getting out four of them . Impatient at my restraint , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst off the cover with a great noise of splitting wood , and stood before him . Never was prisoner more thankful for being set free ; and I believe I actually fell into Charley 's arms and shed great tear-drops on his coat-collar . " Why could n't you wait , you beggar ? " he whispered , a little impatiently . " You will have the whole family up yet , with this racket . " We stood still , ready to run at the slightest sound ; but nobody came . " What shall we do with this box ? " I asked . " Shall we leave it ? " " Hum-I do n't know . It 's rather heavy to carry off . It seems to me there is a direction or inscription of some kind on the cover . " My curiosity was excited , and , regardless of Charley 's cautions , I stuck a wax taper on my match-box , and by its light we read the following words , printed in large coarse letters : " TNis little Freshman is respectfully presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And there followed , by way of signature , a rude delinetion of a skull and cross-bones. // This decided me on carrying the box away from Mr. Carlion 's premises . Even when empty it was rather heavy , and of a clumsy shape ; but we managed , without much difficulty , to get it out at the gate and across the street , and so up a little way to some vacant lots , where we left it . The cover we carried along . still further , and after 1 had scratched out two or three words with my knife , so as to make the inscription unintelligible , we tossed it over a fence into a gentlenuns garden . It went into a flower-bed , and I suspect it may have caused the owner of the premises some dissatisfaction the next morning . It appeared that the blow which Charley had got in trying to rescue me had stunned him for a moment ; but he had recovered in time to see them carrying me oft ; and then by going to the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them putting me into the wagon . XVhen they started he ran after them , determined to keep them in sight , if possible , and find out what they were going to do with me . Mrs. Quigman 's house , where I lodged , was on the outskirts of the town , and the wagon very soon reached what they considered a safe place to stop and screw on the cover of the box . This operation Charley had watched from behind a tree ; and when they started again he again followed them . They had walked the horse nearly all the rest of the way , undoubtedly , in order that they might reach Mr. Carlion 's in the quietest part of the night and Charley had no difficulty in keeping up with them , although he had several times thought that he was discovered . But he was as bright and quick as he was plucky , and , favored by the darkness , he had escaped . He was proposing to himself to enlist a watchman into his service , but no guardian of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were so few in those days in country towns that they were not worth taking into account . It was a long pull for Charley , however , and he confessed that , what with the distance and the supper he had eaten in the evening , he was several times on the point of turning back . He knew where the Carlions lived , however , and presently guessed that their house was the destination of the party . The idea of their playing such a trick on me had inspired him with so much indignation that he had kept on . He saw them leave the box and drive off ; and then , creeping along under the hedge , had watched until the coast was clear , knowing that if he were discovered , or if any of the family came to the door , there was an end of the adventure . I am glad Carlion 's dog did not hear us . There was an enormous Newfoundland locked up in the stable , but that was at some little distance from the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Charley . I have never forgotten the service he did me that night , and I am glad to say that 1 have since been in some measure able to repay him . But never mind that . Tired as we were , we had to walk home that night . We roused up a hostler in one livery stable , but he would not let us have a team at that time in the morning ; and moreover he looked at our disordered dress with so much suspicion , that we deemed it prudent not to try at any other place . On reaching my room , I threw myself down on my lounge without undressing , quite exhausted , only to turn out a few minutes afterward , so it seemed , at the sound of the bell for morning prayers . I managed to make myself look tolerably fresh although I was rather pale , and I had the luck to meet Dick Brashford just at the door of the chapel . From his startled look when he saw me , I felt confident that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box the night before . I did not succeed in finding any absolute proof of his participation in the plot . The excitement and fatigue of that night brought on an illness , which kept me in bed for a week , and even Charley kept away from recitations for a // clay or two , and took out a doctor 's certificate , although he did not go home . XVe had several consultations together and finally resolved to say nothing about the adventure . I never believed in telling tales , either in or out of school , and be-sides , neither Charley nor myself could declare upon our honor that the man with the false beard was Dick Brashford , although We felt morally certain of it . We had come out of the affair with credit and there was an end of it . The Carlions , of course , never talked about that of which they knew nothing ; and Dick and his friends-I forgot to say Charley told me of a third man , who acted as driver and whose presence I had not myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own sakes said nothing . Dick Brashford graduated and disappeared from that part of the country . What became of him , I did not know for a long time ; but I saw him again , and my story would hardly be complete if I made no mention of that interview . It was the day after the battle of Antietam . A message was brought to me , in the afternoon , that Lieutenant-Colonel Brashford , of the 17th , was in hospital , badly hurt , and that he would be glad to see Major McTrevor for a few minutes , if he could spare the time . It was long since I had thought of my old enemy and I did not even know he was in the army . Our regiment had moved up into the position we then held , during the night , and I do not know how he discovered I was near him , although I suppose it could be accounted for in some very simple way . Of course , I went to see him at the earliest moment possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene in the midst of which I found him . It was unhappily already familiar enough to me , but I am glad to say I never grew so callous as to care to talk niuch about it . Brashford was lying in bed . He had one arm unc6vcred , but he did not extend me his hand at first . When I offered him mine and told him I was sorry to see him there , he looked in my face a moment , as if to see whether I meant what I said , and then he shook hands with me , although his grasp showed but a very faint reflection of his old strength . Major McTrevor is it ? I should have known you , sir , I think . " I knew him on the instant , although he was thinner and the expression of his face showed him to be suffering pain , lie spoke slowly but quite distinctly , and I had no difficulty in understanding him . " I was hit yesterday , Major , and the doctors tell me they ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of sympathy I could command at the moment . " I am sorry , " he continued . " Not that J care for myself but my mother is now well along in years , and I suppose she will take it rather hard , at first . " I said I hoped the doctors would be proved at fault for once , but he shook his head , with a sad smile . " You may think it strange , Major-my sending for you , " he said . " It was a whim of mine , but perhaps under the circumstances- " I hastened to assure him that I was ready to do anything for him in my power . " I-I do n't find it quite so easy to say what I wanted as I supposed it would be . Do you remember that trick of putting you in a box , your first year in college ? " I told him , with a little smile , that I had long ago forgotten and forgiven that old affair , although I fear , by-the-way , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know who was the leader that night ? " " I know that you were , " I said . " Then I want to thank you for keeping quiet about it , and to tell you I am sorry for the part I took in it . I had been thinking over some of the poiiats in // my life , as I lay here , and it seemed to me , somehow , When I heard you were so near , that it would be a little comfort if I should have one less enemy in the world to leave behind me . " I told him that I had indeed been put to some bodily discomfort , but as the Carlions had not discovered me , my pride had not suffered . It had not been so very bad , after all . What !

I could not make sure that I interpreted it aright , but it seemed to me , that in spite of his desperate condition and his professions of regret for what he had done , he was for a moment filled with chagrin at learning for the first time the substantial failure of his scheme for my humiliation . He remained silent for a few seconds after I had finished speaking . Then he drew a long t ) reath  --  or would have done so but for the pain which caught him in the middle of the inspiration  --  and said : " Well , perhaps it is better so . Yes , I am glad of it .

But I never declared my passion , either as an undergraduate or as a graduate . I see now that our liking for each other-our love , if you like the word betterwas only a childish passion , and after a time it burned out , I know not how . I still admire her in a reasonable way , and when I meet her now and then , she has always a friendly word for me ; but she married a man much richer than I can ever hope to be , and lives very happily with him , for all I know to the contrary .
