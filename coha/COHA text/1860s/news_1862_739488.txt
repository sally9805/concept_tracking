txt It is a most singular fact that the varying fortunes of the war should be attended by such depressions of popular feeling and such agitations of the financial world as we witness . Not one man in ten thousand of all our people doubts the power of the loyal States and their unyielding purpose to suppress the rebellion , though the effort should cost their entire available wealth , and demand the service in the field of every citizen who is capable of bearing arms . We know that if the whole power of the Republic is put forth the rebellion must be overwhelmed . The discouragements , then , that come upon the country , are simply owing to the inadequate measures that have been taken to meet the danger that presses upon us . With the ability to put a million men in the field , and to maintain the ranks full till the end of the war , we have stopped at half the number , and taken no precautions against the wasting away by battle and disease . The rebels began by boasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In practice they have been forced to outnumber us in every fight in order to obtain a victory , or the slightest advantage over us . At the present time the rebel conscription law makes every Southern man a soldier . The newspapers recently enumerated their male population at over 700,000 , who could be counted on to bear arms . Clearly , then , the rebel Government has played its last and its highest card . It can bring no more men to its aid . If we can organize to beat their present forces , the day is lost to them forever . But under no circumstances is it likely that more than two-thirds of the rebel army , volunteer and conscript , can be put successfully in the field . Disease , desertion , natural disability , and class exemptions , will diminish their census army of 700,000 by fully onethird  --  leaving 450,000 as the utmost number that the rebel Government can force into its army . The question is , can the loyal North meet and overcome that force ? We need not argue Che proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loyal States can put an army into the field quite equal to this , the utmost stretch of rebel conscription  --  and then , with comparative ease , add one million to the number . It is , with our Government , simply a question of effort and of time . The fault is our own that the war lingers . If the Government call into the field , at once , half a million new and fresh men , the rebels can do nothing to meet such a levy . They have already strained themselves to the uttermost . Conscription has done its worst , and tender youths from Southern schools have been allowed to fill up their thinned ranks . Every man that now falls in their columns , leaves us one less to encounter in all future fights . Their candle is lighted at both ends , and between disease and battle , they must rapidly melt away front our front . Here we have every encouragement for redieled efforts to push the enemy to extremities . Our new soldiers ale full grown and ready for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to grow up . They have them not ; their have impressed all that aft. ) able to serve , and even drawn heavily on the second generation . And these are perishing daily by disease and the sword . qwq arms . The Goverment should not need prompting to that effort ; but if it does , the people should not hesitate to dictate its will . We are sure that a half million men could be had as easily  --  shall we not say more easily  --  than the three hundred thousand called for . The reason is manifest . The people would feel and know that with a half million fresh men , ( against which the rebels could not muster a fresh ten thousand ) , the war would be practically ended  --  ended , perhaps , without fighting . Having this confidence in the result of instant success and immediate peace , men would flock into the ranks more freely . Who would not rather be one of a half million men , going to war , than one of three hundred thousand ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abiding peace in its business interests , by simply calling out ? men to overrun the rebel Stites , and push every traitor into the Gulf . Let it be done .
