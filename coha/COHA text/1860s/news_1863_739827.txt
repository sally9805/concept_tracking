Before the termination of the engagement the Sixth , Mai. - Gen . SYKES ' corps , came up and assisted in ( hiving the enemy off the field . VASuINGTON , Thursday , Oct. 15 ? P. M. The falling Lack of our forces from Rappahannock Station to Bristow and Catlett 's is represented as a magnificent spectacle . They marched by four parallel lines . There were no delays nor confusion . Every movement was conducted with remarkable regularity . In the recent conflict between PLZASONTON and STUART 'S forces , while the latter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , the colors of both these Generals at one time were not over fifty yards distant from each other , and while there were charges of cavalry on the left and front , hand to hand encounters followed . Our cavalry were in splendid condition , and exhibited the greatest bravery and gallantry . Their officers say they never showed a better spirit , and in the succession of charges and rallying , obeyed orders with a coolness , regularity and rapidity unequaled in the war . The country being open , the spectacle is described as interesting and grand beyond description . A few particulars of the engagement yesterday in the neighborhood of Catlett 's and Bristow Stations have been received . It appears , the rebels early the morning furiously attacked the Second army corps , commanded by Gen. WARREN , and the cavalry division of Gen. GitEco . The Second corps being one of the oldest , and highly efficient , succeeded in stopping the rebel advance , compelling the enemy tofall back with heavy loss , our own troops also sufferleg largely . The Federal cavalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed and wounded on the field . A considerable number of prisoners fell into our hands , and a battery of six fine guns . Gen. SYKES , with the Sixth army corps , ably supported the Second in their arduous task of defending the rear . At 6 o'clock In the evening , Gen. Las made a desperate attempt to flank Gen MEADE by the way of Chantilly , and endeavoring to get into his rear by the way of Fairfax Court-house , In this he was unsuccessful , as Gen. MEADE anticipated the rebels by falling rapidly back to the coveted spot , thus effectually checking a movement which would have endangered both the Army of the Potomac and the Capital . During last night Gen. MEADE ordered one of his ' supply trains furteer back in his rear , when it was attacked by a small force of rebels , probably mounted guerrillas . The teamsters , reso'ved not to lose the property , rallied to defend it , and succeeded in driving away the enemy , who escaped with only two of the very large number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting of importance to-day . Artillery firing was heard early this morning , but it was not of long continuance . Maj.-Gen . DANIEL E , SICKLES , with his Staff , left here for the front at 2 o'clock this afternoon . In case of a general engagement he will take command of his own corps . The guns captured , four of which are United States regHation , three-inch , and one Blakeley gun , were exhibited here to-day . The prisoners were mostly North Carolinians , about fifty of whom have expressed a desire to take the oath of allegiance . Our casualties yesterday were small . A considerable number of rebel dead and wounded fell into our hands , the latter not being included in the foregoing aggregate of prisoners . The march from our late to the present position was accomplished in the most perfect order , and without the loss of wagons or other property . The enemy were held in check at every point where they attempted a surprise or attack . The force which attacked Gen. WARREN were portions of Gen. IIILL ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had marched from Hanover Junction , near Richmond , since Saturday last .
