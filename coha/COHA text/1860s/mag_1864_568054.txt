ARTICLE VII. - RELATJONS OF SEPARATE STATES TO GENERAL JUSTICE . Staatsreeht , V&amp;lkerreckt und Politile . Von ROBERT VON IMIouL . Tiibingen : 1860 . Two widely diverse views may be taken of the relations which the separate States ef the world sustain toward general justice . One , which may be called the selfish view , regards the individual State as fulfilling its work , when it has observed all its obligations to other States , and has likewise taken the best means in its power to secure just conduct , on the part of those who are subject to its laws , towards the subjects of other States and towards these States themselves . Beyond this it has no work in the world outside of its own borders , unless control over what is done upon its ships on the high seas be an exception ; and if any wrong , anywhere abroad , is committed , it is in no way called upon to interfere , either for the help of the injured , or in the execution of the laws of another State . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust , . the intercourse between the inhabitants of neighboring States becomes closer , and their relations become more and more complicated . it has a right to use its own laws exclusively in its own courts , but if , instead of doing this , in certain cases it allows the laws of other States to regulate decisions , such complaisance is to be regarded as being by no means a right which other States can claim , but a concession for which they ought to be thankful , or which is paid for by equal concessions on their part . Thus the whole system of private international law , one of great and continually increasing importance , rests on no foundation of justice , but simply upon the comity of States . Again , when a crime has been committed within the limits of one State , and the offender escapes into another , he is , according to this same view , like any other emigrant : the State may harbor him , and // no foreign law or punishment can penetrate beyond its boundaries . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interests of general justice , but either because the harboring of rogues is injurious at home , or the escape of them into foreign parts , where no rule of reciprocity prevails , will embolden trausgressors within its own limits . Thus the extradition of criminals is not obligatory , but a matter of comity or convenience . And still again , when a State is at peace and two of its friends at war with one another , there are , indeed , well defined obligations as well as rights of neutrality , but it is not held to be necessary to hold a strict watch over the conduct of traders towards these friendly powers , and all the apparatus for carrying on war even to ready made ships may be exported , and , practically , the whole burden *f executing justice lies on the foreigner : if lie can catch the guilty ship , he may ; otherwise it is sure of impunity . These examples show the influence of a narrow view of national obligations ; on the other hand , a very wide view has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to this theory nations are the individuals composing a world-wide community or virtual confederation , united together by principles of justice , and bound to give a helping hand in the execution of justice , as far as the power of each member extends . The laws of every State , therefore , ought to be sacred in the eyes of every other , so far forth as they are regarded to be ju*t . In the conflict of foreign and domestic law there is a principle of justice , which demands , in certain circumstances , that the latter give way to the former . When a crime is committed in any country , the fugitive criminal ought to find no refuge from just punishment in any other part of the world . When war breaks out between two States , those States which remain neutral are obligated not only to maintain a rigid neutrality themselves , but , by an effective police and by sufficient penalties , to keep their smubjects from all contraband trade , and from every violation of the law of blockade . Nor does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if carried out to an extreme , that inasmuch as there is a right and a wrong side in every conflict , whenever that can be // ascertained , neutrality itself is wrong , and all States ought to take a part with the injured belligerent . And , still farther , the right of interference in the internal affairs of any State , will , according to the same principle , lie open to every other State , which regards a government as oppressive , or a people as engaged in an unjust revolt . Nor is it necessary that an invitation should go forth from one government to another when help is needed ; the interference is equally right when uncalled for , if dictated by the feeling of justice . And thus every State has a vocation , like a knight errant , to defend the oppressed ,  --  to take the cause of the injured , wherever in this world oppression and injustice can be found . It is obvious from this exposition that the second of these principles is unsafe , and even , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so obvious that the first , which is safer and has been the rule for the general practice of nations , deserves equal condemnation . This we shall attempt to show , and then it will be time to ask whether a middle ground between these extremes ,  --  a r*ile which admits the obligations of States to aid one another in preventing wrong and securing time interests of justice , and yet limits these obligations by the independence of nations and in other ways ,  --  may not be the juste milieu , the equitable plan , in accordance with which the law of nations , if defective at present , may be reformed . Let no one urge that this is an abstract and useless speculation . It is not abstraQt , but eminently practical ; for if every State has a part to*act in the justice of the world outside of its own territory , the knowledge of such a calling must awaken a sense of obligation , and put the nations upon the track of common rules , by which their obligations of this sort can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their functions as separate States . Or , to take another view , if nations can be made to feel a certain sort of brotherhood and unselfish community , they will aid one another in the great work of well-doing , and if they render such mutual aid , the feeling of brotherhood will be awakened still more . The proper result of a Christian civilization is to awakemi and extend through mankind such a feeling of brotherhood . If , in a // 1 ) etter day , nations can be made to feel it , the leading spirit of all international law will be not to maintain separate sovereignties against invasion , nor to defend just rights ; nations will have outgrown these inferior principles , just as , when the individual has reached the higher stages of his character , love takes the place of obligation . The enquiry then will be , how can the common welfare of the States of the world ,  --  of this great confederation bound by ties of mutual regard ,  --  be best promoted ? In our enquiries into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves of the rich materials furnished by iMi . Von IMIohI , in an essay on the " International Doctrine of Asylum , " contained in the work placed at the head of this Article . The opinions of this writer on public law entitle him to high respect . In his Geschichte von Staat8wi8sem8ehaften , ( history of political sciences ) , in three volumes , he gives a condensed view of the newest literature in those departments with valuable criticisms on the leading writers . In his Encyciopddie von Staat8wissensclwften , ( Encyclopedia of political sciences ) , he exhibits the method and leading principles of polity , including international law . In the work to which we shall have especial reference , Staat8rec,4t I7ilkerrecht und Politile , ( the doctrine of the State , the law of nations and politics ) , he brings together a number of independent monographies , most of which had appeared in Gem ' - man journals befo*re , but which are here elaborated , and express his views in the year 1860 . These and several other writings , which are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own country ,  --  - " the political system of the kingdom of " *ATurtembero ' " " the responsibility of ministers united with a representative system in the government of a State , " " the science of police according to the principles of a State founded on justice , " and " the system of preventive justice , or jural police , "  - -  all of them extensive works ,  --  show his industry , and place him among the most active and learned publicists now living . The first point which muects our eyes , when we enquire into the relations of States to general justice , is the territoral character // of law , or rather the opinions which have prevailed in regard to such territoriality . Every part of the world , every race , every nationality has its own law , and its own views of what ought to be law , which it has the province of making real within its own boundaries by penalty and other force . There are , thus , a vast number of separate States , within the jurisdiction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice in the relations of States has been invaded . Crimes committed abroad pertain to the province of a foreign I awgiver ; crimes committed at home are to be judged by laws of domestic origin , whoever be the criminal , whether native born or foreign resident . Thus it would seem , that no question can arise concerning crimes committed abroad , or concerning the violation of law anywhere except within our own limits . Ts a foreigner guilty of a forbidden action here ? It must be an action against our law , not against the law of his birth-place or proper home . Is one of our citizens guilty of a crime abroad ? He is in the same manner amenable to the law of the territory where the offense occurred . Suppose him to have been punished . Will you have him tried again for the same offense ? Suppose him to have evaded foreign law , and now to be at home ? Will you interfere to remedy the imperfection of foreign police , and remand him to a country whose relations to him were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of asylum , and , above all , on his own native soil ? Something like this , will be urged in favor of adhering pretty strictly to the territorial application of law , and against what may be called the personal principle , that is , against the doctrine that the law of a State ought to control the actions of a subject during his foreign residence , on the ground of his close personal connection with his country . And when the many inconveniences which would arise from any other than the territorial principle  --  the want of evidence , the need of increased police , the danger of collision with foreign jurisdictions and the like , are taken into view , it must be confessed that the advocates of this side have a strong case . This side is taken , with more or less strictness , by a considerable number of writers on international and on criminal law . // Thus Heifter in his work on criminal law lays it down that no single State has the vocation to attempt to realize justice all over the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not require that its opinions as to what is just shall be accepted outside of its own limits . Only within its territory can its jurisdiction be exercised . It can , for instance , punish only where it can impose obligations , and this is the case only as far as its own subjects are concerned . Another writer on criminal law , Kdstlin , expresses himself to the effect that the specific functions of States are essentially territorial , and that in the two-fold sense , that they have exclusive control within their own territory , and no control beyond it . In the punishment of an offense committed beyond its borders a State would encroach on the rights of another . A native-born perso* can not be punished at home for a wrong do**e abroad , nor a foreigner be punished abroad for a wrong done at home . And to cite but one opinion more ,  --  Mittermaier , a leading living jurist of Germany , lays it down that the State has no universal care over the interests of justice . All that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and punishment of " inlanders . " These citations are from IMIohl , whom we shall use freely without further acknowledgment . Grotius stands at the head of the line of writers on the law of nations . His well known opinions were wholly opposed to such narrow limits of state action . He goes to the dangerous extent of allowing the heads of nations to interfere in foreign affairs for the purpose of punishing injustice . In regard to the surrendry of fugitive criminals his doctrine is , that " since States have the right of punishing offenses which affect their honor or security , no foreign State ought to protect a fugitive who has been guilty of such an offense . But as it is not usual or convenient to allow any foreign power to enter the territory of a State with an armed force in order to seize an offender , the State in which he has taken refuge should either punish or surrender him , or at least compel him to leave the country . " This , it seems , he regards as an obligation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Few would agree with Grotins in this , and Mr. Wildman protests energeticaly against // putting extradition on the ground of right . Most other writers on international law take similar views . ileifter , in his " V*lkerreclit , " takes the same ground which we have quoted him as advocating in his " criminal law . " Oppenheim goes so far as to say that all a State 's office is self-protection , and of course advocates the strictest territoriality of penal law . Story takes much the same ground , that the punishing power is confined within the limits of the State and to offenses there committed . The late Sir G. Cornewall Lewis has written a hook " on foreign jurisdiction and the extradition of criminals , " in order to make this point good . Wheaton and Phillimore , however , widen the sphere of the State by embracing subjects wherever they commit crimes within its jurisdiction . The former conside*s the judicial power of every independent State to extend to all acts forbidden by its laws , whether taking place at home or abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considers " criminal offenses to be altogether local , and to be justifiable only by the courts of that country where the offense is committed , " is peculiar to the jurisprudence of Great Britain and the United States . Phillimore says that the strict rule of international law undoubtedly is , that a State can only punish for offePses committed within the limits of its territory : this is at least , he adds , " the natural and just consequence of the territorial principle . " it is , however , he goes on to say , a pretty general maxim of European law that offenses against their own country , committed by citizens in a foreign land , are punishable by their own country , when they return within its own confines . But the law of the foreign country can punish them also , especially if their offense has been of a private character . In case of a public character , a double offense is committed ; one against the State of which the offender is a subject , another against the general law of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether his own State will punish him the second time for the same offense is not a question of international but rather of public law. * // From the opinions of publicists we turn to the practice of nations . All Christian nations agree in these points , that every State has a right to prevent or to punish offenses against itself or its subjects , whether committed by subjects or by resident foreigners , and that it is authorized and bound to punish crimes committed within its borders against foreign States or their subjects . Yet even in regard to this last point , the views of States are not quite uniform . England punishes such crimes against foreign States rather as disturbances of international relations than as violations of right . But beyond this there is little agreement . First , on the question whether a subject can be punished for crhnes committed abroad , England and our country take the negative side , not without some exceptions , indeed , but strictly enough to show that it is a prin*ple of our criminal law . The United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry the same rule into the relations between the States of the Union . France adopts the same rule , but makes the important exceptions of subjecting to her own law certain foreign crimes of her subjects which touch the public welfare , and of allowing the use of her courts to injured private Frenchmen , when crimes ( crimes , ' not delits ' ) have been committed against them out of the land by Frenchmen who have returned to France . At the opposite extreme from these stands another group of States , comprising the great majority of the German powers , Naples , Portugal , iRussia , Norway , and a number of the Swiss cantons . These States punish every foreign crime of a subject , whether directed towards themselves or their subjects or foreigners . But in so doing they follow their own definition of crimes and offenses , and not those which prevail in the country where the offender resided . Thus when an action is made penal by foreign law and not by their own , they will naturally allow no complaint to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are other less important States which make more or less of a compromise between the opposite views , mentioned above , and may here be passed over in silence . Secondly , cases occur where foreigners in ftreign territory commit wrongs against a State or its subjects , and afterwards // come within its boundaries . Here again great differences exist . Our English and American law is disinclined to notice these cases , but gives such persons , like other foreigners , a free right of asylum . A large number of States , among them Russia and many or most of those composing the Germanic body , go to the opposite extreme : they have no hesitation in punishing according to their own laws foreign offenders against themselves or their subjects , if they can catch them within their confines . France again takes no notice of wrongs done by foreigners abroad to individual Frenchmen , but makes such foreigners punishable for the same offenses for which Frenchmen residing abroad are called to account . A third , and far less important case , is that of foreigners committing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most States take no notice of such crimes , as being beyond their province . A few , however , as Austria , Bavaria , S*xony , reach even this remote point of justice with their laws , either giving up the offender , if required , or banishing him , or , as is the case with Austria , punishing him , unless he is handed over to the operation of foreign justice . When to what has been said we add that modern publicists place extradition on the basis of comity rather than of obligation , and that nations by their varying treaties concerning the delivery of fugitives from justice admit that they have reached no settled convictions in that matter , and can not demand such delivery as a right , *we shall have given an imperfect , it is true , but for our purposes sufficient , sketch of the views and practice which prevail in relation to the treatment of crimes committed beyond the limits of the injured party . From this survey of one part of the subject , and of one in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great difficulty , it is evident that there is no one ground either of theory or of positive law , upon which they stand . In the development of a law between independent soyereiguties it is natural that this should happen , for each start from a state of comparative isolation , with conceptions of justice already formed , and with suspicions of attacks upon its independence . The friction and intercourse of ages afterwards // is needed , to bring the views of States together , and to educate their sense of right up to a high moral standard . In part , such is the nature of man that intercourse between States begins and goes forward upon a calculation of advantages . There is at first scarcely any sense of justice except that manifested by the assertion of claims against other States , there is still less of a spirit of brotherhood , there is no conception of any duty of doing good to others ; and the old type of nations is represented by Japan , which wants no dealings with the world , and regards the admission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor to mankind , for which no sufficient return is received . It is not strange that with such a genesis of law and of relations between independent States , the moral and humane side of international law should fall behind the jural , or that which concerns itself with strict justice . But by and by it begins to be felt that the world , or at least a large circle of nations on its surface , foriu one whole ; at the same time religion may be elevating the sense of justice and of humanity ; and enlightened interest discovers that what is right is useful , and that what is useful for both parties is very generally right . At this time law becomes capable of improvement , and even private persons may , without charge of officiousness , thrust their views of right on the public , in the hope that some fruit will grow up from the free discussion of the principles upon Which the intercourse of States ought to be conducted . In such a spirit we proceed to lay down certain propositions which bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maintenance of general justice . 1 . Every moral being , and much more every collection of such beings called a State , which is founded and grounded on ideas of immutable justice , is bound not only to act justly and righteously , but to hate injustice wherever it is manifest , to sympathize with justice and to endeavor to support it , so far as is consistent with the definite sphere and special duties assigned to each individual and nation in the world . This proposition will , no doubt , be regarded by many as unmeaning , by many again as meaning too munch . We will however make no unfair use of it , and simply remark here that it is verified by the conduet // of nations , where they go beyond their definite sphere in order to put an end to gross injustice . England helped the Low Countries in their rising against Philip of Spain , and no one blames her for it . Cromwell interposed to put down the persecution of the Waldenses in Savoy , and most righteously . The great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IMiohammedans , and the calmest , most judicial writers , such as Wheaton , praise them for the act . Nor can it be doubted , if some great barbarity , as for instance that of wholesale court-murder , were perpetrated by IRussia against rebellious Poles , or by the United States again rebels in the seceding portion of this country , that it would be the impulse and the duty of civilized governments not only to protest against such conduct , but to prevent it f'rom going on by any means within their power . The conclusion is that if this may happen beyond the definite sphere of state action , it may much more naturally happen on those confines where the functions of two States meet , or where two sovereignties must concur in order to secure and realize justice . 2 . The strict territorial principle can not be maintained in an advanced ao'e of the world ; it is in fact departed from by those nations to whose laws and institutions it gives color ; and it has , as an absolute , unchangeable principle , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which need to be made good . As for the fi*t , it is enough to appeal to well known matters of fact . There are modifications of state law occasioned by the concurrence or conflict of foreign laws . The whole branch of private international law is of this description . Nations in a thousand cases , touching the personal status , or contract obligations , or the family obligations , do undertake to enforce foreign law through their courts of justice , and this great branch of law has grown up in the first instance , not through treaty stipulations , but by the actions of courts , first in neighboring States , and then , as intercourse widened , in all the countries of the Christian world , however separated by land or sea . This is , in fact , a fine illustration of what must happen , as the parts of the world come to know one another , // and to find out that justice will be wronged by adhering rigidly to the lex for . Not ' is it of any use to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Granting this to be so for the moment , yet the fact remains that in certain cases nations waive the application of their own law , and adopt that of a foreign territory . The practice of extradition is another fact which shows that close interconrse between nations will lead them to aid in the execution of each other 's law . It is true that all this is arranged by previous treaty , and this of itself proves that it can not be demanded as a strict right , the refusal of which would be a ground of complaint or even of war . But it is true also that nations thereby admit that it is right and proper to assist foreign justice . Nor could this admission be more entire if a State , instead of delivering up the fugitive , judged him by the law of his own country . But in the 8econd place , even those nations which carry the territorial principle farthest are obli0 in certain cases to depart froni it , and thus admit that it will not cover all the cases that arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more attached to this principle than England and the United States let us look at some of the cases , in which they are obliged to resort to a different principle in their legislation . They both , like the rest of their circle of nations , exercise jurisdiction on the high sea over vessels partaking of ' their nationality . It M4ll be at once said here , as has often been said , that such vessels are territory ; but this is a legal fiction , of use to defend a certain theory of neutral rights , but irreconcilable with fact . How can that be territory on the high sea , which becomes amenable to foreign law in a foreign port ? The truth is that the ship , when it has a crew on board , is territory for certain purposes , and against the aggressions of other States , and , what is more important , that the crew are under the laws of their own country , where no other law exists . In other words , a new principle is here applied ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whenever no other law holds sway ; otherwise men would be without a law , and crime on the high seas would have impunity. // And again , in those arrangements where a foreign law is superseded within its own territory by their law , i. e. in all cases where the rule of exterritoriality applies , they set aside the principle in question . They have adopted this rule by treaty with many nations which are not governed by our views of justice , as Japan , China , Muscat , and Turkey , on the ground that justice would not be done if the native courts were to try offenders from countries so different in their civilization . They claim thus that the principle of territoriality be broken , whenever their relations with certain parts of the world demand it . And in that other kind of exterritoriality which is given to ambassadors and public vessels by the law of nations , both nations grant this right to foreign envoys , as well as claim it for their own abroad . What is this but a confession that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases ? And in private international law , or the " conflict of laws , " the same confession is made . So also , if we come to certain particular crimes , both nations have to punish them , although committed beyond their own limits . Our laws concerning the slave-trade make that crime piracy , not only when taking place on our own vessels , but also where foreign vessels are the scene of the offense . In like manner England punishes high treason against Great Britain , when committed by her citizens abroad ; as well as murder , homicide , and bigamy , and certain crimes committed in barbarous countries . The last above all most righteously , but inconsistently with the principle . But in the third place , if we look at the reason of the thing we shall find that this principle , althongh of wide application , is not for all the exigencies of justice sufficient , nor the only principle that justice demands . In a time of no travel and commerce , when the nations are separated by insurmountable walls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within its sphere , and powerless beyond it ; but the close intercourse of modern life , the mingling together of men of various nationalities , the rapid passage from one side of the world to another , the greater interdependepee of nations ,  --  these and kindred causes make the strict and exclusive control of the law of the // territory seem narrow , and lead the minds of just men to modifications of a system , whose narrowness has now become apparent . As soon as intercourse began to be close among the countries of continental Europe , and especially between the members of the Germanic body , Holland , and France , the system of private international law grew np , as we have said , under the fostering care of the courts . It had become a necessity , and this made it a duty . The good of the nations between whom it began required it , and this they were the first to perceive . Although of voluntary origin , and gradual , and hitherto imperfect , it is as truly a normal development from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the provisions of any treaty . We say then that the fact now so general of waiving the application of the lex loci , proves the duty of so doing . This is as much a duty as intercourse itself . If it be dictated by a view of the advantages which are looked for by the nation which thus abridges its own sovereignty , the same may be said of many of the engagements into which nations enter . They are selfish in their treaties , but their selfishness is on the side of justice , instead of being opposed to it . But the principle which we have once before just alluded to deserves mention here : namely , that man must always be under law ; hence , wherever no law exists , he must carry with him the law of his country , as far as it can be applied , and wherever no law derived from Christian morality exists , he ought to be under the control of Christian law . This principle applies to all offenses committed upon ship-board , ( for it is with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the residents in savage countries , and to such as do business in half-civilized lands , where the institutions differ greatly from those of the Christian world . The extension of law beyond its local bounds to those whom no other law can reach , is riot only for the peace of the world , but is also required by the very essence of justice , and by the tie binding the citizen to the State . If he is under no law , he can claim no protection . An exiex , or outlaw , is at the mercy of those who come near him ; // law has nothing more to do with him , unless , alien as he has become , he treads upon the soil where law must reign . The relation of the citizen to the country is too little thought of in these days of emigration , of domicil , and of speedy naturalization . It is evident , however , that no State is bound under all circumstances to allow its inhabitants to emigrate ; still less is every State bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition ; nay , the obligation is just the opposite ,  --  the good of the State requires that some be excluded , and others subject to a term of probation . This lays a natural foundation for one of the kinds of help which nations can afford to one another . If it is not for the advantage of the United States to receive persons who flee from justice at home , there will be no unwillingness to part with them ; and if these runaways have no claim to protection , and their country ought to enforce its law in their case , the duty of ex tradition is evident . 3 . But the justice which nations are bound to aid through the world is not justice in the shape of the lex loci , but justice , as they severally apprehend it to be ; it is not law , but sul*jective justice . The views of nations in regard to the duties of citizens and the expedience of law vary endlessly , even when they par* take of the same civilization . They can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territories , nor to adopt the principles of justice according to which other States legislate , but their own views of what is just and right must be their guide . This is not only a good ethical rule , but is freely admitted in practice . We give two illustrations . It is a generally admitted provision of private international law that the status of the person in his domicil is to govern the decisions of foreign courts whenever that question comes before them . Now it might seem from this that the status of a person , who left his domicil as a slave , would rule in a foreign court , where an action was brought against him by his master . But all Europe and our Northern States , ( so far as the Constitution has not interposed ) , have maintained that slavery is unjust and unnatural , that therefore it is local , and the slave , beyond the lex loci , regains the rights of a man . In other // words , they all refuse to let the local law in this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . And the like is true of bigamy and polygamy , and in several other cases . The other illustration is drawn from the practice of extradition . Most nations except the political offender from the operation of laws or treaties which remand other accused per sons to their domestic courts . But why is he excepted ? Not because political machinations are always innocent , nor because one nation wishes to promote designs against the peace of another ; but because , in political trials , where the offended party is both accuser and judge , the conviction is apt to be unjust , and the penalty severe , and because the exile may have been engaged in a righteous work . Hence it follows , that the help extended to foreign justice must be determined by treaty . It is not stricti juris , although required by proper views of duty . It must be defined by the parties , and until such definition is made , there is no ground of complaint on either side . 4 . The limits to such help are given in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part in maintaining justice upon foreign soil , still less may it execute justice there , when not invited . It may offer its assistance , in all cases leaving the right of rejection and of acceptance to the other party . Still , it ought to be observed , that the strictest conception of sovereignty is not that to which a nation ought to adhere , as if its safety and dignity lay there : quite the contrary ,  --  the more civilized a nation is , the more will it abandon the savage idea of atomic separation from the rest of the world . Every treaty abridges the power of sovereignty by a voluntary renunciation of power for the time , or for all time . The sovereignty is exercised at the time of entering into the brotherhood of nations , and at the time of making every special treaty . After that , it can not be revoked , and even on supposition that all treaties between a State and the rest of the world have expired , it is no longer at iberty to retire into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by usage , acquired rights of intercourse , which they may enforce even by war . Sovereignty spends itself in settling the terms of intercourse , and has no // power to revoke what has been once conceded , whether by stipulation or by custom . We are now prepared to look at some of the duties of States which relate to the maintenance of foreign justice and the prevention of wrongs committed against any State by the subjects of another . We have said next to nothing hitherto on the duty of preventive justice . Nor is it necessary to say more than a word in this place , for such justice , where it can be exercised within the specific sphere of state action , is as important and as obligatory as that of helping to punish actual wrongs , and being exercised within the limits of the c&amp;3perative State , may be safer and more easily managed than justice of a penal description . 1 . One of the means by which the justice of foreign States is maintained , is the respect paid to their laws in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an external law for the lex loci on special grounds . After the references in the earlier parts of this Article to private international law , we need add little in this place . This preference of foreign to domestic law has been ascribed to comity , and , in a certain sense , this is true ( the State is under no constraint in granting such favors , which have their source not in strict obligation but in free concession . And yet they would not be allowed , had not the courts become convinced that justice is in this way better secured ,  --  in short , that the law of the place had failed to apply in certain cases the proper remedies . As soon as a nation or its courts have found this out , a sense of duty requires that they adopt that law which is the best for the case and the class of cases . 2 . All exterritorial jurisdiction , and all exemption from foreign jurisdiction , are to be explained in the same way . They are expedients for the furtherance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party concerned , but obligatory because justice can not go on without them . The rights which ambassadors enjoy in a foreign land are defensible not on the ground that it is undignified for the representative of one State to be subject to the law of another , but because lie could not be independent and free in his actions , if he were re // stricted by the law of the place where he exercises his functions ; and the courts , which Christian nations are permitted to hold in the territories of various eastern nations , have grown into being through the fear that the native courts would depart widely from Christian views of justice . All such privileges are naturally reciprocal , but as these eastern nations have been chiefly passive in their intercourse with Europe and America , they have never had occasion to demand the same privileges for their subjects in return . 3 . Extradition is , in a still higher sense , a way of assisting the cause of general justice . When a fugitive from justice escapes into a foreign land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may enjoy the right of asylum , without enquiry into his case ; or be brought before the courts of the territory ; or be sent back for trial to his own country . Few States now would think of adopting the first of these methods , for it would fill the foreign territory with rogues , and the right of asylum is not of an absolute character . The plan of trying the criminal by the courts of the State where he has found a refuge , has its advantages in this , that he is more sure of an impartial court , and is exempted from the necessity of returning to a country which he may have innocently left ; but the far greater advantage is secured by extradition of having the criminal where the witnesses can be easily gathered . In fact , so great would be the expense of sending witnesses to a remote land ,  --  across the *cean , for instance ,  --  so great the hardship to them of such a loss of time and risk of life , that the practice of extradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad by the law of the place of their sojourn is only conceivable where States are near one another . Extradition is in itself a way of aiding justice beyond our own bounds ; and however nations may have favored it because it enabled them to lengthen their own arms so as to reach the fugitive criminal , or because they did not wish to harbor all offenders against law within their borders , the true ground for defending it is that it is a means of securing justice throughout the world , of helping to put down crime when the criminal comes under the power of another government , which // must sympathize in the exercise of justice , aPd which , although not injured by the offense , takes the part of law and order . The limitations of extradition , as it is practiced in most States , have already been referred to . For special reasons political fugitives are exempted from the operatioi* of the rule , and are seldom included in treaties . Generally it is only heavier crimes against the person and against commercial morality to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet the rules of the present day may be much changed at some future time . It is possible , when all governments shall have become just and beneficent , that even political crimes-if any such there shall be-will not be looked on with the indulgence they receive no*x* . At that day a political revolutionist will be regarded as a disturber of the peace of the world , as an enemy of justice , whom it is right to send back for trial to the place of his crime . 4 . A point not often discussed is , whether a State is in any manner bound to uphold the revenue laws of another , especially whether it is bound to endeavor to keep its subjects from smuggling . The common feeling has been that this is an affair between the smuggler and the officer of customs ; that the smuggler is engaged in trade useful to his country , and if he is willing to run the risk , is more worthy of praise for his spirit and craft than of blame for his violation of foreign law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when fair towards all the world , as evidences of hostility to themselves , so that any assault on the revenue laws of another land is patriotic and calls for sympathy . Hence , unless where a tariff system established by treaty has provided for the repression of it by the parties concerned , smuggling has gone unpunished . Nor have respectable merchants felt ashamed to partake in such adventures . NI . Mohl gives a paragraph to this matter , and decides that as foreign tariffs are often unreasonable , and must be regarded as such by nations who are injured by them , these nations can not be expected to give them their protection , but must take a neutral attitude . We admit the justice of these re // marks : the case is parallel to that of political fugitives . But suppose that revenue laws are admitted to be fair and right in their operation . lit now becomes , we think , a duty of a State to keep its subjects , as far as possible , from smuggling ,  --  not indeed by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods , such as demanding bonds from exporters , with forfeiture if they engage in an unlawful trade . Nor would this fail of inculcating the principles of commercial morality which are feeble even in most Christian nations . There are men in fair standing who will cheat the customhouse when they can do this with impunity . There are foreign , merchants , especially , who feel no scruple about violating the laws of the country where they live , as if they were not as truly bound to obey them as the native born citizen . There are many more who would laugh at the idea of being held by foreign laws of trade , who will smuggle opium into China , and then , wiping their mouth , will say , " I have done no wickedness . " Such men are encouraged by the low tone of morality in the intercourse of States , and would learn to take higher ground if States themselves set the example . 5 . We come next to a somewhat analogous case . What attitude ought to be taken by States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more generally , towards unlawful trade proceeding from their ports , in time of war ? It is admitted on all hands , that such proceedings as the conveyance of com*traband and attempts to enter a blockaded port , being an identification of one 's interests with those of a belligerent , are violations of neutrality , and therefore wrong . And it is because they are wrong , that no one complains when the cargo , or the ship , or both , according to the circumstances of the case , are taken and condemned by the other belligerent . But with this it is held , unless treaty may possibly have ordained otherwise in a case or two , that the neutral government is passive as to all such trade ; it may see and know that ships leave its ports laden with munitions of war intended for a belligerent , but it is not bound to prevent , nay , may have no authority to prevent , such a trade . The means of carrying on // war for an indefinite period may all be furnished by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of gain which supplies both parties alike with the instruments of death , if wanted ; the traffic is admitted to be a violation of neutrality ; and yet merchants , in neutral ports , engage in it without scruple , and would probably ridicule a man who should contend that it was against the rules of morality and ought to be abandoned . Still further , the theory of contraband seems to be framed on purpose to prevent any public interference . The doctrine is that the contraband trade begins when the ship leaves the country . The buying , chartcring a ship for this purpose , lading , weighing anchor , are all innocent . It is only when the vessel reaches the high sea and turns its prow towards a certain point of compass , that the violation of neutrality commences . Until then there is no responsibitity for its movements , for it commits no crime . Afterwards , it has passed beyond the operations of territorial law and the belligerents must look out for themselves . It is as if a thief could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when he had taken leg-bail , a set of policemen who had no right to enter the dwelling , must be summoned to catch him . If you add to all this that the merchant vessels of the belligerents are generally allowed to procure munitions of war in neutral ports , you have a law of nations framed in the interest of commercial States which deal- in contraband articles ,  --  a law so contrived as to make a confessedly unlawful trade as safe as possible . What is to be said of all this ? Has the neutral government no duty , according to the right view of justice , save that of prescrving the neutrality of the State itself ? May the private man be left to do as he pleases ? It will not be thought presumptuous , we hope , if we affirm that the law of nations leaves things here on a false ground . It seeks to secure neutral States against being entangled in foreign wars , but leaves private persons free to light the fires which their country may not endeavor to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the general welfare of States , but allows neutrals to make the most out of war that is possible . But what is right and just in this case ? We shall not be regarded as going very far when we say that the sale of munitions of war to a belligerent within the territory of a neutral ought to be prohibited . Such prohibition is more or less the practice at present ; it is advocated by eminent jurists , and rests on good grounds of justice ; for neutrality between combatants is justice , and that only is neutrality which consists in standing aloof from all the operations of the war , not that which renders favors to both belligerents alike . There can practically be no equal favors to both parties , and such favors only prolong a contest by the help of neutrals , who thus become belligerents on both sides . On this point we can not forbear quoting the opinion of an eminent English authority , Mr. Philhimore , who seems to us to be animated by a sincere love of justice. * " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in a former volume of this work , and if it be the true character of a neutral to abstain from every act which may better or worsen the condition of a belligerent , the unlawfulness of any such sale is a necessary conclusion from these premises . For what does it matter where the neutral supplies one belligerent with the means of attacking another ? How does the question of locality , according to the principles of eter*mal justice and the reason of the thing , affect the advantage to one belligerent , or the injury to the other , accruing from this act of the alleged neutral ? Is the cannon or the sword , or the recruit who is to use them , the less dangerous to the belligerent , because they were purchased or he was enlisted within the limits of neutral territory ? Surely not . Surely , the locus in quo is wholly beside the mark ; except , indeed , that the actual conveyance of the weapon or the soldier may evidemice a bitterer and more decided partiality , a more unquestionable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one say that in these words Phillimore confounds the act of the belligerent State , and of the private person within its jurisdiction . If an act is hostile by whomsoever committed , and can be prevented , the government is responsible for it , and for its consequences , if occasioned by neglect on the part of the public authorities . In the present case there is no special difficulty in preventing all such sales within the territory of the neutral State , any more than in preventing the belligerents from enlisting men there , or in enticing them to go elsewhere for the purpose of enlistment . Yet this is prohibited by international and municipal law . Nay , the purchase and exportation of munitions of war by such parties is more patent than secret agreements between two men within four walls , and far more so than lending money to a belligerent , which the English courts and ours regard as an invalid contract . There are certain manufactories , few in number , where the munitions of war are made , and certain ports , few in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels which can be watched with no great expense or addition to the police . We have then a simple case of prevention where the ends of neutrality and general justice can be without any peculiar difficulty attained . Can the exportation and sale abroad by the neutral trader of contraband articles at his own risk be put on any different ground ? We think not ; except that it is worse for the peace of the world , and puts the neutral dealer in the attitude of actively helping the belligerents , while he was only passive when they came into his country to buy of him . Will it be said that a war between friends ought not to injure the commerce of a third party ? Why then make the distinction between articles that are contraband and those that are not , and with great array of words preach the duty of neutrality ? Moreover , is it not probable that a war will end sooner , if the neutral abstains from helping it on , than if he supplies the parties or either of them with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are enlisted with one side rather than with the other , and help may be rendered to a weak , oppressed nation , which must otherwise succumb ? But if such sympathy // may be active , what becomes of the doctrine that a neutral must regard a war between its friends as in a certain sense just on both sides , because they have conflicting Views of justice between which there is no court of nations to decide . Or will it be said that the violation of neutrality begins on the sea and not before ? This is however a mere fetch . If the intention of the dealer can be made out , he is purposing to do an act in violation of neutrality or he is not . If he is not , let him weigh anchor and go where he will . If he is , let him be prevented . Will it be said that nothing can prevent mereb ants and ship owners from p*ursning a gainful traffic ? To us it seems that if bonds were given , for example , to double the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please of the ship , the forfeiture of so much on detection would check contraband trade more than all the risks from belligerent cruisers , which risks are paid for by the increased price of those cargoes that escape capture . We would not require the neutral to keep watch upon the seas , but simply to have an oversight of trade within his own territory , which , as we have said , is no onerous task . Such action would be comparatively new in the world , and doubtless the commercial States would refuse to give it their assent . But suppose that two measures should take effect at once ,  --  the exemption of all innocent ships , to whomsoever belonging , from molestation , and an increase of the penalties attached to contraband trade and breaches of blockade . The parties actively c*ncerned in such trade , when captured , shall be regarded as prisoners of war , unless their innocence can be established ; the ship that has the contraband on board shall be a lawful prize , as well as the contraband articles them selves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head in the land from which the goods come , would greatly lessen that illicit trade , which , in these days of steamboats , is so much easier and less hazardous than formerly . At the same time the protection given to all other trade , by which war would be made a state of peace for most vessels , would be too solid an advantage not to facilitate the adoption of these more rigid rules , if the two arrangements should be accepted or rejected together . // We will only add , that to reach such an end , more precise definitions of contraband , of blockade , and of attempts to break it than now exist , would need to enter into the law of nations . The opinions of private persons , albeit they hide under the mask of the anonymous reviewer who is conceived of as the organ of some unknown body , are of small account . It may be allowed to us , however , to say that the opinions here expressed , touching the duty of neutrals in aid of general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are willing to confess , however , that we have been strengthened in our views by what has happened during the present war . The English are now neutrals ; we do not blame their merchants for acts which our own did not commit in like circumstances , as i uthe contests between Spain and her colonies ; nor do we blame them for any peculiarly sinful cupidity beyond that of sinners in the United States ; nor do we blame their courts for decisions in favor of questionable neutral trade which our courts have not often sanctioned . But we are taught the immense resources of modern commerce , and its fearful power to prolong a war which would have been quenched long ago but for such help ; and it seems to us as if this war was mainly indebted for its tenacity and exhausting power to neutrals and not to belligerents . The principal war power now is a neutral adhering to time rules of rigid neutrality . Are the rules right ? Ought not the law of nations to be reformed ? Does not general justice require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Article , one more kind of aid which nations can give to general justice : we refer to assistance rendered by the State itself to foreign nations or governments . We refer not to interference in order to preserve the balance *f power , which mnay be dictated by mere self-preservation , but to cases of extreme oppression by a government on religious or political grounds , and to cases where a weaker nation is treated with gre at injustice by a stronger . Such interference is authorized in extreme cases , and will amount sometimes to taking part in war . It may be offered , // or even obtruded . As for the extremity of the case , of course no rules can be laid down , any more than in a case where a private person defends another in the street from a drnnken or malignant assault . Interference of this kind is more disinterested than any other ; it is also more rarely called for , and its rarity prevents it from setting a dangerous precedent . The Greeks may be rescued from Turkish oppression by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not occur again for ages .
