txt MILFORT . IT is often remarked that America , owing to its comparatively recent discovery and settlement , is wanting in the romance and poetry with which the history of the Old World is filled . We are too modern , too fresh in our existence , to present any thing but the common everyday facts of life , forgetting that it is not the age but the character of events that gives them their poetry . It is true that a certain interest attaches to scenes that occurred five or six thousand years ago , in an entirely different state of society from what we ever witnessed ; but the romance and poetry of a people belong chiefly to their early history , whether that history commenced a hundred or a thousand years ago . Then the individual is not merged in the mass ; and hence we find those strange personal adventures and hazardous experiments which develop so marvelously all that is heroic and daring in man . Instead of being deficient in the romance of history , America is peculiarly full of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men appealed to the imagination as it neyer had been appealed to before , and made the realization of those things which for ages had been only dreams appear easy and natural . America , from the St. Lawrence to the Rio Grande , was written all over with *neids and Iliads long before the time of the Heroic Period of the great war for the Union . True , many of those have passed away with the wilderness which witnessed their origin , progress , and end ; yet a vast number are still preserved amidst the legends and chronicles of the Old World-in France , England , Spain-especially in the latter . The investigations hitherto made amidst these musty records have been to bring to light facts bearing on our national history , and not on isolated expeditions or personal adventures . There is a vast field here yet unexplored . As an illustration of this I give the following narrative , as written by himself , * of the adventures and career of Milfort , a Frenchman who came to this country in 1795 . He found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became for twenty years their head chief , controlled their action during the war of the Revolution ; conceived and carried out the plan of the cession of Louisiana to France ; was chief actor in many of the wars on our Southern borders , and came very near changing materially the current of our national history . In 1775 , impelled by a spirit of adventure , he says , he went to Dunkirk , in France , for the purpose of traveling in countries not generally known , indifferent as to what particular region it might carry him . His first impulse was to explore some of the northern countries of Europe ; and finding a vessel loaded for Norway , he embarked on board of her in January , and eventually landed in Berg . In walking along the wharves of this place he came across a ship hound for the United States , and immediately took passage in her , and the next April landed in New London , Connecticut . The cities and large towns of the New World presented little attractions for him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Boston to New York . Thence he turned southward to Philadelphia and Baltimore , passing through Virginia and the Carolinas to Savannah in Georgia . The whole country was alive with the stir of arms . The battle of Bunker lull had set the nation in a blaze ; but that great struggle , which was yet to draw his own nation into it , and found a new empire , did not attract a passing notice from him . Why the sights and sounds usually so exciting to a soldier made no impression on him he does not inform us-he only hints that he was seeking after something * ilf*snoires , eu Coup d ' fEd rapide sur mes Voyage dons teLoseisione , et more Sijour dens to notion *reeke .

He had no immediate fear of starvation , for he saw the woods around him were filled with nuts and herries ; still he could not hut feel that he had acted rashly iu starting on an expedition without any known point in view , and without nny knowledge whatever of the country through which he was to pass . He felt , however , that he had gone too far to retrace his steps , and that , as there must be some limit to the wilderness , his safest course was to go on . Besides , the hope of at last coming upon something strange and new , which impels all explorers forward , prompted him to this course . He therefore plunged deeper and deeper into the wilderness , suhsisting as he best could on the fruit which the forest yielded him . Every morning he rose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night he lay down , wondering where this vast solitude would end . This one solitary Frenchman traversing the American wilderness , not in search of an El Dorado or fountain of life , but of a race of men who roasted and ate travelers and enemies alike , presents certainly a strange spectacle . He had ample time for reflection , and he must have been as much of a philosopher as a dreamer to have retained his composure and hopeful spirit amidst such circumstances . His thoughts at night , as he lay down beside his steeds in the forest , and his anticipations by day as he strode resolutely on through the endless colonnade of trees , must have been novel and peculiar , and we regret that he did not intersperse them in his narrative . The forest was seamed with rivers that " listened to the sound of their own dashings , ' whose origin and destination were alike a mystery . From these he would emerge dripping and weary , still steering toward the setting sun , till at length he reached the banks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had now been steadily piercing the wilderness for a whole month , and for the last two weeks without any thing to eat except such fruit as he could gather on the way . Weary and dispirited , he halted here for several hours to rest . Then gathering a few berries and nuts , he mounted his horse and , swimming the stream , pushed on . After going , as he judged , about a hundred and twenty miles , he came upon a beautiful fountain leaping and sparkling amidst the green foliage . But even this joyous object , bursting unexpectedly on him in the midst of the solitude , failed to waken a corresponding emotion . His low diet had done what the wilderness could not-conquered his indomitable spirits  --  and he looked moodily on the frolicking waters . He was sick  --  the miserable forage to which he had been reduced had disordered his stomach , and he felt that he must have something more nourishing to eat or he soon would be unable to march at all , and be compelled to lie down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every side for something to kill , but his two horses made such a conspicuo*is*hject that every animal fled as he approached , while he dared not leave them to hunt lest he should be unable to find them again , to say nothing of the personal danger he might encounter on foot and alone in the forest . Still he must change his diet or die . His situation was getting desperate ; and after pondering on it a while , he resolved to kill his spare horse and live on him till he should recover his strength . Having come to this determination he unstrapped his luggage and threw it away , and tying the animal to a tree , stepped back a short distance , and cocking his gun was about to raise it and fire , when he heard a slight noise in the woods behind him . Turning quickly round to ascertain the cause , he saw to his surprise a group of four Indians and a negro gazing intently on him . Having been locked up for more than a month in the wilderness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never thought of danger , and instantly beckoned them with the most friendly gestures to approach . But they , pointing to his gun , refused to stir . He then threw it away , when one of them , an old venerable-looking Indian , and apparently the father of the others , approached , and addressed him in the Indian dialect . Milfort , of course , could not understand him , but in reply pronounced on a venture the word " Franfaise . " To his surprise and joy he saw that it was not an unfamiliar word to the savage , for he instantly advanced with a smiling countenance and took his hand . lie had a French medal round hisneck , which Milfort afterward learned had been given to him by the French governor , when L6uisiana was under the dominion of France Milfort did not know what the savages meant to do with him ; but thinking there could scarcely be a worse fate than to be left to starve in the wilderness , he asked no questions , but immediately gave himself up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little speech , placed the horses and equipage in charge of the other Indians , when they all started off in a western direction . After going a little distance , the young negro , at a given signal , parted from them like an arrow from the bow , and bounding away with astonishing fleetness disappeared in the forest . The old Indian then by gestures inquired of Milfort what he was about to do with his gun when they came upon him . He in reply made him understand that , being in a starving condition , he was about to kill his horse for food . The Indian then pointed to the sun , and made a short line on the earth , to give him to understand that by the time the sun had gone that distance they would be at his home , After about an hour 's march , but which to Milfort , exhausted with hunger , seemed an age , they arrived at the Chattahochee River , on the other side of which was a village of the " Coctas . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance , for he was awaiting their arrival with canoes which he had brought over from the farther side . // Crossing the river , *hey proceeded to the house of the old Indian , who , as they entered , made a sign to Milfort to be seated , and presented him with a pipe . Although smoking was not exactly the occupation the Frenchman thought most suitable to a man in a starving condition , lie said nothing , but took the pipe with a gracious gesture , and soon found that it relieved very much the guawings of hunger . After he had finished , his savage host presented him with a slice of water-melon , and took a piece himself . Milfort devoured it voraciously and looked up for more , but to his surprise no more was offered him . He could not understand why his raviug hunger was thus taunted , for he knew he had made the Indian understand his starving condition , and he seemed to be friendly . He had not much time , however , for reflection on this singular conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was startled by the loud and rapid beat of a drum . The Indian , observing his surprise , informed him by signs that their council was about to assemble , and offered to conduct him to it . Milfort immediately rose to follow him , for , unable to make himself understood , he thought it best to humor every wish of his host , though he could not but think that the savage was singularly polite and friendly for one who roasted and ate men . This was in the month of May , 1776 , for Mufort had been more than a month in crossing the State of Georgia , so devious and full of obstructions had been his way . He had arrived among the powerful tribe of the Creeks , and at the time of one of their annual councils . Into this council Milfort 's host now conducted him , for though he was not himself a chief his age gave him free admittance . Leading him forward to a chief seated in the centre on some bear-skins , he presented him , saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest . The chief received him with great dignity , and , making him a sign to be seated by his side , took his hand in token of friendship . Milfort addressed him a few words in French , but seeing that he did not understand him addressed him in broken English . To his amazement he found that the chieftain spoke English perfectly . This was the renowned M'Gillivray , a man well known at that time both in this country and in Europe . The Creeks had been warm friends of the French when they occupi*d Louisiana , and Mufort was most cordially received by the assembled chiefs . He did not remain long , however , for his host soon advanced to conduct him away . Leading him back to his cabin he gave him about an ounce of bread , and the same amount of roast meat , and a drink of water . These mere morsels seemed to increase rather than allay the pangs of hunger , and Milfort could not reconcile this extreme parsimony with the friendly bearing of the Indian . Toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his baggage had been previously deposited , and pointing to some bear-skins made signs for him to lie down and rest . He did so , and being very tired as well as hungry , soon fell asleep , and dreamed of luxurious banquets at which he was allowed to eat without stint . In the midst of his imaginary repast the old Indian entered the room , and , waking him up , asked . how he had slept . He then poured out for him a small cup of whisky , and made signs for him to follow him . He did so , and entering an adjoining room , saw to his great ( lelight a table spread with abundance to eat . When his hunger was appeased his savage host made him understand that he had kept him on short allowance at first from fear that sudden repletion would injure him . M'Gillivray soon came in to dine with him , and they had a long conversation together , kept up on Milfort 's side in very imperfect English . MGillivray , on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to his great surprise , that he spoke scarcely any other language , having but a very limited knowledge of the Indian tongue . The reason of this was , as he afterward ascertained , that M'Gilhivray 's father was a Scotchanan , and had given him an English education . His mother was the natural daughter of a French officer who formerly commanded at Fort Toulouse , near Alabama . This officer had made , a mistress of a squaw , the beautiful daughter of a Creek chief and M'Gilliviny 's mother was the fruit of the connection . His father had long been a trader among the Creeks , and was much beloved by them . In one of his visits to buy furs , peltries , etc. , he saw this half-Indian half-French girl , who had inherited her mother 's beauty , and fell in love with her . More conscientious than the French officer , he made her his wife , which added greatly to his influence with the Creeks . They lived happily together , and a family of five children grew up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughters , but one after another died , till only one son and daughter remained . The former was sent to Charleston , to be educated as an English youth ; and he might well pass for one , for being Scotch on his father 's side , and only half-Indian on his mother 's , he was only slightly tinted with the swarthy hue of the savage . After finishing his education he visited the Creeks on behalf of the English to negotiate a treaty with them . Reverenced for his father 's sake , and claimed as one of their own from being the son of a chieftain 's grand-daughter , he was received with the warmest tokens of affection , and named their Esteckoclco , or " friend . " He was six feet high , tall , spare , and erect , and afterward became known as theTalleyrand ofAlabama . Thebeantifal country of the Creeks , their unbounded affection for him , conthined perhaps with a longing for a wild life , which had come with his Indian blood , determined him to remain among them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was his intention to remain some time in the Indian country . // Milfort was delighted with the intelligence ; for with an educated man for a companion , with whom he could converse about the great world without , he saw that he could combine the charms of both sava*e and civilized life , and gratify his educated as well as his natural tastes . M'Gillivray invited him to go home with him as soon as the council broke up , but Milfort , with true French politeness , declined on the ground that his kind host might feel hurt at his leaving him so suddenly . M'Gillivray , however , was determined not to part with his new-found companion , and before the council dispersed had arranged it all with the old Indian in whose charge he left the horses and baggage . Milfort , bidding his Indian host an affectionate adieu , promising to come and see him again soon , mounted one of M'Gillivray 's horses , and the two rode away into the forest toward the beautiful home of the latter on the banks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus strangely brought together in the heart of the wilderness , journeyed on together , surrounded by all the glories of the spring , the pleasant hours passing swiftly by in pleasant converse respecting the great world without ; and on the fourth reached their place of d*stination . The situation that M'Gillivray had chosen for his home was picturesque in the extreme , and burst on Milfort like an oasis in the desert . The cabins of sixty slaves stood sprinkled over the opening , which was skirted by the river , amidst which rose conspicuously the more imposing residence of M'Gillivray , their proprietor . Each family had a cabin of its own surrounded by a patch of cultivated ground , which gave to the whole the appearance of a little village . This ( luiet spot , surrounded by the green forest , and smiling in the sun , seemed to Milfort more like a dream than a reality , and he could not repress an exclamation of delight . M'Gillivray took him to his own house , and after a day or two presented him with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , determined to retain him permanently among his tribe , he had spoken enthusiastically of the simple , pleasant manners of his people , told him of the reputation the nation had already acquired , and unfolded the brilliant plans he had laid out for the future . All this was strange and new to Milfort ; he had started on his adventurous expedition in the expectation of finding a state of human degradation more revolting than any he had ever yet experienced , of seeing men who roasted and ate their enemies , and behold he had fallen on Arcadian simplicity , and found himself in a nation of savages far more civilized and refined than the wild frontiersmen of the white settlements . Before the charm and novelty of his new situation had time to wear off he was informed by M'Gillivray that a secret war expedition was being fitted out by the Creeks . The chivalric Frenchman , in order to show his gratitude for the kindness he had received , immediately offered to accompany it as a volunteer . M'GilliVOL . XXXI. - No. z vray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground that he was too recent a stranger to be allowed the honor of defending their country ; but that at some future time the chiefs would be glad to accept of his services . Milfort , however , was determined not to be left behind , and pressed his request so earnestly that for fear of offending him it was finally granted . The fact that he was a Frenchman was the chief reason for thus deviating from their established custom . It is a remarkable fact that the French were always great favorites with the Indians on this continent , while the English were as invariably hated . Honored with the title of Creek warrior , Milfort joined the expedition , and it took up its line of march through the forest . These wild warriors in their war paint and equipped for the foray was a novel sight to the French soldier , and he could not but reflect on his strange appearance and position among them . He soon discovered that several of the subordinate chiefs , under the pretense of friendship , were keeping close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger , but he had come among them in too mysterious a manner to permit them to feel perfectly at ease respecting him . As they approached the neighborhood of the enemy he was kept under still closer surveillance . A council of war being called to decide on the plan of attack he was invited to it , and his opinion , he being a European soldier , was asked as to the best course to be adopted . He politely declined to give any whatever , saying that he . was entirely ignorant of their mode of warfare , , and also that of the enemy . But they , deterni-. med to obtain his views , explained their usual . method of surprise by night , etc. , and then insisted on his giving them the plan he would adopt if left to himself . Being thus urged , . he , after obtaining full information of the locality , circumstances , number , etc. , of the enemy , . presented a plan , which , though it might be very imperfectly comprehended by his savtege companions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new to the enemy . To his surprise it was adopted , and proved entirely successful . The enemy , thrown into utter confusion by the new mode of Indian warfare , were completely routed . Milfort , however , had not the faintest idea what an Indian battle was ; and when , with their blood-curdling war-whoop and unearthly yells and frantic gestures and gleaming tomahawks , they leaped among their foes , they looked more like painted demons than men . He confesses that he was startled at the strange apparition , and adds , with a naivetd that is irresistible , " it required all the consciousness that I was a Frenchman , and that I was sustaining the honor of France , to keep me from showing any alarm . The different colors with which they painted their bodies rendered them more frightful objects than the painted devils that figure in the ballet of an opera . Several skirmishes and battles took place before the campaign finished , in which he , by his // skill and cool bravery , won the highest praise , and fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chiefs were lavish in their praises and demonstrations of gratitude , which filled M'Gillivray with unbounded delight , and he called him the saviour of his country . Not long after , in conversing on the affairs of the nation , he informed him that he would soon have another opportunity of showing his courage and attachment to the tribes ; for the Americans and Indians had made an incursion into the Creek territory , and they were about fitting out a formidable expedition against them . . This time Milfort had no diffi-. culty in getting himself accepted as a volunteer . The campaign that followed was an import* ant one , and furnished him many opportunities to distinguish himself . On one occasion , when the Indians were about to close with their enemies , he saw that the position which a portion of the warriors had taken would , if maintained , end in certain defeat . He passed fearlessly through the hostile fire , and placing himself at their head swept round through the forest , and falling unexpectedly on the enemy routed them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the critical moment of the battle , and the glorious victory which he had thus been able to secure , completed the ascendency which the former campaign had gone so far toward giving him over the tribe . On the retura of the expedition the warchiefs , relieved entirely from their suspicions , made a glowing report of his services to the council of old men , and spoke in such extravagant terms of his personal bravery that he was unanimously elected Little War-Chief . M'Gillivray was in ecstasy , and publicly declared himself his protector and friend . Milfort had now been two years a resident of the nation , and to fix him still more firmly among them M'Gillivray gave him his only sister for a wife . Having thus obtained a distinguished rank he was determined to prove himself worthy of it . An opportunity , however , did not occur till next year , when an important expedition was undertaken by the young warriors . Invested with the dignity of war-chief he accompanied it as a leader . Sweeping rapidly forward on their war-path they at length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halted , and a council of war was called to decide on the plan of attack . Milfort , by right , formed one of it , but took no part in the deliberations till each had expressed his opinion . He was then called on for his . He had adopted a plan of his own , entirely different from any that had been proposed . It was a novel one to the chiefs , and one they could not fully comprehend ; yet so entirely had Milfort won their confidence that they unhesitatingly fell in with it , but told him that he must take chief command in carrying it out . He did so . He had seen enough of thiAr fighting to know exactly what they could do , and had also become well acquainted with the tactics of the enemy . The result was , he so completely overthrew and routed the enemy that a single battle ended the war , and they returned in triumph to their homes . Peace being restored , Milfort made a tour through the nation to ascertain more thoroughly its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . Clothed with the authority of the chi*fs of the council of old men , and preceded by the fame of his exploits , he was every where received with demonstrations of love and reverence . When the council assembled the next year they determined to give him a new evidence of their esteem and confidence . After discussing the state and prospects of the nation a chief arose and proposed , as wars were frequent and troubles of various kinds surrounded them , that they should elect a grand chief who should take supreme control of their affairs , and he commander-in-chief of the army . The confidence reposed in M'Gillivray 's talents , as well as in his integrity , made him the proper person to receive this high position , and it was unanimously offered him . But he being in feeble health , besides o* a mild and amiable disposition , which made him so averse to battle that he never accompanied any of the warlike expeditions , declined the proffered honor . He told the chiefs , while thanking them for this proof of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustain the fatigues inseparable to war , and if he should accept the place of commander-in-chief he could not always lead them to battle , and hence on the most important occasion they might find themselves without a leader . At the same time he spoke of Milfort 's services , rehearsed his warlike deeds , and reminding them of the confidence they had already reposed in him , proposed they should make him their Tastanegy , or Grand War-Chief . The proposition was at once accepted , and Mufort , without a dissenting voice , was elected Grand War-Chief of the Creek nation . He was absent at the time on business of the tribe , and M'Gillivray dispatched a swift runner for him , with the request to hasten back and receive the high honor that had been awarded him . Milfort , though he felt deeply this touching proof of the confidence of the Indians in him , resolved , notwithstanding , not to accept the position . Returning with all speed he sought an interview with M'Gillivray , and after thanking him warmly for this new evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went direct to the council . He thanked them also for the honor they had done him , but said they ought to choose a chief more experienced in their customs and more acquainted with their wants than he was ; that he was content in having led their brave chiefs and warriors to victory , atid had much rather obey than command . The council deliberated on what he said , but determined , notwithstanding his objections , to // qwq // the allied army had remained since the capitulation of Cornwallis . From thence he went to Philadelphia . and being convinced that the war would soon be over , returned to his warriors , and abandoning the expedition into Georgia led them back to their homes . Not long after he conducted two successful expeditions against General Bowles , who figured so prominently for a while in the affairs of the Seminoles . In 1789 M'Gillivray went to Mobile to make a treaty with the Spanish Governor of Louisiana and M. Mirian the Intendant . Being appointed commissioner-general for . the King of Spain , he wished Milfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter declined ; though afterward , when Carondelet was made Governor-general of Louisiana , he did accept the position . In the mean time an event occurred which made him again summon his warriors to the field of battle . Two old Cr6ek chiefs being on a visit to Georgia , the whites got them drunk , and while in this state formed a treaty with them by which a large tract of land was ceded to Georgia . When the chiefs became sober they refused to own the treaty , which so enraged the Georgians that they seized them and threatened to kill them . This infamous treaty was the cause of much trouble afterward , not only between the Creeks and Georgia , but also between the former and the G&amp;ieral Government . Milfort , indignant at the foul outrage , did not wait to make complaints to Washington , but placing himself at the head of a large band of warriors fell on the settlements with resistless fury . The whites flew to arms , but were beaten in almost every encounter ; and for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Indians astonished the Americans , and they attributed the skill and energy with which the avenging blow was delivered and followed up to the great ability of M'Gillivray . One of the papers of the day , speaking of the war , said of M'Gillivray : " With what address has he conducted this unhappy war against us ! If it were possible to gain his friendship , and get him in our interests , it would be most desirable , for the other Indians would not then dare to make war . Let us then strive to make peace with him . " M'Gillivray became at once a very distinguished man ; his name was a terror throughout the border settlements South ; was often repeated in the halls of Congress and Washington 's cabinet , and became a familiar word in the saloons of Europe ; and yet during the whole war he was never once on the field of battle . History often makes heroes out of very singular material ; but it rarely , as in this case , manufactures one entirely out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of M'Gillivray , he was quietly sitting in his own cabin on the Coosa , attending to his plantation . An unknown French soldier was winning for him a reputation which to this day it is supposed he won for himself . The result was that I7* , Tashington sent commissioners to him , and eventually gave him the rank of Brigadier-General in the American service . It is nevertheless true , strange as it may appear , that M'Gillivray never once led the Creeks to battle ! Let the future historian of Georgia make a note of this , and he will be ahle to solve some things that occurred in the Creek nation , subsequent to the Revolution , which otherwise would remain a mystery . Milfort now saw clearly that the Creeks would have to abandon their lands unless something was speedily done . In the end he designed to have their safety secured by an alliance with France ; but he knew that years must elapse before this could be brought about , if accomplished at all ; and he resolved to form a grand league with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans . The borderers , he saw , must be driven back at once , or their rapid encroachments would inevitably force the Indians to retire . In carrying out h*is plan he visited tribe after tribe , as Tecumseh did afterward ; and though he did not arouse them by his eloquence , he showed so clearly that unless a common alliance was made they would all be compelled to give up their lands and abandon their homes , that he met with but little strong opposition ; and before the year was out had formed one of the most formidable Indian leagues that was ever made on this continent . Rumors of this at length reached the seat of government atNew York , and caused much anxiety to Washington . The powerful Southern tribes , joined together and led by such a bold and skillful leader as the one who had recently spread terror through Georgia , would wage a war that would cost much blood and treasure to bring to a successful termination . M'Gillivray being nominally the chief of the nation , was supposed to be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mean time the two officers which had been sent as commissioners to treat with him reached the hostile tribe . Luckily for them Milfort , when they arrived , was absent at Pensacola , occupied in distributing the annual presents of the Spaniards to the Indians . M'Gillivray immediately sent for him ; but the commissioners had evidently seen and heard enough in their interviews with the chiefs to convince them that Milfort would oppose all their propositions ; and hence they pressed M'Gillivray with all their power to depart with them immediately for New York , where he could talk over the affairs of the nation with Washington . The more he showed a disinclination to commit himself in any way until Milfort 's return , the more anxious they were to hasten his departure . They had found a different state of things from what they had anticipated . M'Gillivray , instead of being the great and warlike chief he had been represented to be , was a man in feeble health and of a peaceful disposition , and evidently entirely under the influence of this Milfort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this concession to the prejudices of the Indians came too lat* . They would not be appeased , and a second grand council was called to deliberate on the matter . After a long and stormy debate it was decided that M'Gillivray should die . The man whom they had so reverenced , in whose hands they had placed with entire confidence the interests of the nation , had now fallen so low that nothing but his blood could appease them . Milfort , as much as he disapproved of M'Gillivray 's course , stood firmly by him in this terrible crisis ; but be saw clearly that he could not , with all his influence , stem the tide of opposition ; and so , to avert from his friend the doom that awaited him , he secretly hurried him off to Mobile . After remaining here some time M'Gillivray went to Pensacola , where he died , without seeing the treaty he had made with Washington* ratified by his chiefs . Thus perished one whom writers have been pleased to call the Talleyrand of Alabama . The people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delusion as to his character while he lived , and history has prolonged it since his death . Milfort , the Frenchman , not M'Gilliviny , the mixed breed , was the life and soul of the Creek nation . Washington , when he gave M'Gillivray his commission of Brigadier-General , presented him with a superb pair of epaulets which he had received from the court of France through Lafayette . These the humbled chieftain gave to Milfort , who after found use for them in a way he little dreamed of then . Washington , finding the treaty he had made with M'Gillivray not ratified by the nation , sent another commissioner , Souanne , to bring the matter to a satisfactory adjustment . The agent remained six months among the Creeks , trying in every way to win over Milfort , to whom the chiefs now looked for advice and counsel . But the promises and flatteries that had proved so potent with M'Gillivray were lost on the resolute Frenchman , and Sonanne departed without having accomplished his object . Out of his failure grew the famous Yazoo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gigantic swindle on the Indians . In the mean time the French Revolution rolled on  --  the head of Louis XVI . fell on the scaffold , and France b*came a republic under the control of the Directory . Soon Bonaparte was elected First Consul , and the war with Spain commenced . The news of this important event at length reached the quiet settlement of Mobile . Milfort at once saw that the time for carrying out his long - meditated project had come . Retaining his French citizenship , his first step was to send in his resignation as commissioner of Spain to the Governor of Louisiana . The reason he gave was , that the two countries being at war he could no longer act as agent of the latter . The Governor accepted it , complimenting him at the same time on the fidelity and ability with which he had executed his trust . Having thus cut himself loose from the Spanish authority , Milfort resolved to visit France and lay before the Government his grand scheme for reannexing Lou'isiana . First , he sat down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully gathered in the form of a memorial . He then laid his plan before the Creek chiefs , saying , that when he had accomplished his object he would return , and , with France as their ally , bid defiance to the Americans . Bidding them farewell , with much wise counsel as to the course they should pursue till his return , he repaired to Mobile and bought a ship in which he set sail for Philadelphia . On his arrival there he sought an interview with citizen Fauchet , who then represented the French republic at the seat of the Government 9f the United States , and laid before him his plan in detail . Fauchet fell in with it at once , and offered to give him a free passage to France . This , however , Milfort declined , and finding a vessel bound for Bordeaux about to sail , paid his passage in her , and embarked for his native country . Fauchet had given him a strong letter of recommendation to Cambac*res , one of the consuls of the Committee of Public Safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambac*res received him cordially , and gave him a letter to the Secretary , who , though he approved of his plan , told him nothing could be done until negotiations for peace with Spain should commence . The Government would then make the cession of Louisiana one of the conditions of the treaty . About six months after Charles Lacroix , the Minister of Foreign Affairs , presented him to the Directory . This body gave him a special audience , and listened with the liveliest interest to the details of his project . They saw at once a way was opened for France to recover the best part of the possessions she had lost in America . Milfort 's report of his explorations of the Mississippi and its tributaries-his account of the growing commerce and vast capabilities and future wealth of the great valley of the West , filled them with wonder , and opened in prospect a new empire to the republic . Thus was born and eventually carried out the project of obtaining once more possession of Louisiana . It has doubtless often occurred to the reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perils as she was on the Continent , turned her attention to America ? Here is the solution . While Europe was rocking above the earthquake before which the Bourbon dynasty had gone down , a solitary Frenchman in the wilds of the South formed and matured that plan which well-nigh changed the current of our history . That Louisiana would ultimately have been ours no one will deny ; but by what process the result would have been reached it is impossible to conjecture . Having thus succeeded to the extent of his most sanguine wishes , Milfort intimated to the Government that he would like to return to the Creek nation . The Directory replied that it // was necessary he should remain in France until his scheme should he consummated . But he told them that all his property was among the Indians , and that in France he had no means of support . To obviate this difficulty they made him Brigadier-General . The wandering Frenchman searching for adventure in our Southern wilds had risen by his energy to be head war-chief of the Creek nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Brigadier - General in the grand army of France . Holding this high position , he remained year after year waiting the progress of events to bring about the accomplishment of his scheme . At length it was announced that Louisiana was once more in the possession of France . A grand expedition was immediately set on foot to take possession of it , and convey a French colony of 25,000 men thither under command of Marshal Victor . Milfort threw himself with his accustomed energy into it , and soon , to his great joy , he saw the fleet which was to bring the consummation of his years of labor spreading its sails for the Atlantic . His dream of success , however , was dashed in the very moment of its fulfillment . The fleet was blockaded in the port of Ostend , and before it could be released Louisiana was sold to the United States for $15,000,000 . This was in 1803 . Here ends Milfort 's own account of his life and adventures . The remainder is briefly told in the Biographie Universelle . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tranquillity , a single wife taking the place of his former harem among the Creeks . Then came the invasion of France in 1814 . The Allies , leaving their rear and cutting their lines of communication . A levy of " corps-francs " was raised , and Milfort was appointed their commander . But he harassed the peaceable peasantry more than he did the enemy . After the close of this short and unhappy campaign he quitted Mdzi*res , and took up his residence at Vouzier*s , where he did nothing during the second invasion beyond defending his own house , which he had transformed into a kind of fortress . Abandoning the lower floor , he masked the staircase by a palisade of bushes , and concentrated his arms upon the next floor . These , consisting of three double-barreled guns , served by Madame Milfort and . a servant , were to cover the doorway , while the General himself defended the palisade . A company of Hulans entered the house one night , and , finding the lower floor deserted , began to light a fire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palisade on the stairs , received a sabre stroke from Milfort , and ran back to his comrades , who laughed at him . Another coming up met the same fate , whereupon the whole company took to flight , rushing pell-mell from the court-yard . This was just what Milfort had been waiting for . The three muskets sent their balls among the fugitives in the narrow passage . But , notwithstanding his victory , Milfort thought it prudent next day to seek safety within the walls of Mdzi*res . He died there in 1817 , leaving a young son , without any fortune . His widow , implicated in a charge of swindling , was sentenced to several years ' imprisonment . The career of Milfort reads more like a tale of romance than actual history . Unknown as it was to America , it had an important bearing on her destiny . But for him , one of two things would have occurred , and possibly both  --  a war with Spain , or the occupation of the mouth of the Mississippi by the English . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military preparations were already being made for its conquest by us , in consequence of the violation by Spain of her treaty stipulations . A forcible seizure of it was inevitable , which would have precipitated a war with Spain , which in turn might have hastened the war with England , that took place nine years afterward . At that time New Orleans could not have made the gallant and successful defense she did under Jackson . Again , the possession of Louisiana by France rendered its ultimate conquest by England almost certain if the former had endeavored to hold it . Bonaparte saw this , and it was to Prevent so great a catastrophe that he transferred it so readily to the United States . With England in possession of the mouth of the Mississippi , the war of 1812 would have taken a different course and had a different issue . Stretching her arms across from New Orleans to Canada , she would have given the Western Indians tenfold the assistance she did . Jackson 's campaign against the Creeks would probably have had a different termination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force that the Western frontiers coulduot have resisted . Mr. Benton , in 1830 , in a speech in Congress referring to this event , and the result if the French fleet had reached Louisiana , said : " Put it on either foot-Louisiana remains a French or becomes a British posse sion. in the first contingency we must have become the ally or the enemy of France . The system of Bonaparte admitted of no neutrals ; and our alternatives would have been between falling into the train of his Continental system , or maintaining a war against him on our own soil . We can readily decide that the latter would have been most honorable ; but it is hard to say which would have been most fatal to our prosperity , and most disastrous to our republican institutions . In the second contingency , and almost certain one , we should have had England established on our western , as well as on our northern frontier ; and I may add our southern alco ; for Florida , as the proper ally of France , would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France and Spain , and a desirable one , after the acquisition of Louisiana , and as easily taken as wished for , the vessel that brought home the news of the victory of Tra. falgar being sufficient to summon and reduce the places of Mobile , Pensacola , St. Marks , and St. Augustine . This nation , thus established upon three sides of our territory , the most powerful of maritime powers , jealous of our commerce , panting for the dominion of the seas , unscrupulous in the use of savage allies , and nine years afterward to be engaged in a war with us I The results of such a position would have been , * the loss for ages and centuries of the navigation of the Mi*sissippi , the permanent occupation of the Gulf of Mexico by the British fleet , the consequent // control of the West Indies , and the ravage of our frontiers by savages in British pay . These would have been the permanent consequences , to say nothing of the fate of the late war , commenced with our enemy encompassing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean in front with her proud navy , victorious over the combined fleets of France and Spain , and swelled with the ships of all nations . From these calamitous results the acquisition of Louisiana delivered us . " Such mighty and fearful results did a French adventurer among a tribe of Southern Indians come within a hair's-breadth of securing . The accidental blockade of the French fleet in a Dutch port , and afterward the bold act of Jefferson , which be himself believed to be unconstitutional , alone prevented this . What prophet could have seen any connection between that solitary , half-starved wanderer in the wilds of Alabama and such historical changes ? Unknown as he is , Milfort played an important role in our bistory , and came very near playing a still more important one . It is only the surface of the broad stream of human events that we commonly see ; the deep under-currents are seldom known .
