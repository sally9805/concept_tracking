ARTICLE VIIL-OUR UNITY AS A NATION . Do we fully realize all that is expressed by these simple words ? Do we even now comprehend all that we shall lose if this unity shall pass away definitely and beyond the hope of recall ? We have been a great , proud people , springing into existence with almost magical rapidity ; able to take our place among the nations of the world , and make our flag respected wherever it might wave . With an ever-expanding territory ; with an ever-increasing commerce ; possessing in the bosom of onr own land all varieties of climate ; and accustomed to look on the peace and prosperity of our country as things immutable ; how will it please ns to have the boundary of the cluster of States remaining in the Union cut down to the Pennsylvania line ? For , in the event of the final recognition of the Sontheru Confederacy , it would not be easy to hold back from them Maryland and Delaware . How shall we endure the loss of pre8tige which will reduce ns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the loyal States of Kentucky , and Kansas , and the divided State of Missouri , dragged from ns by force , or , if they succeed in remaining in the Union , exposed to the continual attacks of the surrounding rebel States ? In fine , how shall we , of the Northern and Eastern States , exist , separated by only an imaginary line , from a people who openly profess hatred and contempt for our characteristics and our institutions ; and whose ambition will cause their interests to clash with ours at every moment ? For we should be wrong to imagine that , after a formal recognition of their separate existence as a nation , our relations would assume an amicable form ! A thousand motives for discord would arise continually ; and our dissensions and wars would be interminable . Those who know the spirit of the South can never be the victims of such an illusion . So completely has slavery undermined the tendency of our institutions , that the slave States , to-day , are far more inclined to feudalism than to republicanism. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of antagonism to ourselves ; and it may be asserted , with all truth and justice , that so indifferent have these people become to the honor of the American name , so false to the heritage of their fathers , that they would gladly accept the protectorate of any foreign power . In contemplatin* this disloyalty , not to a Government but to their nationality , we pause and ask in amazement , what could have produced such a change ? What could thus have perverted the hearts and minds of a portion of our countrymen ? We are in the midst of the great crisis of our national history . We are passing through an epoch of transition ; such epochs as are recorded in the annals of all nations , and from which they never emerge as they have entered them . Every event of this kind has an end to work out ; a mission to accomplish ; and takes its origin in a great underlying cause , which is but too apt to escape for a long time general recognition . Thus , if we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolt of certain States , and their war upon the Union , very many would reply , " Abolitionism is the cause * and yet , in this , how greatly would they err , for 8lavery , and not Abolitionisin , is the basis and motive power of this rebellion . Without entering into the merits or demerits of the institution , it is enough to state that it is one which the unanimous voice of civilized humanity is every day more and more loudly condemning . The Southern States , at the commencement of our career as a nation , were fully aware that slavery was an evil , and a clog on the progress of any people where it exists . They acknowledged this freely then ; urging in extenuation that they had been hampered with the institution , and that it had not been established among them by any will of their own . We find the following in Winterbotham 's View of the American United States , published in 1795 . It shows conclusively how greatly the spirit of Southern slave-holders has changed since that date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas of the people are , in general , of a peculiar cast ; the soul often becomes dark and narrow , and assumes // a tone of savage brutality . Such , at this day , are the inhabitants of Barbary and the West Indies . But , thank God ! nothing like this has yet disgraced an American State . We may look for it in Carolina , but we shall be disappointed . The most elevated and liberal Carolinians abhor slavery ; they will not delude themselves by attempting to vindicate it ; he who would encourage it , abstracted from the idea of bare necessity , ( there can be no necessity of acknowledged wrong ) , is not a man , he is a brute in human form . For , disguise thyself as those wilt , 0 slavery , still thou art a bitter draught ! , It is interest , louder than the voice of reason , which alone exclaims in thy favor . " Humility , however , though a Christian virtue , is not a general characteristic of human nature , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Southern population , and they soon wearied of apologizing for an institution which they imagined to be for their interest to perpetuate . Self-sufficiency and arrogance succeeded ; for when we have once resolved on pursuing the wrona , it is far easier to assert that we are right than to prove it . Meanwhile , the Free States , by the same obedience to a natural law , had moved in exactly the opposite direction . From indifference they had passed to a comprehension of the moral evil of slavery , and this , of course , engendered a tacit , if not avowed dislike and condemnation of it . However , to a large party in these States , this spirit was obnoxious . They would have stopped the progressive movement of mind , and rolled back the popular sentiment . " Better to leave these things alone , " was the cry . True , it might have been better , according to this way of reasoning , if there had never been a Luther , or a French revolution , or an uprising of our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God-ordained progress of humanity that these things should fail to be at their proper time . Then came the aggressive and exacting spirit of the slave power , growing in strength and audacity every day ; not content to be and remain what it was , but , following the bent of despotism everywhere , desirous of engrossing all power , and becoming the ruling element of the country . The growth of opposition to this spirit in the South was very slow of development in the North . It was continually held in check by the law-and-order-loving character of the // people ; by their appreciation of the magnitude and importance of the question , and the immense complication of difficulties that lay in the way of its solution . It is owing to these causes that we have for years been striving to reconcile the two antagonistic systems , which have for ages agitated the world We have claimed to believe in freedom ; we have made it our boast that we have proved before the face of the world , despite the incredulity and sneering comments of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are capable of ruling themselves in liberty and harmony ; and yet here , in the very midst of a nation proud of their freedom and enlightenment , has existed , and exists , a relic of the darkest and most absolute despotism . We have believed that we might permit a system at variance with everything around it ; an anomaly which has been the creator of anomalies , such as the existence of a Denmocratic pro-slavery party . We have striven to wre8t harmony from these discordant elements , and we have persisted in refusing to believe that from the working out of a natural law , as inevitable , and as much beyond our control as the great ocean-tides , the two systems diverged from the outset , and that no point of contact , no sympathy , no bond in common was in the nature of things possible . We do not as a people realize this yet . A dim consciousness is dawning in many new quarters , but , in general , though we know that we are sundered , and that our nationality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of the present convulsed state of our country . IDe Tocqueville long ago perceived in the South elements dangerous to the Union . He says " Of all the Americans the Southerners should most desire the Union , for they alone of all the rest would suffer in being abaadoned to themselves ; and yet they are the only ones who threaten the existence of the Union . " He doubted , too , the power of the Federal Government to maintain itself in case a dissolution should be attempted ; but he did not count on the love of country that springs up insensibly and inevitably in the heart ; nor on the areat nece88ity of our oneness as a people , which now , for the first time during our existence as a nation , we have been aroused to feel . // The mother country is putting forth her mightiest energies to protect the birthright of her children ; and is it not our duty to ponder well on the cause that is arming brother 's hand against brother ; and which has long since destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one country , one religion , one language ? There is a vague idea abroad that this rebellion once crushed we shall return to our previous condition ; but this is impossible . Neither nations nor individuals ever pass through a great stirring experience and remain what they were . Had it been possible for things to remain in statu quo ; had the slave-power been less exacting , or the spirit of opposition to it less strong in the free States , we might have been better pleased to live on tranquilly , leaving the great inevitable contest to our posterity ; but this could not be ; and if not possible in the past , still less will it be so in the future . The step of a decided rupture was a thing that needed years of preparation : hereafter it will be but a continuation of an old feud , ever increasing in bitterness and rancor . While then these momentous events are passing , it becomes us , the People , to be equal to the emergency , and not strive by lagging behind to detain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with great loss , and infinite suffering and toil , in quelling this rebellion , leaving the institution of slavery intact , what shall we have gained ' ? The South will have suffered a double humiliation ; - that of a defeat , and the old consciousness that they possess an institution that in. the opinion of the free States is such an evil and shame that its extension can not be permitted . Even should there be a Union party at the South , strong enough to reconstruct the Union on its old basis , will there be there men wise and just and moderate enough to tamely accept this position , which it must be admitted is humiliating , and continue to love the Union ? Is it logical to believe that a people , who on this very ground have revolted , without awaiting actual grounds for complaint against the Federal Government , will so entirely change in views , and even in nature , as to subsequently acquiesce willingly in the measures which even in theory provoked their revolt ? // If not , if the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as conquered provinces , and establish a military despotism over them ? Would not such a course be entirely incongruous with the nature of our Government , and revolting to the liberal sentiments of our people ? And if not this , what then ? Shall we at last , after having won the victory with such struggle and self-sacrifice , consent to the independence of these States , that is to say , to the dismemberment of our country ? We shall be obliged finally to look these questions frankly in the face ; why not do so now ? Why not recognize and acknowledge at once the fact that until the cause of our dissensions is removed , our harmonious nnit.y as a people is an impossAlity 2 " Let the cause be removed ! " the answer comes back . " Let us of the free States silence the Abolition pulpit and press . Cease to meddle with the institutions of the South and we shall have unity ! " We say " yes , " most cordially . Let us be consistent . If we will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pulpit and the press ; turn back the course of ' public opinion ; throw open the territories to slavery ; not only this , let the master take his slaves where lie will , North , East or West , and let them be recognized everywhere as his property , and then we shall have unity ; the unity of retrogression and despotism it is true , but better even that than the vain effort to bind together elements that have no affinity ! That the existence of slavery in our country has ever been considered by all minds as an element of danger to our peace and prosperity as a nation is demonstrated by the words of all who have ever written on the subject . Dc Tocqueville says : " The most formidable of all the ills which threaten the future existence of the United States arises from the presence of a black population upon its territory ; and in contemplating the causes of the present embarrassments , or of the future dangers of the United States , the observer is invariably led to consider this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bug since , before the slave power had commenced its exactions , before it had ventured to assert in the face of Christianity and civilization that slavery is a God-appointed institution , alike beneficial to master and // slave , and consequently to be propagated as much as possible : before the springing up of the irrepressible antagonism in the free States which such an attitude could not fail to engender : in a word , before it became a question of abject submission to tyrannical exaction , or the utter demolition of the system which produced such results . This is absolutely and unavoidably the issue . We know that every step of human progress has been accomplished by these terrible upheavings , this fierce battle between the Old and the New : the efforts of progressive humanity to cast off one by one , as they discover them , the clinging errors of a darker period , and emerge into the brightness of a newer day . ft is requisite then that the People should have a distinct and comprehensive conception of the purpose , the idea for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they make of this idea their standard , morally convinced of its holiness , its necessity , and are willing to cast aside the errors and prejudices that oppose it , and render vain all their efforts , a contest like this is but a wanton destruction of human life , and a wanton waste of the products of human toil . And it seems as though Providence itself had presented the occasion for the solution of the problem which has so long baffled the wisest statesmen of our nation . We have long known that slavery is an evil ; it is an incubus on the nation ; but how should we get rid of it ? This has been our dilemma hitherto . Let the revolted States be forced to return to their allegiance , and we shall be , with regard to this question , in exactly the same position as before . The Federal Government will no longer have the right to resort to measures legitimated by revolutionary exigencies , and the opportunity for action will have been lost until a new revolt shall again present it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the opportunity has offered itself for emancipating the slaves , not on the Abolition principle , for this , however just in the abstract , becomes unjust in practice , but simply in accordance with the law of confiscation according to the code of all civilized nations under similar circumstances . And it is this fact that makes this opportunity so particularly favorable , and marks this as // the pre-iminently happy epoch for the accomplishment of this purpose . Southern property is vested almost wholly in slaves , and if these are to be excepted from the law of confiscation , very little will be left to come under it . If the whole matter is made to turn on the point that only property used in the prosecution of the rebellion can be lawfully confiscated , no species of property is so completely and conclusively covered by this clause as the slaves . In tilling a rebel master 's fields , in attending to his house , in obeying his orders , they are ministering to the maintenance of the originators of the rebellion , without which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the master need money for the furtherance of his plans he sells his negroes . It is difficult to conceive in what better way property could be employed in the furtherance of rebellion ; for if we insist on reducing the formula to its literal sense , the only actual , material property used directly in the war , is the general equipage of officers and men . The slave owner claims his slaves as his property , in which he has invested so many thousands of dollars . We simply take him on his own ground in confiscating them to the Government , which , representing the Republican principle , can make no use of money vested in human beings , and consequently emancipates them . This is the simple and feasible solution of the great problem ; the short path that will lead us outside the stupendous wall that has so long hemmed in slavery . ILlut here a very natural inquiry presents itself , what is to become of these four millions of blacks suddenly loosened from bondage ? Are we to intermingle with them , and acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect ; and they would be justly so were there any grounds for such fears . Nothing is more improbable , more i ? npossilfte , we might say , than the general amalgamation of the white and black races ; and nothing more opposed to the natural order of things than the recognition on termus of equality of a race universally conceded to be inferior , and in addition to this just emerged from the degrading position of slavery . There exists in the white race an instinctive and insurmountable aversion to the black . Apart from the contempt with which we naturally view a race // condemned to servitude by their lack of capacity , there is something repulsive to us in the physique of the black ; and those who have not been familiarized by the habit of contact shrink involuntairily from their touch as though they belonged to a different species . Indeed , if we are to base an opinion on the most marked indications of nature , we should say that the two races were not intended to live together . The white can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the African ; and his health is enfeebled and his life shortened in the tropical regions which most nearly approximate to the former 's natal latitude . All the tastes , habits and inclinations of the negro are purely material suited to the indolence of the physical life of the tropics , where the energy and enterprise of the white find no adequate field . In fine , the direct antagonism of the two races on every conceivable point of comparison proves conclusively that the Creator , in placing the black on a point so remote from the rest of the world , and so unsuited for the habitation of any other people ; and in denying them all migratory instincts , intended them to be a race apart , for what purpose the developments of the inscrutable future can alone reveal . This then , the great natural difference , and the repugnance growing out of it , is the impassible barrier to amalgamation . Moreover , as an additional guarantee , we have the fact that the prejudices of caste , even among our own race , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are only eradicated with the greatest difficulty , and by imperceptible degrees . The man or w6man who has been our servant can never be acknowledged by us in the interior of our hearts as an entire equal ; and even their posterity suffer , in some degree , in our estimation . The distinctions of education and custom endure long after the laws which represented them have been abolished . The position of social inferior , provided it be not accompanied by the denial of equal rights before the law , is always quietly and contentedly accepted ; for people generally have an instinctive , unreasoned , perhaps unconfessed , consciousness that social distinctions arise from the working out of a law inherent in humanity . There never was but one attempt to bring all classes to the same level , and that was a phrenzy // and a failure . Arguing from this fact , it does not seem at all probable that the suddenly freed slaves would make the absurd demand to be considered the equals of their former masters , or peril their newly acquired liberty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this very connection iDe Tocqueville says " Thus it is in the United States , that the prejudice which repels the negroes seems to increase in proportion as they are emancipated , and inequality is sanctioned by the manners , while it is effaced from the laws of the country . But if the relative position of the two races which inhabit tbe United States is such as I have described , it may be asked why the Americans have abolished slavery in the north of the Union , why they maintain it in the south , and why they aggravate its hardships there ? The answer is easily given . It is not for the good of the negroes but for that of the whites that measures are taken to abolish slavery in the United States . " There remains to be combatted yet another forcible objection urged by the opponents of emancipation . The slaves , say they , yielding to their natural indolence , will refuse to labor in a state of freedom . When to this is replied , . that the blacks must either work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder rather than toil . This being the general view of the case , and it having been established as a fixed fact that the whites can not cultivate the Southern soil without danger to life , it is asserted that to emancipate the slaves would be to sweep away at a blow all elements of prosperity at the South . It does not require much reflection to detect the fallacy of these arguments . In the first place , even while conceding the natural indolence of the blacks , do they not at the North gain a livelihood as honestly and ' decently on an average as the lower class of Irish ? And is it not the most arrant folly to suppose that they would prefer to incur the penalties of crime , death , or imprisonment , rather than continue the labor to which they have been accustomed for years ? If this reasoning be sound , why should we not suppose that the blacks would gladly accept the improved condition of free laborers , and enable the planters of the South to cultivate their products as hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for all economists agree that free labor is cheaper than slave labor . In a political pamphlet written by G. de Edlice , published // in France in 1846 , and entitled the " Immediate and Complete Emancipation of the Slaves , " there are such powerful and eloquent arguments urged with such honesty and directness of purpose , that we can not forbear quoting some passages as confirmation of opinions we have expressed . " But the slaves , say you , are not fit for freedom . To emancipate them all at once would he to give them a fatal gift , and in the desire to deliver them too rapidly from a had condition , we should plunge them into a worse one . They would cease to work because they associate the idea of servitude and shame with labor ; aged persons , women encientes , and children would he ahandoned ; they would live in a state of vagabonda0e and distrust ; neglecting all religious instruction , and retrograding towards harharism . Let us then first teach the slaves to hear the weight of liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopting all such measures as may seem likely to ameliorate their condition , and when they are in a fit state for emancipation , we shall he happy to accord it them . " * * * * * * * * * * " Let us accept this argument as sound , and try to discover its real merit . " The immediate emancipation which we ask for the slaves , is not a lawless and limitless emancipation . There will he laws in our colonies , the strength of the public , a police , and tribunals . There will exist , in fine , all the means hy which a State protects its existence , and its durahility . The newly freed slaves can therefore always he prevented from committing depredations , or from changing the form of the Government . As to the rest , the English islands have never heen so peaceahie as since the day of the emancipation . There has been no attempt whatever to interrupt the established order of things ; on the contrary , so much have individual crimes diminished everywhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' perfect the obedience to the laws , that the garrisons have been greatly reduced . If any one shall reply to this by reminding me of the massacres of Santo Domingo , I will advise him to read the history . I have no time to combat errors founded on the most stupid ignorance . " What is meant , then , by the allegation that the slaves are not ready for freedom ? Is it to be believed that the slaves from their lack of industry would be incapable of providing for the wants of existence ? They perform now almost all the labor ; they suffice for the maintenance of the colonists and their own ; they know how to manage the spade and the hoe , how to cultivate the soil , gather the harvest , and prepare sugar for the market . Many , also , have trades ; and when it be necessary they will be able to practice all the mechanical employments used in civilized society . " This is not the question , ' you will reply . We grant that they know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " How then ! Will they not have to earn their bread ? and how can they earn it without labor ? ' " It is not true that the emancipated negroes would take advantage of their liberty to reduce their wants to the barest necessities . The experience of the English colonies has proved quite the contrary . The newly freed slaves have not gone to wander in the depths of the woods . Some have continued to work // on the plantations ; others have bought little pieces of ground , built houses , and founded villages ; thus commencing to form that class of small proprietors which constitute everywhere the most moral and useful part of the population . Can such a beneficial result be complained of ? and since the aifranchised slaves become honest and industrious peasants , will it still be asserted that they are not fit for the exercise of liberty ? * * * I* * * * * * * " Let us suppose the worst . The day after the act of emancipation , there would be a floating and uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitation , the mass would subside to their level , only assuming an improved condition of spiritual and material order . " Believe me , the best education for liberty is liberty itself ; there is no preparation for it possible ; it is only by its exercise that we become worthy of it . Nothing can be given to the slave that will really civilize him , whatever measures we may take for his protection , so long as he remains a slave . It is the possession of man by man that must be abolished , abolished entirely by declaring it like the slave trade , odious and infamous . Everything short of this that may be done will be null and void in the application . " Olrnsted , ill his Journey to the Seaboard Slave States , relates the following conversation which he had with a slave on this subject , which tends singularly to confirm this view of the matter . " Well , now , would n't you rather live on such a plantation than to be free , William ? " " Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , yes , sir , I d like it better to be free ! I would that , master . " " Why would you ? " " Why , you see , master , if I was free-if I wasfree , I d have all my time to myself . I d rather work for myself . I d like dat better . " " But , then , you know , you d have to take care of yourself , and you d get poor . " " No , sir , I would not get poor , I would get rich ; for you see , master , then I d work all the time for myself . " " Suppose all the black people on your plantation , or all the black people in the country were made free at once , what do you think would become of them ? - what would they nil do , do you think ? You do n't suppose there would be much sugar raised , do you ? " " Why , yes , master , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people do ? Would n't dey hab to work for dar libben ? and de wite people own all de landwar dey goin to work ? Dey hire demself right out again , and work all de same as before . And den when dey work for demself , dey work harder dan dey do now to get more wages  --  a heap harder , I think so , sir . I would do so , sir . I would work for hire . I do n't own any land , I hat to work right away again for massa. " // P. S. Frousard , entitled La Cause des Esciaves , the author commenting ably on this subject , quotes a remark of IMI . Poivre : " Free labor is the foundation of abundance and prosperity in agriculture ; and I have never seen this branch of industry flourish save in the countries where the rinhts of man are recognized . The earth , which yields with such prodigality to free labor , seems to become barren beneath the compulsory toil of slaves . The Creator of nature has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and given him the earth to cultivate with the sweat of his brow , but in liberty . " Then , in confirmation of IMI . Poivre 's opinion , IMI . Frousard adds : " It seems certain that the solidity of the State would be strengthened , and its revenue increased , if free labor were employed in the cultivation of the sugarcane and coffee plant in America , as the vine and olive are cultivated in Frnnce , or the sugar-cane in Cochin-China and Bengal . This is the strongest argument that can be adduced in favor of the emancipation of the slaves . When this great question shall be examined with a more profoundly analytical attention than I am able to give it , let our administrators compare what our colonies do now with what they mi , , ht do under a new order of things , and they will perceive that in America as in Europe , personal liberty is the principle of national wealth as well as of individual happiness . That without it there can be neither patriotism , nor safety , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouragement for manufacture . " A plantation can be cultivated far more profitably by free labor than by slave . A slave , ill-fed , ill-treated , and over-worked , without encouragement in his labor , without interest in his own success , must inevitably work slowly , since there is nothing to attach him to his master , and he detests his own condition . A free man , on the contrary , works for his own sustenance and that of his family . He will naturally do all that is possible to obtain the good will of the employer who gives him bread , so that he may continue to engage his services The slave , condemned to groan through life beneath the yoke of slavery , and hopeless of ever seeing his condition improved , is consequently devoid of ambition and energy . He will do only what he is obliged to do in order to escape punishmeat , and far from desiring to cater to the cupidity of his master , he is rejoiced whenever he can balk it . The free man is afraid of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the hope of advancement , he is prompted to labor by the most powerful motives . He does not need the severe surveillance of an overseer to oblige him to do his duty . Do we not notice a great difference between daily workmen , and workmen by the job ? The latter has no need to be watched ; the hope of earning more animates and encourages him ; while the other , having sold his services for a definite time , works with more indifference and though he receives less wages , he becomes in the end less profitable to his employer . " // labor at the South , let us be permitted in the first place to quote onco more from De Toccjueville . We can not have the opinion of a more eminent and impartial writer . " Many of the Americans even assert that within a certain latitude the exertions which a negro can make without danger are fatal to them ; but I do not think that this opinion , which is so favorable to the tudolence of the inhabitants of Southern regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union are not hotter than the South of Italy and Spain , and it may be asked why the European can not work as well there as in the two latter countries . If slavery has been abolished in Italy and in Spain without causing the destruction of the masters , why should not the same thing take place in the Union ? " In this view De Tocqueville is confirmed by many who have witnessed life at the South and in the tropics . In Cuba , where the meridional sun pours down its burning , overpowering rays , the railroads are laid entirely by Irishmen ; and on the plantations the exposure and fatigue of the mayoral ( overseer ) are almost equal to that of the slaves . We may therefore safely conclude , until we have sonic more convincing proof , that there is far more of plausible pretext than of truth in these assertions . iWere slavery abolished at the South its fields would be peopled and re-peopled by the emigrant population that swarms in the large cities of the North ; a population oftentimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of obtaining employment ; and who would gladly run the imagined risk to better their condition . With the tide of emi6 ration that would flow Southward , it might be that crc long black labor would be to a great degree superseded ; and in this case it would seem a natural consequence that the blacks should move on towards the tropical latitudes so much more in consonance with their nature and inclinations . Santo Domingo and Hayti would doubtless , in the course of time , absorb , through the medium of voluntary emigration , the larger portion of the negroes on this continent ; and thus at last deliver us from the incubus of a black population in our midst . The contest , if thus decided , will leave us stronger as a nation than ever before , for we shall not only have got rid of our dcments of discord , but we shall also have vindicated the supremacy of the Federal over the fractional State Governments . The doctrine of State rights , as opposed to the ruling power of the whole , has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation . It is an idea which debilitates instead of strengthening , by substituting petty jealousies for a noble nationa* pride . That even in the early days of the iRepublic this spirit was condemned by patriots is evinced by the subjoined paragraph of a letter addressed to Washington by James Duane " I once flattered myself that the dignity of our Government would have borne some proportion to the illustrious achievements by which it was successfully established ; but it is to be deplored that Federal attachment , and a sense of national obligation , continue to give place to vain prejudices in favor of the independence and sovereignty of the individual States . " Let those who , infected by this false doctrine , doubt our right to enforce obedience from the revolted States , read the following lines and learn the opinion of the great , wise father of our conntry on this subject From Governor Lee to Washington in 1794 , alluding to the insurrection in the western part of Pennsylvania " My grief for the necessity of pointing the bayonet against the breasts of our countrymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your decision to compel immediate submission to the authority of the laws , and by my own apprehensions of my inadequacy to the trust you have been pleased to honor me with . I never expected to see so strange a crisis ; much less to be called to the command of an army ; on the judicious direction of which may perhaps depend our national existence . But being ready to give my aid on the awful occasion , I was willing to take any part in the measures you might think proper to order for quelling the insurrection without regard to rank or station . " " By their fruits ye shall know them , " said the holy Nazarene , and this eternal principle is true of all time . The evil tree of slavery has produced naught but accursed fruits . A systeul founded on the absolute denial of human rights , and sustained by the force and terror of despotism , could only be consistent with itself by destroying patriotism and all sense of justice . Those who believe in and uphold this system are like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poisonous tree that their perceptions are obscured . The very atmosphere they breathe is infected , and they can no longer di*tiriguish right from wrong . In vain shall our noblest sons offer up their lives ; in vain shall we each and every one be called on to sacrifice our dearest affections , and our most precious interests , if , after all , the cause of our difficulties is still to remain . All our efforts , all our sufferings , will be but a barren sacrifice . // The administration can of itself make no move in this matter , since it is but the exponent of the people . It is at present lintited to following as far as possible the law already laid down in the Constitution . Nevertheless , at a time like this , all preexisting laws must , to a certain extent , be set aside ; for the laws sufficient for the protection of the country , in times of peace , are not equal to the exigencies of self-protection against revolt in a great struggle for national existence like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but gravely and profoundly , over the great question at issue . It is for them to become convinced that if we do not avail ourselves of the opportunity which now presents itself , for annihilating the sole barrier to our unity as a people , it would be wiser , more consistent , and more humane , to cast down our arms , yield up all foregone conclusions , give up all faith in what we have hitherto held dear and sacred , and let the waves of retrogression sweep over us and bear us back to the ideas of a past age . We know that these things can only be realized by degrees . People are naturally , and to some extent wisely , conservative . They doubt as yet the justice of such a course ; they are incredulous as to its necessity , or even its expediency ; but each day as it rolls away , and each event as it transpires , will bring them nearer and nearer to a juster appreciation of the subject . F*iice , in the pamphlet from which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the abolition of slavery in the French colonies . They are equally applicable to ourselves . " There are three questions to be considered . First , the question of duty . Are we , or are we not , morally obliged to declare the immediate and complete emancipation of the slaves ? Secondly , the question of success . Are we likely to carry out the project of immediate emancipation ? Finally , the question of interest . What will be the result for France aud the colonies from the application of this system ? " I will venture to assert beforehand , that these three questions are closely bound together . The principle of justice is also the principle of strength and utility . In other words , only the desire to perform without delay our duty towards the slaves , can furnish us the necessary means of success , and protect all our true interests . " INo reflective person will be astonished at the intimate connection which we find between the useful and the just . By a great law of Providence , that which // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alL The transitioa from disorder to order may present some difficulties ; but this is of short duration , and the beneficial results lasting . Not one single instance can be cited , since the beginning of the world , in which a people have experienced a permanent injury from being governed in their political system by the eternal laws of morality . " In conclusion , let us be permitted to distinctly state our position , so that we may leave no cause for misconstruction . We do not urge the abolition of the slaves as a means of carrying on the war successfully . Though we deem slavery an outrage of the rights of humanity , and as a great wrong , productive only of evil , yet we would not , in order to abolish it , arm the hand of the semi-barbarous black against our own race . We mean only that as fast as the government which represents our nationality shall triumph ; as fast as the national flag shall wave over the revolted States , the property vested in slaves , of all those found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the slaves consequently freed from bondage . The property of loyal citizens can not , of course , be interfered with , but as there are probably few such , save in the States of Missouri , Kentucky , and Maryland , slavery will have received a shock from this general emancipation from which it can never recover ; and the border States will find themselves under the necessity of voluntarily enfranchising their slaves , since they will have lost all value in the market . Provided , as we all hope and believe , the national arms shall triumph , this programme will be simple and practicable ; but if the people shall not resolve to execute it ; if they shall shrink before the responsibility of a step requisite for the general safety , ours will be but a victory in name which will leave us in no better condition than before the commencement of the war Americans of the United States who love your country , and would fain see its nationality restored , take to your souls the conviction and ponder well upon it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , vain will be your heroic sacrifice of life ; vain all your generous efforts at reconciliation and reconstruction of the Union . Only when our proud flag shall float over freedom in each and every State , shall we be able to realize the aspiration of every patriotic heart-Oun UNITY AS A NATION .
