SOMETHING ABOUT HISTORY . THERE is no kind of writing which is undertaken so much from will and so littIe from instinct as History . It seems the great resource of baffled ambition , of leisure , of minds disciplined rather than inspired , of men with pecuniary means and without professional obligations . Sympathy with or opposition to an author prompts those thus situated to write criticism ; a dominant sentiment inspires poetical composition ; and usually an impressive experience suggests adventure in the field of fiction : but we find educated men , in independent circumstances , not remarkable for sensibility to Nature , acute critical perception , or dramatic talent , whose literary aspirations are vague , and who desire to be occupied eligibly , turn to History as the most available vantage-ground , busy themselves with wars and councils that happened ages ago , - with kings and soldiers , institutions and adventures , politics and dynasties , so far removed from the associations and interests of the hour , that only a scholar 's enthusiasm or ambition could sustain the research or keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective method and motive that chiefly accounts for the numberless inert and the few vital histories . Like any intellectual task assumed without special fitness therefor or motive thereto , - without a comprehensive grasp of mind that impels to historic exploration , - without a patriotic zeal that warms to national heroism ,  --  without , especially , a love of some principle , a conviction of some truth , an admiration of some national development , irresistibly urging the cultivated and ardent mind to seek for the facts , to celebrate the persons , to evolve the truth involved in and manifest through public events , - the annals recorded are but dry chronology , - a monotonous , more or less authentic , perhaps quite respectable , but far from a very important or peculiarly interesting work . Thousands of such cum her the shelves of libraries and fill the pages of catalogues ,  --  dusted once a year , perhaps , to verify a date , to authenticate the details of a treaty , or fix the statistics of a war , but never read consecutively and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer and his book . He undertook the latter in the spirit of a mechanical job ; industry and leariiing may be embodied therein , but no moral life , no human charm ; yet the work is cited with respect , the author enrolled with honor ; - whereas , had he sought in poetry or philosophy , iii a novel or a drama , thus to occupy and celebrate himself with literature , the failure would have been signal , the attempt ignominious . There is , indeed , no safer investment for middling literary abilities than History ; for , if it fail to yield any large harvest of renown , it is comparatively secure from the assaults of ridicule , such as make pretension in other spheres of writing conspicuous . Even in what are considered the successful exemplars in this department of literature , the errors incident to artificiality , the conventional forms of writing , are patent . Only in passages do we recognize that beauty or truth , that reality and genuineness , which so often wholly pervade a poem , a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some point , the flow incident to wilful instead of soulful utterance becomes apparent ; - ambition , pride of opinion , love of display somewhere manifest themselves . It has been said that the chief element of Hume 's mental power was skepticism ; and , singular as it may appear , his doubts about what are deemed the vital interests of humanity gave a charm to his record of her political vicissitudes ; while he made capital of touching " situations , " he displayed his own strength of intellect ; but , with all this , did not write complete and authentic history . And when analyzed , what was the animus of Gibbon 's elabo // rate chronicle ? He " spent his time , his life , his energy , " says a severe , but just critic , " in putting a polished gloss on human tumult , a sneering gloss on human piety . " And who has not felt , in following Macaulay 's animated periods and thorough exposition and illustration of some event , trait , or economy , - in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better it would have been to reserve his brilliant descriptive and keen analytical powers for the grand episodes , the prolific crises , and the leading characters of history , instead of indiscriminately devoting them to a consecutive account of national incidents and persons , both great and small , illustrious and insignificant ? A popular British author of our own day , in order to demonstrate the law of compensation , as regards the literary vocation , cites its inexpensiveness , - arguing , that , whereas the artist must invest capital , however small , in colors , marble , canvas , and studio-hire , and the professional man occupy a costly locality , the author needs but a quire of foolscap and a pen and ink to set up in trade . While there is literal truth in this comparison , the fact is not applicable to historical writing , except in a very limited degree . The preparation of the most successful works in this department , in modern times , has been attended with an outlay impossible to the poor scholar . It has involved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the purchase of rare books and family papers , and sometimes years of busy reference , observation , and study , lucrative only in prospect . The same amount of culture and facile vigor of composition which less prosperous authors expend on a masterly review would suffice to make them famous historians , if blessed with the pecuniary means to seek foreign sources of information , or gather about them scattered and rare materials wherewith to weave a chronicle of the past . Hence , not only has History become the chosen field of writers with no special gift for more individually inspired kinds of literature , but of the educated sons of fortune . Accordingly , it is curious to remark the contrast between the lives of historians and those of poets ; and in the average circumstances of the former there is some justification for the title of an aristocratic guild in letters . Compare Cowper 's humble home at Olney with Gibbon 's elegant library at Lausanne , - the social environment of Hallam , Grote , or Macaulay with the rustic isolation of Wordsworth , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , there can thence be inferred no general rule ; and the very differences in temperament between inventive and reproductive writers suggest a consequent diversity of habits ; but the very idea of historical composition , on an extensive scale and as a permanent occupation , implies the leisure which competency alone yields , the means indispensable for gradual literary achievement , and more or less of the luxury and social position which , when education obtains , usually attend upon these advantages . It results from these considerations that there is no sphere of literature which is so often the refuge of wealthy scholars , idle men of taste , baffled politicians of independent means , ambitious and wellread but not specially gifted citizens who have inherited comfortable estates . It is so dignifled an employment , that it gratifies pride , - so possible without trenchant opinions , that it does not alarm the conservative , - so thoroughly respectable , safe , and capable of being made illustrious , so comparatively easy to the fluent but unoriginal mind , and practicable to follow , when methodically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we can scarcely be astonished at the alacrity with which such voluntary tasks are undertaken or the steadiness with which they are followed ; at the same time , it may be because so few are able to command the means and opportunity , that historical writing is so highly estimated . As a test of intellectual power , a gauge of individual sentiment , an evidence of original genius , it is immeasurably inferior to dramatic , philosophical , or any // of the more personal forms of literature , when inspired by deep convictions , original ideas , or creative imagination . It requires more knowledge than reflection , more patience than earnestness , more judgment than sentiment and those who have raised it to a vital significance and profound beauty and interest have done so by virtue of endowments which , otherwise directed , would have placed them high and firm on the roll of genius : for it is possible to write history without this transcendent gift , - possible to write it respectably without the slightest grandeur or grace of mind , - by virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good sense . We can not imagine Shakspeare tracing out his conception of Hamlet , or giving language to Lear or Miranda , without a soulful experience as far above mere intellectual assiduity as humanity is above mechanism ; we can not think of Milton elaborating his sublime epic , without , in fancy , taking in the studious years , the Italian nights of music , starlight , and high converse , the beautiful youth , the self-sacrificing prime , the blind old age , the religious patriotism , the pious loyalty , the learning and love , and the isolated meditation , cheered by grand symphonies and hoarded wisdom , through and by which , concentrated into melodious expression , the life of a noble mind thus majestically expressed itself : but we can easily fancy cold and cultured Gibbon returning from the Continent , full of classic lore , disgusted with his failure in public life , not sympathetic enough to enjoy heartily a career either of pleasure or of society , and so , in his dreams of scholarship , seizing upon the idea of a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can also well imagine Hume , with his love of speculation , turning gratefully to the records of the past for subjects of reflection , analysis , and inference . In these and other notable instances , we feel it is more an accident than an inspiration , more from circumstances than from innate and absolute endowment and impulse , that the historic Muse is wooed . Within a brief period the grave has closed over one of the most irreproachable and assiduous of American writers of History , - whose career signally illustrates the blessing of such a resource to unoccupied and cultivated leisure , and at the same time the fortuitoils cir*umstances which often originate and prolong this kind of literary labor . In a letter to a friend abroad , written by Prescott soon after he found himself thus congenially occupied , the case is most frankly stated . " Ennui crept over me , when I found myself a perfectly idle man , with nothing to do , and , what made it worse , with eyes so debilitated that I had no power of doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of invention , ' and I resolved to turn author in spite of my eyes ; and it is a great satisfaction to me to think that the volumes I have put together for my own amusement should have afforded some to my countrymen , and , above all , to my friends . " * This modest and candid estimate of his vocation indicates how much more a thing of volition and opportunity , and how much less a work of special endowinent and intuitive recognition is the literature of History than that of Poetry , Psychology , or Philosophy , notwithstanding all these may be fused therein . " Whatever may be the use of this sort of composition in itself and abstractedly , " observes a judicious critic , t " it is certainly of great use relatively and to literary men . Consider the position of a man of that species . He sits beside a library-fire , with nice white paper , a good pen , a capital style , every means of saying everything , but nothing to say . What , again , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Something has happened , and that something is History . " To feel fully the difference between a formal , mechanical annalist and the re * Letter of W. H.

While the attempt , by intensity of description and brilliant generalities , to impart to veritable history the charm we accept in the historical romance , has caused many an old-school reader to place Macaulay 's fascinating volumes , called " The History of England , " on the same shelf with works of fiction , - Aytoun , Hugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning to this principle or prejudice , whichever it may be , hy challenging the delightful author to the test of fact . In statesmen , or those who have excelled in political writing , the ambition to write history , the desire to illustrate and record national events , is not only a natural , but an auspicious feeling ; and so it is in educated poets in whom the sentiment of patriotism or the narrative art gives scope and glow to such an enterprise . That Fox and Bacon , Milton and Swift , Mackintosh , Schiller , and Lamartine , should have partially adventured in this field seems but a legitimate result of their endowments and experience , however fragmentary or inadequate may have been some of the fruits of their historic studies . When an enlightened and executive or speculative man is an obvious part of the history of his own times , his chronicle must have a certain significance and value . Raleigh , when he wrote the " History of the World " in prison , gave hints by which subsequent and less obsolete annalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mind of Camden , prompting him to rescue and conserve the materials of English history and note the fading traditions , - a purely antiquarian service , which only those can appreciate who seek authentic data of the far past . Such as cavil at the legal tone and crude arrangement of Clarendon are none the less his debtors for specific memoirs , the personal element of history ; and while Burnet has been vigorously repudiated by standard historians , he continues , an ( l justly , to be a prolific authority . It is conceded by all candid explorers , that , as far as it goes , the account of England by Rapin is the best . Franklin 's old friend Ralph was commended and quoted by Fox . As the enterprise of historical writers enlarged and their style became elaborate , these and such as these lost in popularity what they gained in usefulness . The charm of rhetorical elegance and broad generalizations gradually usurped the place of simple narrative and detailed statement . In the very design of Gibbon there is a certain poetical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unrolling a vast picture or succession of pictures , too vague in outline and too monotonous in color for minute impressions , yet , on this account , the more remarkable for general effect . What Europe was in the Middle Ages we find more specifically in Hallam ; the Moors in Spain have been more vividly painted by subsequent writers , whose aim was less comprehensive : but bow the imperial sway of Rome subsided into the Christian era , how a republican episode gleamed athwart her waning power in the casual triumph of Rienzi , the later emperors , and what occurred in their reign in Jerusalem and Constantinople , pass emphatically before us in the stately pages which once charmed readers of English as the model of historic eloquence , and now excite the admiration of scholars as a monument of erudition and elaborate but artificial writing . There was a new attraction in the pleasing style of Robertson and the characterization of Hume ; the winsome language of the one and the transparent diction of the other made historical reading hot so much a task to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in the one chronicle we followed events gracefully // unfolded , and in the other discussed perSons with acuteness ; yet , when to either was subsequently applied the test of absolute accuracy and sound deduction , large allowances were demanded for inadequate research on the part of Robertson and partial inferences on that of Hume . The theories of the latter indicate why and how , with all his intellectual abilities , the sympathies of his readers were inevitably limited ; in his view of humanity we find the true cause of all his deficiencies as an historian : " Human life , " he somewhere remarks , " is more governed by fortune than by reason , is to be regarded more as a dull pastime than a serious occupation , and is more influenced by particular humor than by general principles . " Yet , in a philosophical retrospect of English historians , we can trace a progressive development from the purely antiquarian researches of Camden to the personal memoirs of Clarendon and Burnet ; thence to the comprehensive erudition and majestic narrative of Gibbon ; onward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinating narrative of Robertson ; - all of which qualities of industry , charactcrization , broad knowledge , taste , emphasis , and reflection blend , culminate , and intensify along the copious , rhetorical , and vivid page of Macaulay . The Italian historians prolong , in style at least , the method of their classic predecessors : " La Storia del Guicciardini * considerata come opera classica , " - we are told by one of the critics of that nation ; who adds , " His descriptions are always accurate , clear , and expressed with eloquence ; the causes of events and their consequences are enumerated with rare acuteness ; and his personages are delineated in their true characters , the historian descending into the deepest penetraha of their hearts : but the most eminent merit of this History consists in the moral and political considerations with which it abounds ; it is like Tacitus . " In like manner , Machiavelli is compared to Thucydides ; while *archi 's long periods , adulation of the Medici , and municipal details are condemned by the same authority : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite this general commendation of native critics , be apt to ascribe the conservative charm of the Italian historians to their style rather than their method or matter . It is remarkable how late the French writers won laurels in the field of historical composition , and how long France , with all her national vanity , has lacked a complete and classical chronicle ,  --  brilliant and invaluable fragments whereof abound . According to the most esteemed French critics , until this century the nation actually knew nothing of its own history ; and it is characteristic of their speculative and methodical mind and taste , that History became popular and philosophical , a novelty and a reform , simultaneously . Guizot , Thierry , Sismondi , and others , created a new era in this branch of letters ; Thiers and Michelet enlarged its sphere and increased its charms ; and yet , while the graphic simplicity of Froissart , the critical insight and ingenious generalizations of Guizot , and the poetical glow and richness of Michelet have made the history of France both highly suggestive as regards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a narrative , the greatest allowance for brilliant theorizing , political sympathies , and an errant fancy are indispensable in order to attain to a clear view of genuine facts and absolute principles . It has been said that " leadin ideas " are fatal to accuracy of statement ; and these dominate in the minds of French philosophical annalists ; while the more sympathetic class are fond of rhetorical display and fanciful episodes . A recent critic , after bestowing merited encomiums on Michelet , gives the following instance of his absurd generalizations , which occur in the midst of grave historical statements and descriptions : " Wool and flesh are the primitive foundations of England and the English race ; ere becoming the world 's manufactory of hardware and tissues , England was a victualling-shop ; before they became a commercial , they were a breediun and a pastoral // people , - a race fatted on beef and mutton ; hence their freshness of tint , their beauty and strength : their greatest man , Shalcspeare , was originally a butcher . " Less prominent and more recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with special excellences and defects . Thus , Grote keeps attention more by the intelligence of his comments than by the flow of his narration ; he is far more political than picturesque ; and while he gives a masterly analysis of the Athenian system of government , so as to place it in a new light even to the scholar 's apprehension , he discusses the arts and the literature so inspiring to most cultivated minds , when describing Greece , with comparative indifference . Those who would examine English annals unbiased by Protestant zeal , and realize how the events and characters look to a Roman Catholic vision , may gather from Lingard some views which may not disadvantageously modify their interpretation of familiar men and occurrences . Two English writers have hastily compiled her annals during certain epochs ; but while they are equally chargeable with superficiality , the manner in which the work is done is by no means similar . Smollet 's continuation of Hume was confessedly a bookseller 's job : four octavo volumes in only ten times the number of months , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather a suspicious piece of literary handiwork ; and besides the indecent haste , so incompatible with thoroughness , the misrepresentations of Smollet are patent . Goldsmith , as unambitious in research as he was genial in expression , made so agreeable a story , that , with all its imperfection , his sketch still finds readers ; while the rarely quoted work of Henry most conveniently enumerates , at the end of each reign , details economical and social which identify and illustrate both period and progress in Anglo-Saxon civilization . As a copious and consecutive record of the salient incidents in modern Continental history , - so needful now for reference , and the diverse phases of which are so widely chronicled in the memoirs , the journals , the diplomatic correspondence , and what may be called the incidental history of the period , - the plan of Alison s work might have achieved a triumph of industry and skill , valuable as well as interesting to general readers and professional writers : but the political opinions , with the partial feelings they engender , continually distort the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian ; while his almost wilful blunders , like the errors of Lord Mahon in regard to the American War , have been repeatedly demonstrated . Mackintosh philosophized about events , measures , and men , better than he described either . Sharon Turner nobly illustrates the value of intrepid research and patient collation . IMitford represents the aristocratic as Grote the democratic element in Grecian history . Tytler wrote of the past in the life of nations with the exclusive reliance on written proof that a conveyancer places upon title-deeds , and beside the glowing and harmonious pictures of later annalists such writing now appears obsolete . Napier describes battles scientifically , and Carlyle revolutions melodramatically , - each with original power , in their respective methods , - while Miss Strickland brings to the record of queenly sorrows and duties a woman 's sympathetic prepossessions . Since those quaintly simple and emphatic statements which , under the name of Froissart 's Chronicles , seem to perpetuate the instinctive notion of History , as an honest and earnest , but unadorned and unelaborate narrative of military and political facts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style and enlargement of scope and art , but a greater complexity and subdivision in the historian 's labors . Abstract political ideas , purely intellectual phenomena , have found their annalists , as well as executive enterprise ; events have been analyzed , as well as described , - characters discussed , as well as pictured , - the elements of society laid bare with as much zeal and scrutiny as its development has been traced // and delineated . European historical students read anew the records of the past by the light of philosophy ; more subtile divisions than the geographer indicates organize the record ; events are narrated with reference to a dominant idea ; governments are chronicled through their ultimate results , and not exclusively with regard to their locality ; rulers are considered in groups ; a faith is made the nucleus of an historical development , instead of a nation . Thus , we have Ranke 's " Popes " and D'Aubign* 's " Reformation , " Hallam 's " Middle Ages " and " English Constitution " ; Dc Quincey treats of " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with positive laws ; Gervinus illustrates it as a development of certain inevitably progressive ideas ; Niebuhr interprets it by fresh tests and ordeals ; Dr. Arnold teaches it by an original method ; Humboldt points out its naturalistic tendencies and origin ; Herder and Hegel , Dc Tocqueville and Guizot , the eminent writers on Civilization , on Art , on Education , Political Economy , Literature , and Natural History , more and more exhibit the facts of humanity and of time under such new combinations , by so many parallel truths and principles , that it is difficult to conceive that History , as now understood by the educated and the reflective , is the same thing , once crudely embodied in a ballad or mystically conserved by an inscription . To multiply relations is the destiny of our age , and to converge all that is discovered through the laws of Science upon the records and relics of the past is a process now habitual and pervasive . And yet how little positive satisfaction does the lover of truth , the aspirant for what is authentic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certain general notions of the character of nations we , indeed , distinctly and correctly attain : that Chinese civilization is stationary , the French instinctively a military race , the Swiss mercenary , and adventurous in engineering and religious reform , - that modern German literature was as sudden as simultaneous in its de velopment ,  --  that Holland redeemed her foundations from the sea , - that Italy owes to art , and England to manufactures , her growth and grandeur . These and such as these are problems which the history of the respective countries , however inadequately told , reveals with authenticity ; but when we go beyond and below the patent facts oflocal civilization , to the analysis of character , and , through it , of destiny , few and far between are the satisfactory records whence we can draw legitimate materials for inference and conjecture . The most attractive method is apt to be that upon which least reliance can be placed . We seldom consult Sir Walter 's essays at serious history , while the novels he created out of historic material are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm is in the inverse ratio of their authenticity . With every new candidate for public favor in this sphere of literature , there arises a " mooted question " whereon the historian and his readers are irreconcilably divided . The character of Penn , of Marlborough , and of the facts of the Massacre at Glencoe are still vehemently discussed , whenever Macaulay 's popular History is referred to . Froude advances a new and plausible theory of the character of Henry VIII. ; few of Bancroft 's American readers accept his estimate of John Jay , Sam Adams , or Dr. Johnson , or of the political character of the Virginia Colonists ; and Palfrey and Arnold interpret quite diversely the influence and career of Roger Williams . Nor are such discrepancies surprising , when we remember how the history which transpires now and here fails of harmonious report . Every battle , diplomatic arrangement , political event , nay , each personal occurrence , which forms the staple of to-day 's journalism and talk , is regarded from so many different points of view , and stated under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prospect of reaching the exact truth . Hence the true way to profit by History is eclectic . Let the erudition of the German , the go- // 305 nial animation of the French , the Saxon good sense , the Italian grace he enjoyed , and whatsoever of glamour or of inadequacy these charms hide be duly estimated ; reflection and sympathy will often separate the gold of truth from the alloy of prejudice or fantasy . Above all , let this eclectic test be applied beyond nominal history , - to the geological data on the ancient rock , - the handwritin , , of the ages upon race , costume , language ,  - -  the incidental , but genuine history innate in all true literature , vivid elements whereof live in passages of Milton 's controversial writings , in Petrarch 's sonnets , Dc Foe 's fictions , our Revolutionary correspondence , South 's sermons , Swift 's diaries , Burke 's speeches , French memoirs , Walpole 's letters , in the poems , plays , and epistles of the past , and every fact and person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When we are much attached to our ideas , we endeavor to attach everything to them , " says Madame de Stabl . " The secret of writing well , " observes a Scotch professor , " is to write from a full mind . " These two maxims seem to us to illustrate the whole subject of historical composition ; an earnest votary thereof will instinctively find material in every interest and influence that sways events or snoulds character , and from the assimilation of all these will educe a vital and harmonious picture and philosophy . There is an historical as well as a judicial or poetic type of mind ; and to such there is no object too trifiin* , no fact too remote , not directly or indirectly to minister to the unwritten history which va* , uely shapes itself to his intelligence . In his reading and travel it is by no means to the ostensible monuments and trophies of the past that his observation and inquiry are confined : the Letters of Madame de S&amp; vignd give him authentic hints for the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood-stains at Holyrood identify the place of Rizzio 's murder ; the " Edinburgh Review " reveals the spirit of the Reform movement as clearly as the Parliamentary records its letter ; the South-Sea House and the Temple are as suggestive as Whitehall and the Abbey ,  --  for trade and jurisprudence , in the retrospect , are as much a part of the by-gone life and present character of a nation , as the fate and the fame of her dead kings ; and a Spanish ballad is as valuable an illustration as a Madrid state-paper ; while the life of Harry Vane vindicates the Puritan nature as clearly as the letter of a Venetian ambassador exhibits the domestic life of a Pope . The redeeming influence of strong personal sympathy and earnest conviction , both in the choice of a subject and the method of its treatment , has been signally illustrated by a countryman of our own . The interest of the general reader and the approbation of historical scholars were at once enlisted by Motley 's " Rise and Fall of the Dutch Republic . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical composition by virtue of a certain fluent animation , a certain decided and sustained tone , such as can be derived only from an absolute relation between the author 's mind and heart and his subject . Accordingly his record not only seizes upon the attention , but wins the sympathy of the reader , who recognizes a vital and genuine spirit in the work , which gives it unity , completeness , and a living style , whereby its incidents , characters , and philosophy are unfolded , not only with art , but with nature , and so made real , attractive , and significant . That we are right in ascribing these merits to the affinity between the author and his work is amply evidenced by his own confession in a letter called forth by the death of Prescott , in which he says , - " It seems to me but as yesterday , though it must he now twelve years ago , that I was talking with our ever-lamented friend Stackpole about my intention of writing a history upon a subject to which I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made already some general studies in reference to it , without being in the least aware that Prescott had the intention of writing the history of Philip II . Stackpole had heard the fact , and that large preparations had already been made for // the work , although Peru ' had not yet been published . I felt , naturally , much disappointed . I was conscious of the immense disadvantage to myself of making my appearance , probably at the same time , before the public , with a work not at all similar in plan to Philip II. , * hut which must , of necessity , traverse a portion of the same ground . My first thought was , inevitably as it were , only of myself . It seemed to me that I had nothing to do but to abandon at once a cherished dream , and probably to renounce authorship . For I had not first made np my mind to write a history , and then cast about to take op a subject . My subject had taken up me , drusvn me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , it seemed , to write the book I had been thinking much of ,  --  even if it scere destined to fell dead from the press ,  --  and I had no inclination or interest to write any other . " The same inspiratiou is partially obvious in those portions of every history which come home to the writer 's experience : as , for instance , some of the military episodes in Colletta 's " History of Naples , " he having been a soldier ,  --  and the descriptive phases of Parkman 's " History of Pontiac , " the author having been a Prairie traveller , and familiar with the woods an ( l the bivouac . In like manner , it is the idiosyncrasy of historians which gives original value to their labors : Botta 's knowledge of American localities and civilization was meagre , but his sympathy with the patriots of the Revolution was strong , and this gave warmth and effect to his " Guerra Americana " ; Niebuhr was specially gifted to develop what has been called the law of investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lays hare much of its unapparent meaning and spirit . So apt and patient are the Germans in research , that they have been justly said to " quarry " out the past ; while so native are rhetoric , theorizing , and fancifulness to the French , that they make history , as they do life and government , theatrical and picturesque , rather than gravely real and practically suggestive . A peculiar feature in the labors of modern historians is the research expended upon what the elder annalists regarded as purely incidental and extraneous . The collation of archives , official correspondence , and state-papers is now but the rough basis of research ; memoirs are equally consulted ,  --  localities minutely examined ,  - -  the art and literature of a given era analyzed ,  --  the geography , climate , and ethnology of the scene made to illustrate the life and polity , - social phases , educational facts estimated as not less valuable than statistics of armies and judicial enactments . Michelet has some charming rural pictures and female portraits in his History of France ; Macanlay thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great historical aggregate . Topography , botany , artistic knowledge are not less parts of the chronicler 's equipment than philology , rhetoric , and philosophy ; a newspaper is not beneath nor a traveller 's gossip beyond his scope ; architecture reveals somewhat which diplomacy conceals ; an inscription is not more historical than the average temperature or the staple productions . Whatever affects national character and destiny , whatever accounts for national manners or confirms individual sway , is brought into the record . Diaries , like those of Pepys and Evelyn , the tithe-book of a county , the taste in portraiture , the costume and the play-bill yield authentic hints not less than the census , the parliamentary edicts , or the royal signatures ; the popular poem , the social favorite , the cause ce'libre , what pulpit , bar , peasant and beau , doctor and lady i ? e la mode do , say , and are , then and there , must coalesce with the battle , the legislation , and the treaty , - or these last are but technical landmarks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas are made emphatic only through association and observation . How the vague sense of Roman dominion is deepened as we trace the outline of a camp , the niassive ranges of a theatre , or the mouldy effigy on a coin , in some region far distant from the Imperial centre ,  - -  as at Nismes or Chester ! How complete becomes the idea of mediaoval life , contemplated from the ramparts of a castle , // in the " dim , religious light " of an old monastic chapel , or amid the obsolete trappings and weapons of an armory ! What a distinct and memorable revelation of ancient Greece is the Yenus or Apollo , a Parthenon frieze or a fateful drama ! The best political essays on the French Revolution are based on the economical and social facts recorded in the Travels of Arthur Young . The equivocal action of Massena , when he commanded Paris against the Allies , is cx1 ) lained in the recently published letter of Joseph Bonaparte , wherein we learn his deficiency of muskets . humboldt accounted for the defects of Prescott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the historian had never visited that country . Napoleon gave a key to the misfortunes of Italy , when he said , " It is a peninsula too long for its breadth . " And the significance of the Seven Years ' War is expressed in a single phrase by Milton 's last biographer , when he defines it as the " consummation politically and the attennation spiritually of the movement begun in Europe by the Lutheran Reformation . " Indeed , so intimate is the connection between private life and public events , between political and social phenomena , that the historical mind finds material in all literature , and the very attempt to keep to a high strain and to bend facts to theory limits the authenticity of professed annalists . What Macaulay says of an eminent party-leader is modified to those who have studied the character through his memoirs or writin*s . The charming narrative of Robertson , the characterization of Hume , the stately periods of Gibbon , fail to win implicit confidence , when the scene , the age , or the personages described are known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a treaty of Colonial governors against Indian ravages the germ of democratic government , we know that it is his attachment to a theory , and not the actual circumstances , which leads to such an inference ; for the very authority he cites merely indicates a defensive alliance among rulers , not a coalition of the ruled . And so when to an account of the Battle of Lexington he appends a rhetorical argument connecting that event , so meagre and simple in itself and so wonderful in its consequences , with the progress of truth and humanity in political science and reformed religion , we feel that the reasoning is forced and irrelevant , - more an experiment in fine writing than an evolution of absolute truth . Thus continually is the independent reader of history taught eclecticism : he makes allowance for the want of careful research in this writer , for the love of effect in that ,  --  for the skepticism of one , and the credulity of another , - for enthusiasm here , and fastidiousness there and especially for the greater or less attachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong convictions and genuine sympathies . Hence , to read history aright , we must read human nature as well ; we must bring the light of philosophy and of faith , the calmness of judgment and the insight of love , to the record ; collateral revelations drawn from our own experience , modified acceptance of both statement and inference , superiority to the blandishments of style , are as needful for the right interpretation of a chronicle as of a scientific problem . Thus history is perpetually rewritten ; fresh knowledge opens new vistas in the past as well as the future ; the discovery of to-day may rectify , in important respects , the statement which has been unchallenged for centuries ; one new truth leavens a thousand old formulas ; and nothing is more gradual than the elucidation of historical events and characters . Even our own bref annals suggest how large must be the historian 's faith in time : only within a year or two has it been possible to demonstrate the justice of Washington 's estimate of Lee , and how completely the sagacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Revolution , one of these men has been as much overrated as the other has failed of just apprecia // tion , - because the documentary wisdom requisite for an enlightened judgment has not until now been patent. * With the imposing array of professed histories and historians in view , it is Curious to revert to the actual sources of our own historic ideas , - those which are definite and pervasive . The vast number of intelligent readers , who have made no special study of this kind of literature , probably derive their most distinct and attractive impressions of the past from poetry , travel , and the choicest works of the novelist ; local association and imaginative sympathy , rather than formal chronicles ; have enlightened and inspired them in regard to Antiquity and the great events and characters of modern Europe . This fact alone suggests how inadequate for popular effect have been the average labors of historians ; and so fixed is the opinion among scholars that it is impossible for the annalist to be profound and interesting , authentic and animated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the learned repudiate as spurious the renown of Macaulay , - although his research and his minuteness can not be questioned , and only in a few instances has his accuracy been successfully impugned . They distrust him chiefly because he is agreeable , doubt his correctness for the reason that his style fascinates , and deem admiration for him inconsistent with their own self-respect , because he is such a favorite as no historian ever was before , and his account of a parliament , a coinage , or a feud as winsome as a portraiture of a woman . In one of his critical essays , Macaulay himself gives a partial explanation of this protest of the minority in his own case . " People , " he remarks , " are very loath to admit that the same man can unite very different kinds of excellence . It is soothing to envy to believe that what is splendid can not be solid and what is clear can not be profound . " And it has been most justly said of his own method of writing history , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schuyler , and Professor Moore 's paper on Charles Lee . must make everything clear and hrigh* , and bring it into the range of his analysis ; his exaggeration chiefly applies to individual characters , not to general facts " ; and the reason given for the decided preference manifested for his vivid record is not less true than philosophical , * W* learn so much from him enjoyably . " It is precisely the lack of this pleasurable trait which makes the greater part of the annals of the past a dead letter to the world , and wins to romance , ballad , epic , fiction , relic , and poetry the keen attention which facts coldly " set in a note-book " never enlisted . How many of us unconsciously have adopted the portraits of the early English kings as Shakspeare drew them ! To what a host of living souls is the history of Scotland what the author of " Waverley " makes it ! Charles I. haunts the fancy , not as drawn by Ilume , but as painted by Vandyck . The institutions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the architecture of Florence more than by the municipal details of Hallam . Pyramids , obelisks , mummies have brought home Egyptian civilization ; the " old masters , " that of Europe in the fifteenth century ; the ruins of the Colosseum , Roman art and barbarism , as they never were by Livy or Gibbon . Lady Russcil 's letters tell us of the Civil War in England ,  --  Saint Mark 's , at Venice , of Byzantine taste and Oriental commerce , - the Escurial and the Albambra , Versailles , a castle on the Rhine , and a " modest mansion on the banks of the Potomac , " of their respective eras and their characteristics , social , political , religious ,  --  more than the most elaborate register , muster-roll , or judicial calendar . For around and within these memorials lingers the life of Humanity ; they speak to the eye as well as to memory , - to the heart as well as the intelligence ; they draw us by human associations to the otherwise but technical statement ; they lure us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate with the scenes , the effigies , the monuments of the Past , we have , as it // were , a vanta*e-ground of actual experience , an impulse from personal observation , and , perhaps , a sympathy born of local inspiration , whereby the phantoms of departed ages are once more clothed with flesh , and their sorrows and triumphs are renewed in the soul of enlightened contemplation .
