No . CCVII . APRIL , 1865 . ART . I. - England and America . A Lecture read before the Boston Fraternity , and published in the Atlantic . ZYlio'nthly for December , 1864 . By GOLDWIN SMITH . Boston : Ticknor and Fields . 1865. 8vo. pp. 56 . IT is generally admitted , even by the enemies of the United States , that not only material comfort , but also a considerable degree of intellectual cultivation , is here far more widely diffused among the people than in any other country . But that in our community there is a wider development of moral sentiment , and a higher moral standard of conduct , both in private and public affairs , than are to be found elsewhere , has not been so readily acknowledged , and has not , perhaps , been sufficiently affirmed in our own social and political speculations . There is , however , no result of the conditions of society in America more certain or more important . We are far indeed from asserting that our people as a whole are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assert only that , as a whole , they are morally superior to the population of any foreign country . However strong may be the support given to this claim by a comparative view of society in this and other countries , it would still be open to question , and might fairly be set down , if not as an arrogant , at least as an unproved assumption , were it not that the causes of the facts upon which the claim is based are not less evident than the facts themselves , and are of such nature that these results must be regarded as effects necessarily // proceeding from them . The diffusion of material prosperity and of a degree of intellectual cultivation forms a deeper and more solid foundation for the support and growth of moral sentiment than is found elsewhere . The quality of the moral notions possessed by an individual depends primarily on his freedom from the pressure of purely selfish wants , and on his appreciation of the wants of others , and of the relation of his wants to theirs . In a community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent moral ideas than in a community of which the greater number are scarcely raised above the level of poverty . And while the diffusion of wealth and education thus gives us this advantage , the nature of our social and political institutions confirms and increases it . The first notion of morality is that of the responsibility of the individual for the consequences of his conduct . In a society in which there is no factitious division of classes , and in which every man shares , under the law , in the direction of affairs according to his will and his ability , the sense of responsibility is constantly stimulated . A civic conscience is created , which holds up an ideal rule for the judgment of the performance both of private and of public duties . Its decisions may be affected by passion , prejudice , or interest ; but it does not fail to pronounce them , and in pronouncing them to rectify in some degree its former errors . The appeal is continually made from selfishness to the highest rule of conduct which the enlightenment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the moral sentiment and the growth of moral ideas are thus the natural , inevitable , necessary consequences of free democratic institutions . That these consequences may be checked by outward circumstances , and that moral degeneracy may follow , may in some instances be true ; but such instances must be exceptional , and need not be considered in our argument . The general conclusion does not admit of question , that free institutions , based upon material prosperity and popular education , are the most powerful means that can be adopted for raising the moral standard of a community . And it is because in America we are possessed of these conditions that we have attained to a comparative moral superiority , which ought to be more distinctly recognized by ourselves than it has heretofore been , not as an isolated fact , or as a // 1865 . America and England . motive for national conceit , but as involving consequences of the greatest moment both socially and politically . In so far as politics rest upon a moral foundation , it is plain that their character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These principles are to find expression in the conduct of public and national affairs , in our dealings with foreign nations , in our treatment of races other than our own . But the application of the principles of right to public national and international affairs has been in the past history of the world very imperfect and irregular . The traditions of all national histories are traditions of force , violence , and fraud . The very idea that politics are but a branch of ethics , an idea essential to the correct conception of political duties , is not yet accepted and acted upon by those who have the guidance of public affairs even in the most civilized states . The conduct of statesmen and politicians is neither guided nor judged by any absolute and pure rule of morality . Hence the relations of governors and governed have been , and still are , determined rather by selfish interests than by considerations of justice . The dealings of nation with nation have been , and still are , regulated , so far as they submit to such regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current opinions , derived from ages of comparative darkness , and formed into an imperfect and fluctuating code , which has neither the command nor the sanction of law , and the authority of which may often be invoked in defence of injustice and wrong as strongly as in favor of justice and civilization . But improvement in the moral sentiments of mankind precedes , by a longer or shorter interval , improvement iii their conduct ; and private morals feel and respond to the impulse of improved ideas much more easily and speedily than the morals of public affairs . In America there has been no exception to this general rule . Our political conduct has frequently failed to conform to the demands of that justice , which we acknowledged , but refused to obey . Our treatment of the Indians and of the negroes , to say nothing of other minor instances of the sort , will long remain a reproach upon our national character , and afford solid reason for distrust of our claims to a superior national morality . But the events of late years are compelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is required of us than has heretofore been attained ; that old precedents from periods of less enlightenmen t , and from the history of natiohs less advanced in civilization , are not to be cited as authorities for our guidance ; that maxims drawn from the experience of a period in which considerations of justice , humanity , and the brotherhood of men , were less understood in their application to public affairs than at present , are not fitted to the existing needs of our society ; that we are not to follow the old paths , but to open new ones , in which we are to lead the advance of the world in the establishment of peace and good-will among men . The mere taking of this high ground will enable us in some measure to maintain it . The progress of the world depends on the degree in which ideal excellence is acknowledged as a real object of desire and of effort . The want or disregard of ideal objects involves a moral deterioration alike in individuals and in communities . The upholding of an ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By position and condition , as well as by the nature of our institutions , we are summoned to the performance of unexampled duties , and to the raising of the character and conduct of our own and other nations to a level hitherto unattained . In proportion to our exceptional advantages are our exceptional responsibilities . It is no fanciful view that we take of our opportunities and duties . We urge no impracticable undertaking . We commend no impossible excellence . On the contrary , the work of improvement to which this nation is called is no matter of speculation , no conclusion from any chimerical theory , no unreal product of exaggerated national vanity ; but is a substantial , practical necessity , forced upon us as one of the conditions of national existence . Such work , however , is always of irregular and halting execution . The course of improvement , the progress of civilization , is like that of a stream , now running forward with steady and peaceful flow , now seemingly turned backward and for a time bent away from its true direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head to hurry onward over obstacles which , instead of impeding , serve by their very agitation to purify and quicken its current . The progress that we have yet made as a nation is very little compared // to that which lies before us ; but in the future , as in the past , progress will be difficult , slow , imperfect . We shall constantly come short of our ideal ; but our interests will continually combine more and more closely with our duties to compel us by faithful and strenuous exertions to become worthy of our splendid and unparalleled opportunities . The application of these truths to the whole matter of international relations is evident , but at this moment they have a special force in respect to the relations of the United States and England . The thought of war with England has become a familiar one among us of late . The course of the English government , and the conduct and expressions of the aristocratic and wealthy classes in England , during the last four years , have produced among us an almost universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only of having experienced wrong at English hands , - of having had the suppression of a rebellion that imperilled the existence of the nation made more arduous by sympathy and material aid rendered by Englishmen to the Rebels ; but also , what it is more difficult for a high-spirited nation to forgive , - of having been treated with contumely , even with insult , by the most powerful organ of public opinion , and by the ministers of government , in England ,  - -  of having had our conduct maligned , our intentions misinterpreted , and our sacrifices and efforts in our great cause , the cause of government , of liberty , of human right , vulgarly belied and condemned . Our best , our most natural sensibilities have been hurt , and the result is a degree of exasperation toward England , the deeper for having been necessarily in great part suppressed , which endangers and will endanger for a long time to come the maintenance of peaceful relations between the two countries . The privateers which have swept our commerce from the seas were English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rebels have eked out their slender resources have reached them through English agency ; the very cannon with which their forts have been defended , the rifles and the swords with which they have fought us , have borne the stamp of English makers ; the money with which their troops have been paid has been the loan of English capitalists . Is it strange that the confidence and friendship of the people of the United States have been turned into distrust and ill-will ? // And it is not strange , however much it is to be regretted , that this ill-feeling has been promoted and cherished by the efforts of some among our own citizens . The friends of the Rebellion in the loyal States have exaggerated every offence of England , and have stimulated every passionate impulse of resentment on our part , in the hope of involving the two countries in war . They have understood that to engage the United States in a foreign war would be the greatest aid that could be rendered to the cause of the Rebellion . They have played upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who carry in their hearts an inextinguishable hatred of England . They have sought to excite popular passion to a degree which should render it uncontrollable by the better reason of the community , and should force the government to yield to its eager demands . Happily these machinations of the enemies of the country have been baffled alike by the common-sense of the majority of the people , and by the firmness , patience , and diplomatic skill of the President , the Secretary of State , and the American Minister in London . But though these efforts have been thus checkmated for the time , they have not been without effect upon the general sentiment . And this effect has been seconded by other influences scarcely less dangerous because proceeding from men devoted to the service of the country . The old traditions of enmity still rankle in the hearts of some of the officers of our army and navy , and there are hot-headed zealots among them who long for needless war . They have ill learned the first lesson of their profession , the prime object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the reconciling , of enmities . More than once during the Rebellion has one of the distinguished officers of the navy taken occasion to display his own ill-feeling toward England , and to stimulate the passions of his subordinates against her . His services afford neither justification nor palliation of the impropriety thus committed toward his own government , not less than toward that of a nation with whom we are at peace . Gasconade is not always harmless . Au admiral should not play with sparks in a powder-magazine . The questions which have arisen during the war involving the right of neutrals and belligerents have been of the most delicate // nature , and have demanded the coolest temper and the wisest judgment for their settlement . The precedents which might furnish a clew to their correct solution were conflicting and uncertain . Fortunately , many of those derived from our own history were such as based the decisions of international law upon principles of justice . They were such as we were proud to follow , even though their application to the existing cases might be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that great portion of the press of England from which we had no reason to expect fairness or friendliness of judgment united in loading our conduct in the occurrences in question with opprobrious epithets , in applying to our intentions the worst interpretations , and in counselling us in words that sounded like threats . To a nation conscious of its own integrity , such language was of no import , save as it indicated the existence of a feeling against us of which we had already much stronger evidence . Although the language may have been foul , and the insinuations base , yet the counsel of our enemy was correct . But against the arraignment of our British censors there was a vehement protest , on the fallacious ground that " those who would teach correct principles must begin with correct example . " The ancient and the recent annals of England were searched to find precedents and incidents in her history having in them all that was indefensible in the cases in point . The task was not difficult . The ancient and recent history of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that desires to direct its course by the rule of right rather than that of force . If the public opinion of England declared itself on the side of right , whatever might be the motives or the terms of the decision , it was for us , as leaders in the work of improvement in the law of nations , to rejoice that the power of England was for the moment , at least , thrown upon the side on which we were contending , and for which we had often heretofore contended against her in vain . But the attempt was made , and not without success , to find in the new teachings of England an additional ground of irritation against her . Quis tulerit Gracchos de seditione querentes ? was exclaimed , and the trite , sonsible , and appropriate old maxim , Fas est et ab hoste doceri , was apparently forgotten . // Undoubtedly the real root of this bitterness is not that England used to do so and so , but that men believe that , in spite of her present outcry against us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has set us , and in spite of the intentions and declarations of her better men , she would do so again were the occasion to arise . But still this is no good reason for the indulgence on our part of recriminations which , so far as they have effect , tend to widen the breach of good feeling between us . So , again , one of our distinguished orators , a man whose chief claim to honor it is that he has striven through a lifetime to rouse and uplift the moral sense of the community in regard to the great national calamity and sin of slavery , deserting his own principles , has joined his voice with that of the thoughtless or the disloyal in inflaming the prejudices of Americans , not only against our English enemies , but against our English friends . It is easy to do it . But even if our English friends , in the warmth of good-will , commit what in thin-skinned sensitiveness we fancy to be impertinences toward us , is it the part of an honorable Christian statesman to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence their genuine purposes and actual services ? We cite these instances as illustrations of a spirit that is dangerous to the highest interests of civilization and of the country , mainly because it is fostered and indulged by men whose position and whose intelligence ought to make them the first to frown upon it and to check its manifestations . In the Lecture , the title of which stands at the head of this article , Mr. Goldwin Smith has stated with rare clearness and admirable candor the conditions of opinion and feeling in the various classes of English society toward the United States , and explained their causes and motives . But it is not from his statements alone that we learn that , however just it may be to charge England in its collective capacity as a nation with wrongs committed against us , it is not just to charge the English people with them , or correct to assume that the great body of the people has other than good-will toward us . In Mr. Adams 's reply to the address of the Emancipation Society in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true state of the case in a few words . " Whatever , " he says , " may be // the hostility of some , it is by no means shared by the greater number of the British people , and ought not to be presumed to be a national impression . " England is a divided nation , and neither the will of the body of her people nor the opinion and principles of her wisest men are fully represented in the acts and demeanor of her government . Knowing this to be the case , we ought to consider how natural and how plain are the causes which have contributed to produce the feeling which has been manifested toward us , during the progress of the Rebellion , by the majority of the upper classes in England . To say nothing of the character of our history for twenty or thirty years past , which was well fitted to occasion , even in those friendly toward us , the most serious solicitude as to the influence of our institutions on national temper and disposition , to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most intelligent foreigner could hardly be expected to comprehend , that led up to the outbreak of the Rebellion , and nothing of those falsehoods and pretences and those conditions of the war which were fitted to excite an ignorant and sentimental , but not the less genuine , sympathy for the Rebels , two preponderating causes yet remain amply sufficient to account for and palliate the aversion with which we have been regarded abroad , and the active efforts made by individuals to injure us and prevent our success , however insufficient to form a moral justification of this feeling and these acts . The first of these causes is the natural and instinctive hostility of an aristocracy , which feels that the current of civilization , as represented by the thoughts and desires of the masses of men , is turned against it , and that its dignities , privileges , prerogatives , and even its possessions , rest on a foundation which is gradu* ally being mined by the advances of the modern spirit of democracy , - the natural and instinThve hostility , we say , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , in wealth , in dominion , and in happiness , to one of the first places among nations , and becoming by force of example alone " a standing menace " to the despotic and aristocratic polities of the Old World . The second of these causes is one of still more general nature , from the operation of which no nation has a right to ex // April , pect to be exempt , and against which none is yet far enough advanced to have a right to protest . This is the principle of commercial selfishness . The men with whom the gre edofgain is superior to every other consideration , who would sacrifice the interests of their country and of humanity to their own profits , are not confined to Liverpool and London . The Lairds and the Lindsays are a wide spread clan . And indignant as we may be that the temptations of large profits , and the excitement of the gambling of blockade-running , or the robbery of privateering , have engaged so many of the ship-owners and merchants of England in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce , we have little reason for surprise at their course . It is our misfortune that we are exposed for the time to suffer from such injuries ; but the remedy is in our own hands , and not in the way of retaliation . The end of the Rebellion will be the end of the practices from which we suffer . Every vigorous blow struck at our civil enemies defends our interests abroad . And let us not revile England because some Englishmen are found ready to make money for themselves out of our present straits . The question of compensation for the losses inflicted upon us by the privateers that have sailed from English ports is perhaps more dangerous to the continuance of friendly relations between the two countries than any other that is likely to arise after the close of the Rebellion . It is a question that can not be settled by considerations of abstract justice , or by appeal to authoritative decisions of international law . Whatever may be the opinion concerning the friendliness or the policy of the British declaration of neutrality , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the government can not clearly be proved to have knowingly connived at its violation , there can be little hope of enforcing a claim against England for reparation for the injuries inflicted upon us by British subjects . Strong as such a claim mio*ht be in equity , it may not be founded on arguments which avail in the court of nations . The strongest case we have against England is probably that of the Alabama . But although* in allowing her departure from Liverpool , the British government was guilty of the most culpable negligence , we doubt if the attempt // to fasten the responsibility upon England of reparation for her piracies can be made good . Even if it be admitted that the evidence on which our claim for reparation is based is ample , clear , and convincing , yet such a claim is not likely to be settled by an appeal to reason . No nation , , not even our ownis yet sufficiently under the control of reason to listen to its appeal in such a case , against the counsel of pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of immediate interest . Shall we then contemplate the enforcing of our claim by war ? Will war give to us that which we seek , - indemnity for loss ? To enga0e in war with England on account of a refusal to settle our claims against her , or on any other existing ground of quarrel , would be simply for the gratification of a resentment which may be better satisfied , and for the indulgence of a spirit of vindictiveness which no provocation can justify . That , in the present low state of civilization , there may be legitimate cause of war between nations , we do not dispute ; but war is the greatest of crimes , if engaged in without just and sufficient cause . War with England would be an unspeakable calamity for both nations . It is not to be thought of or spoken of lightly . It would be a war which , whatever might be its course or its termination , would be disastrous in equal measure to the true interests of each country . It would be the work and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have no possible conclusion of good . Except when undertaken for the maintenance of some high principle of justice , war is especially to be deprecated by those who have the interests of the masses of the people at heart , and who see in the peaceful progress of democracy , not only the advance of civilization , but the diffusion of happiness among men . War is the game of princes and of aristocrats , not of the people . In the case of a war with England , the American people would in fact be using their national power against themselves . They would be throwing their lives , their resources , their energies , into the scale against their real interests , their principles , and their hopes . They would be casting away the advantages of the New World , to load themselves with the burden of the Old . A war between America and England would be welcome to // all the opponents of democracy on both sides of the Atlantic . It would be playing into the hands of despotism . Whatever injury we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every enemy of liberalism and progress in Europe ; wbatever injury England might inflict on us would be a weapon turned against the struggling , poor , and unprivileged masses of the Old World . And still more , a war would inevitably for a time unite all classes in Eiigland against us . However much it might be resisted by England 's better men , however plainly it might be seen by the more intelligent among the workingmen of England to be opposed to the interests of their class , yet , once engaged , it would of necessity weld the whole nation together in a common instinct of resistance and defence . Friends whose desires and hopes are common with ours , whose interests are bound up with our success , friends who have stood by us and worked for us in the heat of the day , would be converted into enemies . The hand raised to strike the guilty falls upon the innocent . The smoke which covers the battle prevents us from seeing that we are fighting our brothers in disguise . The fact is hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the ranks of the aristocracy in England to whom war with America would be welcome , because it would enable them to strengthen their own privileges , to postpone reform , and to concentrate their power over the laboring classes . To make democrats or republicans synonymous with enemies , would add tremendous force to the aristocratic reaction which is now so strong in England . The American people could in no way so counteract and destroy their legitimate power abroad , in affording the example of a true democracy , in which the rights of every man are respected and equal justice meted out to all ,  --  they could in no way so effectually ruin the best hopes of the lovers of freedom , of the laborers for reform , of the poor arid the oppressed in Europe , - as by allowing themselves to be drawn by any consideration less than one of highest right and honor into a war with England . A war of resentment or vindictiveness would be an argument against the influence of democratic institutions upon national character , which , however unfair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and powerful in their hands . // But if we look at the effects of war with England simply as they concern ourselves , they are not less to be deprecated . It has been said that there is but one thing for a nation worse than war , and that is to be afraid of it . It is no boast that , as regards a trial of strength with England or any other power , we are not afraid . The last four years have taught us much of the strength and resources of our country . We know now that our democracy is at least as strong as any other power . We trust ourselves . If it be a question of right , we are ready confidently for war . But there is a fear that is not cowardicc , which may well fill our hearts at the thought of war with England . What but harm could come of such war to us and to those we love ? Are we ready to send our bravest and best out to fight and to die , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our national dignity and honor ? Shall the light of our eyes perish , that our spite may be indulged ? Are our hearts not yet full enough of sad memories ? What is to be gained by war ? Shall we spend millions on millions to get back the paltry few we have lost through England 's misdeeds ? No , whether such a war be regarded economically and materially , or as a matter of policy or of morals , it is alike without justification or rational motive . Politically , it would be the greatest of errors ; morally , it would be a crime . Woe to that nation , indeed , that has not the capacity for great and noble passions ; but deeper woe to that people which mistakes the irritations of temper for noble passion , and obeys the promptings of its baser instincts rather than the dictates of the supreme reason ! There are other ways of avenging ourselves on our foreign enemies than by war . There is no occasion for so brutal and uncivilized a process . The suppression of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the defeat of our foreign enemies ; and our triumph will be shared by our foreign friends , who are fighting the battle of liberal principles and equal rights in the Old World . Our success in the work we now have in hand will be an argument for free popular government to which there can be no demurrer . There will be no need for us to engage in a crusade for the spread of democratic principles , or for the overthrow of despotisms. // The example of a strong , rich , prosperous republic is a persistent revolutionary fact . Owing to the Rebellion , we have , for the first time in our history , become in truth an object of general attention and interest in Europe , and that attention and interest are not likely to diminish . For with the destruction of slavery , and the peaceful establishment of a truly republican government throughout the land , we may expect that the attraction which has heretofore been so strong to bring the laboring classes of Europe to our shores will receive new accessions of strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek for the rights and opportunities denied them at home . The development of the internal resources of our country has hardly begun . The South , which the costly and inferior processes and results of slave labor kept poor , and whose productiveness was confined to two or three great channels , once entered upon and taken possession of by intelligent and independent labor , will rapidly grow rich , and pour her untold and untouched wealth through a thousand courses . Agriculture , mining , manufactures , will all take part , not so much in the regeneration as in the actual discovery of the productive capacities of the vast region which has so long been occupied by unwilling and comparatively ineffective laborers . The demand for labor here will be answered by the influx of laborers from Great Britain and the Continent . Every honest ablebodied man who crosses the ocean to us adds to our strength , and takes away from the strength of Europe . We are draining , we shall drain , from the Old World its most precious , its most important possession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evils to ourselves attending the process is probable enough ; but it is enough for the present purpose to consider , that this emigration will change our relations to the European nations . It is men and money that make a nation powerful . We shall accumulate both faster than any other nation . Our true war policy is the policy of peace . To husband our resources , to organize our industry , to develop the capacities of the country , to redeem the debt with which the Rebellion has burdened us , to heal the wounds with which the Rebellion has scarred us , - this is our surest way of avenging ourselves // upon our enemies . Thus we shall grow continually more powerful and more respected . No nation will insult us , for none will desire to provoke us to war . England need not be forced to pay indemnity for the loss her Confederate cruisers have inflicted upon us . She will be paying us all the time . In ten years the debt will be cancelled by the transfer of values to our side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we know by experience , no meaner character than that of a bully among nations . To grow strong ourselves will put an end to bullying . Moreover , if we really succeed , as we mean to succeed , in making our institutions conform to our principles , and in carrying forward our system to its natural results of general prosperity and popular happiness , we shall become attractive , not only to foreign people , but to our neighbors on this continent . There will be no need to annex Canada by force . She will drift toward us by inevitable gravitation , - and in the course of years may form a part of the United States , or may be joined to the United States in a federative league , which shall be the beginning of that grand federation of the states of the continent , which shall at last realize in its peaceful and harmonious action of mutual beneficence the best dream of the founders of the New World . At the present moment , the motives of policy , not only for keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our alliance with her , are greatly quickened by the proceedings of France on our southwestern border . The establishment of a Franco-Austrian empire in Mexico is less dangerous to us than the acquisition by France of territory immediately adjoining our own , and united to our own by its geographical configuration and physical characteristics . France is an unwelcome neighbor in America , especially when she takes up her position as such by an act of spoliation , which she would hardly have ventured to commit had our arms been disengaged . The wolf makes free with the flocks when the shepherds are fighting with each other . With such conditions as those in which we stand at present , and with such a prospect opening in the peaceful years before us , it is impossible to contemplate a foreign war , especially a war with England , with other feelings than abhorrence , or to // regard those who would bring it about otherwise than as hostile to the true interests and true honor of our country . At present these fosterers of war are in a minority ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but little provocation might change this minority to a majority . It depends on England whether the provocation shall be given ; it depends on the character of the American people whether , supposing it to be given , they will quit themselves like children or like men . And here we must recur to those moral considerations with which this article begins . A heavier responsibility rests upon us in this matter than upon any other people . If we are as a whole more intelligent than the people of other nations , if we have a moral standard higher than exists elsewhere , we are to manifest our superiority on the occasions in which our tempers and our passions may strive to obtain mastery over our conduct . Such occasions are the tests of our pretensions ; and our conduct is the true measure of our advance . If we are more fortunate , more prosperous , happier , than other nations , we are bound to be more generous . As democrats , as believers in the rights of man , as standing upon our own deeds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts of life squarely , man to man , we are bound to show a larger mode of thought , a quicker sense of duty , than men who have been brought up among the conventionalisms of an artificial society , and have inherited the injurious prerogatives and prejudices of the past . It has been a favorite charge against democratic government , that it was more liable to be swayed by popular passion , and carried away by popular impulse , than any other . If we be true to ourselves , it will be for us to show that , as no government is more strong , so none is more stable and less passionate . it is , indeed , only by the practice of a noble self-restraint , that the nation can fulfil its career , and truly maintain its dignity and honor . It is only by great and continuous moral effort on the part of the people , as individuals composing the nation , that war is to be avoided , and that our republic is to achieve the glory of becoming a nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The empire is not , but the republic may be peace .
