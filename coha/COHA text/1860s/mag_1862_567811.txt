ARTICLE 111. - CONSCIENCE AS CONTRASTED WITH THE DISCURSIVE REASON . ITE who would indicate more clearly the office and authority of conscience , and give such prominence as is due to this fundamental law of our being , assumes a worthy task , though he be unable to perform it . For , as no faculty occupies a higher position than this , so none should be more free to exercise its prerogatives without interference . And therefore it is well to guard against all encroachments upon the sphere and rights of that faculty , which , to be the most efficient instrument of good , must act with spontaneous and native freedom . Feeling as we do that a correct and enlightened conscience is man 's noblest heritage , and desiring to see it rescued from all subservience and thraldom , we have been led to contrast it with other faculties of the mind , and especially with what is called the discursive reason , or reasoning faculty ; and , if we mistake not , it will appear that the latter is the grand usurper which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to control the moral tribunal ; whereas the conscience , within its own sphere , ought to be free and snprerne in all its operations and decisions . From all that appears , the mind is one in its ultimate root of being and activity . It is like a machine , where , though the parts perform different operations , they are connected and controlled by a central principle . The faculties , as it were , converge , and at length lose themselves in unity . Consequently analysis can only proceed up to a certain point . Beyond that , obscurity baffles the closest inspection . By this we would not say that the mental faculties do not differ in their ultimate principle , but that this difference rather appears from what is external , than from what is internal ; that is , it rather appears in the separate functions which they have to perform , than from any inward evidence . Indeed , we should suppose , that those faculties which constitute a human // beino ' would be conjoined in such a manner as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this being true , the most we can do is , to mark the distinction between these faculties , as seen in difference of office , and modes of operation  --  a difference which we propose to indicate with respect to conscience and the discursive reason , with the desire to accord to the former that sacred and independent authority which rightly belongs to it . We say the discursive reason , to distinguish it from what is called the pure , or intuitive reason . For , when it comes to the latter , we arrive at that principle without which it were impossible to form any right perceptions , whether intellectual or moral ; whether by intuition or demonstration ; and , as we shall see , it differs nothing in its mode of perception from the moral faculty . Whereas , as we hope to show , the moral and reasoning faculties not only differ in this respect , but in re* spect to the truths they perceive , and are wholly unlike and independent in office and operation . 1 . The office of the moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , to determine simply what is right or wrong . This is its distinctive work and it has no other . The reasoning faculty , on the other hand has only to do with truths outside the sphere of morals-as , for instance , truths of a scientific or speculative nature . It would determine simply what is true or false , wise or unwise . The former would regulate our conduct as moral and responsible beings . The latter would rather add to our knowledge , and facilitate our projects as the creatures of time . II . In respect to operation , the perceptions of the moral faculty are intuitive , and its judgments immediate . Those of the reasoning faculty , on the other hand , are only arrived at through processes of demonstration . This contrast will not hold when applied to the pure or in* tuitive reason , and we shall see a further propriety in the distinction made between it and the reasoning faculty . In the former , the judgments are as immediate as those of the eonscience . It has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whence arise its perceptions , and on which rest its conclu // sions . These ideas , or principles , are fundamental . They exist in the nature of things , and can not be resolved into further siniplicity . Neither can we give any account of them , only that they are , and that they are as necessary as real . And the judgments founded upon them are instantaneous and final . Nothing comes between the perception and the conclusion , but to see is to judge . The process is immediate , and the judgment conclusive . The discursive reason , on the other hand , arrives at its conclusions through processes of demonstration , whether of induction , or deduction . The data on which it proceeds are not ' necessarily simple , and one , so far from arriving at the ultimate conclusion immediately , must proceed from one thing to another , and reason it out . The path from premise to conclusion runs through a labyrinth in which one is always liable to go astray . Now we hold that the conscience , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as unlike the second . It has to do with the universal , necessary , and fundamental ideas of right and wrong . These ideas are neither remote nor complex . They are near at hand , and as simple as possible . Consequently one has nothing to resolve or demonstrate before arriving at conclusions . One thing does not depend upon another , and there is no room for inference . The simple ideas of right and wrong being presented to the conscience , it passes judgment upon them at once  --  a judgment which no right reasoning can reverse , or make more conclusive . If my conscience does not determine at once that it is wrong to employ fraud to compass a neighbor 's property , I can never determine the matter by any process of demonstration . Indeed , the more I stop to reason about a question of this nature , the more my moral judgment becomes confused . And so of all simple questions of right and wrong . We may also discover why it is that the conscience , like the intuitive reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protracted processes of reasoning . These faculties have to do with universal and necessary truths-truths which concern immediate thought and action , and , in reference // to which , therefore , it is necessary to form immediate perceptions and judgments . So far as mankind are required to act on the spur of the moment , they need to comprehend at once the grounds and course of action . They can not stop to reason about everything they do , for this were to waste time and make man incapable of spontaneous action . Espec ially , in the sphere of morals , is it essential to the ends of life to be able to determine at once the moral quality of actions , and the consequent line of duty . Discipline , iu this instance , is not to come by resolving doubt and difficulty , but by deciding promptly , and by acting immediately , according to our moral dictates . Hesitation and delay would produce fatal effects on our moral nature , and would at least retard our moral progress . Hence the conscience is a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , the process of accusation , judgment , and punishment , is immediate . To this instantaneous process it owes its efficiency . Were it possible to protract the trial , the consequence would be the same as in the law 's delay . The circumstances of the case would fade out of memory . The parties brought forward to testify would be more careless of the facts , and more indifferent to the cause . As time advances , the crime would appear less offensive , and hence a partial or perverted judgment , and possibly a release of the criminal . II3ut where , as in the moral tribunal , the person accused is a present witness to the facts , and where the accusation follows immediately upon the crime , and where the punishment is instantaneous , there is no room for the escape of the criminal , or the mitigation of the crime ; and for this reason , because the moral tribunal acts without delay , it is most perfect and efficient in its operation . With the reasoning faculty , on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has to do rather with truths which are not necessary to the immediate ends of life , and upon which we are not required to form immediate judgments Conclusions , in this instance , it will be enough to reach after long and patient study . It will serve our necessities to be able to reach them by a slow and tedious process . and after many failures . For the sake of disciplihe it is // 210 Consciertee as Contrasted with the proper that the way should lie through obscurity and doubt , and that the conclusion to be certain should have to be subjected to proof . It follows , from what has gone before , that while the primary conclusious of the moral faculty are likely to be most correct , those of the reasoning faculty are likely to be most erroneous . Each faculty , to be true to itself , and to form right conclusions , must act in its own way . As the conscience can not reason and demonstrate , so the i*easoning faculty has not the power of intuitive insight ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitation , it arises in the second from too much haste . It is by doubting the truth of our moral perceptions , and by stopping to review the moral judgments , that we abuse the conscience . Whereas , it is by jmnping at conclusions that we abuse the reason . We speak , of course , of the moral faculty when unperverted , and when employed about questions of simple morality . For , if the conscience have lost its integrity , or is employed about questions of a complex nature , it must defer its conclusions till one has resolved those occasions and circumstances which prevent the power of right perception , or which hinder an immediate judgment . We may notice , also , that an additional reason why the moral faculty is capable of immediate perceptions and conclusions is , that those universal and necessary truths about which it is employed are comparatively few . God has , so to speak , simplified these truths , and reduced them to the lowest number so as not to bewilder the judgment . And hence it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the moral quality of actions , and determine so easily the principles of duty . With respect to reasoning , on the other hand , so many principles enter into the calculation , that it is difficult to see the way clearly and to reason correctly . Here , too , the realm of truth is boundless . There is no end to discovery , and reason but just begins to penetrate that misty region which skirts the horizon of human knowledge . The further progress it makes the more it becomes amazed and bewildered at the obscurity beyond . How fortunate that truths of this class are not of the highest moment , and that where we are required to pronounce // an immediate judgment the way is so clear that we can determine at once the nature of the action and the course of duty ! HI . Another peculiarity of the moral faculty is , that it is supreme and independent in its sphere , and final in its perceptions and determinations . As the organ of sight has no power to distinguish between sounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral quality of actions . And , hence , if the conscience is unable to determine whether an action is right or wrong , it appeals iii vain to the reasoning faculty . It is a law to itself ; and has no higher authority to which to refer its decisions . From this we are not to infer that the solution of many complex questions will not require the service of both these faculties , but that , as the conscience has no power to resolve a question outside the sphere of morals , so the reasoning faculty has no power to resolve a question within the sphere of morals . This may better appear from illustration . Take , for instance , the question whether Government had best subject articles of foreign merchandise to protective duties . This is a question of political economy . Apply it to the conscience , and the conscience pronounces no decision for or against it . It has nothing to do with morals , and is foreign to all determinations of the moral faculty ; and if political sagacity is unable to decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , whether negroes have rights which white men are bound to respect . This is a question of morals . It has primarily nothing to do with what is wise or unwise , politic or prudent . It is a simple question of right or wrong . The conscience alone can decide it , and no amount of reasoning can disprove its decisions , or make them clearer . Take again the question whether the North was bound to obey the ? hgitive slave law . This is a complex question , and requires for its solution the exercise of both the reasoning and moral faculties . For one is not only required to determine what is right or wrong in poim4 of morals , but what is true or false in point of policy . Apply this question , now , to an enlightened conscience , and it responds , at once , this is wrong . No man has a right to deliver into bondage a being to whom // God has given the right to personal freedom . And this decision , so far as the conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , to the reasoning faculty , and the conclusion is , that such surrender is politically wise . The Constitution provides for it , and refusal to obey it may open the way for further encroachments , and for the final overthrow of government . While , therefore , the latter conclusion can never disprove the truth of the former , the question comes to this-whether it was better to obey the law and do violence to the conscience , or whether it was better to disobey the law and do violence to the Constitution . Thus , it appears , that the moral and reasoning faculties perform separate functions , and that each is final in its decisions . The supremacy of conscience , in its own sphere , appears again in the unequal development of the moral and reasoning faculties in childhood . At this period of life , as all have observed , the conscience is singularly matnre , and the moral judgments remarkably clear and decided . This appears not so much the consequence of education , as a spontaneous forcing forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctive sense of right and wrong , the reasoning powers are in their infancy . This wonld not follow did clearness of moral perceptions depend on the reasoning capacity . This may resolve the mystery why clearness and strength of judgment are denied us at a time when they appear so needful . The reasoning powers appear to be restrained , that the conscience may have freedom to mature and assume authority over the youthful mind . What the child needs most is strength and clearness of moral discernment . From the moment he becomes responsible he needs to know the difference between right and wrong , and to have the law within enforce its authority . Hence a reason why the moral faculty develops so early , why its judgments are so clear and correct , and why any violation of conscience is folloved by such keen reproach . That the moral faculty is independent of the reasoning faculty appears , again , in the unequal strength and development of those faculties in manhood . Nothing is more observable than // that God has endowed different men with uneqnal powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguishes between right and wrong were dependent on that which distinguishes between the true and false , it would follow that those persons who possess the strongest reasoning powers wonld possess , also , the strongest moral powers . Bnt this by no means appears as a general rule . God , as if by way of compensation , has , in numberless instances , endowed ordinary minds with superior moral capacities ; and instances are very common in which men of intellect are morally weak . The poets are supposed to possess the highest refinement of reason , and the clearest perception . of the beautiful and true ; yet facts do not warrant the conclusion that the poets , as a class , possess superior powers of moral discernment . Many statesmen and philosophers are remarkable for clearness and grasp of intellect , whose moral capacities , so far as we can gather , are very indifferent . Whether this arises from lack , neglect , or abnse of those powers , it is equally certain that power of moral discernment does not depend on sharpness of intellect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds whose moral capacities are of the highest order . This is not to say that such persons are not often as deficient in moral discernment as men of large intellectual caliber , nor to say that the latter are not often possessed of as great moral power as any other . Nor is it to deny that , in all complex questions , in which reason has something to resolve before the conscience can pass its decisions , the stronger the reasoning powers , the better will the conscience be able to perform its functions in these partienlar instances ; but it is to say that , in all questions of pure morality , that is , of simple right and wrong , the conscience is equally clear and decisive , whether conjoined with strong reasoning powers or otherwise . Now this , we believe , to be a wise provision of the Almighty . As , in childhood , it is more needfnl to have correct notions of right and wrong than of any other class of truths , so , with the mass of mankind , clearness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reason . They need , above all things , the power to apprehend moral truth , and a // law to regulate their conduct as moral and responsible beings . It follows , from what has gone before , that a man may be a distinguished philosopher or statesman , and yet an indifferent moralist , and qnite unworthy to guide the people in questions of morality . It is true , where force of moral power is wanting , a man is destitute of an clement of greatness ; and yet , for all this , he may be a strong reasoner and profound thinker . There are many persons whose conclusions , in matters of science and speculation , no ordinary man would presume to question ; and yet he may do so very properly when it comes to the sphere of morals . Indeed , it appears to be the design of Providence that a few , as pioneers of thought , should open the way to higher realms of knowledge , and that the multitude should follow their guidance . But , in the sphere of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for discovery here . There are few new truths to be arrived at , and no new principles of moral action . Consequently , every man is to judge and act for himself . He is not to depend on others , as though they alone had the power to determine his course of action . He is not to wait for their conclusions in order to know his duty . His law is within . He must determine for himself what is right and wrong , and act accordingly . And , in this respect , he stands by himself and independent of all authority . This is not to say that , in consequence of a blind , perverted , or unfaithful conscience , he is not liable to fall into error , and even to confound the principles of moral action . Much less , that he is not to compare his own convictions of duty with those of others , and do all in his power to enlighten conscience . But , when all is done , his conscience is to himself his law of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by deferring to tlmeir conclusions . This is a point of munch significance , but one which many persons fail to perceive . Because a man is superior in point of intellect , they conclude that he is superior in moral endowments . And , if the philosopher comes to the conclusmon that there is no difference , in the nature of things , between right and wrong , they take for granted that , because he excels in philo // sophic discernment , they must defer to his conclusions . Suppose , again , the statesman to lay it down that slavery has nothing to do with morals , and that it is simply a question of profit and loss . Many would infer , that because he is a man of large political sagacity , his conclusion must be considered decisive . Or , because a supreme judge affirms that negroes have no rights which white men are bound to respect , does it follow from hence that , because he is learned in the law , his decision is final in a question of common morality ? By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie is only a law to himself , and one , much inferior in intellect , may pronounce a contrary and much wiser decision . We protest against submitting to any man 's dictum , in matters of conscience . It is to make man morally impotent , and irresponsible , and has been fruitful of the worst evils in both church and state . The papist , who submits to the priest in matters of conscience , and who presumes to ask no questions beyond his authority , and that of mother church , is only equaled in baseness by that partisan who submits a question of simple morals to individual or party interpretation . The independence of the moral faculty appears , again , in the unequal development of the moral and reasoning powers in the same person , at different periods of life . Above , it was seen , that the moral powers are highly developed at that period of life when the reasoning powers are yet in their infancy . The development of the latter is the fruit of time aud study , and they come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If , now , quickness and correctness of moral discernment were conditioned by strength and capacity to reason , it would follow that , as the reasoning powers mature , the conscience would be better able to determine the moral quality of actions . Whereas , it rarely appears that men are more conscientious than they were in childhood , or that they are better able to perform the moral functions ; while it is true that , as mankind at large grow older , their moral judgments are often more confused , their convictions of conscience less decided , and its violation less fruitful of reproach . Such an unequal development of the mental faculties is , of course , not necessary , or right . The // design is , that we should employ each faculty in lawful exercise , and be always true to the moral and rational judgments . But it is common to cultivate one faculty to the neglect of the other , and , what is worse , to employ it - as an instrument wherewith to falsity and confound the dictates of our moral nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unequal development of the moral and reasoning powers arising from neglect of the one , and an undue devotion to the other . All are aware of the temptation to intellectual studies . Pride of reason leads to an assiduous cultivation of the reasoning powers , and engenders a pressing desire to reason more profoundly and correctly . One is impelled to come to greater penetration , power , and grasp of thought , and , not only to push his investigations to the remotest point , but to apply to all his conclusions the severest logic . And who knows not to what an astonishing strength of logical acumen one may attain by long and patient study . But does it follow from hence that he is more conscientious ? Is his moral descerument necessarily any clearer because of his power to handle an argument ? By no means . We will not say that he has done any intentional violence to his moral nature , for , by the supposition , he has been making a lawful exercise of reason . But we do say that through this excessive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therein , the moral faculty is not only often left unexercised , but suffers positive injury in consequence . Nothing can strengthen and sharpen the moral powers but exercise ; and as every limb and muscle of the body needs exercise for itself the same is true of every faculty of mind ; and any cultivation of the reasoning powers can no more serve the moral , than exercise of the hand can serve the eye , or that of the eye can serve the ear . ( 2 . ) On the other hand , the contrary effect upon the reasoning and moral faculties is still more apparent where , from any cause , men employ one to disprQve the decisions of the other . We speak , now , of an unlawful exercise of the reasoning powers ; for it is not possible for the mental faculties , when rightly employed , to contradict each other ; amid any line of // reasoning which refutew the plain and srmpie moral dictates is sophistical and false . One may appear to reason correctly , but there is somewhere a flaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the inferences and conclusions are illogical , and there is at best but a show of reason . And yet , in the lower sense , the effect of such a course is to make one intellectually sharp and morally obtuse . In proof of this , we may instance an advocate who , indifferent to the nature of his cause , is only intent to carry his point . Such an one shall acquire great skill to discover and present the strong points in the case , to suppress those that are weak , and so to arrange and press his argument as to perplex the jury , and clear a client whom he knows to be guilty , and yet be unable to see the baseness of such a course . And the same is true in every relation of life in which men set themselves to find reasons for doing what they know to be wrong . They shall become rationally shrewd , discriminating , crafty , skilled to originate plans , to arrange details , to obviate those difficulties which lie in their way , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all under semblance of right and justice , while , on the other hand , they become less acnte in moral discernment , less capable of accurate moral judgments ; in a word , less conscientious . We have thus sought to indicate the office , operation and in - dependence of the conscience as contrasted with the discursive reason , and , if we mistake not , these faculties stand opposed to each other in the strongest light . But our design in assuming the subject was no less to set forth the truth in theory , than to notice how much it is disregarded in practice . For , observation goes to show , that the way in which men come to deny the plainest rules of morality , and to confound all moral distinctions , is by subjecting the conscience to rules which only apply to the reasoning faculty . The conscience is neither allowed to act alone in its own sphere , nor in its own way , nor on its own authority . It seems to be regarded as incompetent to its task , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning faculty is made to protract and review the moral judgments , // as though it were a s*rt of final arbiter to which the conscience must always refer . It is to be observed , also , that where interest inclines men to act contrary to their moral dictates , their first desire is to tamper with the conscience , and make it an unfaithful witness ; or , what is worse , to enlist its testimony on the side of evil . Men are not sufficiently candid to confess a wicked purpose , nor sufficiently courageous to undertake a wicked action , so long as the conscience is free to rebuke and testify against them . Hence the desire to overrule this faculty , and to pervert and falsify its judgments . How shall this be done ? The common resort is to a process of reasoning . This is necessary , because it is impossible , by a mere act of the will , to change the moral perceptions , or to deaden the moral convictions . The conscience is compelled to judge according to representations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one has no more power to force it to determine that right is wrong than to force the eye to conclude that light is darkness . It only remains , therefore , to question the truth of the moral perceptions , and , by a process of reasoning , to pervert and confuse the moral faculty . Now this is a universal practice . Nothing is more common than to hear men plead in defense of opinions and actions which are contrary to the plainest instincts of their moral nature . How natural it is to justify a course of conduct which any child even knows to be wrong ! One shall always be able to palliate a crime , and to make a show of reason in self-defense . And although , as a consequence the conscience does not at once throw down its authority , yet it loses integrity , and not only becomes less capable of accurate moral judgments , but often a witness in defense of evil . In like manner , have not the moral instincts of the people been always trifled with by crafty priests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were practiced upon the multitudes in the name of religion . How completely were they blinded and misguided by those whose duty it was to enlighten and guide them . They are made to believe anything , and do anything in behalf of that church and religion whose authority , // as the first great fallacy , they are taught not to question . Indeed , who knows not that it was the aim of the popish church to keep the people in ignorance , so as to have them more easily duped , and more subservient to churchly authority . And what is the politician 's art , but that of a cunning sophister to make the worse appear the better reason , and to take advantage of the popular ignorance . A shrewd politician is well aware of the moral instincts of the people ; but he is equally aware of their incapacity to reason . Above all , he knows that they are little able to detect a flaw in argument , and that they hastily accept inconsequent conclusions . In a bad cause , therefore , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to twist them into conscientious action on the side of evil . For he knows that , as a correct conscience is an indispensable ally in a good cause ; so a perverted conscience is as indispensable in a bad one , and that the people , to become a potent instrument of either good or evil , must be made to believe and act conscientiously . And , just so far as the deniagogue has skill to deceive the people as to the nature of his cause a enlist their moral support , just so far will he be able to carry his point . Plato even lays it down that it is necessary to deceive the people for reasons of state ; and who knows not that the Roman religion was , in a great measure , the device of lawgivers and legislators , wherewith the better to awe and restrain the multitude ! Who remembers not those instances in which the plebeians , maddened by the insolence and injustice of the patrician orders , and ready to fly upon them in their rage , are only restrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods ! So much did the delusion of the people contribute to their own oppression . Put why recur to history ? Do not these facts find abundant confirmation in our own times ? Were not the people presented with excellent reasons for waging that unnatural war with Mexico ? Has not the idea of a higher law been ridiculed without limit , and reasoned into an absurdity ? Have not the preachers of manifest destiny found a plenty to carry that doctrine into practice ? And above all , has not that most offensive and odious of institutions , slavery , been honeyed over , and pre // sented to the people in every conceivable form ? Have they not been served with abundant lectures , speeches , judicial decisions , to prove that the negro is doomed to perpetual bondage ; that he is an animal ; that he has no higher destiny than to dig and delve ; that he has no rights which white men are bound to respect ; aud that the iustitution is one of simple profit and loss , and qnite foreign to religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve political ends . And have not they , who are more immediately interested in the institution , been reasoned into the inconceivably monstrous lie , that it is divine , and that they do God 's service to fight and die in its defense ? Surely , reason never did set itself to oppose more directly the fundamental instincts of man 's moral nature , and was never more successful to abuse and pervert them . All the arts of sophistry have been employed to misguide the people respecting a question of common morality , until the public conscience has been warped into every conceivable shape ; and until those who affirm and defend the institution as an actual blessing appear to be more conscientious and earnest in their belief than those who account it a crime . And , without question , the war that is thrust upon us is to be the more bloody and fearful because the conscience of the Southern people has been enlisted in their cause . For that moral support which is ever the strongest ally in a good cause will , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fierce and desperate in defense of a bad one . How dangerous it is to trifle with that faculty which God has set to be our monitor and guide , in matters of right and wrong , and to be our defense on the side of justice ! A man can do himself no greater injury than to call in question his instinctive moral convictions , and to try to reason himself into a wrong belief . As well might he doubt the intuitive perceptions of the reason , or the senses , as the correctness of his moral dictates . Nay , it does not appear but that it would be just as possible , and perhaps just as easy , for a man to reason himself into the belief that white is black , or that light is darkness , as to come to believe that right is wrong . True , such confusion is not actual , for it is inconsistent with worldly policy ; but , // were men as much inclined to act contrary to the instincts of sense and reason as to the dictates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might become incapable of correct perceptions of any kind , and well-nigh demented . There are certain judgments , intellectual and moral , which a man can never question without doing violence to his nature . They are not to be proved or disproved , or reasoned upon at all . They are to be taken for granted , and acted upon at once ; for only in this way can he be true to nature , whose operations are in obedience to unerring laws and instincts . And , as a moral and responsible being , it is a man 's first duty to be true to conscience . Let him doubt everything else sooner than the truth of his moral dictates . Let him reason where reasoning is necessary ; but let him never think to demonstrate the selfevident . Where God has made the way clear , let him not think to make it more apparent , much less to run in a different or contrary direction . Let him follow the guide within , which is to go in the natural path , and reach the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reasoned into moral confusion and blindness , he must reason his way out , or apply to others for help . As he entered the labyrinth so must he seek to find a way of escape ; but having escaped , let him remember that the conscience is supreme in her own sphere ; that she acts in her own way , and on her own authority ; and that being a competent guide she needs no instructions or assistance .
