txt DUELS AND DUELISTS . By T. B. THORPE . THiRTY-FIVE years ago in the Southwest it was difficult to find one sselfinagroup of six or eight prominent citizens without soon learning that one or more of them had been an actor in a duel . We have certainly met as many as five persons at a small wedding-party who had thus distinguished themselves , and the coincidence was not thought of except by myself . There were many reasons for this . rhe country at that time was newly settled and very prosperous . The enterprising , the adventurous , the unscrupulous , all came together on the same level , and soon acquired comparative independence . There were none of the reVoa . XXXVII. - No. 219. -C c straints peculiar to long-settled countries . The very necessities of these frontiersmen made them physically brave and reckless . The law laid a light hand upon crime ; the lowest order of its development , such as robbery and theft , was punished by Lynch-law , or the criminal escaped . The disagreements among those who held positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled in a street fight or according to the code of the duelist . This " code " unquestionably had its restraining influences ; and the fear of its penalties kept within the hounds of good conduct many a man who would otherwise have been an extortioner or a profligate in the community . It is not our present purpose to add a page to the volumes that have been written in denunciation of the code , for even where dueling has been most popular there has never been any organized voice in its defense . Our object is to notice some of its characteristic developments , and mark the varied phases the custom assumes in different localities and among different peoples . My first impressions , from casual personal association , regarding gentlemen who had " killed their man , " were that the responsibility they had taken upon themselves sat lightly on their consciences ; and I began to read the remorseful scenes depicted of the horror-stricken Macbeth and Gloster as the mere chimeras of the poet 's brain . It seemed to me that many of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . There was a growing consciousness on my part of an irresponsibility in the matter contrary to the teachings of revelation or the assertions of poets and historians ; and with this blunting of the keen susceptibilities of the value of life came the consequent indifference to its sacrifice . As time wore on , however , my eyes were gradually opened , and at last I came to the old and most correct conclusion , that the curse of Heaven followed those who had killed their brother in the field . One of my earliest and kindest friends was Judge D . He was naturally of a pleasant and social disposition , and exceedingly sympathetic with every one in suffering . He was liberal with his means to the poor ; and in the epidemics which periodically devastated the country of its unacelimated populatio*i he was the first and last at the bedside of the sufferer , acting the part of a Good Samaritan . At times , however , without any apparent cause , he would fall into moody fits , answering you abstractedly ; and when in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several years before I met him the Judge had commenced the practice of law , and formed the centre of a group of village attorneys , all of whom were natives of the Southern States . Practice was then lucrative , easygoing , and about as much conducted on social as on legal principles . In the midst of this pleasant community there appeared one day a // tall , raw-boned Yankee - a man with every characteristic of the New Englander roughcast and defined , He was critically educated in his profession , sharp by nature in its practice , and determined to succeed . With this idea he obtained an office within an hour after his arrival , and in another hour he had his books on a deal table and was ready for business . The whole thing was looked upon as a good joke , and the live Yankee was quite popular , from the fact that he afforded gronudwork for so many witticisms and pleasant jests . Of all these things , together with entire social ostracism , he seemed unconscious . While his successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking and tenpins , he was buried up in his legal studies . The example which he set was , however , not without effect ; he first got one poor client and then another , and attended to his legal duties with such perseverance and untiring energy that he began to be troublesome , by giving his associates more trouble and thus forcing them to be industrious ; even the judge complained of the unnecessary labor his researches gave the Court . There were certain grave citizens who had business matters to be looked after , and who were willing to sacrifice their prejudices to the prospect of gain ; and seeing in the ungainly Yankee a safe and industrious counselor they gave him their business , in spite of his personal unpopularity both with the people and the bar . As might have been expected it was soon discovered that if any real serious law was wanted the Yankee was retained . The revolution thus created was looked upon with disgust . The necessity of putting him down became apparent . The result was , that after trying every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a secret meeting of the sufferers that if the Yankee lawyer was permitted to go on unchecked he would soon be on one side or the other of every important case brought in the jndicial district , lie must therefore , if possible , be disposed of ; and presuming that from his early education he was opposed to dueling , it was decided to involve him in some personal difficulty which would demand a challenge , and presuming he would refuse to fight , they might then post him on the court-house door for cowardice , and thus destroy his character and professional business . After the plot was matured the conspirators placed their names in a hat and drew them out with the understanding that they should in rotation , if necessary , challenge the Yankee intruder , and persist in this until their diabolical plot was carried into execution . It was the misfortune of my friend the Judge to be at the head of the list ; young , ardent , and urged on by a thoughtless crowd and an overwhelming public opinion , he the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The natural manliness of the Yankee rebelled at its grossness , and he resented it instantly by knocking his antagonist down . The plot sueceeded better than was anticipated , a blow had been given , this filled the Judge with demoniac fury , the challenge was sent , the Yankee accepted it , and the party met on the field . At the first fire the New Englander fell shot through the heart ; his body was unceremoniously buried in a fence-corner near where he was sacrificed ; his friends at home probably never heard of his untimely fate ; and except for a passing tradition he was supposed to be no more . Such was the adventure of the Judge when a young man ; and it is no doubt true that so obtuse was his feelings at the time , and so clearly was he inspired with the idea of correctness of conduct , that at the moment he had no idea or even suspicion that he had done wrong . But as time wore on , and his associates and supporters in that duel died or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under this pernicious influence his health gradually failed ; but it was a long time before he lost the power of keeping up the exterior of a happy and contented man . One of his peculiarities was to take an intense dislike to any one who had seen him in one of his moments of remorseful suffering ; he fairly hated such persons , and made them feel that it was dangerous to be near hini . I was at the time of my adventure unacquainted with the cause of the " perilous stuff ' that poisoned his heart . I had noticed his fits of abstraction , but saw in them nothing inconsistent , as he was a man of delicate health and of a capricious disposition . When Mr. Clay was running for the Presidency the Judge and myself set off on a straggling political tour . It was fine weather , the people were excited , the political contest was vigorously hut generously conducted , and although men differed in politics , it d*d not affect their friendly personal relations . In our meanderings through the backwoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small room of a log-cabin . After lying side by side some time discussing the events of the day I fell into a prof6und sleep , but was finally awakened by hearing my companion breathing heavily . By the aid of the moonlight struggling through the chinks of the logs I saw his face was pale and distracted , while his mouth was drawn aside with the feeling of the intensest agony . A smothering sensation seemed predominant , as if suffocation was threatened . Alarmed for the result I seized him by the shoulder and woke him up . " Barnes ! " exclaimed the Judge , gazing wildly and wickedly in my face- " Barne* , why do you pursue me thus ? Have n't von had your revenge ? Have n't you slept quietly these ten years , while I have been lashed with a whip of scorpions all the while ? " I again shook him by the shoulder and said , " Judge , wake up , you are dreaming ! " In another instant his fine eye grew intelligent with recognition , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despairing sorrow , of wounded pride , anger , and maliciousness , as // he comprehended that I knew his weakness , and that he stood unveiled , a trembling , stricken victim of an outraged conscience . A fearful sensation gradually stole over me . I felt that a great gulf had been created between us . I knew the Judge 's proud spirit ; his contempt of danger , his insanity , indeed , when his self-esteem was injured ; and I had most unhappily seen his soul naked , cringing , and blasted ; I had been an unwilling witness to the interior of a whited sepulchre . The next day the gentlemen of our party hinted darkly that the Judge , from his wan face and distracted air , must have had one of his " fits . " When it was understood that I had occupied the same room I was informed of the misfortune that I had suffered , and I was told that I had better be cautious and circumspect in the Judge 's presence , for if he perceived by word or look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy for life . I lived in this way a year ; sometimes the Judge would be very sociable with me , and would treat me with all the unreserve of an old friend ; at other times he would be cold and forbidding , or , if conversational , I could see he was cross- questioning me in various ways to get at my real thoughts . On one of these occasions he took down Shakspeare and read some passages from " Macbeth , " and asked me what I thought of such highly-wrought pictures of the stings of conscience . I evaded making any answer , and he dropped the subject . Soon after this he was buried in the bosom of his family ; it was given out as usual in such cases that he had had a nervous attack . The blinds were all down , and a dreadful silence appeared to rest on the dwelling . A clergyman in the neighborhood made frequent visits , and occupied much time in offering prayer and giving consolation . While recovering from this unusually prolonged attack he sent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedside . He thanked me for the manner I had treated his conduct on the night we occupied the little room in the log-cabin . He frankly confessed the cause of his emotions , and detailed to me the incidents I have related of his duel . He told me he went upon the field without the slightest idea of the possibility of any serious consequences . That he had been from his youth up acquainted with persons who had " killed their man in a duel , " and he had not the slightest suspicion from their conduct that they looked back with any regret ; indeed he thought a duelist 's reputation was the passport LO worldly success . That with these vague and undefined notions of right and wrong he had killed his victim , *rofessedly to revenge an insult which he voluntarily and premeditatedly gave . " Oh , " said the Judge , finally , diopping exhausted upon his pillow- " oh , that I could even for an hour bring that man to life , that I might for so short a while take this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has haunted me - sat at my table , been my companion in my office , leered at me when arguing a case at the bar , crowded me out of my seat on the bench , walked with me when in the streets with my children and wife . Oh , Heaven , what will be the end ! " A day or two afterward the Judge was in the streets ; he affected the nonchalance of a man at peace with himself . His loud , but now to me affected , laugh told the superficial observer that he was a happy man ; and the aspiring youth who witnessed his manner , and had a a taste for the admiration of being concerned in a duel , quoted the Judge as an example of how lightly the consequences sit upon the conscience ; and so to the end he mocked the world , making fools believe there was no punishment for slaying a man in a duel . Having given an illustration of the misery that follows a fatal duel , the suffering that precedes a bloodless one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts of the preliminaries of the remarkable duel that took place between Mr. Randolph and Mr. Clay . Certainly two men more tichly endowed by nature never lived , and their concession to the terrible exactions of the dueling code show how almost impossible it . is to rise above them . Both gentlemen possessed in the highest degree moral courage ; their whole public life affirms this . They differed in political sentiments , and in the . mental struggle for supremacy the irritable and eccentric Virginian , unaccustomed to defeat , displayed the conscious weakness of his cause by descending to personal defamation , and to impugning Mr. Clay 's honesty of purpose . In the bitter partisanship of the times Mr. Clay 's enemies applauded these attacks , and thus encouraged they were continued by Mr. Randolph , until Mr. Clay found further forbearance impossible . It has been , I think , very justly held by high authorities that the seconds in a duel are more to blame than the principals . They negotiate the preliminaries of the meeting , they coolly load the pistols , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wounded honor ; yet it is they who put the instruments of destruction in the hands of persons who are laboring under the intensest mental irritation and physical excitement . Gentlemen of no ordinary social and political position were the seconds of Mr. Randolph ; each individual had character enough to have been a peace-maker without the possibility of having his motives impugned . The night before the duel Mr. Randolph 's mind was evidently filled with a sense of uneasiness , not of personal danger , but with a suspicion that he had without cause provoked the quarreL Under this excitement he sent for his second-his adviser and early and dearest friend . He answered the summons , and found Mr. Randolph in a calm ana confiding mood , " who opened the conversation with these pathetic words : " I am determined to receive without returning Mr. Clay 's fire ; nothing shall induce me to harm a hair of his head . I will not // make his wife a widow or his children orphans . Their tears would he shed over his grave ; but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not in the wide world a person to pay this tribute to mine . " And overcome hy hisfeelings he bent his head upon his hand and gave vent to tears . Here was true manliness breaking through the trammels of the duelist 's code ; it was godlike nature speaking out and rebelling under a barbarous superstition . But while Mr. Randolph was thus melted , thus humanized , his second , his adviser , this " friend of his youth , " did not dream of conciliation ; he never suggested that possibly Mr. Randolph had been wrong in offering " his enormous and unprovoked insults " upon Mr. Clay , and that now , when passion had subsided and calm reason had assumed its sway , there was a greater and more noble satisfaction to be given than could be tendered on the field . That Mr. Randolph could , without compromising himself as a man , frankly acknowledge the injustice he had rendered the " Great Statesman of the West , " and thus not only do an act on which Heaven would smile , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice of dueling for all coming time. * Fortunately Mr. Clay 's bullet missed its mark , and Mr. Randolph fired in the air . Instantly Mr. Clay stepped forward , and with great emotion said , " I trust in God , my dear Sir , you are untouched ; after what has occurred I would not harm you for a thousand worlds . * Of what practical effect was this duel ? It decided no question of fact touching the honor of either party ; it changed no one 's opinion respecting the truth or falsehood of Mr. Randolph 's charges against Mr , . Clay ; on the contrary , the question at issue remained just where it was before the duel took place , and so must remain to the end of time . Familiarity with danger breeds contempt of it ; and it is this rule that finally makes the bravado . The history of our frontiers affords many instances of men who were for long years desperadoes , and who defied all the laws , human and divine , with seeming impunity ; and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury and refinement , and of polished education , inexperienced in the use of deadly weapons , have been suddenly brought in contact with these outlaws , and conquered them on their own fields and in their own bloody and inhuman way . A remarkable instance of this is remembered where a descendant of General * Unfortunately the second did nothing of this ; he - seemed to have not the slightest idea that Mr. Randolph , though entirely in the wrong , could *ive any other satisfaction to the man he had injured except at the pistol 's mouth . Who can believe , after reading Mr. Randolph 's pathetic words , that he would not have met Mr. Clay at that very time , if his second had suggested it , and made such concessions as would have done justice to both , and relieve the world of the example of two such great men meeting in mortal combat ? Philip Schuyler , who some thirty years ago , while traveling in the Southwest , was set upon by one of these inhuman fiends . The man 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defied arrest or punishment . He had been repeatedly warned by the constituted authorities of his State , declared an outlaw , and a large reward was then offered for his arrest . Schuyler was a stranger , and at the time was waiting at the village tavern for the mail-stage . To loiter away the time , he was with a number of the villagers sitting at a table amusing himself with conversation and indulging at the same time in fits of laughter . Suddenly the party was interrupted by a yell almost as loud as a steam-whistle , which noise was followed by a volley of braggadocio epithets and the general inquiry , " What the people round the table were making all that noise about ? " The parties in the locality turned pale as they recognized the redoubtable Gamble , for they saw there was mischief in his frenzied eye . The outlaw , having delivered himself of the opinion that every man present was a sneak and a coward , ended with deliberately discharging a mouthful of tobacco-spittle upon the polished boot of Schuyler , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by external appearance , be pronounced a gentleman . The rude men who witnessed this congratulated themselves that the blow had fallen upon a helpless traveler , and that in the skirmishing and catastrophe that must follow they could make their escape . To Schuyler this insult was electrical , and , rising with indignation , he demanded of Gamble ( of whose history at the time he knew no-thing ) , " Did you intentionally spit upon my boot ? " Gamble was speechless with rage and astonishment , and as soon as he could recover the use of his tongue he thundered out , " Yes ! and I 'll do the same for your face next time ; " but before he could carry his disgusting threat into execution Schuyler struck the outlaw such a blow in the chest that the ruffian went reeling against the side of the wall . In another instant the parties closed with each other , and a rough-and-tumble fight ensued , in which each party attempted in vain to use their knives . The spectators formed a ring , and looked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Gamble was killed , they got clear of the terror of the vicinity ; if the stranger , what difference did it make to them ? The fight continued , without seeming damage , until both parties separated for a moment from exhaustion ; but as they were about to renew the contest the landlord interfered , and s*uggested that both men be shut up in a dark room , each armed with a revolver and bowie-knife , and be thus left in a quiet way to fight it out " like gentlemen . " The proposition was received with cheers , and Gamble especially indorsed the proposition . Schuyler was silent , but showed himself to be as resolute and fearless as a tiger . When // qwq dust " a Mississippi River sand-bar then just above qwq cellus , in triumph . " It is difficult to imagine , " says the chronicle , " the lamentable spectacles the city presented , the courtiers and people casting down their faces for shame , not knowing what course to take for the reparation of their honor . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admirable Crichton " arrived , and he is represented as being neither able to eat nor drink till he first sent a challenge to the conqueror , appealing to him to repair , with his best sword in his hand , at nine o'clock in the morning of the next day , in presence of the whole court , and in the same place where he had killed " the other three , " to show that in the court of Mantua there were as valiant men as he . The challenge was accepted , and there gathered together the Duke , the Duchess , with all the noblemen , ladies , magnificoes , and all the choicest of both men , women , and maids of the city . The combatants , dressed in shirts and drawers , and without any other apparel , took their places , their rapiers of exact equal length being handed to them by the Duke . At the proper signal , a shot from a great piece of ordnance , the two combatants made their approach to one another . For a while Criebton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charmed with the sweetness of his countenance , and correspondingly disgusted with the sternness of the other 's aspect . The old chronicles give the exact details of the fight , and dwell at length upon the dexterity and quickness of Crichton , who evidently depended on science to overcome brutal force . Each successive advantage is hailed with joy by the ladies , whose bright eyes flash encouragement upon the champion of Mantua ; and as Crichton gains one advantage after another over his rude and vaunting foe-as he forces his rapier with mathematical precision into the breast , arms , and belly of his antagonist , and seems disposed to slowly and by piecemeal render him helpless to the finishing stroke-the sweet Duchess , the fair women , and innocent maids of Mantua wave their jeweled hands and flash encouragement from their sweet eyes ; the conquered at last giving up the ghost , ghastly and gory , comforting himself that he could not have died by the hands of a braver man . A distinguished officer in the American navy , who was in command off the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matamoros , gave me an illustrative anecdote of the duel as it was understood by the officers of the British navy at the close of our war of 1812 . Soon after peace had been declared between Great Britain and the United States , and while both sides were chafing under the idea that the war had been fruitless of any good results , my informant found himself on board of a small United States brig in the harbor of Calais , which was at the time crowded with ships of the largest size belonging to England , France , and Spain , which vessels made the petty affair under the Stars and Stripes look more than naturally insignificant by comparison . The opportunity of making disparaging allusions against the United States Navy was ft-eely indulged in , and the few American officers who ventured ashore had to stand a great deal of implied insult . One evening Lieutenant Guest , a Tennesseean by birth , went ashore , and entering the most fashionable coffee-house , found it crowded with ga*ly-dressed navy and army officers of every first-class nation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside his richly gold-laced and gayly-plumed rivals ; in fact he felt that he was personally as insignificant in appearance as his vessel was in the naval display in the harbor . After looking carefully around and finding no table entirely vacant , he discovered an empty chair which brought him opposite a British officer . There was a general bnz in the room as Guest took his seat ; a sort of feeling evidently prevailed that something exciting might happen from the unexpected meeting . Guest felt that every eye was upon him , but he affected the utmost indifference , and coolly lighted a cigar , and ordering a cup of coffee , seemed to be engaged with curling the fragrant tobacco smoke about his disdainfully curled-up nose . The Englishman was made to feel from the outside pressure that he was bound to distinguish himself and this idea on his part was more and more intensified as the officers of the different nationalities present turned their exl ) ectant eyes upon him . Guest sipped his coffee in silence , but he was finally interrupted with the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American brig in the harbor ? " " I am , " return*d Guest , in a bland manner . " I am glad I have had the pleasure of meeting you , " continued the Englishman , " for I have for a long time been anxious to ask some intelligent American officer what he thought would probably be the result to his country should it again go to war with England . " " I have not the slightest idea , " returned Guest , very deliberately lighting another cigar ; " Jam only a naval officer , and not a statesman . " " But , " continued the questioner , pushing his point with a pertinacity that occasioned a sensation among the lookers-on- " hut you have some opinion on the subject ? " The spectators now began to gather round the table and suspend conversation . " I have an opinion , " said Guest , finally ; " a very decided opinion , indeed ; but I am not obliged to give it . " Here the spectators looked at the Englishman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he returned to the charge by saying , rather tartly , " he should like to hear what his opinion was . " " If you insist upon it , " said Guest , " I will oblige you , though I do not think this is a time or place for political discussion . " " Let 's have the opinion , nevertheless , " urged the Englishman , affecting a yawn. // " Well , " said Guest , " if your country and mine ever get into another war it has been decided by my Government at Washington to send a sloop-load of powder over to your country , dig a hole in the middle of it , and then set the powder on fire ; and my opinion is that the explosion will blow your boasted British isle out of the water . And now , " continued Guest , rising , " since you have gotten hold of a state secret perhaps you want the authority ; so here 's my card , " and Guest placed it upon the table . " And there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious and very red in the face . There was a suppressed murmur through the entire room , and here and there could be heard sounds indicative of sarcastic laughter , amidst which Guest left the saloon , the spectators falling back so as not to oppose his progress . On reaching his vessel Guest found Lieutenant Hove , the officer in charge , and remarking that he was very much fatigued , he said he would turn in at once , and added , as if parenthetically , " If you get a letter addressed to me in the course of the morning open it and make all the necessary arrangements without consulting me . Good-night . " It was noon ere Guest made his appearance on deck , and he then learned with surprise that no letter had been received , and he found it very difficult to explain the reason . It was certainly impossible that his jest could be construed into any thing less than an intended insult . The day wore on without incident until toward sundown , when a boat was seen putting off from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streamers , and had a number of officers *n board who seemed to be in unusually good spirits . The boat in its circuit made a sort of visit to almost every ship in the harbor , and , after attracting unusual attention , pulled straight to the American brig , when a note was sent up addressed to Lieutenant Guest , U.S.N. , and , without waiting for an answer , moved away . It was with unusual interest that the officer addressed opened the note , but its contents filled him with surprise and astonishment . It was written on official note-paper , and from the flag-ship of the British fleet ; the object was to request Lieutenant Guest , and such of his friends as he might select , to honor with their presence a social dinner party to be given the next day on board of his Majesty 's ship the Thunderer . As this was the first act of courtesy that had taken place between the representatives of the two great rival nations , and as it was so cordially and so informally worded , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to say that Lieutenant Guest and his friends at the proper time repaired on board of the Thunderer , and , after spending an hour or two on deck in pleasant chit-chat , they were invited to a splendid repast , at the conclusion of which complimentary toasts were given to the American navy , and the hope expressed that nations of the same parentage , speaking the same language , might never be at war with each other again . Though the American officers were thus treated , and though all formality was dispensed with , still they felt that this hospitality had something to do with Lieutenant Guest 's affair at the coffee-house ; for in the moments of the greatest hilarity there was an evident restraint that was not common at a convivial party of professional sailors . The dinner ended the guests proceeded to the deck of the ship , and were there greeted , as if by accident , with the usual ceremony that pertains to the reading of an official document addressed to the fleet . Courtesy required that Lieutenant Guest and his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined when they heard the finding of a court-martial upon the case of officer in His Majesty 's service , who , for wantonly provoking an insult in a public house , and before and in the presence of innumerable witnesses , and then for refusing to properly resent the same , is hereby cashiered from His Majesty 's service . The instant the reading was ended the usual bustle on board of a man-of-war commenced , and the British officers , more kindly ceremonious than ever , bade adieu to the American officers ; and so ended this romantic adventure , founded upon the then accepted laws of dueling . It is a melancholy fact , probably , that the brilliant legal genius of S. S. Prentiss will be forgotten when reminiscences of him will be remembered . Prentiss was a New Englander , and probably had by education as great a horror of dueling as any man living ; but when he went South he found that public opinion favored the code , and as he intended to succeed , he was not going to embarrass himself with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duel than to be annoyed by a questionable public opinion . As hundreds of others have done , he discovered moral to be a more difficult kind of courage than mere physical bravery . In the splendor of his early career he was surrounded by the associations subsequently designated as " the flush times " of Mississippi . Vicksburg , his chosen residence , was then in the height of its unparalleled prosperity . No city in the South ever rose to wealth and importance and refinement as rapidly ; and the consequence was it gave an eccentric , reckless , and novel character to its population . The prominent citizens were about equally divided between the best representative men of the North and the South , the former giving solidity and order to all business enterprises ; the latter inspiring society with a kind of " reckless chivalry " and devil-may-care spirit that was as positive as it was novel . The failure to have a note discounted at a bank was often treated as a personal insult . We knew of one gentleman who attacked another in the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the midst of the excitement of prosperity the citizens would hold public meetings and vote equal sums for the building of a church and a theatre . At one of these popular assemblies some one suggested that a ferry-boat was needed , and thereupon an appropriation was provided , and in due time the boat was completed . It was a gay time when the little craft came down the river from its birth-place at Pittsburg , covered with flags , and announcing its arrival by peals of petty artillery that echoed far and wide against the high bluffs , and then died away over the lowlands in the west . The excitement of welcome over , it was discovered for the first time that there was no town on the Arkansas shore opposite to run the boat to , and its usefulness promised to be a failure . The proprietor , however , was not easily put down . The Arkansas shore opposite was then the great dueling-place for Mississippians and high-spirited people of the adjoining States ; and as soon as it was known that they could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherished than ever . A bull or bear fight had none of the charms that seemed to cluster about these human combats ; and if the parties engaged happened to be popular editors , or gentlemen of large political reputation , enthusiasm knew no bounds . Prentiss , in his wildly humorous way , used to declare that the ferry-boatman provoked duels to enrich his exchequer , and that he had large placards printed in blank , to be filled up and posted about the streets when necessary ; but this was unquestionably an exaggeration . A pending duel was often announced , and this was advertisement enough ; nor was it necessary to take any especial pains to find combatants . If the general market was dull , the rival editors of the city were pitted against each other , their daily editorials always being personal enough to afford the basis of a pretty quarrel . The present generation of active men can not remember what a painful , and almost awful interest these combats excited away from their active centre ; nor will the injury they did , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ever be fully appreciated . Yet there was nothing in them that does not afford a parallel among the records and doings of excitable Irishmen who thirty years earlier made Dublin and Gaiway so famous for the dueling codes . It was not uncommon in Ireland for difficulties growing out of legal arguments to be decided by pistols ; as yet we have no recollection of ever hearing of a Southern court that adjourned to witness the fight . Yet Curran , when unknown to fame , provoked the ire of one Walsh , who was a great favorite with ( he mob , and all the members of the bar except the judge went out to see the " sport . " The principals were conducted to a ten-acre inclosare surrounded by a hedge , from behind which the legal spectators , along with the idlers of the entire village population , peeped , and encouraged the combatants after their peculiar fashion . Prentiss was as witty as Curran , and just as reckless . He was the idol of a crowd , the members of which were never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal difficulties , when it was seldom a dinner party could be kept up until a late hour without ending in an affair of honor ? Of dueling , when he first commenced his career at Vicksburg , he spoke with nnreserved censure or keen sarcasrn . His remarks were considered pardonable because they came from a New Englander , but they finally got up the impression he would not fight-that his early education would paralyze his natural courage . It was under this impression he was drawn into his first difficulty ; but he came out of it so gallantly , displayed so much physical courage , such daring recklessness , that he annihilated the plotters against him , and did this without the ordeal of a combat . But when the political excitement of the times of 1833 came on he got involved in a duel with Governor Foote , who was his social equal , and met that gentleman on the field . The affair created but little excitement ; but when a second duel was announced there was a sort of dramatic concentration of public sentiment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the meeting was agreed upon Prentiss amused himself with a continued volley of witticisms at his antagonist 's expense . He was at one and the same time the most blood-thirsty and the most jocular of principals , and he so managed to tickle the public taste that no duel was ever fought in the Southwest more remarkable for its peculiarities. *3overnor Foote was a most courageous man , but it was proverbial that while he would stand up and be fired at without the slightest hesitation , yet he was said to be such a poor shot that " he could n't hit a barn-door at ten paces . " Prentiss had no great practice with a pistol ; he had never fired one until a man grown ; yet by his extraordinary muscular power a weapon in his hand was as firmly held as if screwed in a vice . The wisdom of having a ferry-boat at Vicksburg was now fully justified in the excitement of this duel , for nothing could exceed the holiday gayety that prevailed among the crowds as they precipitated themselves on the Arkansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the spectators , and his repartees were passed like electrical currents from mouth to mouth . It was a grand spectacle , and nothing more . After he was placed on the ground he heard a twig of a tree break over his head , and looking up observed a rosy-cheeked , blue-eyed boy belonging to one of his neighbors . The opportunity for a jest did not escape him . " Get down , my little man , " said he , " for Governor Foote is a poor shot , and you may get wounded with his pistol . " What must have been Governor Foote 's feel . ings as he heard this allusion to his want of skill can well be imagined . // It was a miracle of excellent surgery that Governor Foote was not killed , Prentiss 's ball making sad havoc in his person ; and it is safe to say that if death had ensued the naturally susceptible tendencies of Mr. Prentiss 's nature would have driven him mad . And what a picture is this of civilization ! the moralist may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this extraordinary or unprecedented . O'Connell fought his celebrated duel in the county of Kildare , about twelve miles distant from Dublin . The place was " well ckosenfor spectators , " being near the foot of a bill , from which many thousands could and did hehold the proceedings without crowding or interruption . The antagonist of O'Connell fell mortally wounded , and a loud and cruel yell went forth from the valley , and was sent back again from the hills , while its echoes were prolonged from field to field ; the pang occasioned by these shouts far surpassed the anguish occasioned by the dying man 's wound . O'Connell was victorious , and his victim , after a few hours of suffering , slept quietly in the grave ; but it was a secret from the world how quiet was O'Connell 's conscience . Have we not some inkling , however , that nil was not peace , when we find him long years afterward sacrificing an immense sum , as a reward of his professional pursuits , to hurry away to a distant part of Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of the lonely and impoverished widow of the man he killed ? Thirteen years after Mr. Prentiss fought Governor Foote he found himself enriched with a wife and children , and no one seemed more happy than he in his domestic circle . For language used before a court while attending to his professional duties he received g challenge . The sacred home responsibilities under which he was placed gave a new phase to the circumstance ; yet , while suffering the most intolerable agony , he could not refuse to fight . He reasoned with himself , regretted the necessity , contemplated with agony the possibility of leaving his family unprotected , yet he could not resist the temptation . He finally wrought himself up with the idea that he must fight for his wife and children , and he conceived that his mortal suffering was a trial of his faith through his religious teachings . Mr. Prentiss , while he was thus walking in the " valley and shadow of death , " was to the world calm , dispassionate , and often playfully witty . Yet he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he did nothing but pray , weep , and read the Bible-that he was worn away to a perfect shadow , and tottered like an old man . " What a melancholy picture ! what a terrible fascination ! This fear of public opinion has seldom indeed been resisted . Mr. Prentiss 's confessions of remorseful suffering , which we have quoted because they have been authentically published to the world , are no doubt characteristic of those of every man who has been reared to look upon dueling as a crime , while the remorse which we think always follows the shedding of blood in a duel is universal , whatever may have been the early education . We have the record of one distinguished gentleman who had the moral courage to refuse a challenge , and the affair is doubly interesting from the character of the parties engaged . In the year 1856 the Hon. T. B. Hill , Presidential elector , in the height of a political discussion , spoke of the Hon. Alexander Stephens ( subsequently Vice-President ofthe Southern Confederacy ) " as having hetrayed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Iscariot by abusing it afterward . " Words personally more harmless , it seems , could not have been uttered ; yet Mi* . Stephens took offense , and opened a detailed correspondence . No understanding was effected , and Mr. Stephens , according to the practice of the duello , posted Mr. Hill as a coward . Now this occurred in Georgia , where the public sentiment was in favor of dueling ; both the parties were Southern men , and had Southern men for constituents , and yet Mr. Hill , more courageous than Mr. Prentiss , accepted the direful consequences ; and instead of seeking redress with pistols , was content to make an appeal to the intelligent and good in vindication of his conduct . His letter is a fine specimen of logic , and in a few words , and in a better manner than we have ever before seen , disposes of the subject . In his reply to Mr. Stephens be says : " You say that my letter , both in tone and manner , is personally offensive in itself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you proceed to ask of me that satisfaction which is usual between gentlemen in such cases . ' It might he some satisfaction for you to shoot at me , thoul*h I should entertain no great fear of being hit ; hut candor requires me to say , with my present feelings , I could not deliberately shoot at you , and for many reasons  --  a few only of which I will now give . " I might possibly kill you ; and though you may not consider your life valuable , yet to take it would be a great annoyance to me ever afterward . The ceaseless accusations of my conscience that I was a murderer would be the bane of all my feture happiness . " If the invitation to mortal combat is intended as a mere formal occasion to exchange a few harmless shots , ant ? then have an adjustment , I can only say that I never engage in farces , or make feigned issues . If I could be made conscious that I had done you injustice I should deem it a dtity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot at . If you did me injustice I met the ace qion with the remedy , and it does seem made a shot which produced a wider if not deeper sore than any within the power of powder and ball to produce . " Now , Sir ( as I always speak plainly ) , I will only add that I know of nothing which has occurred between you and me which could authorize or justify a duel ; and while I have never at any time had an insult offered me , nor an aggression attempted , I shall yet know how to meet and repel any that may be offered by any gentleman who may presume upon this refusal or otherwise . " This correspondence occurred more than twelve years ago , and was at the time the subject of a vast amount of newspaper controversy throughout the country . It is no doubt true // that the thinking , solid men of Georgia , as a general thing , approVed of Mr. Hill 's conduct , and yet there is reason to believe it injured that gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not affect his social standing or professional career . Those who made Mr. Lincoln 's acquaintance after he came to Washington as Chief Magistrate , and were personally cognizant of his remarkable goodness of heart and his unusually kind feelings , are surprised to learn that such a man hnd gravely accepted a challenge and gone out to fight a duel . The occasion was made memorable , of course , by Mr. Lincoln 's humor . Under the most trying circumstances this quality of his mind seemed to predominate ; and it was , after all , this rare quality that sustained his spirit through the dark days of his administration , and kept him cheerful and hopeful while all around bun were sad and despondent . It has been the custom of historians of Illinois to say that in 1820 was fought the first and last duel in that State . There were circumstances connected with it that display unusual characteristics , and gave a practical example of the predominancy of the New England element that largely made up the original settlers of the State , and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing odious . Two obscure men , named respectively Stewart and Bennett , quarreled , and their friends , for the sake of a joke , agreed upon a sham duel . Stewart was in the secret , but Bennett , in the hopes that he would be made ridiculous , was left to understand the thing was earnest . The duel was fought with rifles loaded with blank cartridges . When placed on the ground Bennett , from certain things he witnessed , conceived the idea they were playing a trick upon him , and , unobserved by his seconds , dropped a ball in his weapon . The word fire was given , and Stewart fell dead , whereupon Bennett made his escape . Two years afterward he was arrested , brought back to Illinois , and tried for murder . Public opinion was against the barbarous practice , and Bennett was convicted and sentenced to be hung . The Governor of the State refused to pardon the criminal , and he was executed . The result was that dueling was unpopular in Illinois-there were associations about it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet , with this historical fact before Mr. Lincoln , he seemed to have lacked the moral courage to treat a challenge with contempt , and accepted its requirements and agreed to fight with dragoon swords . On the ground , which was on the Missouri side of the Illinois river , he mentioned to his second that the spot was most appropriately selected , as it was in sight of the Penitentiary . There was evidently in his mind a clear idea that he was engaged in a criminal transaction . His second was fortunately a man of equal humor with Mr. Lincoln , and managed to so mar the actual meeting with preliminaries and qualifications , and the unusual height of Mr. Lincoln compared with his antagonist , who was a short man , made it so difficult to get an equal length of arm , that all parties at last conceived that the whole thing was ridiculous , and it was amicably settled ; and , as is generally the case , there was no real cause for a quarrel . The attentive reading of the records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no rules to be induced that imperatively govern such encounters . Decatur , the most valiant man of his day , fell under the fire of his inferior in courage and reputation . DEsterre was a professed duelist , yet he was slain by O'Connell , who had on a former occasion , contrary to the Galway rules , accepted , without exchanging shots , a reconciliation on the field . Alexander hamilton had passed through the dangers of a long war with a reputation untarnished ; he was a vestryman of his chosen church , an active Christian gentleman , the head of a large family circle ; he was known to be an enemy of the duello ; and yet with such a history , and living in a community that discountenanced dueling , he yielded to its demands and lost his life . It is beyond a doubt true that every man who has fought and killed another in a duel suffers more or less remorse of conscience , though we have examples where such feelings are hidden from the world . We believe that General Jackson never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie felt in his closet was only known to his Maker . As a rule all great soldiers , at least of modern times , have discouraged dueling ; but their example or opinions of the matter are of questionable value . They are above the necessity of being tried . Washington affords the noblest example the world ever gave in this matter . He denounced dueling , and pardoned a blow and made acknowledgment that he deserved it as a just punishment for an offered insult . All his companions in arms accepted his views , with the exception of Mad Anthony Wayne . He recognized the code by aiding the officers engaged in affairs of honor to leave and enter the lines without the password . Success in personal combats depends upon physical peculiarities . The accomplished and apparently effeminate gentleman is often , as in Schoyler 's case , competent at a moment 's notice to the display of the coolest and most determined physical courage . Mr. Graves , of Kentucky , who killed Mr. Cilley , said it required a higher order of courage to refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remorse which followed his experience , he did not hesitate to say that if he was ever involved in a similar difficulty he hoped he would be enabled to exercise that nobler species of courage that accorded with moral obligations , rather than act from fear of public opinion . The courage that fights a duel and that which sustains the soldier in the field are of an entirely different character . When the late rebellion broke out our Southern cities were filled with professed and celebrated duel- // THE STREETS OF WASHINGTON . 411 ists . Their admirers expected from them brilliant deeds in war ; we have no knowledge of their success . Dueling , from beginning to end , judged by the tests of practical merit , or by the inspiration of Christ 's teachings , seems to be without a single redeeming character . Its hold upon the sympathy of mankind is strange and incomprehensible , and can only be accounted for on the principle that there is a leaven of the savage in our nature that can neither he regulated by reason nor subdued by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The incomprehensibleness of the fascination of dueling has excited the speculation of the greatest minds . Sir Francis Bacon is confounded with the speenlation . He says , touching the causes of it , " The first motive , no doubt , is a false and erroneous imagination of honor and credit ; and therefore the king , in his last proclamation , doth aptly and excellently call them hewitchinq duels . For if one judge of it truly , it is no better than sorcery that enchanteth the spirits of young men that have great minds with a false show ; a kind of satanscal illusion and apparition of honor against religion , against law , against moral virtue , and against the precedents and examples of the best times and valliantest nations . " It is honorable to our Government that it has for nearly twenty years officially and legally condemned dueling , and holds the violator of the law strictly accountable for his conduct . Documents of more political importance have emanated from the Department of State at Washington than the one which deprived the duelist diplomatic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved by the good people of the country than the following : " Sin-It is a matter of public notoriety , and as is believed unquestionable , that you have been a principal party to a duel near this city . By this step you have violated the act of Congress approved February 20 , 1839 , entitled An act to prohibit the giving or accepting within this District of Columbia a challenge to fight a duel , and for other purposes . ' This proceeding on your part is the more to be regretted and the more unaccountable as your military experience must have made you familiar with the twenty-fifth article of war , which prohibits any officer or soldier sending or acceptiu* , a challenge to fight a duel upon pain of being cashiered .

If , however , you should deem it advisable to leave Costa Rica before your successor shall arrive , the accompanyin , sealed letter to the President of that republic announcing your recall will enable you to do so with propriety . In that event you will commit the archives of the legation to the custody of some respectable citizen of the United States . Yours , etc. , " WILLIAM H. Sawuin . " That the duel has been taken advantage of for the purposes of gross wrong is apparent , but that its terrors have had a conservative influence in newly settled countries there can not be a doubt . It is also true that American duels have gained an exaggerated importance by being subjected to unusual newspaper publication , and by their too frequently sanguinary ending . This fatal characteristic is moie owing to the earnestness of American life , and the familiarity of our people from their youth up with deadly weapons , than to any blood-thirstiness or unusual cruelty of character . Reviewing the whole ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that American national development is not regardless of human life , and that its saugninary history bears a favorable comparison with older , more highly cultivated , and more pretentious civilizations .
