txt ART . VII . - A Brief Treatise upon constitutional and Party Questions , and the . Jliistory of Political Parties , as I received it oral Qifrom the late Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois . By J. MADISON CUTTS , Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel , U. S. A. New York : D. Appleton &amp; Co. l2mo. pp. 221 . TuE compiler or editor of this little book is the brother-inlaw of the late Mr. Douglas , and explains in the Preface the character and authenticity of his work . " In the summer of 1859 , Mr. Douglas remained in Washington ; and as I was very desirous of receiving from him a statement of his own political faith , with the general views of a statesman upon constitutional , political , and party questions , I prepared , with his consent , a brief analysis of such subjects as I wished him to explain to me . We were in the habit of spending an hour together each evening , until all the questions I had proposed were answered . " It is a work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unsatisfactory ; and its particular statements are often palpably untrue , as when , upon page 121 , Mr. Douglas says that " nearly all the Republicans throughout the country went into its lodges , ' * - meaning the ranks of the Know-Nothing party . This is a good illustration of the looseness with which Mr. Douglas was in the habit of stating facts . Thus , in his article upon the dividing line between federal and local authority , published in Harper 's Mag* azine , which was an elaboration of all his speeches during the // 510 Stephen A. Douglas . Kansas debate , Mr. Douglas begins his history of the Jeffersonian plan by asserting that the territory which was ceded by Virginia on the 1st of March , 1784 , was the first territory ever acquired by the United States . The truth is , that on the 29th of October , 1782 , Congress accepted from New York her claim to Western territory . This is an unimportant fact , indeed , but it shows the inaccuracy of his statements . The graver errors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross ignorance of Mr. Douglas upon subjects upon which he was constantly dogmatizing . In the article of which we have spoken , he asserted distinctly that the prohibition of slavery after the year 1800 " never became a part of the Jeffersonian plan of government for the Territories , as adopted April 2* , 1784 . " Now the facts are , that the anti-slavery proviso was supported by sixteen of the twenty-three members of Congress present on the 19th of April ; but they were so divided as not to give the necessary majority of States , which was seven ; and the proviso was defeated at that time . But it was readopted by the Congress of 1785 , on the 16th of March , a fact which Mr. Douglas either did not know or which he conceals ; while the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 , which was unanimously adopted , renewed the anti-slavery proviso of the Jeffersonian plan for every Territory over which Congress then had control . The object of Mr. Douglas 's representations was to prove that the question of slavery was left by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The truth was exactly the other way . Mr. Douglas 's article was one of the futile efforts made in the last days of slavery to impose upon a presumed public ignorance of the history of the country , and to make it appear that the fathers of the Revolution were as indifferent as Mr. Douglas and his party to the rights of man . Those who are really intere*ted to know Mr. Douglas 's views upon the great questions of his time will probably look elsewhere than in Lieutenant-Colonel Cutts 's book to find them . But such persons are very few , and will be constantly fewer . We have lived so fast during the war , and have become so familiar with great principles and sturdy character , that , although Mr. Douglas died but five years ago , he seems to have been dead for half a century . His name is already merely a // partisan memory , and we can look at him now as he will appear in history . Indeed , every honorable and thoughtful American has been in a manner forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President of the United States , accompanied by part of his Cabinet , and by General Grant and Admiral Farragut , makes a public pilgrimage through the country to the tomb of Douglas , praising him lavishly as he goes , when William Henry Seward speaks of Mr. Douglas as a man " to whom the nation and the world owe an irredeemable debt , " it is quite time for every man who values morality and honesty to protest against so gross an insult to American manhood and to the fundamental principle of the American government . The only act of Mr. Douglas 's political life which can be remembered with honor was his willingness to vindicate the authority of the government against the Rebellion . In consideration of that act , the country was content to leave his name to the charity of silence . But if his example is to be cited to young Americans of another generation as noble and praiseworthy , it would be treachery not to tell the truth , that he was a warning , not an example ; and that nothing showed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that , just before the war , he was considered by many persons to be a true statesman ; for , of all our noted politicians , Mr. Douglas was the one who had reduced immorality in politics to a science . Thi*s is the single point in his career to which we now wish to call attention . A man of plausibility and adroitness , Mr. Douglas was totally destitute of deep convictions or of moral force . His attainments were superficial , and his methods of public persuasion and appeal utterly mean and unscrupulous . He had a certain popular attraction akin to that of a prize-fighter , which was favored even by his personal appearance ; and he might well be called the Benicia Boy of American politics . But he was iiistinctively shunned by nobler minds , and was most distrusted by those who most truly understood our government and its principles , and who believed most in the people . His ambition was uncontrollable . He lived for political effect , and constantly in the public eye . Like all demagogues , he despised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there // was a certain vulgar familiarity with the crowd , there was never a generous impulse , or heroic thought , or a profound and humane principle . His speeches were often skilfully sophistical , but there was never any gleam of humor in them , nor grace of fancy , nor touch of pathos . They were incredibly commonplace ; and we doubt if a single sentence from one of them survives in any school-book of declamation , or lingers in one human memory . He confirmed no young man 's faith ; he cheered no old man 's despondency . His name is identified with a political dodge , a trick , an intentional deception , which might consign a race to endless slavery and plunge the country into hopeless commotion , and welcome , provided it made him President . In all that Mr. Douglas said and wrote , the only proposition which has even the appearance of a political principle is what was known as " squatter sovereignty , " or , as he preferred to express it , " popular sovereignty . " This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidency in the repeal of the Missouri Compromise . It was the substance of his speeches in Congress from the time of that repeal to his death ; and it was the staple of that famous political tournament between him and Mr. Lincoln for the Illinois Senatorship , in which the very worst sophistry that has ever endangered the American principle , embodied in its most plausible champion , went down before the wonderful strength and skill of that principle itself , embodied in its greatest and most characteristic representative which our history has produced . There is no chapter of our political history which at this time we should so warmly recommend to the young student as the report of this great debate . Nowhere else are the moral principles upon which this government was founded , and consciously founded , so plainly and sensibly and racily set forth . Mr. Lincoln dealt with his antagonist with a half-amused , half-contemptuous air , as if admiring his vigorous battle , while he utterly despises and abhors his cause . He crushes Douglas 's most elaborate and ingenious sophistries by main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insidious appeals to popular prejudice . The very audience which Douglas had inflamed by a specious sneer , Lincoln surprises into nobleness by a frank appeal to their manhood . // It is not the least of the services of Abraham Lincoln to his country and to mankind , that , before directing triumphantly the war against the spirit which would have overthrown the government by force , he had thoroughly exposed , in the sophistry of Douglas , the spirit which would have overthrown it by demoralizing the people . The Rebellion sought to dam the stream ; Douglas , to poison its fountains . The Rebellion was the battery in the open field honestly bombarding ; Douglas was Guy Fawkes in the cellar stealthily plotting a secret explosion . It is small praise to him who had for years and years stimulated the passions of the Southern oligarchy , - and who , according to General Quitman , declared in 1856 , just before the meeting of the Presidential Convention of his party , that the South was too easily satisfied ,  --  that , when he saw he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he vehemently opposed them . The man whd , after encouraging the enemy to the utmost , and carrying them powder and ball , then , discovering that he is not to be made their commander , suddenly declares against them , may be entitled to silence , but surely not to praise . The consuming ambition of Mr. Douglas 's life was the Presidency . To secure that result he had taken in the interest of the South the only ground upon which , as he knew , the Southern policy had any chance whatever of being sustained in the Free States . For taking that ground in its own service the South deserted him , and defeated forever the ambition of his whole career . Then it rebelled against the government , and it is hard to believe that , in springing to defend the government , Mr. Douglas did not taste the fierce joy of personal and political revenge . Mr. Douglas 's doctrine of squatter sovereignty was merely the bold assertion , that a majority of a certain class of the population , arbitrarily selected , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberties of the rest . " A political community , " he said in substance , " we are all agreed , may rightfully govern itself . Now a Territory is a political community ; let it therefore establish such institutions as it prefers . Certainly inca who are properly voters in the various States in which they live do not lose their capacity by going to a Terntory . If , therefore , in that Territory they wish to have com // mon schools , very well ; if not , not . If they wish to have slavery , very well ; if not , not . We may not like it , but the majority of the people must decide . It is their affair , not ours . " But who are the people ? That was a question he never pretended to answer , but which was vital to the whole discussion . lie begged the entire debate by assuming that only white persons were people . " I admit , " says Mr. Lincoln , " that the emigrant to Kansas and Nebraska is competent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ govern any other person without that person 's consent . " And Mr. Douglas was silent . But while the assertion was politically folly , it was morally criminal . Follow it to any logical result . " If the majority wish to legalize blood-revenge , very well ; if not , not . If they choose to disfranchise all who are over thirty years of age , or who have aquiline noses , or re*l hair , very well ; if not , not . If they choose to tolerate murder or to eucour*ge falsehood , very well ; if not , not . It is their affair , not ours . They are competent to decide for themselves . " Now iu a world where there were no such things as right and wrong , Mr. Douglas might have been a great statesmau ; but in this world no man and no body of men can have a right to do wrong . Any political community may decide whether the legal rate of interest shall be six or seven or eight per cent . It may decide what taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the people or of one man has the right to deprive a single innocent person of his eyesight , or of the honest wages of his labor , or of any other of his natural rights . The majority have indeed the might to do these things , but that is all . In speaking of Burke , Macaulay , who was certainly not a visionary political speculator , says that he did not deny that Parliament was legally competent to tax America , as it was legally competent to commit any other act of folly and wickedness , to attaint any man of high-treasou without witnesses , or to confiscate all the property of all the India merchants . But from acts like these , he says , they are bound by every obligation of morality systematically to refrain . But Douglas could not plead the legal coi petence for his squatter sovereigns . His first step was a slicer assumption , and from that he gravely proceeded to confound might with right , insisting that morals had nothing to do with politics . // In the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the air of a man who is at last found out . He had been the undisputed great man of the West , - the Little Giant of his party ; and lo ! here was a giant-killer . It was Captain MacHeath in the midst of his gayest and most audacious rogueries suddenly confronted with the officer of the law , infinitely cooler and cleverer than himself , and with all the majesty of the law upon his side . The Captain scoffs and sneers and patronizes and cajoles , but in vain . He runs and doubles and twists , but to elude the swiftness and force of his pursuer is hopeless . Stung with conscious defeat and exposure , he flings mud and filth of every kind , but equally in vain . Speaking in a part of Illinois in which the prejudice against negroes was most bitter , Mr. Douglas does not hesitate to insist , with coarse insinuation , that Mr. Lincoln must be an amalgamationist . Mr. Lincoln quietly replies : " I protest against the counterfeit logic which concludes that , because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must necessarily want her for a wife . 1 need not have her for either . I can just leave her alone . In some respects she certainly is not my equal ; but in her natural right to eat the bread she earns with her own hands , without asking leave of any one else , she is my equal and the equal of all others . " When the long debate between them ended , the glittering but preposterous sophism with which Douglas had dazzled the nation was ended also , and the whole country had been authoritatively recalled to the remembrance of the great truth , that our government rests upon a strictly moral basis , because it is founded upon a confession of the equal rights of man . From this debate to the end of Mr. Douglas 's life was but three years . Besotted with the fierce thirst for the Presidency , he went on uttering the most monstrous doctrines . In the resolution he introduced into the Senate , after the arrest of old John Brown , he betrayed the most daring disdain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeches in the Southwest , after his election as Senator over Mr. Lincoln , he outraged decency and common sense . He shouted that lie did not care whether slavery were voted up or down . He affirmed that the white people of every State had a perfect right to enslave // the colored part of its population or not , at its pleasure . He insisted that the fathers , in the Declaration of Independence , spoke and meant to speak of white people only , and white people of the Anglo-Saxon race ; nor was he satisfied with that , but alleged that the equality spoken of was the equality of British subjects born and living in this country to British subjects born and living in Great Britain ! He congratulated his hearers that the monstrous heresy of the incompatibility of a permanent continuance of Free and Slave States in one Union had been hurled back upon those who uttered it ; and repeated the old folly of his speeches in Illinois , that " between the negro and the crocodile , he took the side of the negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would go for the white man . " But what , at last , is this proposition ? " asked the remorseless Lincoln . " I believe it is a sort of proposition in proportion , which may be stated thus : As the negro is to the white man , so is the crocodile to the negro ; and as the negro may rightfully treat the crocodile as a beast or reptile , so the white man may rightfully treat the negro as a beast or reptile . " But it was in vain that , after his election as Senator in 1858 , Mv . Douglas made his most obsequious bow to the slave power at the South , and went haranguing the people from Cairo to New Orleans , saying with a smile , " Have slavery if you like it , my good friends ; it is nobody 's business but your own . " The slave power , also , had found him out . The leaders of the oligarchy were terribly in earnest , and wise in their generation , and Mr. Douglas had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed it to go into the Territories , as of constitutional right ; and secondly , he adopted , although for quite another purpose , the principle of the Republican party , which was perilous to slavery , that it was the creation of local and municipal law . This had , indeed , been the original plea of slavery , but it had changed its ground ; for upon this plea it was condemned to a fair struggle with liberty , in which it was foredoomed . It now haughtily asserted its universal constitutional right . And this was essential ; for , unless it could carry this concession , nothing but the sword remained . Mr. Douglas saw this , undoubtedly , as plainly as the Southern leaders ; but he knew what they could not know , and would not know , that // the Free States could never be wheedled or blinded or bullied into such a position . He was entirely right in declaring that Mr. Buchanan 's course in Kansas , and upon the whole subject of the nationalization of slavery , was fatal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conscience , common sense , and self-interest of all the Free States . Mr. Douglas saw , aud truly ; that the sole hope of his party lay in his nomination , and he had certainly crawled low enough and long enough to earn it ; but he did not seem to comprehend that the South , which was the inspiring force of the party , in adopting him , surrendered its ground of the constitutionality of slavery . Wiser than he , also , the Southern leaders fully understood the radical nature of the conflict . They knew that they could no longer rule the country through their party , and they were ready for the chances of civil war . So his masters spurned him without pity . The very want of earnestness revealed by his reckless cry that he did n't care whether slavery were voted up or down , was sufficient reason for them to reject him ; and utterly chagrined and enraged , he threw himself into the arena of the Presidential campaign of 1860 against them . He stumped the country , addressing acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate , disappointed , embittered ; counting upon his personal popularity , upon the national confusion , and upon the cowardice of the country . But , as always with a man who has no moral convictions , he had no perception of the true character of the people . Accustomed to appeal only to their basest passions and poorest prejudices , he knew nothing of the deeper and purer springs of popular action . In the tremendous contest of that year , Mr. Douglas represented nothing but his own ambition . Behind the words he passionately spoke , there was nothing but the unscrupulous career of a pettifogging politician . In his dire extremity there was no noble popular remembrance to succor him , no generous defence of imperilled right to shield him with its heavenly ray . The country *yas whirling onward to civil war , and he was tossed upon the wild current like a dried leaf upon Niagara . By day and by night he ranged through the land , offering it his stale and outworn trick as a panacea for the throes of birth and death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the stern battle-cry of the two great principles in conflict . " Slavery shall not go into the Territories , " cried one . Slavery shall go everywhere , " cried the other . " Come , come , gentlemen , do n't trouble yourselves about the nigger ; let slavery take its chance , " laughed he between . " The mills of God ! beware ! beware ! " whispered in his ear the rousing conscience of the land . " The mills of God ! There are no mills of God ! " he cried ; - and instantly lie was caught up and ground to powder between the terrible mill-wheels of Liberty and Slavery . This was the man who , while public sentiment was confused and the public conscience torpid , was accounted a statesman , but who , the instant that conscience awoke , shrivelled before its scorching inquisition , until now his name has no other significance than that of an unscrupulous and adroit politician . This was the man who trampled upon the fundamental principles of this government , and to whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrimage . This is he to whom Mr. Seward declares that the nation and mankind owe an irredeemable debt , and of whom he affirms that he thinks " Stephen A. Douglas with Abraham Lincoln will live in the memory and homage of mankind equally with the Washingtons and ilamiltons of the Revolutionary age . " Such words from such a man are inexpressibly mournful . For more fully than any other two men in this generation , Lincoln and Douglas illustrated in their lives and words and acts the two principles which have always contended and are still struggling for mastery in this country , - the despotism of caste and the principle of equal rights . Douglas said plainly : " The Declaration of Independence , when it declared that all men were created equal , had no reference to the negro ; they were not talking of negroes nor thinking of them ; they were speaking of white men , - men of European birth , European descent , - struggling for the rights of this continent against the tyranny attempted to be imposed upon them by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of white men , that they were created equal , that is , equal to their brethren across the water . " Lincoln said , with equal plainness , speaking of the framers of the Declaration : " In their enlightened belief nothing stamped with the Divine image and // likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on and degraded and imbruted by its fellows . They grasped not only the race of men then living , but they reached forward and seized upon the furthest posterity . They created a beacon to guide their children and their children 's children , and the countless myriads who should inhabit the earth in other ages . Wise statesmen as they were , they knew the tendency of prosperity to breed tyrants , and so they established these great , self-evident truths , that when in the distant future some man , some faction , some interest should set up the doctrine that none but rich men , or none but white men , or none but Anglo-Saxon white men were entitled to life , liberty , and the pursuit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Declaration of Independeuce , and take courage to renew the battle which their fathers began , so that truth and justice and mercy and all the humane and Christian virtues might not be extinguished from the land ; so that no man could hereafter dare to limit and circumscribe the great principles on which the temple of Liberty was being built You may do anything with me you choose , if you will but heed these sacred principles . You may not only defeat me for the Senate , but you may take me and put me to death . While pretending no indifference to earthly honors , I do claim to be actuated in this contest by something higher than an anxiety for office . I charge you to drop every paltry and insignificant thought for any man 's success . It is nothing ; I am nothing ; Judge Douglas is nothing . But do not destroy that immortal emblem of humanity , - the Declaration of Independence . " We have a right to be both proud and glad of the fact - for it reveals the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke these words to be their chief magistrate when the contending principles appealed to the sword ; that they honor his memory with more tender reverence than any American was ever before honored ; and that their present clear and firm and humane resolution to plant the government upon the truths of the Declaration of Independence shows that , though dead , he yet speaketh.
