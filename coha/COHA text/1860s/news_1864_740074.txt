txt While the nation at large ie only interested in the deeds of our armies , there are thousands of anxious hearts in the North whose individual sympathies are centered In some one loved being , lingering far away upon some racking be of sickness , and wondering whether or not  --  the object of their solicitude is being treated with care or neglected . Ilia for those anxious hearts at home that these remarks are ' penned. ' 1 I bad an opportunity , yesterday , of going over the whole of the enormous range of hospitals here , for the purpose of examining their condition , and to witness the practical working of the Sanitary Commission , which has now become an inseparable branch of the army itself , The hospitals are delightfully situated u ponrusing ground on the right bank of the pretty Appomattox , and cover an extent of , I should judge , not less than half a mile in length and as much in breadth . They are composed of tents neatly laid out in regular streets , with the ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fanciful devices of hearts , stars , &c.,; and along the streets , crossing each other , are regular avenues , ingeniously formed of fir branches twisted around poles and arching overhead ; thus forming extremely picturesque vistas , ai cool and refreshing as they are beautiful . Nothing could give a grander idea of the Inherent energies of an army of men , than to come and see how , in so short a time , a little town has been created , good roads formed and neatly graded , and water pipes  --  supplied by a pumping machine in the river ? laid down throughout , and conveying the refreshing liquid to the remotest tent . Indeed , but for the temporary look of mere canvas dwellings , such are the order and Symptoms of comfort and cultivation everywhere , that one would imagine , instead of this being the temporary base hospital of an army yet in motion , it was destined to remain a permanent and thriving little town . As many as 6,000 patients have been accommodated here at a time , but at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , those that could be with safety removed being sent to permanent hospitals in the North , and only those remaining who are too ill to move or who are on the eve of recovery . Each corps of the army has its own hospital here , the negro regiments also , all under experienced and attentive physicians , and the order and care so manifeet everywhere , would make it invidious to single out any especial one for commendation . But the feature connected with these hospitals which most interested ms was the admirable working of the Sanitary Commission among them , which is really one of the grandest exhibitions of spontaneous , practical philahthropy which the world ever beheld , To enumerate what this society supplies to cur sick and wounded solliery would be to run through the whole catalogue of human wants , in clothing , food and comfort , not only for the body , but the mind  --  for they even supply entertaining literature for those who can enjoy it , The Government has done all that a Government can do ? far more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the care of our suffering men ; but there is a point which Government can not reach and where individual charity must step in to look into the minutlas of our soldiers ' necessities . This is what the Sanitary Commission has effected ; condensing into a focus the magnanimous tritutes of a grateful and feeling nation , and bringing to each suffering couch the comforts and almost the sympathies of home . At every corps hospital Is to be found a branch depot of the Sanitary Commission , in direct communication with their general and exhaustless depot located at City Point Wharf . At these branch depots ' supplied not only with every necessity , but every luxury that a sick man can require , watchful agents ara ever present , searching into the needs of each individual patient , ( Whether our own or the enemy 's is quite immaterial , ) and , under the advice of the phy sicians , immediately supplying whatever the patient may require . Wines , jellies , milk punch , preserves , delicacies of every imaginable kind that would grace the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here distributed by the bucket and the bushel . To give some idea of the extent of this noble institution , 60,000 patients have already , since the 1st of May passed through the hands of the agents here ; alone . During the month of June the Commission expended $250,000 ; the same amount in July ; and although that expenditure was somewhat less in August , there is every likelihood that , in the event of any great battles occurring . the months of September and October may see as large , cr even larger outlays . Ever +since May they have had constantly running to and from this place , three steamers , three barges and a tugboat . They not only take care of the soldiers while bed-ridden , but supply those who need it with crutches when they go away , and , in the event of death , undertake their burial , place a decent head-stone over them , and send a record , with maps of the burial-ground , to Washington ? all gratuitously . At Fredericksbnrgh , Port Royal , White House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burials . When we remember that the same good work which is going on here is also being carried wit by this seine commission wherever the armies of the United States are to be found , vie may form some idea of the gigantic nature of this national chart ? ty , and proudly ask if the civilized world ever beheld the like . Dr. W. F. SWALII is the acting Association Secretary in Charge at this department , and superintends the whole work , both in the field and at the base . Mr. Joins A. Aiterasoe Is tee Superintendent of the transportation , anu Mr. FaANA U. FAT has the ; are of the auailiary corps , whose especial duty it Is to see that the benefits of the Commission shall circulate through every nook and corner of the artlY . I have much pleasure , alter what I have personally witnessed , in bearing testimony to the efficiency with which these gentlemen are performing their , noble and arduous duties .                  @ @ @
