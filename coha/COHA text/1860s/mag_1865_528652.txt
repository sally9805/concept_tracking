txt THE CHIMNEY-CORNER . VI . LITTLF* FOXES . - PART V. INTOLERANCE . * ND what are you going to preach A about this month , Mr. Crow-field ? " " I am going to give a sermon on Intolerance , Mrs. Crowfield . " " Religious intolerance ? " " No ,  --  domestic and family and educational intolerance , - one of the seven deadly sins on which I am preaching , - one of the foxes . ' " PEOPLE are apt to talk as if all the intolerance in life were got up and expended in the religious world ; whereas religious intolerance is only a small branch of the radical , strong , all - pervading intolerance of human nature . Physicians are quite as intolerant as theologians . They never have had the power of burning at the stake for medical opinions , but they certainly have shown the will . Politicians are intolerant . Philosophers are intolerant , especially those who pique themselves on liberal opinions . Painters and sculptors are intolerant And housekeepers are intolerant , virulently denunciatory concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exact , seated at her domestic altar , gives homilies on the degeneracy of modern housekeeping equal // to the lamentations of Dr. Holdfast as to the falling off from the good old faith . " Do n't tell me about pillow-cases made without felling , " says Mrs. Alexander ; " it s slovenly and shiftless . I would n't have such a pillow-case in my house any more than I 'd have vermin. ** " But , " says a trembling young housekeeper , conscious of unfelled pillowcases at home , " do n't you think , Mrs. Alexander , that some of these old traditions might be dispensed with ? It really is not necessary to do all the work that has been done so thoroughly and exactly , - to double-stitch every wristband , fell every seam , count all the threads of gathers , and take a stitch to every gather . It makes beautiful sewing , to be sure ; but when a woman has a family of little children and a small income , if all her sewing is to be kept up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitching . Had she not better slight a little , and get air and exercise ? " " Do n't tell me about air and exercise ! What did my grandmother do ? Why , she did all her own work , and made grandfather 's ruffled shirts besides , with the finest stitching and gathers ; and she found exercise enough , I warrant you . Women of this day are miserable , sickly , degenerate creatures . " " But , my dear Madam , look at poor Mrs. Evans , over the way , with her pale face and her eight little ones . " " Miserable manager , " said Mrs. Alexander . " If she d get up at five o'clock the year round , as I do , she d find time enough to do things properly , and be the better for it . " " But , my dear Madam , Mrs. Evans is a very delicately organized , nervous woman . " " Nervous ! Do n't tell me ! Every woman nowadays is nervous . She ca n't get up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do her sewing decently , because she s nervous . Why , I might have been as nervous as she is , if I d have petted and coddled myself as she does . But I get up early , take a walk in the fresh air of . a mile or so before breakfast , and come home feeling the better for it . I do all my own sew-733 ing ,  --  never put out a stitch ; and I flatter myself my things are made as they ought to be . I always make my boys ' shirts and Mr. Exact 's , and they are made as shirts ought to be , - and yet I find plenty of time for calling , shopping , business , and company . It only requires management and resolution . " " It is perfectly wonderful , to be sure , Mrs. Exact , to see all that you do ; but do n't you get very tired sometimes ? " " No , not often . I remember , though , the week before last Christmas , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one day , and I was really quite worn out ; but I did n't give way to it . I told Mr. Exact I thought it would rest me to take a drive into New York and attend the Sanitary Fair , and so we did . I suppose Mrs. Evans would have thought she must go to bed and coddle herself for a month . " " But , dear Mrs. Exact , when a woman is kept awake nights by crying babies " - " There s no need of having crying babies ; my babies never cried ; it s just as you begin with children . I might have had to be up and down every hour of the night with mine , just as Mrs. Evans does ; but I knew better . I used to take em up about ten o'clock , and feed and make em all comfortable and that was the last of em , till I was ready to get up in the morning . I never lost a night 's sleep with any of mine . " Not when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to manage that . I used to lance their gums myself , and I never had any trouble : it s all in management . I weaned em all myself , too : there s no use in having any fuss in weaning children . " " Mrs. Exact , you are a wonderful manager ; but it would be impossible to bring up all babies so . " " You 11 never make me believe that : people only need to begin right . I m sure I ye had a trial of eight . " " But there s that one baby of Mrs. Evans 's makes more trouble than all your eight . It cries every night so that somebody has to be up walking with // it ; it wears out all the nurses , and keeps poor Mrs. Evans sick all the time . " " Not the least need of it ; nothing but shiftless management . Suppose I had allowed my children to b* walked with ; I might have had terrible times , too ; but I began right I set down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did ; and if they cried , I never lighted a candle , or took em up , or took any kind of notice of it ; and so , after a little , they went off to sleep . Babies very soon find out where they can take advantage , and where they ca n't . It s nothing but temper makes babies cry ; and if I could n't hush em any other way , I should give em a few good smart slaps , and they would soon learn to behave themselves . " " But , dear Mrs. Exact , you were a strong , healthy woman , and had strong , healthy children . " " Well , is n't that baby of Mrs. Evans 's healthy , I want to know ? I m sure it is a great creature , and thrives and grows fat as fast as ever I saw a child . You need n't tell me anything is the matter with that child but temper , and its mother 's coddling management . " Now , in the neighborhQod where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lady Bountiful , the pattern female . Her cake never rises on one side , or has a heavy streak in it . Her furs never get a moth in them ; her carpets never fade ; her sweetmeats never ferment ; her servants never neglect their work ; her children never get things out of order ; her babies never cry , never keep one awake o ' nights ; and her husband never in his life said , " My dear , there s a button off my shirt . " Flies never infest her kitchen , cockroaches and red ants never invade her premises , a spider never had time to spin a web on one of her walls . Everything in her establishment is shining with neatness , crisp and brist.ing with absolute perfection , - and it is she , the ever-up-and-dressed , unsleeping , wideawake , omnipresent , never - tiring Mrs. Exact , that does it all . Besides keeping her household ways thus immaculate , Mrs. Exact is on all sorts of charitable committees , does all sorts of fancy - work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is a most available , most helpful , most benevolent woman , and general society has reason to rejoice in her existence . But , for all this , Mrs. Exact is as intolerant as Torquemada or a locomotive-engine . She has her own track , straight and inevitable ; her judgments and opinions cut through society in right lines , with all the force of her example and all the steam of her energy , turning out neither for the old nor the young , the weak nor the weary . She can not , and she will not , conceive the possibility that there maybe other sorts of natures than her own , and that other kinds of natures must have other ways of living and doing . Good and useful as she is , she is terrible as an army with banners to her poor , harassed , delicate , struggjing neighbor across the way , who , in addition to an aching , confused head , an aching back , sleepless , harassed nights , and weary , sinking days , is. burdened everywhere and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her troubles are nothing but poor management , and that she might do just like her , if she would . With very little selfconfidence or self-assertion , she is withered and paralyzed by this discouraging thought . Is it , then , her fault that this never-sleeping baby cries all night , and that all her children never could and never would be brought up by those exact rules which she hears of as so efficacious in the household over the way ? The thought of Mrs. Alexander Exact stands over her like a constable ; the remembrance of her is grievous ; the burden of her opinion is heavier than all her other burdens . Now the fact is , that Mrs. Exact comes of a long-lived , strong-backed , strongstomached race , with " limbs of British oak and nerves of wire . " The shadow of a sensation of nervous pain or uneasiness never has been known in her family for generations , and her judgments of poor little Mrs. Evans are 734 June , // about as intelligent as those of a good stout Shanghai hen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shanghai hens , - and very ornamental , and in a small way useful , these humming-birds ; but let them not regulate each other 's diet , or lay down schemes for each other 's housekeeping . Has not one as much right to its nature as the other ? This intolerance of other people 's natures is one of the greatest causes of domestic unhappiness . The perfect householders are they who make their household rule so flexible that all sorts of differing natures may find room to grow and expand and express themselves without infringing upon others . Some women are endowed with a tact for understanding human nature and guiding it . They give a sense of largeness and freedom ; they find a place for every one , see at once what every one is good for , and are inspired by Nature with the happy wisdom of not wishing or as king of any human being more than that human being was made to give . They have the portion in due season for all : a bone for the dog ; catnip for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book or review for their bashful literary visitor ; lively gossip for thoughtless Miss Seventeen ; knitting for Grandmamma ; fishing-rods , boats , and gunpowder for Young Restless , . whose beard is just beginning to grow ; - and they never fall into pets , because the canary-bird wo n't relish the dog 's bone , or the dog eat canary-seed , or young Miss Seventeen read old Mr. Sixty 's review , or young Master Restless take delight in knitting-work , or old Grandmamma feel complacency in guns and gunpowder . Again* there are others who lay the foundations of family life so narrow , straight , and strict , that there is room in them only for themselves and people exactly like themselves ; and hence comes much misery . A man and woman come together out of different families and races , often united by only one or two sympathies , with many differences .. Their first wis dom would be to find out each other 's nature , and accommodate to it as a fixed fact ; instead of which , how many spend their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good as their own in its way , but not capable of meeting their requirements ! A woman trained in an exact , thriving , business family , where her father and brothers bore everything along with true worldly skill and energy , falls in love with a literary man , who knows nothing of affairs , whose life is in his library and his pen . Shall she vex and torment herself and him because he is not a business man ? Shall she constantly hold up to him the example of her father and brothers , and how they would manage in this and that case ? or shall she say cheerily and once for all to herself , - " My husband has no talent for business ; that is not his forte ; but then he has talents far more interesting : I can not have everything ; let him go on undisturbed , and do what he can do well , and let me try to make up for what he can not do ; and if there be disabilities come on us in consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us both take them cheerfully " ? In the same manner a man takes out of the bosom of an adoring family one of those delicate , petted singing-birds that seem to be created simply to adorn life and make it charming . Is it fair , after he has got her , to compare her housekeeping , and her efficiency and capability in the material part of life , with those of his mother and sisters , who are strong-limbed , practical women , that have never thought about anything but housekeeping from theircradle ? Shall he all the while vex himself and her with the remembrance of how his mother used to get up at five o'clock and arrange all the business of the day , - how she kept all the accounts , how she saw to everything and settled everything , - how there never were break-downs or irregularities in her system ? This would be unfair . If a man wanted such a housekeeper , why did he not get one ? There were plenty of single // women , who understood washing , ironing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little canary - bird which he fell in love with , and wanted for her plumage and her song , for her merry tricks , for her bright eyes and pretty ways . Now he has got his bird , let him keep it as something fine and precious , to be cared for and watched over , and treated according to the laws of its frail and delicate nature ; and so treating it , he may many years keep the charms which first won his heart . He may find , too , if he watches and is careful , that a humming-bird can , in its own small , dainty way , build a nest as efficiently as a turkey-gobbler , and hatch her eggs and bring up her young in humming-bird fashion ; but to do it , she must be left unfrightened and undisturbed . But the evils of domestic intolerance increase with the birth of children . As parents come together out of different families with ill - assorted peculiarities , so children are born to them with natures differing from their own and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new child as a piece of special property which they are forthwith to turn , to their own account . The poor little waif , just drifted on the shores of Time , hasperhaps folded up in it a character as positive as that of either parent ; but , for all that , its future course is marked out for it , all arranged and predetermined . John has a perfect mania for literary distinction . His own education was somewhat imperfect , but he is determined his children shall be prodigies. l-Jis first-born turns out a girl , who is to write like Madame de Stad , - to be an able , accomplished woman . He bores her with literature from her earliest years , reads extracts from Milton to her when she is only eight years old and is secretly longing to be playing with her doll 's wardrobe . He multiplies governesses , spares no expense , and when , after all , his daughter turns out to be only a very pretty , sensible , domestic girl , fond of cross - stitching embroidery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than for poetry and composition , he is disappointed and treats her coldly ; and she is unhappy and feels that she has vexed her parents , because she can not be what Nature never meant her to be . If John had taken meekly the present that Mother Nature gave him , and humbly set himself to inquire what it was and what it was good for , he might have had years of happiness with a modest , amiable , and domestic daughter , to whom had been given the instinct to study household good . But , again , a bustling , pickling , preserving , stocking - knitting , universalhousekeeping woman has a daughter who dreams over her knitting - work and hides a book under her sampler , - whose thoughts are straying in Greece , Rome , Germany , - who is readin5 , studying , thinking , writing , without knowing why ; and the mother sets herself to fight this nature , and to make the dreamy scholar into a driving , thorough-going , exact woman - of- business . How many tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time lost , in such encounters ! Each of these natures , under judicious training , might be made to complete itself by cultivation of that which it lacked . The born housekeeper can never be made a genius , but she may add to her household virtues some reasonable share of literary culture and appreciation , - and the born scholar may learn to come down out of her clouds , and see enough of this earth to walk its practical ways without stumbling ; but this must be done by tolerance of their nature , - by giving it play and room , - first recognizing its existence and its rights , and then seeking to add to it the properties it wants . A driving Yankee housekeeper , fruitful of resources , can work with any tools *r with no tools at all . If she absolutely can not get a tack-hammer with a claw on one end , she can take up carpet-nails with an iron *poon , and drive them down with a flat-iron ; and she has sense enough not to scold , though she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She knows that she is working with tools made to do something else , and never thinks of being angry at their unhandiness . She might have equal patience with a daughter unhandy in physical things , but acute and skilful in mental ones , if she once had the idea suggested to her . An ambitious man has a son whom he destines to a learned profession . He is to be the Daniel Webster of the family . The boy has a robust , muscular frame , great physical vigor and enterprise , a brain bright and active in all that may be acquired through the bodily senses , but which is dull and confused and wandering when put to abstract book-knowledge . He knows every ship at the wharf , her build , tonnage , and sailing qualities ; he knows every railroad-engine , its power , speed , and hours of coming and going ; he is always busy , sawing , hammering , planing , digging , driving , making bargains , with his head full of plans , all relating to somethinb outward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his ideas are clear , his observation acute , his conversation sensible and worth listeninb to . But as to the distinction between common nouns and proper nouns , between the subject and the predicate of a sentence , between the relative pronoun and the demonstrative adjective pronoun , between the perfect and the preter-perfect tense , he is extremely dull and hazy . The region of abstract ideas is to him a region of ghosts and shadows . Yet his youth is mainly a dreary wilderness of uncomprehended , incomprehensible studies , of privations , tasks , punishments , with a sense of continual failure , disappointment , and disgrace , because his father is trying to make a scholar and a literary man out of a boy whom Nature made to till the soil or manage the material forces of the world . He might be a farmer , an engineer , a pioneer of a new settlement , a sailor , a soldier , a thriving man of business ; but he grows up feeling that his nature is a crime , and that he is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he had been blindly predestined to before he was born . Another boy is a born mechanic ; he understands machinery at a glance ; he is all the while pondering and studying and experimenting . But his wheels and his axles and his pulleys are all swept away , as so much irrelevant lumber ; he is doomed to go into the Latin School , and spend three or four years in trying to learn what he never can learn well , - disheartened by always being at the tail of his class , and seeing many a boy inferior to himself in general culture who is rising to brilliant distinction simply because he can remember those hopeless , bewildering Greek quantities and accents which he is constantly forgetting , - as , for example , how properispomena become paroxytones when the ultimate becomes long , and proparoxytones become paroxytones when the ultimate becomes long , while paroxytones with a short penult remain paroxytones . Each of this class of rules , however , having about sixteen exceptions , which hold good except in three or four other exceptional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilder ; and the crowning beauty of the whole is , that , when the bewildered boy has swallowed the whole , - tail , scales , fins , and bones , - he then is allowed to read the classics in peace , without the slightest occasion to refer to them again during his college course . The great trouble with the so-called classical course of education is , that it is made strictly for but one class of minds , which it drills in respects for which they have by nature an aptitude , and to which it presents scarcely enough of difficulty to make it a mental discipline , while to another and equally valuable class of minds it presents difficulties so great as actually to crush and discourage . There are , we will venture to say , in every ten boys in Boston four , and those not the dullest or poorest in quality , who could never go through the discipline of the Boston Latin School without such a strain on the brain and The Chiirn ; iey-Corner. // nervous system as would leave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , whose talents lay in the line of natural philosophy and mechanics , passed with brilliant success through the Boston English High School . He won the first medals , and felt all that pride and enthusi* asm which belong to a successful student . He entered the Latin Classical School . With a large philosophic and reasoning brain , he had a very poor verbal and textual memory ; and here he began to see himself distanced by boys who had hitherto looked up to him . They could rattle off catalogues of names ; they could do so all the better from the habit of not thinking of what they studied . They could commit the Latin Grammar , coarse print and fine , and run through the interminable mazes of Greek accents and Greek inflections . This boy of large mind and brain , always behindhand , always incapable , utterly discouraged , no amount of study could place on an equality with his form*r inferiors . His health failed , and he dropped from school . Many a fine fellow has been lost to himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a failure . The collegiate system is like a great coal-screen : every piece not of a certain size must fall through . This may do well enough for screening coal ; but what if it were used indiscriminately for a mixture of coal and dia-monds ? " Poor boy ! " said Ole Bull , compassionately , when one sought to push a schoolboy from the steps of an omnibus , where he was getting a surreptitious ride . " Poor boy ! let him stay . Who knows his trials ? Perhaps he studies Latin . " The witty Heinrich Heine says , in bitter remembrance of his early sufferings , - " The Romans would never have conquered the world , if they had bad to learn their own language . They had leisure , because they were born with the knowledge of what nouns form their accusatives in im . " Now we are not among those who decry the Greek and Latin classics . We think it a glorious privilege to read both those grand old tongues , and that an intelligent , cultivated man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those olden times loses a part of his birthright ; and therefore it is that we mourn that but one dry , hard , technical path , one sharp , straight , narrow way , is allowed into so goodly a land of knowledge . We think there is no need that the study of Greek and Latin should be made such a horror . There is many a man witl*out a verbal memory , who could neither recite in order the paradigms of the Greek verbs , nor repeat the lists of noun* that form their accusative in one termination or another , who , nevertheless , by the exercise of his faculties of comparison and reasoning , could learn to read the Greek and Latin classics so as to take their sense and enjoy their spirit ; and that is all that they are worth caring for . We have known one young scholar , who could not by any possibility repeat the lists of exceptions to the rules in the Latin Grammar , who yet delightedly filled his private note-book with quotations from the " zEneid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek Reader , at the same time that he was every day " screwed " by his tutor upon some technical point of the language . Is there not many a master of English , many a writer and orator , who could not repeat from memory the list of nouns ending my that form their plural in les , with the exceptions under it ? How many of us could do this ? Would it help a good writer and fluent speaker to know the whole of Murray 's Grammar by heart , or does real knowledge of a language ever come in this way ? At present the rich stores of ancient literature are kept like the savory stew which poor Dominie Sampson heard simmering in the witch 's kettle . One may have much appetite , but there is but one way of getting it . The Meg Merrilies of our educational system , with her harsh voice , and her " Gape , sinner , and swallow , " is the only intro-738 June , // duction , - and so , many a one turns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching the classical languages is peculiar to them alone . Multitudes of girls and boys are learning to read and to speak German , French , and Italian , and to feel all the delights of expatiating in the literature of a new language , purely because of a simpler , more natural , less pedantic mode of teaching these languages . Intolerance'in the established system of education works misery in families , because family pride decrees that every boy of good status in society , will he , nill he , shall go through college , or he almost forfeits his position as a gentleman . " Not go to Cambridge ! " says Scholasticus to his first-born . " Why , I went there , - and my father , and his father , and his father before him . Look at the Cambridge Catalogue and you will see the names of our family ever since the College was founded ! " " But I ca n't learn Latin and Greek , " says young Scholasticus . " I ca n't remember all those rules and exceptions . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could only know how my head feels when I try ! And I wo n't be at the foot of the class all the time , if I have to get my living by digging . " Suppose , now , the boy is pushed on at the point of the bayonet to a kind of knowledge in which he has no interest , communicated in a way that requires faculties which Nature has not given him , - what occurs ? He goes through his course , either shamming , shirking , parrying , all the while consciously discredited and dishonored , - or else putting forth an effort that is a draft on all his nervous energy , he makes merely a decent scholar , and loses his health for life . Now , if the principle of toleration were once admitted into classical education , - if it were admitted that the great object is to read and enjoy a language , and the stress of the teaching were placed on the few things absolutely essential to this result , - if the tortoise were allowed time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fish to swim , towards the enchanted and divine sources of Helicon , - all might in their own way arrive there , and rejoice in its flowers , its beauty , and its coolness . " But , " say the advocates of the present system , " it is good mental discipline . " I doubt it . It is mere waste of time . When a boy has learned that in the genitive plural of the first declension of Greek nouns the final syllable is circumfiexed , but to this there are the following exceptions : m . That feminine adjectives and participles in - or , - , * , are accented like the genitive masculine , but other feminine adjectives and participles are perispomena in the genitive plural ; 2 . That the substantives cli restes , aj5kue , etesial , and chiounes in the genitive plural remain paroxytones , ( Kiihner 's Elementary Greek Grammar , page 22 , ) - I say , when a boy has learned this and twenty other things just like it , his mind has not been one whit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old thirteen States , the number and names of the newly adopted ones , the times of their adoption , and the population , commerce , mineral and agricultural wealth of each . These , too , are merely exercises of memory , but they are exercises in what is of some interest and some use . The particulars above cited are of so little use in understanding the Greek classics that I will venture to say that there are intelligent English scholars , who have never read anything but Bohn 's translations , who have more genuine knowledge of the spirit of the Greek mind , and the peculiar idioms of the language , and more enthusiasm for it , than many a poor fellow who has stumbled blindly through the originals with the bayonet of the tutor at his heels , and his eyes and ears full of the Scotch snuff of the Greek Grammar . What then ? Shall we not learn these ancient tongues ? By all means . " So many times as I learn a langua6e , so many times I become a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Latin 1865. 739 // and Greek are foully belied by the prejudices created by this technical , pedantic mode of teaching them , which makes one ragged , prickly bundle of all the dry facts of the language , and insists upon it that the boy shall not see one glimpse of its beauty , glory , or interest , till he has swallowed and digested the whole mass . Many die in this wilderness with their shoes worn out before reaching the Promised Land of Plato and the Tragedians . " But , " say our college authorities , " look at England . An English schoolboy learns three times the Latin and Greek that our boys learn , and has them well drubbed in . " And English boys have three times more beef and pudding in their constitution than American boys have , and three times less of nerves . The difference of nature must be considered here and the constant influence flowing from English schools and universities must be tempered by considering who we are , what sort of boys we have to deal with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs of our growing American society . The demands of actual life , the living , visible facts of practical science , in so large and new a country as ours , require that the ideas of the ancients should be given us in the shortest and most economical way possible , and that scholastic technicalities should be reserved to those whom Nature made with especial reference to their preservation . On no subject is there more intolerant judgment , and more suffering from such intolerance , than on the much mooted one of the education of children . Treatises on education require altogether too much of parents* and impose burdens of responsibility on tender spirits which crush the life and strength out of them . Parents have been talked to as if each child came to them a soft , pulpy mass , which they were to pinch and pull and pat and stroke into shape quite at their leisure ,  --  and a good pattern being placed before them , they were to proceed immediately to set up and construct a good human being in conformity therewith . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible should have entertained this idea , overlooking the constant and affecting declaration of the great Heavenly Father that Ale has nourished and brought up children and they have rebelled against Him , together with His constant appeals , - " What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done in it ? Wherefore , when I looked that it should bring forth grapes , brought it forth wild grapes ? " If even God , wiser , better , purer , more loving , admits Himself baffled in this great work , is it expedient to say to human beings that the forming power , the deciding force , of a child 's character is in their hands ? Many a poor feeble woman 's health has been strained to breaking , and her life darkened , by the laying on her shoulders of a burden of responsibility that never ought to have been placed there ; and many a mother has been hindered from using such powers as God has given her , because some preconceived mode of operation has been set up before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could wear the armor of SauL A gentle , loving , fl-agile creature marries a strong-xvilled , energetic man , and by the laws of natural descent has a boy given to her of twice her amount of will and energy . She is just as helpless , in the mere struggle of will and authority with such a child , as she would be in a physical wrestle with a six-foot man . What then ? Has Nature left her helpless for her duties ? Not if she understands her nature , and acts in the line of it . She has no power of command , but she has power of persuasion . She can neither bend nor break the boy 's iron will , but she can melt it . She has tact to avoid the conflict in which she would be worsted . She can charm , amuse , please , and make willing ; and her fine and subtile influences , weaving themselves about him day after day , become more and more power-740 // ful. , Let her alone , and she will have her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileged expounder says to her , - " My dear , it s your solemn duty to break that boy 's will . I broke my boy 's will short off . Keep your whip in sight , meet him at every turn , fight him whenever he crosses you , never let him get one victory , and finally his will will be wholly subdued . " Such advice is mischievous , because what it proposes is as utter an impossibility to the woman 's nature as for a cow to scratch up worms for her calf , or a hen to suckle her chickens . There are men and women of strong , resolute will who are gifted with the power of governing the wills of others . Such persons can govern in this way ,  - -  and their government , being in the line of their nature , acting strongly , consistently , naturally , makes everything move harmoniously . Let them be content with their own success , but let them not set up as general education-doctors , or apply their experience to all possible cases ! Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loveliest and purest natures , who have no power of command . They have sufficient tenacity of will as respects their own course , but have no compulsory power over the wills of others . Many such women have been most successful mothers , when they followed the line of their own natures , and did not undertake what they never could do . Influence is a slower acting force than authority . It seems weaker , but in the long run it often effects more . It always does better than mere force and authority without its gentle modifying power . If a mother is high - principled , religious , affectionate , if she never uses craft or deception , if she governs her temper and sets a good example , let her hold on in good hope , though she can not produce the discipline of a manof-war in her noisy little flock , or make all move as smoothly as some other women to whom God has given another and different talent ; and let her not be discouraged , if she seem often to accomplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherein the great Creator of the world has declared Himself at times baffled . Family tolerance must take great account of the stages and periods of development and growth in children . The passage of a human being from one stage of development to another , like the sun 's passage across the equator , frequently has its storms and tempests . The change to manhood and womanhood often involves brain , nerves , body , and soul in confusion ; the child sometimes seems lost to himself and his parents , - his very nature changing . In this sensitive state come restless desires , unreasonable longings , unsettled purposes ; and the fatal habit of indulgence in deadly stimulants , ruining all the life , often springs from the cravings of this transition period . Here must come in the patience of the saints . The restlessness must be soothed , the family hearth must be tolerant enough to keep there the boy , whom Satan will receive and cherish , if his mother does not . The male element sometimes pours into a boy , like the tides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is noisy , vociferous , uproarious , and seems bent only on disturbance ; he despises conventionalities , he hates parlors , he longs for the woods , the sea , the converse of rough men , and kicks at constraint of all kinds . Have patience now , let love have its perfect work , and in a year or two , if no deadly physical habits set in , a quiet , well-mannered gentleman will be evolved . Meanwhile , if he does not wipe his shoes , and if he will fling his hat upon the , floor , and tear his clothes , and bang and hammer and shout , and cause general confusion in his belongings , do not despair ; if you only get your son , the hat and clothes and shoes and noise and confusion do not matter . Any amount of toleration that keeps a boy contented at home is treasure well expended at this time of life . 1865.1 74 ' // One thing not enough reflected on is , that in this transition period between childhood and maturity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boy is fitting for the university , the girl going through the studies of the college senior year , and the brain-power , which is working almost to the breaking-point to perfect the physical change , has the additional labor of all the drill and discipline of school . The girl is growing into a tall and shapely woman , and the poor brain is put to it to find enough phosphate of lime , carbon , and other what not , to build her fair edifice . The hills flow in upon her thick and fast ; she pays out hand over hand : if she had only her woman to build , she might get along , but now come in demands for algebra , geometry , music , language , and the poor brain-bank stops payment ; some part of the work is shabbily done , and a crooked spine or weakened lungs are the result . Boarding-schools , both for boys and girls , are for the most part composed of young people in this most delicate , critical portion of their physical , mental , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them through one straight , severe course of drill , without the slightest allowance for the great physical facts of their being . No wonder they are difficult to manage , and that so many of them drop , physically , mentally , and morally halt and maimed . It is not the teacher 's fault ; he but fulfils the parent 's requisition , which dooms his child without appeal to a certain course , simply because others have gone throughit . Finally , as my . sermon is too long already , let me end with a single reflection . Every human being has some handle by which he may he lifted , some groove in which he was meant to run ; and the great work of life , as far as our relations with each other are concerned , is to lift each one by his own proper handle , and run each one in his own proper groove .
