ART . II . - Does the Bible sanction American Slavery ? By GOLDWIN S*iim . Cambridge : Sever and Francis . 1863 . Is African slavery , as it exists in our Sonthern States , an evil or a good thing ? Is it , or is it not , consistent with a high sense of duty to man and to God , and with the requirements of that state of Christian civilization which the foremost nations of the world have now reached ? So far as the practice of those nations and the opinion of the best and wisest men of Christendom are authority to decide this question , it is decided . There is not a slave in modern Europe . Even Russia , semibarbarous as yet , has recently abolished serfdom , a very different thing from Africaii slavery , becanse the serf had rights , and the relation between him and his master was the relation of man to man , not of man to merchandise . England , France , and Denmark have abolished slavery in their colonies .

So also the government of the United States has not merely tolerated , but maintained and protected slavery . And why ? Because it had no control over the subject . The several States had this control ; and those of them most advanced in wealth and liberal cnlture have prohibited slavery within their limits . The power of the cental government might be exercised to prevent the extension of slavery . This , and the growth of Northern sentiment averse to the institution , caused the present war . It is needhess to cite eminent names . The list wonld include nearly all the great thinkers - philosophers , historians , and poets - who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the l ) resent time , and it would include the founders of our own government , and most of its distinguished statesmen , many of them slavehiolders . Authority , therefore , that is // to say , human authority , is all on one side . Until recently , indeed , the abstract moral question was almost universally regarded as settled . Slavery is an evil and a wrong . Few were bold enough to deny this . The only question was , Can it be got rid of , without causing greater evils and wrongs than its own ? Abstract truth , more especially moral truth , finds easy entrance into the mind and conscience . But concrete truth , truth manifested in fact and action , when great interests are connected with error and wrong , is sure to be resisted . Pure thought , too , as it passes into conduct , loses something of its purity and beauty , and becomes often soiled by the dross of human passion and selfishness . Liberty , equality , and fraternity were favorite and fashionable themes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the age that preceded the Revolution . But when they took the form of a demand for a republic , instead of monarchy and aristocracy , they suddenly lost their charm for these enlightened classes . When they afterwards assumed the form of Robespierre and the guillotine and a mob frenzied with license and howling for blood , their very names became odious to the old world . So , a few years ago , it was very easy and very common for Southern slaveholders to admit , that to treat human beings as peoperty is wrong , and that slavery is injurious to the best interests of society , when these propositions were coupled with another , - thatit is for the slave-owners to say when and how slavery is to be altered or destroyed . But the truth wore a different aspect when a powerful party in the country demanded that the area of slavery should be restricted , and afterwards , as is now the case , that slavery itself should be abolished . Truth then became concrete , and instantly the pride of power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must also be said , that , when the pure and noble idea of liberty appeared , as it did among a small portion of this Northern party , in the guise of reckless abolition , heedless of consequences , and of a willinguess , if not a desire and purpose , to light the flames of servile war in the South , freedom for the negro , like the liberty and equality of French Jacobins , unfortunately ceased to be a beautiful thing in the eyes of many even thoughtful // men . Freedom , to be a blessing , must bless both parties , him who gives and him who receives . If it can not do this , it is not freedom , but a mere transfer of power from one portion of society to another . Bat this world is governed by a good God and by moral laws ; and moral truth , whatever abuses may be for a time connected with it , must in the end triumph . Slavery , as established in the Southern States , is wrong , and injurious* because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - to religion , to enorals , to science , to literature , to the arts , to industry , - for these can flourish only under the right , under the rule of justice and truth . This is the rock on which the argument against slavery is built , and so long as the foundation remains , the edifice can not be overthrown . The Southern people discovered this , and , as soon as slavery was seriously menaced , they abandoned the faith of their ancestors , and boldly announced to the world , that slavery is founded in truth and justice , that it is the basis of liberty and civilization , and a blessing wherever it exists . As they could not cite in support of these dogmas the opinion of the age , the practice of the most enlightened nations , or the writings of the wise and good here or elsewhere , they went at once to the fountain-head of spiritual truth and moral law , and boldly claimed for the institution the sanction of the Bible . Slavery , they said , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ was silent on the subject , and it was recognized and impliedly approved by St. Paul . If all this be true , those who accept the Bible as their rule of conduct must bow to its authority . But before yielding to a conclusion which justifies oppression and condemns all that has been done to emancipate the negroes , it is well to inquire what sort of slavery was established by the Old Testament and recognized by the New , in what respects it differs from African slavery in the South , and whether any obligation is imposed upon us to perpetuate the latter . The storm of war that is sweeping over our country has excited discussion on many questions vital to the interests of the people . This discussion is one of its compensations . Our whole system of government is on trial , investigation is compelled by the emergency of danger , new views are suggested , // weak points may be discovered , and in the collision of free thought , stimulated by great events and the jeopardy of great interests , old errors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be destroyed , as decayed trees of the forest are prostrated by a tempest , to make room for a new growth . Slavery , as the cause of the war , has received especial attention . Its Southern friends are indeed silent for a time , being fully occupied in defending it on bloody battle-fields . But it has advocates in our Northern States and in Europe ; for the slave power had grown to such bulk , that it had become the basis of a political party in the North and of vast commercial interests in France and England . The argument drawn from the asserted sanction of the Bible has been revived , and the discussion which has ensued has had the good effect of enlarging our knowledge and vindicating the truth . Among the publications induced by this controversy , the best we have seen is a little volume written in England , the title of which we have placed at the head of this article . As it is the production of a foreigner , it is likely to have the greater influence , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author . Mr. Goldwin Smith is Professor of History at Oxford , and has a distinguished reputation , at home and abroad , of which this work is not unworthy . It is marked by clearness of thought and statement , extensive learning , liberal views , an elevated tone of thought befitting the topic , the earnestness of conviction , and a simple , grave , and forcible style . Critical and historical knowledge is necessary to understand many parts of the Bible , and this sort of knowledge is by no means universal , even among the educated . Most men , indeed , who condemn slavery , feel sure that it can not be sanctioned by the Holy Scriptures , because it is opposed to the spirit and teachings both of the Old and the New Testament . Many are , however , not convinced , but puzzled , by the texts cited by the advocates of slavery . It is important , therefor* , to show that the slavery of the South is not the slavery of the Bible ; and this has been done by Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political and personal . The former consists in a share of political power . To gain it , to keep it , and to exercise it for the good of society , implies a // degree of intelligence never possessed by a barbarous people , and by certain classes only of the more civilized . As nations advance in wealth and knowledge , this intelligence is more largely diffused . Intelligence means the power to think , and thinking produces the desire for action . As soon , therefore , as any portion of the people emerges from ignorance and poverty , public affairs become the objects of its intelligent curiosity and thought , and it demands the right to influence the action of government . When the masses of the people , or a portion of it , sufficient to represent the great interests of the nation , possess this right , such a people is said to possess political liberty . But those to whom this privilege is not extended are governed entirely by the will of those who possess it , or of one man , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power over the conduct of government , is enjoyed now , as always , by a very small proportion of mankind . Free government belongs only to the most enlightened nations , to the most highly organized races . They only have been able , after a long and painful progress , to appreciate and desire it , to win and keep it . To be governed by the few , in all public affairs , is and always has been the lot of the vast majority of men . PQrsonal liberty is the power which a man has over himself , over his own actions and destiny , so far as these are not controlled by general laws affecting the whole community . *lntelligence , combined with moral force , - what is called ability , - is the condition on which this sort of liberty can be enjoyed ; for power is the inseparable attribute of ability , and loss of power of the want of it . Personal liberty is thus , like political liberty , the boon of advancing civilization , because civilization , by increasing the objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the early stages of society , bodily strength and courage conferred power , because man was engaged in a struggle for subsistence with the untamed forces of nature and with fellow-men as savage as himself . The weak , therefore , sought the protection of the strong , because depbndent upon , or the servants of , the strong . When communities were formbd into nations , laws and policy were required , and demanded a new sort of ability , and intellect was enfranchised from the dominion * force . The security afforded by national // power and law developed industry and the arts . These enabled multitudes to takQ care of themselves , who were before dependent on individuals for protection . For the power of the individual was substituted the power of government , representing society , and men became personally free , masters of themselves , and governed , not by individual will , but by law , which , whether made by themselves or not , was the law Such has been thb progress of society from the family to the tribe , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts of war to the arts of peace . During the whole of this progress , force of mind and force of character have always conferred power . The weak have ever been the servants of the strong , under the name of slaves , serfs , or vassals , because dependent on the strong ; and servitude is another name for dependence . Not until society became stronger than any indi vidual could men become free . And their freedom consisted in this , that , in return for protection , they gave service , duty , fealty , and obedience , not to a master or lord , for his own benefit , but to a king , magistrate , or ruling class ; in short , to government , for the benefit of all , because it represents all . Servitude , therefore , or the subjection of man to man , does not contradict the laws of nature . It represents the relation of weakness to strength . It has existed in all ages , and in all nations at some period of their growth . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class unfit to enjoy personal liberty , or the want of power in government to protect the rights of individuals ; for personal liberty is a right , for those who can use it without injury to themselves or others . In the former case , personal liberty may be denied or restricted U by law , and according to the necessity for that law , its humanity and justice , will the government that makes it be judged . It must not be a selfish law , intended exclusively for the benefit of the governing party , for power is eternally coupled with duty and responsibility . The ability to do good implies the obligation to do good , and he who has control over the happiness of another is a tyrant amid a criminal , if in exercising that control he seeks only his own interest . The laws of tIme most enlightened nations give power to husbands over wives , to parents over children , to masters over apprentices . But // the power is intended for the benefit of both parties , and it is therefore carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are plain and simple principles , which , though often violated by human selfishness and passion , have always been vinqicated and established more firmly by the consequences of such violation . No philosopher or moralist , whose name has become eminent , and held its place through the centuries as a spiritual guide and teacher , has ever advocated selfishness as a virtue , or denied the doctrine that all power , whether of an individual or of government , is trust-power , to be exercised for the well-being of both the governin.g and the governed party ; that a king ought to be the father of his people ; that a ruling class ought to rule for the benefit of all classes ; that the lord is bound to his vassal in mutual and reciprocal obligation , the master to his servant . But the world has never been governed by philosophers , and history is a terrible record of disobedience to these precepts by those who have governed it , whether one or many , princes or parliaments , lords or masters . It is a record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime . An unjust and oppressive goverrnhent can not prosper , can not endure . Sooner or later it is destroyed by the moral force of mankind , either from within or from without , by a domestic or a foreign power . We have in this country four millions of negroes . They are of a race inferior to ours . They gre , therefore , it is said , unfit to enjoy political liberty , or to exercise power over government . If this be so , they are rightfully deprived of that power , both for their own good and ours , and we of the superior race may govern them politically for the good of both . We are told , also , that they are unfit to enjoy personal liberty , to exercise power individually over themselves , to be governed each by his own will under the law . Is this true ? Let us grant it . What , then , is the duty of the superior race which has power over the negro ? Does not the possession of this power , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trustee for the negro ? What is meant when it is said that the negro is unfit for personal liberty ? Is it not that he is unable to take care of himself , - that he // requires a care-taker , a guide , a support , as a child does ? Are not those , therefore ; who have power over him , who claim and take that power , bound to furnish the guardianship lie needs , for his benefit , and , since his conduct and condition affect their interests , for their own also ? How have we of the white race performed this duty ? This question is answered by the Constitution of the United States , which permitted the slave-trade for twenty years , and slavery forever , slaves being regarded by both as articles of merchandise , existing wholly for the benefit of their owners . It is answered by the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Dred Scott , in which the Chief Justice declares , that the public opinion of the civilized world at the time the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which is therefore binding on us , regarded negroes " as beings of an inferior order , and altogether unfit to associate with the white race , either in social or political relations ; and so far inferior , that they had no rights which a white man was bound to respect , and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced , to slavery for his " ( the white man 's ) " benefit . He was bohght and sold , and treated as an article of merchandise and traffic , , whenever a profit could be made by it . " Mr. Justice Daniel , in the same case , declares that a slave , under our law , " is strictly property , to be used in subserviency to the interests , the convenience , or the will of his owner . " The question is also answered by the laws of the Southern States , all of which proclaim that a slave is in all respects a. chattel personal , and by the opinion of Judge Ruffin of North Carolina , quoted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The question before the court has been assimilated at the bar to the other domestic relations , and arguments drawn from the well-established principles which confer and restrain the authority of the parent over the child , the tutor over the pupil , the master over the apprentice , have been pressed upon us . The court does not recognize their application . There is no likeness between the cases . They are in opposition to each other , and there is an impassable gulf between them . The difference is that which exists between freedom and slavery , and a greater can not be imagined . In the one , the end in view is the happiness of the // youth , born to equal rights with that governor on whom the duty . devolves of training the young to usefulness in a station which lie is afterwards to assume among freemen . To such an end , and with such a subject , moral and intellectual instruction seem the natural means . Moderate force is superadded only to make the others effectual . If that fail , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passions and the ultimate correction of the law , than allow it to be immoderately inflicted by a private person . With slavery it is far otherwise . The end is the profit of the master , his security , and the public safety ; the su1*ject , one doomed in his own person and his posterity to live without knowledge , without the capacity to make anything his own , and to toil that another may reap the fruits . " To the same effect is the decision of Judge Field of Virginia , in 1851 , in the case of Souther vs. the Commonwealth , 7 Grattan , 673 : " It is the policy of the law , in respect to the relation of master and slave , and for the sake of securing proper obedience on the part of the slave , to protect the master from prosecution , even if the whipping and punishment be malicious , cruel , and excessive . " These principles deny the obligation of the superior race to regard the happiness or improvement of the inferior , whilst they assert absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank as a man , and convert him into a thing ; they expose him without protection to the irresponsible control of his owner , and to the operations of two passions that have ever been the scourges of humanity , - the lust of money and the lust of power . He is denied every right of humanity , - liberty , personal security , mental improvement , moral elevation , property , wife , and child . He can acquire nothing by his labor , he can hold no relations to his fellow-men , he can make no contracts . So far as it can , the law reduces him from the position of a man to that of a brute . And why is this done ? Because those who make the law have the power to do it . Though four millions strong , the negro has not force of mind and will or fitting opportunity to resist them . His weakness , his capacity for moral and intellectual improvement , for enjoying a higher destiny , for domestic happiness and affection , appeal in vain to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // because it is stronger devotes him and all his hopes and all his future to itself , as an instrument , and a possession . The gigantic selfishness of this system is less surprising than the bold and shameless avowal of it here , in republican America , and in the high noon of the nineteenth century . Servitude , or the dependence and consequent subordination of the weak to the strong , of the ignorant to the intelligent , of the poor to the rich , in some form , has existed in all ages , and must exist , so long as superior ability of mind and body creates disparity of condition and social inequality . The character of that servitude must necessarily vary with the progress of a people in civilization . The modern European laborer is the successor of the feudal serf , as the latter was of the Gothic slave before the Northern hordes overturned the Roman empire , and crystallized into nations . One characteristic of Christian civilization has been , that the law , representing advancing society , has more and more interfered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the powerful , to extend the sphere both of personal and political liberty , to give man more and more to himself , and to yield government constantly to the influence of larger numbers of the people . The violation of the truth of nature , as well as of justice and humanity , by the degradation of man to the condition of a chattel , has been the work of nations either pagan or barbarous , except in the case of modern African slavery . The Egyptians , the Hindoos , the Persians , the Greeks , and the Romans held men as chattels , at every period of their history , from the rudest to the most refined . They made no distinction of race , but enslaved and made property ' of all alike , whenever they had the power . The slave-trade , domestic and foreign , flourished among them and their laws were identical in spirit , frequently in positive provisions , with those of our Southern States . To this universal law and practice among ancient nations , the laws of Moses and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law and government resolve themselves into custom , and are thus products and outward manifestations of the mental , moral , and material condition of a people . Laws change with that condition , and therefore change slowly . A new law is made to satisfy a new want caused by the gradual growth // or an alteration in the circumstances of a nation . Slow progress is , therefore , the general rule of society , sudden moral changes the exception , if indeed they ever occur . Even after a conquest , however complete , the conquered retain , of necessity , their laws , that is to say , their customs or habits of living , because these can not be changed by the will of the conqueror . All institutions , therefore , represent the character of a people , as a crop shows the nature of the soil . As soon as we understand the condition of a people , we can understand their laws and government . To change these , we must change their nature . Reforms , therefore , which anticipate the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Men of genius , of extended views , of spiritual insight , prophets and inspired teachers , are always before their age . Such were Socrates , Plato , and Bacon , - such , in a far higher , the highest sense , was Christ . The world has not yet been able to catch up with them . Only a select few . sit at their feet and understand their oracles . This universal law of progress , of custom , as the necessary foundation of all institutions , explains history . It explains slavery . It shows its origin , its growth , the part it played , the good and the evil it did , how slaves came to be regarded as property by some , why they were ranked as men by others , how theycame to be emancipated , and why they are still held as property by the barbarous tribes of Africa , by the Turks , by the Spaniards in the West Indies and the Portuguese in Brazil , and by our own Southern States . Recent historical researches prove that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the varied forms of society ; that , as Mr. Smith says , " the political systems which now fill the world , with all their grandeur and complexity , once lay enfolded in thJ patriarch 's tent . So that in the patriarchal chief of an Arabian tribe we still see the father of empires and republics . " The head of the family , as the only government , had absolute power . As the members of a family increased , differences of mental and bodily force would create subordination ; some would command and others obey ; to some the inferior tasks of life would be assigned , and these would become servants . As the collateral branches of a family multiplied , these , drawn together by affinity of blood , united and // formed a tribe under one chief . The protection of the tribe and its chief was essential to all , more especially to women . It was the interest of every one , therefore , to become a member of a family and of a tribe , wh*ether he had or had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The price of protection was dependence , obedience , . servitude . The power of the chief was necessarily despotic . I* extended over the life and liherty of wife and child , as well as of the servant . In a rude- age , it was exercised with rigor . Thence arose ancient slavery . Thence also polygamy and concubinage , in the warm climates and among the races of the East , where all three exist at the present day . As population increased , conflicting interests would necessarily cause disputes , and these war , which seems a part of our nature in all conditions of society , savage or civilized . Among a barbarous people , war was barbarous . The humane usages of modern times have been the slow growth of civilization . The . practice of the earliest times was to slay all enemies , probably because , when contending tribes were weak , this was the only security from renewed attack . To make captives of those who suriendered implied force enough to hold them as captives. * This was a step forward in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , according to established custom , to the lives of the captives , he had also a right to their services . Service was the price of life , as to the poor and weak of the tribe it was of protection . An order of servants inferior to the latter was thus introduced into the tribe because they were aliens , and had been enemies . These servants were distributed among the distinguished warriors of the tribe as part of the spoil , as laborers , as boudmen , as handmaidens . They were valuable as instruments of wealth and ministers of pleasure . Thence arose the idea of property . Property is something useful which can be appropriated by an individual . Captives in war were useful . Over them there was absolute power , which was unNestrained by any sympathies or feelings of the family or the tribe , and beyond these , at that time , men 's sympathies did not reach . Captives therefore were naturally , at this rude period , regarded as property , and as a consequence the subjects of barter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the East , vestiges of which still remain . We must not , however , confound the slavery of these primitive ages with the great slave commerce of modern times , or with the gangs of slaves afterwards collected on Roman estates , and now on Southern plantations . If slavery partook of the rudeness of this dawn of humanit , it partook also of its simplicity , its equality , its kindliness . Slavery had then a mission to perform . It softened the ferocity of war . It was a boon to the captives , who thereby escaped death . These were introduced into the tribe , increased its power , and thus led to the formation of a nation . As they who had lately been enemies could scarcely be trusted as soldiers , they became laborers , and thus industry was varied and extended , and out of industry grows wealth , commerce , and the arts . Captors and captives were moreover often of the same race . There was no marked disparity between them of culture or condition , where all were ignorant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore made their impression , inspired respect , confidence , admiration , and love . Marriages , and connections which were considered almost equivalent to marriages , were formed between master and servant , and these introduced *ll the varied relations of life , with their kindly humanizing influences . The relation of master and slave , therefore , was altogether a human relation , even when slaves were regarded as property in the early ages . They were domestic servants , members of the family and the household ; and if sold , sold as such . They were not owned in vast numbers , or bred for sale , or bought in droves from dealers , or worked by overseers , or made the instruments of a great commerce . The human element predominated over the mercenary . The Homeric poems and the Old Testament are almost the only records that we possess of this antique life . Patriarchal bondage among the Hebrews is thus described : " And Abraham was old and well stricken in age ; and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ruled over all that he had , Put , I pray thee , thy hand under my thigh , and I will make thee swear by the Lord , the God of Heaven and the God of // earth , that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites , among whom I dwell ; but thou shalt go unto my country , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son Isaac . ' . . . . And the servant took ten camels , of the camels of his master , and departed ; for all the goods of his master were in his hand ; and he arose , and went to Mesopotamia , unto the city of Nahor . And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water , at the time of evening , even the time that women go out to draw water . And he said , 0 Lord God of my *master Abraham , I pray thee , send me good speed this day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stand here by the well of water ; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water ; and let it come to pass , that the damsel to whom I shall say , Let down thy pitcher , I pray thee , that I may drink ; and she shall say , Drink , and I will give thy camels drink also ; let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac ; and thereby shall I know that thou hast showed kindness unto my master . ' " And so it came to pass , and this picture has remained graven on the world 's memory ever since , because it is morally beautiful , because it is a picture of simple manners , of fideliity , mutual trust , and love . It bears no resemblance to the accounts we have of Athenian and Roman slaves , manacled , scourged , tortured , and nailed on crosses by their masters , of the porter chained to the door of Roman houses , or to Cato 's advice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with old oxen and horses and worn-out tools of husbandry . Neither does it bear any resemblance to the teachings of the Bred Scott case , or to the decisions of Judge Rufflui and Judge Field quoted above , or to the descriptions of plaiitation life in ther South given to us by Mrs. Kemble and Mr. Olmsted . Evidently the relation of master and servant was a uman relation , not that of man to property . It was , as Mr. Smith says , " a relation of perfect affection and confidence , of complete identity of interest . " Of a similar character are Homer 's pictures of the heroic age of Greece . The slaves were domestic servants , and the captives taken in war were not regarded as merchandise , but // members of the family . Penelope plies the spindle with her maidens ; Nausicaa , a king 's daughter , goes with her female servants to wash clothes in a brook ; Ulysses , on his return , finds in his slave Eum*us a faithful steward and friend . The slave-auction , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and of husband and wife , are nowhere described in these old books as among the customs of the age . There is , however , an important difference to be noted between the scenes painted by Homer and those in the Old Testament . In the latter there is no trace of cruelty or the oppressive exercise of authority . A spirit of justice and humanity , and a deep religious sentiment , pervade the narrative , as they do all of the sacred books . The Homeric poems are filled with violence and lust , both of men and gods . The gods are deified men , moved by human passions , and , under the influence of these , taking part in human affairs . Adultery was the cause of the Trojan war . The wrath of Achilles was roused by the refusal to give him a female captive , " blooming Briseis , " whom lie claimed as the spoil of war . Ulysses massacres the handmaidens of Penelope . Strength , valor , and subtlety are the qualities prized , martial glory is the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of angry passions is the characteristic of the hero . We look in vain for spiritual truth , for the perception of the infinite , for religious reverence , and for the maxims of justice and humanity with which the writings of the poets and prophets of the Old Testament are filled , and which , have made it ever since an exhaustless mine of thought and wisdom , the teacher and guide of the foremost nations of the world . In pathos , in sublimity , in richness of imagery and simple grace , the Hebrew surpass the Grecian poets . These last are gradually receding into the dimness of the past , but the books of Ruth and of Job , Eccle*iastes , the Psalms , the prophecies , and the grand and noble annals of Israel , will be preserved forever , as they have been for so many ages , in the minds and hearts of men . *I'he word unto the prophets spoken Is writ on tables yet unbroken . The heedless world has never lost One accent of the Holy Ghost . " // 63 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Grecian intellect , so brilliant and profound in philoso*y , poetry , and art , - in all these the instructor of the world . The reason is , that the gods of Greece were no gods at all , and there was nothing in the attributes ascribed to them which could elevate the soul or soften the heart , nothing which could develop and nourish the sentiment of duty to man as man , and enlarge the range of sympathy beyond the limits of self . The God of Abraham was the true God , one , invisible , the Lord of heaven and earth , uncreated , the Creator of all things , inscrutable , the supreme Ruler , omnipotent in power , perfect in goodness and wisdom . One great intellect among the Greeks rose to this sublime conception , but the philosophy of Plato was not the popular faith , and he lived after Paganism had done its work . The God of Abraham was emphatically the God of the people ; his name was ever on their lips , his power and commands ever present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength , their stay , their shelter , their defence , amid surrounding idolaters their enemies and his . It is impossible that men should recognize the existence and the presence of such a mighty and inscrutable being , their master and judge , should feel that his eye is ever upon them , without a sense of reverence and awe , without a desire to worship and obey . Now Israel was taught that man was made in the express image of his Creator . Not that he resembled the Deity in outward lineaments , but because , as the record says , though formed of the dust of the ground , when God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life , man " became a living soul . " A soul . Able , therefore , to perceive divine truth , and to know God as the finite can know the infinite . If to know him , then to reverence , to fear , to love him , for all these emotions necessarily arise from a knowledge of his attributes . If his creatures , then men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his justice , his mercy , and his punishment . To the wondrous being thus created God gave " dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air , and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth . " Ox-pr every thing . God alone was the Lord of man , and by God 's law , the law of justice and love , // was he to be governed . " Fear *1od and keep his commandments , " said the great preacher of Israel , " for this is the w*le duty of man . For God shall bring every work into judgment1 with every secret thing , whether it be good or whether it be evil . " From this inspiring faith may be deduced the sublimity , the spirituality , and the noble sense of justice and humanity , which pervade the poetry , the philosophy , and the laws of the Hebrews , and from the belief that they were God 's chosen and peculiar people sprang their narrowness and exclusiveness . When they . departed from this faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suffering ; whilst they kept it , they were victorious and happy . Out of it arose the brighter light , the wider scope , the higher law , the softer and more tender sentiment of Christianity . As the nations have accepted or refused this later dispensation , as they have kept it " in spirit and in truth , " or departed from it , they too have grown to the power and blessing of civilization , or , remaining in or lapsing into idolatry and debasement , have decayed in all the elements of prosperity and progress . The Hebrew faith explains the Hebrew law in all its provisions , but especially as it related to slavery . It explains why it was that one of the Hebrew race was never in any real sense a slave , but in his position much like a modern apprentice , as his term of service was limited unless he chose to extend it , and he was protected from the tyranny of his master . " If thou buy a Hebrew servant , six years shall he serve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing For they are my servants , which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt ; they shall not be sold as bondmen Over your brethren , the children of Israel , ye shall not . rule one over another with rigor And when thou sendest him out free from thee , thou shalt not let him go away empty ; thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock , and out of thy ' floor , and out of thy wine-press ; of that wherewith the Lord thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him . " Neither Greek nor Roman hesitated , as our author says , to reduce his countrymen " to that permanent bondage which // alone can be properly called slavery . In the early times both of Athens and Rome , we find numbers of the poor reduced to slavery by the rich . And in the wars between Gj*cian States , whole communities when vanquished are swept into hopeless and irredeemable bondage by the people of their own race . " Their gods could not protect them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of the chosen people . Idolaters were the enemies of his God . " A Hebrew was his brother , the foreigner was not his brother . " In the same spirit with which Christians afterwards , when Christians became also narrow and exclusive , regarded heretics and infidels , did he regard the heathen . Thence another class of servants and another law . " Both thy bondmen and thy boudmaids which thou shalt have , shall be of the heathen that are round about you ; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids . Moreover , of the children of the stranger that do sojourn among you , of them shall ye buy and of their families that are with you , which they begat in your land ; and they shall be your possession . What was the position of the Hebrew bondman of this class ? Did he become a mere chattel ? Did he lose his rank as a man , as a " living soul " ? Were the paths of moral and intellectual iftiprovement barred against him ? Had he no rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has answered these questions . We have not space to quote the details of his argument . He shows the humane spirit of the law , from its provisions in relation to the poor and to " strangers " ; that restraints were imposed on the authority of the master , not found in the codes of Greece and Rome or in those of pther pagan nations ; that the slave might be a witness ; that he was regarded as a member of the family of his master ; th4 the power of the master was not greater than that of the husband and father over wife and child ; that , if lie was bought , so often was a wife , and he , like her , was bought as a human being , invested with human rights , and to hold human relations to his master and to society . The crowning proof of this , however , is , that , among a people holding itself aloof from all others , and under a theocracy in // which religious ceremonials were numerous , strictly observed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bondm*n was adopted into the nation by the distinguishing rite of circumcision , and his presence enjoined at the most august festivals of the church . The Sabbath was to him also a day of rest ; he was a member of the congregation , and united with his master in worship of the God of Israel ; he partook with him at the feast of unleavened bread , the feast of weeks , the feast of tabernacles , and , more important than any , at the high solemnity of the Passover . " This is the ordinance of the Passover . There shall no stranger eat thereof ; but every man 's servant that is bought for money , when thou hast circumcised him , then he shall eat thereof . " The slave , therefore was not a thing ; he was a " living soul , " to whom were opened by the Law the fountains of eternal truth . We can only make a passing allusion to the remarks of our author , by which he proves that the Mosaic laws did not encourage even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , discouraged and at length almost extirpated it , by providing checks and hinderances to the four chief causes of slavery , - conquest , kidnapping or piracy , penal servitude , and debt ; and that the Hebrew nation was never marked by those characteristics which distinguish a slaveholding community , - slave-markets , runaways , insurrections , guards , dread , cruelty , the decay of industry , the impoverishment of the soil . These are the social features of our Southern States , as they were of pagan Greece and Rome . The nation of Moses was not a slave power . Nevertheless , the Mosaic law does recognize , ordain , and regulate slavery ; and not only slavery , but also polygamy , concubinage , the massacre of conquered enemies , the making captives of the inhabitants of cities taken by storm , the right of private revenge , and other customs shocking to the cultivated thought and sensitive moral feeling of civilization . Were these things then commanded by God ? Are they divine , and therefore binding on us ? The answer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they naturally belong to a certain reriod of the growth of society . No , they are not binding on us , they are no justification for us , the condi // tions of whose social state are different . The institutions we now possess will in time become unfit and pass away . But the principles on which they are founded , so far as they are true , will not pass away . They will survive to animate new forms ; for institutions are fleeting , and truth is eternal . " The one remains , the many change and pass ; Heaven 's light forever shines , earth 's shadows fly . " It is for us to use for worthy ends what we have , and constantly to aspire to something better . Moses did this . He found the Hebrews in the transition state 4between the tribe and the nation . Their institutions or customs were such as belong to that state . He improved them , he informed them with the spirit of divine justice and truth , he directed them to noble ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . He could do nothing else . He was the liberator , the lawgiver of a semi-barbarous people , the founder of their future nation . Had he attempted to abolish their customs by law , he would have failed , because , as already stated , all law is custom , and all changes must be gradual , for customs and institutions grow out of the mental and moral condition of the people , and therefore can not be altered wholly or suddenly by any external human power . Neither can they by divine power , without , as our author expresses it , taking men out of their own hands , which is not the rule of God 's dealings with men , and certainly was not the rule of his dealings with the Jews . To be free , men must be free to disobey his will , as the Jews were to their cost . Slow progress is the law of humanity . Why it is so , why evil is able to maintain its ground , why ignorance and sin have power to resist knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between truth and falsehood , has been fought so long , and is still fighting , are dark mysteries of our nature . We can only trust that , as part of the plan by which this world is governed , they form with the rest a symmetrical whole , working for ultimate good , founded on necessary laws , and not causing , even in the present , unmixed evil . Moses , therefore , in an age of barbarism , could not convert a barbarous people into a civilized , enlightened , and humane community , without a miracle that would have destroyed // their moral responsibility , and made of ' them , not men , but machines . He could not abolish polygamy , concubinage and slavery and despotism , cruelty to enemies in war , the right of asylum , and the " avenger of blood , " and introduce marriage and free labor , the trial by jury , the writ of habeas corpus , a free press , and popular representation , without anticipating the work of many centuries , and the slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would have been as useless to put a steam-engine or a printer 's press into the hands oft the Jews , as any of these institutions , the result of ages of effort and g*'adual change . What he could do , consistently with the laws of man 's nature , he did . He took the institutions and manners of the people as he found them , and infused into them the principles of ju.stice and humanity , of reverence for God and love for man . All laws , all human relations , may be thus elevated , purified , and softened , and thus the way be opened for better laws and nobler relations . Mr. Smith has shown , historically , " that the laws of Moses were not a new code , but a revision of the old customary law of the nation . " In what spirit and for what purpose this revision was made , what changes were introduced by which barbarous usages were ameliorated and turned to , good ends , our author has also forcibly and clearly exphained . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the book itself . We have thus , with the aid of Mr. Smith , endeavored te show that the slavery of the Old Testament was a very different thing from slavery in our Southern States . But we are not Jews , we are Christians ; and the advocates of the institution claim that Christ by his silence impliedly , and his Apostles by their writings expressly , recognized and sanctioned even the ferocious and terrible system of slavery of pagan Rome , in the most profligate and corrupt period of its history . It is not necessary to spend much time in refuting an assertion so monstrous , which , if true , or generally received as true , would roll back the wheels of time from civilization to barbarism , and , undo all that Christianity has done since its founder died for man on the cross . The preceding argument , by which the ameliorations introduced by the Mosaic law are deduced as a necessary consequence from the faith of Israel in the one , // invisible God , apply with greater force to the Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river is to the sea . The religion of the Jews was narrow and exclusive ; the mis*ion of Christ was to all . Moses was the lawgiver of the Hebrews ; the son of David was the Son of Man , - therefore . the brother of all men . He was also the Son of God , who , therefore , is the Universal Father . " The Hebrews , " says Mr. Smith , " had , like all other ancient nations , a national deity , whose name was Jehovah* The national deity of the Hebrews , unlike those of other nations , was God indeed . All his attributes were those of the true God , though but partially revealed , and his worship has consequently passed into the worship of the Universal Father , without break or incongruity , as the light of dawn brightens and broadens into the light of day . " Christ , therefore , did not come to destroy the law or the prophets . " I am not come to destroy , " he says , " but to fulfil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the Preacher of Israel , " for this is the whole duty of man . " " Thou shalt not avenge , nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people , " was the injunction of Moses , " but thou shalL love thy neighbor as thyself . " Christ took a higher and wider view both of worship and of love* " Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind . This is the first and great commandment . And the second is like unto it , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . " The neighbor in the Mosaic law was a Jew ; the neighbor in the law of Christ was every man . Is it possible to love your neigl*bor as yourself , and , at the same time , convert him into an instrument for your own selfish gain ? The law of Moses , because man was created by their Jehovah a " living soul , " gave to the servant bought of the heathen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the heathen did . Is it conceivable that Christ , who came to fulfil that law , to give to it a larger meaning , and to its spirit a wider applicatipn , intended , when he declared that God was the Father and all men his children , to make some of them property , as the Romans did , or to declare , with Chief Justice Taney , that any of them Were without rights which a Christian was bound to respect ? Moses was a lawgiver , and governed the conduct of men // from without . Christ was a messenger of divine truth , and governed them from within , by their convictions . Moses ruled over the masses by means of barbaro*is institutions , which ; as before explained , he could only modify , not change . Christ found barbarous institutions , and he undermined and finally destroyed them , by entering into the heart and conscience of the individual . The nation of Israel has long since passed away . The kingdom of Christ is a confederacy of the most powerful nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is founded , not upon institutions , but upon truth ; for institutions change and pass , but truth remains . Institutions are mere outside forms . T*iey are created by the informing spirit , as the shell of a lobster is shaped by the living and growing animal . When the spirit grows beyond the form , institutions are like the abandoned shell , like husks and chaff . Had Christ , by the exertion of supernatural power , suddenly changed the institutions of the Roman Empire , it would have availed nothing , unless he had also changed the Romans themselves . He could not thus have changed them , without destroying their free agency , their moral responsibility , all the merit and benefit of voluntary moral action , - without also violating the law of progress , which , as already said , is the law of humanity . Moreover , had he thus suddenly changed the social and political institutions of Rome , what would he have given them instead of despotism , chattel slavery , the shows of gladiators , and the wild beasts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , anticipating the centuries , produce the feudal monarchies of the Middle Ages , with vassalage and chivalry and the tournament , - or the English Constitution , or our own , - or some other form yet veiled by the curtain of the future ? Not in this way did he exercise miracukus power . To otherwise change suddenly the institutions of the Roman Empire was impossible . As a man , he was poor and obscure , and so were his followers . An attempt to excite a rebellion against the government , or a servile revolt , would have failed . Had it succeeded , the success would have been local and transient , unless founded on individual conviction of the // truth that liberates , as only the truth can . Therefore upon a truth - the truth of the universal fathership of God and the universal brotherhood of men - did Christ found his universal Church and hi* universal kingdom . Such is the power of the invisible idea . It enters into one mind ; it spreads by the contagion of sympathy ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governs action , and institutions are men 's ways of acting according to their thought . Therefore Christ 's kingdom was likened by him " to a grain of mustard-seed , which indeed is the least of all seeds , but , when it is grown , is the greatest among herbs , and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof " ; and " unto leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened . " He declared that his kingdom was not of this world . lit was a spiritual kingdom , which in the end commanded all , because it was spiritual . But the time for outward triumph had not come ; and so he said , " Render unto Ca*sar the things which are C*esar ' s , " - these were , submission to established government and obedience to the law , - " and unto God the things that are God 's , " - these are , love to him and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christian Emperor on the throne of the C*esars , agd , at a later period , a Christian pontiff on the throne of the Emperors . " The servant is not greater than his lord ; neither is he that is sent greater than he that sent him . " We find , therefore , in the precepts of the Apostles , the principles of Christ carried out . They did not become agitators or demagogues , nor seek , prematurely , to overturn established government by revolution . They found the Empire a despotism , and Tiberius , the most sensual , heartless , and cruel of the Emperors , on the throne . They found Jud*a a prey to tyrants as sensual and cruel , who were supported by the central despotism at Rome . They found chattel slavery firmly established as an " institution , " though not a " peculiar " one , as it was in keeping with the violence , oppression , and corruption around it . " Nevertheless , " to use the language of our author , " our Lord and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that evil world . Their attitude towards them all was that // of deep spiritual hostility and of entire political submission . The dominion of a foreign conqueror , the presence nf his soldiery , the extortions of his tax-gatherers , the injustice of his judges , the iniquitous privileges of th' conquering Roman , the iniquitous degradation of the conquered Jew , - all th*s* , as well as slavery , are accepted with unquestioning resignation . The things which are C*sar 's are rendered unto Ca*sar , though Caesar is a Tiberius or a Nero . To endure patiently the dominion of these monsters , it has been truly said , was the honor of Christianity and the dishonor of mankind . " The precepts of the Apostles , by which this submission to existing institutions is enjoined , have been cited recently in support of our Southern slavery , as they have been heretofore in support of political tyranny . But they can not be used except iii accordance with their meaning and purpose . When so used , they are of universal application . They inculcate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be premature and hopeless , for the order of a bad government is better than the anarchy of none . They exhort servants to obey their masters with fidelity , for obedience and fidelity mitigate all servitude , and may be the means of spiritual growth *nd elevation . Rebellion , to be justifiable , must promise , not merely success , but something better , to be established by success , than the system rebelled against . Neither of these conditions existed , at the time of the Apostles , in the Roman Empire . Their language does not imply approval of the evil institutions of their age , but , on the contrary , deep spiritual hostility and spiritual warfare against them and all forms of oppression , - the only warfare by which oppression , whew supported by worldly power , can be attacked and finally overthrown . The advice given to slaves , that they should obey their mas ters , is good advice to all servants , everywhere and at all times . It applies equally to the negro on Southern plantations and to the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laborers , to all whose lot it is to serve and obey ; and if observed , it would promote the happiness of Southern plantations , and of Northern farms , factories , and . firesides . And why ? Because obedience and fidelity are the duties of all // servants , high or low . Duties not to the master only , but to God also , who has appointed them to that station . " A servant with this clause Makes drudgery divine ; Who sweeps a room , as for Thy laws , Makes that and the action fine . " In this spiril ; is the exhortation of St. Paul : " Servants , obey in all things your masters according to the flesh ; not with eye-service , as men-pleasers , but in singleness of heart , fearing God . And whatsoever ye do , do it heartily , as to the Lord , and not unto men . Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance , for ye serve the Lord Christ . " Did St. Paul regard those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as beings rightfully doomed , according to Southern law , as announcd by Judge Taney and Judge Ruffin , " to live without knowledge , " and the end of whose existence is " the profit of the master " ? iflut if a servant has duties , so also has the master . " Masters , " continues the Apostle , " give unto your servants that which is just and equal ; knowing that ye too have a Master in heaven , " - " neither is there respect of persons with him . " ( Coloss. iii . and iv. ; Eph. vi . ) Now , what sort of equality is here meant ? Not surely that which is inconsistent with the human relation of master to servant ; but as surely an equality which is inconsistent with the relation of man to property , - one , too , that is inconsistent with any system of slavery or servih , ide which authorizes or permits injustice or oppression , and which regards exclusively the interest of the master . In these words is declared the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God , as members of the brotherhood of Christ . Far different is the law of Virginia , according to the decision of Judge Field , quoted above , which sanctions any degree of punishment by the master , even though it be " malicious , cruel , and excessive . " The words of St. Paul are a proof of his " deep spiritual hostility " to the slavery of Rome , which accompanied his " political submission " to that system . These simple words *truck slavery in its vital point . They went at once to its fountain source . " Give unto your servants that which is // just and equal . " Persuade all masters to do that , and slavery would vanish . Persuade all governments to enforce that command , and slavery would be destroyed . In this manner Roman slavery was destroyed ; so was mediæval vassalage ; so Russian serfdom ; so negro slavery in the British , French , and Danish colonies ; and so , we trust , will emancipation triumph in our Southern States . But it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his master , giving thus , by active interference , his sanction to the Roman law . It is true that St. Paul did send Onesimus , who , under his teaching , had become a Christian , to Philemon , his master , also a Christian , and thus submitted to that law . But with him he sent a letter , exhorting Philemon to receive him , " not now as a servant , but above a servant , a brother beloved . " The Southern people tell us , that , under their training , the African has become a Christian . When they receive their runaway negroes , who are sent back to them in obedience to the law , as fellow-Christians , " not as servants , but as brothers beloved , " the mission of St. Paul and his Master to both will be accomplished .
