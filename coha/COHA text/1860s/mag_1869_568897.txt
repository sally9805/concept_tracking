ARlICLE lY-THE AMERICAN COLLEGES AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC . Iv . THE consideration of the American colleges as communities has brought us to the question of their religions character . This includes several subordinate questions , such as , whether they ought to be placed under a positive religious influence , and to what extent and in what manner this influence may properly be exercised . These questions , and many others which arise under this comprehensive topic , are from the nature of the subject not easily answerd , and in the present state of opinion are involved in somewhat serious complications . We may as well say , at the outset , that the view which any man , otherwise well-informed , will take of this subject , must necessarily vary with the views which he takes of religion itself , as to its essential nature and authority , as to its relation to man 's responsibility and destiny , and as to its evidence . It will vary also with the views which he takes of Christianity ; according as he regards it as supernaturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be of human origination , and , therefore , so far as its miracles and the claims and conceptions of its central personage are concerned , as more or less historically erroneous . it will vary also according as his views are more or less enlarged of its relations to human culture , and of its friendliness to the highest forms of human development . The position which we occupy is that " the Christian faith is the perfection of human reason ; " that supernatural and historical Christianity is the only Christianity which is worth defending or which is capable of being defended on the grounds of reason or history ; and that such a Christianity , when interpreted by enlightened judgment , as to its truths and its pre // eepts , is not only friendly to the highest forms of culture , but is an essential condition of the same . There are not a few at the present time who do not agree with us in this position . More than a few , we fear , who are interested in the higher education of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religion as to assume in all their reasonings , that the claims of supernatural Christianity are more likely than otherwise to be set aside in the progress of historical and scientific investigation , and that it is therefore inconsistent as well as impolitic for the universities and colleges of the country to be very positively committed to the support of these claims . Such a recognition of Christianity , in their view , hinders the freedom of investigation and of teaching , and is inconsistent with that tolerance among scholars which is required by the spirit of the age . They might repel the charge of being anti-religions or atheistic or even anti-Christian in their own faith , *but they reason that for a college to recognize the Christian faith in its teachings is to commit itself to an implied bondage of opinion , which can not but constrain the freedom of its spirit , or which must , at least , make it unwisely intolerant . We can not accept this position or the inferences to which it leads . We must discuss this question in an important sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject from a Christian point of view . But while we frankly avow our position , we trust that it will not make us so one-sided or one-eyed in our construction of those whose position differs from our own as to render us incapable of appreciating their difficulties or of looking at college and university education from their point of view . Though our position is distinctively and avowedly Christian , we d*not propose to argue simply as theologians , or to use our assumption of the truth of Christianity as a vantage ground ; but to argue as friends of education , and to occupy , so far as we may , the ground which is common to all friends of cul*ture who are not avowedly irreligious and atheistic in their scientific and practical theories . The view which we shall endeavor to maintain is that the American Colleges should have a positively religious and Christian character . We have in mind the college such as we // have conceived and described it ,  --  the college which is a distinct community and maintains a separate and distinctive intellectual and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as communities ,  --  the colleges of the very large cities , where pupils live in their own homes and are rooted in their own families-can derive their religious influence from the same sources from which other youths derive theirs , that is , from the domestic , social , and church relations of the great community from which they have never been transplanted . While it is desirable , and in a sense , necessary that institutions of this kind should exert a positive religious and Christian influence , the necessity in this case is not so imperative . We are concerned with those colleges which maintain the distinctive and intensely active common life which we have described . When we say that the cojlege of this description should be positive in its religious and Christian influence , we mean that the essential facts and truths of the Christian system should be recognized in all its teachings as true ; that as a community the college should participate in Christian worship , and that its instruction and discipline should , with rare exceptions , be in the hands of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the following : First. - The colleges as such have the same duty and need of social religion which exist in every community . This can be doubted or denied only by those who deny altogether the obligation of united and common religious teaching and worship . We have seen that the college , as a community , is eminently independent and self-sufficing , deriving the roots of its life eminently from within itselt and living that life with an energy that is especially intense . If*ther human societies need to be socially religious , the need of the college is pre*iminent . If it is becoming that the great community of men should divide itself into separate societies in order that it may maintain religious teaching and worship , then it is especially appropriate that a society which of itself is separated from every other , should be provided with such teaching and worship . If every household ought to be a religious commonwealth , then the college which takes the youth from his home // and intrcduces him into a larger household of its own , ought tosustain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessities and position . Second. - The college , as compai'ed with other communities , stands in special and imperative need of religious restraints and religions influei*ces . The individuals of which it is composed have been released , sometimes abruptly , from the restraints of the family and of the public opinion of society at large . They form to themselves a public opinion of their own , which , though otten generous and just , is yet liabl to strange caprices and sudden revolutions , even when sobered and elevated by the most active and ennobling religious elements . The passions are strong , the will is impetuous and weak , the judgment is immature , the experience of temptation is limited , the habits of good are not fixed , while those to evil are sometimes fearfully strong . Such a community , as it would seem , does of all others stand in pressing need of the best religious influences , and these should be constantly applied , wisey varied , and patiently maintained . If Christianity can do anything to control and elevate any class of persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is adapted to and required for the susceptible , intelligent , and impetuous youth , who crowd the American colleges . What is adapted to the welfare of young men as individuals , is equally required for the order and discipline of the whole body . To govern a college by mere law , or by the force of rules and penalties , without appealing to the ethical and religious feelings of the pupils , is not always successful in the lowest sense , and it never can be in the highest . The rea*on and conscience must often be appealed to , and if this is done with effect , both reason and conscience must be reinforced and quickened by religious faith and feeling . If religious restraints and religious hopes are required in every community of full grown men-not as is sometimes charged to do the work of a police , but to make the work of a police less necessary ,  --  this must be eminently true in a community of youths whose sense of propriety is not always proportioned to their knowledge , and whose mobile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8urveillance . If the college contains none whose principles of duty are made sturdy by // religious reverence and whose consciences are quickened by the presence and love of God , then , on those occasions of strain and conflict between the students and the faculty which must inevitably occur from time to time , the cause of order must be imperiled . It is not according to the wisdom of experience to affirm that such exigencies will not arise , nor if they do occur , to rely upon any principles which are not enforced , either directly or indirectly , by religious faith . Third. - It is a legitimate and important function of the college , to form the character to moral and religious excellence . Education should not and can not be limited to the culture of the intellect and the tastes , but it properly includes the culture of the character . The Christian believer holds that the character can only be rightly formed when it is subjected to the authority of Christ . He holds that discipleship to Christ is the condition of complete success in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When then he requires that the college should teach and influence its pupils according to this theory , he is only consistent with his own most sacred convictions . Whenever the instruction on scientific and literary themes can be of such a character as to afford the opportunity of confirming the Christian faith , and strengthening Christian purposes , it should in all cases be given . If it furnishes no such opportunity , the character of the instructor In ay still attract and influence his pupils . Those who found and endow Christian colleges may as properly endow them as places of religious culture , so far as such culture can be successfully applied , as make them places of intellectual discipline . Those who do not accept the Christian notion of character , who do not believe in Christ as the object of man 's confidence and the light and hope of his life , may see no propriety in connecting these influences with his training in youth . They would exclude religion and Christianity from the college for the same reasons and no other that would exclude them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same reasoning which would exclude them from a place in the college , would require that they be rejected altogether . Fourth. - If moral and religious perfection are the end of all education , then moral and religious culture are friendly to // education and culture of every kind . * The end of learning , " says Milton , " is to repair the ruins of our first parents , by regaining to know God aright , and out of that knowledge to love him , to imitate him , to be like him , as we may the nearest by possessing our souls of true virtue , which being united to the heavenly grace of faith , makes up the highest perfection . But because our understanding can not in this body found itself but on sensible things , nor arrive so clearly to the knowledge of God and invisible things , as by orderly conning over the visible and inferior *reatur s , the same method is necessarily to be followed in all discreet teaching . " These views , with some qualifications of phraseology , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relig. ions truth . They are in brief " that moral and religious perfection are the final aim of all human culture , as they are of our existence and discipline in the human condition . This end is promoted by education , chiefly by the study of nature and of books . " Now the question upon which opinions differ , is , whether the final , that is the religious aim , ought to be distinctly recognized in our educational arrangements , especially in the higher institutions of learning . Some contend that any recognition of religious ends other than the most indirect and incidental must interfere with the direct object of education , which is culture , and in this way may defeat the ends of religion itself . Others contend , that inasmuch as religion is supreme , it should be recognized and pursued in the college , even at the expense and sacrifice of culture , that whatever else should be sacrificed even in an institution professedly devoted to education , religion should be regarded as supreme . We contend that there is no incompatibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direct object of every institution of learning , and in one sense the immediate aim of its arrangements , this aim is not hindered but promoted by that enlightened recognition of religion which culture makes possible . We hold that religion controls and tempers culture , in order to stimulate , refine , and elevate it ; and culture , in its turn , enlightens and liberalizes religion . We do not agree with Matthew Arnold in his Culture and Anarcky , that the Christian element is essentially " ilebraistic " in the sense of being // dogmatic , narrow , and intolerant , and that as such it is opposed to the " ilellenistic " element , which is reflecting , enlightened , tolerant , and civilized . Rather do we hold that Christianity mediates between Judaism and ilellenism , that it is Hebraism Hellenized , and contains in itself the excellences of both directions , softening the austerities of Judaism by the refinements of Greece , and thus enlarging its narrowness by " turning a stream of fresh and free thought upon our stock notions and habits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the touch of the divinely human Master and Lord of Christianity , that these antagonistic elements can be fused into something nobler than either , the self-sacrifice and worship of that Christian love which " seeketh not her own , " which " believeth all things , and hopeth all things . " iDid we not believe that an earnest and spiritual Christianity was compatible with and favorable to the highest forms of human culture , we should not believe it to be from God . But believing that it is divine , not merely in its origin but in its adaptation to every possible development of humanity ,  --  that it has " the promise of the life that now is as well as of that which is to come , " - we think that its truths and spirit should be distinctly and prominently recognized in all our higher institutions of learning ; and this not merely from its acknowledged importance and supremacy , but because of its beneficent influence upon learning and culture themselves . We would not make of our colleges houses of piety a such , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we would not lower the standard of learning or diminish the requirements of taste and culture ; but we would distinctly hold up and exemplify the most spiritual and earnest forms of Christian duty and the Christian life , as the end to which all learning and all culture should be consecrated as supreme . The mottoes upon the seals of Harvard and Yale respectively , when united into one , happily express our own opinion , as they do justice to the claims of religion on the one hand , and culture on the other . Harvard , in her Ohristo et Ecelesiw , pays the chief homage to religion , as it was natural that she should , being older in time . Yale completes the motto , by Lux et Veritas , providing for culture in words that remind us of Arnold 's oft-repeated " sweetness and light . " // We trust that none of our readers will be surprised that we assert , that other things being equal ,  --  as endowments , time , access to an intelligent and refined community , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that institution of learning which is earnestly religious is certain to make the largest and most valuable achievements in science and learning , as well as in literary taste and capacity . Among the particulars in which an earnest Christian spirit is fitted to act favorably upon the culture of the colleges , are the following . It is favorable to persevering industry . Culture of every sort is the fruit of applicatioii . Success in any science and art is achieved by labor . The spirit of Christianity is a spirit of self-denying and patient service . To what feats of literary work has it not prompted , in the amazing toil by day and night , through months and years , which has wrought those ponderous tomes that fill the libraries of the learned . It is true other motives prompt to laborious erudition and scientific toil ; the motives of ambition in all its forms , and sometimes those of malevolent passion or critical spleen , but none of these is a force which in its nature is so tense and untiring as are religious duty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devotees of Christian art in all its forms , who have labored , not merely for an immortality of earthly fame , but under the inspiration which came from the assured hope of a personal immortality which should surpass all their ideals by its satisfying realities . The Christian spirit is in its nature truth-loving . If there is any one feature prominent in the character of its great Founder , in which he was before his own time and has given character to all the time that is subsequent , it is his recognition of the independence of the truth as such , and of its authority , by virtue of its hold upon the reason . If there is any one spirit which he has inculcated by precept and example , it is the spirit of brave allegiance to truth . If any duty may be said to have been prominently recognized and enforced by him , it is the duty of candor in weighing all sorts of evideuce . The father of the inductive philosophy could find no better illustration of the spirit which was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than in these words , " that it is no less true in this human kingdom of knowledge , than in God 's kingdom of heaven , that no man shall enter into it except he become first as a little child . " It enjoins the love of all sorts of truth-Truth of art , literature , as well as of that beauty which is but another name for aesthetic truth . The precept " whatsover things are true , whatsoever things are lovely , whatsoever things are of good report , think on these things , " provides for the most catholic taste conceivable , for the most progressive civilizatiGn , for all true refinement in art , in literature , in manners , and in civilization of every kind . It not only provides for all these , but it imupels to all these as duties . It is , morover , refining in its operation and influences , and so far is eminently favorable to culture . It represses the animal passions with the debasement which they involve . It rises above mere worldly tendencies with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which this hardness is capable , and substitutes for it the more delicate grace of spiritual modesty and spiritual aspirations . It destroys the selfish affections and substitutes for them the love which is warm as well as ennobling . It rises above the envious jealouses which , if reports are true , do sometimes separate men of science , poets , and musicians ; as well as theologians and religionists . In short , the indirect effect of Christian feeling is to call forth and encourage whatever in human sensibility is of finer texture , and to keep it fresh and pure . The same Christian faith which , when , it enters a cottage , other things being equal , awakens and intensifies the love of floxvers , of music , of poetry , and of pictures , does also , when it donimates in the cultured soul , increase the delicacy and enlarge the sphere of its tastes , and when it rules in a university , tends to make its members more refined in all their capacities for aesthetic progress , as well as quickens the desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Christianity is the same thing as culture , or that Christian attainments may in a college be accepted as an equivalent for attainments in science and literature . As we have said , the university and the college are // not proximately designed for religious culture and spiritual edification , but for study and intellectual discipline . To turn them into houses of religion or to use them chiefly or prominently as places for spiritual instead of intellectual exercises , is grossly to pervert them , and like all other perversions and half-truths is to foster all manner of spiritual monstrosities ; as hypocrisy , cant , spiritual pride , asceticism , and the like . Hence we do not care to sce the religious features of a college paraded in the newspapers , or reports of its religious condition and doings made the subject of ostentatious comments . The impropriety in such cases is eminently conspicuous and offensive , because it is an offense against religion and culture combined . Pharisaism and cant are never in good taste . We can not deny that Christianity sometimes seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms . Its ethical claims are supreme and uncompromising . It sets the moral excellence which comes of its faith and obedience , far above all other excellences , and requires its disciples to esteem all these as nothing in this comparison , and at this sacrifice . Whenever the question arises between the gratification of a taste and the discharge of a duty , or between the culture of the intellect and the culture of the heart , the former must be sacrificed . All tastes and all enjoyments , which pertain to the present , must be held as secondary to those which pertain to the higher and unseen life . Hence it has been inferred by the detractors of Christianity , that it is barbarous because it does not exalt art and culture as supreme ; they forgetting that the nature or fate which they set up in its stead is equally inexorable and cruel , when it burns , and bruises , and drowns , or limits , in myriads of ways , the works and aspirations of culture and art . Hence it has been inferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their knowledge of Christianity or who make it a cloak for envy or suspicion toward those whose tastes are more refined than their own , that while a certain degree of knowledge and culture are enforced by Christianity , any excess beyond is inconsistent with its spirit . Hence the impression that it is unfriendly to eminent attainments in science and letters , and that for this reason it can not be comfortably housed in a university , which would stand at the front of modern achievements . // To shut off these unfortunate and unwarrantable inferences , we assert that Christianity has much to learn from culture , that while it is refining in its influences and therefore tends to culture , it is itself refined and enlarged by the learning to which , in its essential nature , it is altogether friendly . Culture as such 4argely pertains to the form and expression of which Christianity is the spirit and soul Grace and perfection of manners , purity , and felicitousness of diction , dexterity in the accomplishments of music , drawing , and painting , or nicety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as skill and science in the more intellectual departments , all bring back to Christianity the means of more perfectly manifesting the power of its spiritual beauty , and teach Christianity itself how to become more attractive by assuming those adornments which she herself has very largely created , and all of which she welcomes and rejoices in as appropriate to herself . But while we concede all this , and even contend that Christianity may learn from culture , we contend also that culture itself is exposed to certain excesses for which Christianity is the only adequate counterpoise and remedy . We affirm that a vigorous religious influence is needed in every university , if for no other reason , simply as a corrective against the one-sidedness , the Philistinismn we might call it , of modem science and literature . Modern culture , from the very perfection which it requires and attains in particular departments , tends to narrowness , positiveness , and conceit . The devotee of any single branch of knowledge or department of art must devote himself exclusively aud perseveringly to his chosen profession . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm fixes the attention more and more exclusively upon the objects within his limited sphere . He becomes great in a single line , because hi* mind moves within that alone . It often happens that while he is strong in one department , he is weak in thought and opinions with respect to every other . But it does not follow because he is weak and even ignorant , that he is sensible of his defects and incapacity . On the contrary , his conscious superiority in his chosen pursuit , makes him positive , dogmatic , and conceited in respect to every other . Hence // the sectarian narrowness which divides the devotees of the physical sciences , and their acknowledged proneness to cliques , which is recognized in the pointed words of President White : " It may seem strange that this should be alluded to ; but in view of the fact that more than one American college has been ruined by such feuds , and that very many have been crippled , in view of the cognate fact that the odium theologicum seems now outdone by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule it is now impossible to receive an impartial opinion from one scientific man respecting another ; and that these gentlemen , in their jealouses and likenings , are evidently awaiting some one with a spark of the iJfoLi*re genius , to cover them before the country with ridicule and contempt , we do not think that the Board is likely to give too much importance to this . " ( Report etc. on the organization f* Cornell University . ) It may seem to some a little strange that we suggest that Christian science furnishes the natural and most efficient prophylactic and cnre for these sectarian narrownesses and embitterments . The study of God in his relations to what is known or knowable in the universe of spirit and matter certainly forces to a general consideration of what is known or knowable in the several departments of being . It requires the consideration , superficial indeed but respectful , of the principles and authority of every one of the sciences . It brings each expert to look beyond the narrow bounds of his own speciality , and to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then carries him up to a point of view which commands the limits of all the special sciences , that he may see how they all adjust themselves to that underlying philosophy , which recognizes in some sort their bond of unity-whether this is called the Absolute of the schools , or the living God of the people . In this way Theology becomes , not merely in the language of Bacon the " haven and Sabbath of all man 5 contemplations , " but in a certain sense the commune vinculum of the special sciences . It is such , so far as it forces the devotee of each to look beyond the limits of his own field , and to recognize the existence and rights of his neighbors . It even becomes a harmonizing and purifying power , so far as it liberalizes // the mind of each narrow devotee , by lifting his thoughts now and then up to God , and forcing him to recognize the relations of his own science to Him . Even if Theology is not cultivated as a science , but is present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only so far as is required for religious faith and feeling , it must still quicken and widen their intellects , and enable them to pursue their special departments in a spirit less narrow and more catholic . Should it be urged that Theology , in its turn , is jealous of scientific progress , and hostile to its freedom , we have no occasion to affirm or deny that it may be . All that we contend for is that the influence of Christian theology and of Christian faith upon the professed devotees of science themselves , legitimately tends to make them more profound , and therefore more broad and catholic as philosophers . So far as observation or history has taught us , Christian Geologists , Chemists , Philosophers , and Historians have not loved scientific tmuth as truth any the less purely , or followed it any the less boldly or bravely than those who were not Christian . Nor have they , when other things were equal , been a whit less diligent , earnest , and successful , than those who have accepted none of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture to affirm , that when other things were equal , they have been , in every respect , better philosophers for being also " theologians ; " more broad and more profound in their intellectual activities and achievements , and immeasurably more noble and generous in their tempers as teachers and writers , and in the intercourse of science and of life . Faraday was no less enlightened and broad-minded as a chemical philosopher because he kept his Christian faith warm and true in the humblest fashion . Alexander Humboldt would have been wider-minded , and larger-hearted as a thinker , had he not so timidly shunned those religious avowals and religi&amp;us sympathies , which his brother William so freely expressed . " They that deny a God , destroy man 's nobility , " says Bacon , and Atheism never fails to develop something of the ignoble , whether in the school , the salon , or the beer-shop . No Atheistic theory or Pantheistic philosophy was ever intellectually great , or a*sthetically noble . // The question is not , as many would represent it to be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one hand and the interests of scientific culture on the other , but it is a question between the most efficient methods of advancing both science and culture . We contend , for the reasons already given , that a religious college will , if all else is equal , in the long run , do more for science and culture than the college which sets aside or makes little of religious influence and of Christian truth . Nor is it a question whether science shall be free and be pursued in a liberal spirit , or whether it shall be constrained by theological prepossessions and be limited by Christian dogmas and the Christian history . We contend that the Christian investigator is pledged by the very spirit of his system to be a bold and fearless follower of the truth wherever the truth shall lead , even though it should lead him to thc rejection of any part or the whole of its own history and theology . It is simply whether true culture can be effectually received without moral culture , and whether moral culture can be effectually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is in a condition of eminent exposure as well as of especial promise , Christian influences ought not to be employed with the utmost possible efficiency . Fifth. - Religions influences and religious teaching should be employed in colleges , in order to exclude and counteract the atheistic tendencies of much of modern science , literature , and culture . We have already alluded to the advantage which science and cult qwq can nublic and score , an inalienable any any have rio'ht that shade of opinion which he or they may hold , should be taught in some one of the chairs of a college . // We would distinguish here between the college and the urnversity . The disposition to confound the two is perpetually appearing at every turn of this discussion , and at every step of our progress , not merely as involving the intellectual fallacy of the a'nbiguo*as middle , but the practical error of prescribing a course of instruction for boys which is only suitable for men . The college is a training place for minds that are yet immature in the elements of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are supposed to have been trained to the capacities and responsibilities of incipient manhood . Whatever freedom may be claimed for the university in teaching and learning , does not sanction a similar freedom in the college . We are not prepared to allow , that even in the university every shade of opinion should have a hearing , under the countenance of its guardians , and with the sanction of their consent . The tolerance oC free speech and free discussion we would defend to the last degree . The courtesies of fair and dispassionate controversy we would enforce with the utmost scrupulousness , but we are not required by these duties to set in the chair of authorized teaching , even in a free university , the representatives of every shade of literary opinion , or of anti-religious philosophy . We acknowledge it is not alway easy to apply these general principles . It is not easy to say how far a man 's philosophical or religious creed should be considered as an objection to his holding a college or university chair , but the principle holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should maintain a positive religious influence and character . These thoughts lead us to our next inquiry , by what means is this to be done ? What methods of influence may be employed ? and within what limits may they be applied ? We can not , as we have just suggested , be required to discuss or to answer these and the like questions any more than when we lay d xvn certain fundamental principles and rules of duty , we can anticipate all the refinements of casuistry . The following points arc clear . The college should maintain public Christian worship , and this should be conducted in an earnest , positive manner . It should give positive Christian instruction conoerning the evidence and truths of theism and Christianity . // It should by the influence and activities of its teachers favor an active Christian life . It should pervade all the teaching which admits it with a distinct and earnest recognition of Christian truth . At the same time , as we have already explained , the college is professedly and primarily a place for intellectual culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils should be given . All the coiiditions required for successful study should be furnished . Among these are irominent , perfect tolerance of any form of religious opinion , encouragement to the utmost freedom of reading and inquiry , and the inculcation of the bravest confidence in the authority of evidence , and the application of a critical judgment . The point of the greatest delicacy is a point upon which no fixed rules can be established , and that is how far the religious opinions and character of a person should be considered in estimating his qualifications for the post of teacher . Such a question as this can not be settled in a general way , or by prescribed formulae . There are manifold peculiarities of personal character , besides learning or even aptness to teach , which render an individual a very suitable or a very unsuitable member of a college faculty . There are many # well instructed , and very eminent men , who are withal very earnest religionists , who by the very indiscretion and overplus of their zeal , are totally disqualified for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , the sensitiveness of whose conscience , and the hesitation of whose temper , make their inquiring spirit and their " honest doubts express infinitely more of religious earnestness and of religious power , than the plump and unhesitating orthodoxy of many a coarseminded and hard favored dogmatist . There are some chairs the instruction of which can not be affected by the faith or the character of the incumbent . There are other chairs , which an anti-Christian sophist or a velvet-footed infidel might pervert to the most disastrous uses . If the principle and duty be acknowledged for which we contend , the application may be safely entrusted to the wise discretion of those whose business it is to decide upon individual cases . Against the view which we have taken , manifold objections // may be offered . One of the most formidable is , that if the colleges are positively religious institutions , they must be necessarily sectarian . This does not follow . A sectarian or denominational college is a college conducted with reference to the interests of a single denoinir*ation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar religious spirit , are all made proininent* as fundamentally Christian , as alone authorized , or as pre&amp;ninently excellent . Such colleges may sometimes be needed for the pre8tige of the denomination , or to guard its youth against being drawn from its fold . The lamentable and unjustifiable divisions among Christians may therefore involve the necessity of a few colleges that are distinctively and avowedly sectarian . But the foundation or the conducting of a college in the interests of a single denomination has not generally been successful , for the reason that the culture which colleges impart is , in its nature , liberalizing ; and that to Christian earnestness , when instructed by Christian learning , the exclusiveness of any Protestant sect becomes almost invariably distasteful . Just in proportion as the college becomes eminent in its culture , just in that proportion does it lose sight of any single sect and denomination , and take in to its larger view the common relations of all to culture and to Christ . A truly religious college can not , in our opinion , be eminently sectarian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yielding itself up to the influence of the science , art , and culture which it is appointed to promote . However strictly it may be held by its character to the name or the organization of any single denomination , it will outgrow all narrowing relations to it , or make its denomination outgrow them , just as fast as it grows at all . If this be so , then why should it be attached to any one denomination ,  --  why should it not be the common property of many , or the common property of none ? We reply , a college in which several denominations have an equal interest , will inevitably be divided and dishonored by ignoble sectarian strifes . The several denominations which hold it in common will regard each other with that " eternal vigilance " which in such cases easily degenerates into perpetual suspicion ; its officers will be elected , its policy will be determined , // with a judgment divided between the interests of the college and the interests of the sect . Some of the most disgraceful exhibitions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country has ever witnessed , have occurred in the history of colleges which have been the joint property of two or three denominations . But why not let them be the property of none ? This can only happen as the board of trust and management is made up partially or wholly of members who have no religions preferences at all . Or why not solve the problem by throwing the college upon the endowments and the care of the State ? The objection to either of these arrangements , so far as the religious relations and character of the college is concerned , is that it will immediately become the object of the ambition , or the victim of the strife of some one or more religious sects , with the never ending discussions which must inevitably follow ; or it will have no religions character at all . In the present divided condition of Christendom , there seems to be no solution of the problem , except the one which has been accepted in this country , viz. , that the college should be in the hands of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect to its religious character and influence , and that it should be preserved from sectarian bias and illiberality , by its responsibility to the community which it would influence , and the enlightening and catholic influence of the culture to which it is devoted . We see no alternative between this and the abandonment of any special and efficient religious infli*nce , i. e. , the complete secularization of the college . For this alternative many leading minds are already prepared ; more than are ready to acknowledge There are not a few who contrast what they call the people 's colleges , or the state colleges , with what they choose to designate as sectarian colleges , to the disadvantage of the Iatter ,  --  who do not desire that the college should have any positively Christian influence , either because they do not believe it has anyplace there , or because they would attract students frommi those who have no positive religious faith for themselves , or desire none for their children . That these views are incorrect we have endeavored to prove , by our argument // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reproach , if sectarian is fairly charged on the one side , godless may he as fairly retorted on the other , and if a purely secular college will attract a certain portion of the community , positively reli gio us colleges will attract another . If the two sorts of colleges are fairly tried , the fruits of the two will be made manifest . It will be seen after a generation , whether Christianized science , art , and literature , has any advantage over that which is un-Christian or non-Christian ; whether the education and culture that are elevated by the Christian faith , has any advantage over that which is secular and atheistic . One thing is certain , that all the experiments which have been tried in this country to conduct institutions of learning without Christian worship and Christian influences , have failed ; that all the so-called State colleges have , in some sort , been forced to adopt , either directly or indirectly , the same methods of religions influence which are employed in the Christian colleges ; that in the choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of positive and earnest Christian faith , for their greater usefulness as teachers , and their greater acceptableness to the community . Those who believe that the Christian argument has been nearly exhausted , and the Christian history has been demonstrated to be impossible , and must be regarded as practically false ,  --  that the Christ of the New Testament is but a human ideal , with no personal authority , will of course , in the light of their advanced opinions , be willing to repeat the experiment under what they consider more favorable auspices , but they can not ask those to believe in its success , who hold another theory of religion and Christianity . We are reminded here of another topic which has been more or less distinctly discusssed by and betbre the American public-whether the instructioa and government of the American colleges has not been too largely entrusted to clergymen ? Clergymen , it is said , must , by the very nature and influence of their profession , be essentially artificial and one-sided . They can not and they ought not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the phrase , that is , they can not judge of men as they are , with fairness and discrimination , for the reason that all men present themselves to their view in a constrained atti // tude and under an artificial light , and they in their turn must look at men through highly refracting media . They usually want tact and delicacy in the management of men . They do not approach them with that skill which can only be acquired by a large experience under a great variety of circumstances . They are also not usually good men of business , and ought , therefore , not to beintrusted with the investment and care of the large sums of money which are required for the support of a college . They are not abreast with the advancements of modern science , and unlikely to be abreast with the culture which is required by the present generation . For these and other reasons it is urged they ought not to constitute so large a portion of the boards of instruction and management as they have done in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assert that in some cases there is not reason for these criticisms . But we can assert with considerable confidence that it would be difficult to show in any individual case that where clergymen have failed , either as members of a college faculty or of a board of trustees , laymen would have succeeded . The relation of one of these boards to the other is so different in different colleges that it is almost impossible to reason from failure or success in one case to failure or success in another . In some colleges the faculty have little influence in the policy and appointments . In others one or two individuals , either lay or clerical , very largely determine both . The success or failure.of many institutions seems to be occasioned by excellences or defects which are individual rather than professional . There are several obvious roasous , however , why clergymen have been , and must still continue to be , intrusted very largely with duties and responsibilities of this kind . In the first place , most of the colleges have originated in the most thankless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are consecrated by the vows and the spirit of their profession . The labor , self-denial , and disinterested toil which have been required to lay the foundations and rear the superstructure of the most successful colleges of this country can not be too easily estimated . To a very large extent these have been endured and rendered by cler*yrnen . The care , inquiry , // invention , and correspondence , the personal toil and sacrifice which devolve upon those who act as trustees of an infant and often of a well-established college are such that few persons except clergymen are willing to undertake them . Clergymen rn ay not always be good men of business , but they generally know who are such , and have generally the good sense and good feeling to ask the advice and to defer to the decisions of those who are , which is more than can always be said of laymen who are called to duties and trusts to which they are not competent . Hence , with the best intentions and with far greater experience in affairs generally , lay men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or power of adaptation , especially in the management of men , an excess of tact has not unfrequently been charged upon the clergy . Clerical art and finesse have in not a few cases become proverbial as grounds of reproach . Clergymen are far more commonly interested in matters of education than laymen , by reasin of a certain breadth of culture and generosity of disposition which are the results of Christian science . Though the idola tri bus may exact from them a devotion which is sometimes narrow and exclusive , yet their profession is from its very nature , as we have shown , the most liberalizing of all , from the common relation it involves to other branches of knowledge and from the habit of seeking for the foundations of truth which the study of God and religion induces . It is but the simple truth to say that there is many a country clergyman , whose income is counted by hundreds where that of his classmate lawyer mind judge is counted by thousands , who knows incalculably more of science as such and of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lawyer , whose reputation is the very highest in his profession . The professional studies of the clergymen do also very emphatically involve and cultivate a sympathy with literature of all kinds . The practice of composition and of public speaking upon elevated themes , involves more or less interest in the study of language and in works of imaginative literature . The clergy as such have , at least in this country , a more pronounced and catholic literary taste than the members of any other profession . They constitute , indeed , to a very large // extent , the literary class  --  the class who furnish most frequently public addresses , essays , reviews , and pamphlets . Educated lawyers , physicians , and merchants write very little in comparison with them , arid are muth less fequently readers beyond the range of their own profession . The reason why clergymen are so generally selected as professors and teachers in colleges , is twofold First , t hat the men best qualified by special culture are oftener found in the clerical profession ; and , second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clergyman in the smallness of its pay and the unselfish patience which it involves . At the same time it is not usually true , so far as we have observed , that there is not a sufficiently large number of laymen in the faculties and boards of trust to correct the one-sidedness and to supplement the defects of their clerical colleagues . We have never observed that there was in such boards any jealousy of lay cooperation , any disposition to foster a clerical spirit or any one-sided results from clerical supervision . The cloistered , scholastic and pedantic influences of the college which are sometimes complained of , so far as there are any , usually proceed from lay professors , who have never known any thing but a scholar 's life . The doctores umbratiles of the American colleges are more frequently laymen. lute relations of the colleges to the community are those of partially endowed beneficent institutions , which are designed to confer important benefits upon the young . For the faithful and successful discharge of their duties , the instructors are directly responsible to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public . Many of the beneficent results which these institutions propose to accomplish are not immediately obvious . The adaptation of the means to the ends proposed is not always easy to be seen , and as a general rule can be judged and estimated only by a few . When the results do not seem to be the best conceivable , it is not always easy to say whether any other training or appliances would have wrought results so good . The training of an individual youth in a liberal spirit to the capacity and the desire to be a useful public man , either in the exercise of a profession or in any leading position , is a matter concerning which the // experience of the past should be most cautiously regarded . It should be committed to enterprising men , indeed , who are not afraid of innovation or reform , but who are also far-seeing , thoughtful , and self-relying . Extemporaneous and flippant dogmatism and ambitions and satirical criticism by bold adventurers or uncultivated Philistines are especially out of place in discussions concerning such trnsts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserve to be heeded except for their power to mislead the confiding public . Though , in one sense , the managers of colleges need not ask the advice of the public , because they know and understand , better than the public can , the duties with which they are intrusted ; yet , in another sense , they ought never to forget that , if they do not retain the confidence of the public , it will be impossible for them to be of service to the public . If the community do not value the training and the instruction which they give , they can not bemefit it , and they might as well not exist . And yet , as we have observed , the public are not competent to judge directly of many , not to say of most , of the questions involved . It is most fortunate that , under these circuu1stances , the colleges have always had one resource . They have usually been able to rely upon their own graduates . These act as internuneji between the colleges and the public whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In times of a conflict between the two , the alumni of a powerful college are , indeed , as " arrows in the hand of a mighty man . " " happy is the college ' that hath its quiver full of them ; they shall *peaJe with the enemies in the gate . " The graduates of the American colleges are their glory and their strength . They are their glory , so far as they show , by mental power , by varied acquirements , and accomplished culture , what their Alma Mater has done for them , either by her unwelcome restraints and hard duties , or by those influences that were more genial in their operation and are more delightful in the remembrance . They are their strength , so far as they are distinctly conscious of the benefits which they derived fromn the college , and are forward to acknowledge them . The colleges of this country have nothing to fear , so long as the majority of their pupils continue to confide in their systems // of discipline and instruction , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college or university , all the world over , is the object of special regard to those whom they have trained , but the colleges of America have the strongest conceivable hold upon the affection of their pupils , from the intimacy of the associations which are here fixed and interwoven , as well as from the sense of the value of the discipline here received . These alumni , it is true , retain and somewhat liberally exercise the traditional privileges of all children , freely to criticise the ways of the household . They retain vivid recollections of the tedium of many of the college tasks , and the unwelcome character of some of its exercises . Nor do they always weigh the import of what they say , or are they always very confident of the justice of the criticisms which they unthinkingly utter . Sometimes their fault-finding is but the result of their jealous regard for the honor of their college and an indirect expression of the fervor of their zeal for its abundant prosperity . The alumni are greatly mistaken if they ever suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or delight to trifle with it . On the other hand , they are not only most desirous to have it , but they are sensible that if they lose it they must lose their hold upon the public at large . At the same time , as honest men , they will be more anxious to deserve than to gain their favor , and they would act most out of character should they strive to attain it by any sort of edmicational charlatanry or any varnish of superficial culture . They are not only willing to hear , but they are most ready to regard whatever suggestions may b* made in respect to any improvements in the college system . But some of them are not prepared to initiate or follow any headlong rivalship for numbers which may be proposed , or to sacrifice their matured convictions at the dictation of editorial demagogues , or at the direction of the self-styled " spirit of the age . " It is their duty to desire , and we believe they do desire to be brought into the most intimate communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves should feel that the college is their own ; not as their property for capricious experiments and hazardous speculations , but as // their trust for wise support and administration in behalf of the interests of their country and of mankind . The importance of the colleges , as organized centers of the most valuable species of power , can not be estimated too extravagantly . The man who feels any obligation to act upon his fellow-men for their good can scarcely find a place where his influence can be so extensively felt with respect to the most important interests as through a college that has a mature and established growth . Oxford and Cambridge are more powerful in England at this moment than the Lords , the Commons , and the Queen together . As permanent and enduring institutions , they are more lasting than dynasties , and have survived revolution * . If the alumni of the American colleges could but appreciate the dignity and duty of this trust , the country and mankind would have occasion to bless them , and they would have occasion to bless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this real trust , which is , in fact , committed to these alumni , should be made more formal and official , that the alumni should nndertake the actual management of the concerns of the colleges , by electing their trustees in whole or in part . Such a measure has been in part introduced at Harvard , and an election is now held at every commencement , by which a class of the board of overseers are chosen by the direct votes of the graduates who are present . The movement in Harvard did not originate , as we understand the matter , in any special desire of the alumni to take a more direct part in its administration , but it was adopted to deliver the college from the interference of a troublesome class of political and sectarian intermeddlers who were constantly introducino ' into their deliberations , held in public , all b manner of uncomfortable insinuations and appeals , intended quite as much for the arena of political and religions parties as for their relation to the internal economy of the university . The board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a confirming and visitorial power . The corporation of the university , as is well known , is a very small body , and has within its hands the chieg and as some contend the sole , authority . This remains intact upon its old historic foundation . But the movement thus initiated has extended to other colleges // and propositions have been made ,  --  and in one instance , at least , adopted , to give to the alumni a similar power of electing by classes , at intervals , a part or the whole of a board of trustees . By some , such participation is claimed as a right , by others it is recommended as politic . We do not propose to discuss this question here , for any arguments concerning the principle or the details of such a measure would be entirely out of place . We have mentioned it as one among many indications that the alumni of many of the colleges are awakening to a more lively interest in their concerns , and we hope to a more serious sense of personal responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and of every other subject which respects their external or their internal relations will be for their good . We deprecate only that this or any other question should be discussed with the spirit or debased by the arts of demagogues , or that the results of any discussion should tend to drive from these venerable seats of sound learning the studies and the arts which make men solidly great or nobly good . That college does not deserve to live which would not welcome the counsel and accept the guidance of the choicest of its sons . We believe , moreover , that there are few American colleges which have any character or age of which the majority of its trustees is not of its own graduates . The only question is , whether these boards are not at present so organized as to secure an adequate representation of the feelings and judgment of the alumni . It is a still more serious question , whether the uncertainties of a chance nomim*tion , from a constituency that changes every year , would not on trial give eminent dissatisfaction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would divide their opini*ns and weaken their affection instead of uniting their efforts and kindling their enthusiasm . A self-perpetuating board of trustees , resting on some historic basis , with a traditional spirit , acting in relations of confidence and free communication with the board of instructors , can not be ignorant of the wishes and feelings of the alumni , and can not , if they would , refuse to be aflected by them . The chance nomination and election of one or more representatives by a body organized for an hour , and changing in its members // very considerably every year , might open the way to constant dissatisfaction and personal discussion , and should not be resorted to except after grave deliberation and inquiry . The alumni of an institution which has prospered under any system of organization and government , may well be content with its constitution and history . If any college has failed to explain its condition fully and frankly to its alumni , from motives of delicacy or for any other reason , let it freely and frequently open to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its fears , in the frankness and freedom which are suitable to a family gathering , and it can not fail to command the confidence and to receive the sympathy of all the generous and noble-minded of its sons . Criticisms and complaints are also beginning to be heard in another direction. * It is contended that in this country the colleges have unwittingly departed from the original signification of Fellows ; these , in the colleges of England , having been originally resident and charged with the duty of governing , as well as of teaching the college . It is urged that , in substituting for such Fellows a body of persons , who may themselves have been uneducated at a college , and many of whom have had little or no experience of its instruction and government , to the exclusion of all the faculty except the president , we have weakened too greatly the influence of the instructors . We call attention to these criticisms for their relation to one most important condition of the prosperity of any college . This is is the maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trust and the faculty or faculties of instruction . It is of little consequence what may be the legal privileges and powers of the three great elements of college administration and legislation , provided they conspire to- * We ought , rather , to say that a movement in this direction has been revived . In 1824 a memorial was addressed to the corporation of Harvard university , signed by all the professors , among whom were Henry Ware , Andrews Norton and Edward Everett , urging that , according to the original constitution and design of the charter , the Board of Fellows should consist of resident instructors , and giving many reasons why such an arrangement would be most advantageous to the university . It failed after having given birth to a half score of able and spirited pamphlets . // gether for its support . A college in which the trustees , the graduates , and the faculty are of one mind , and work in harmony and mutual confidence , can not but prosper , provided there is any occasion for its existing at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges , by some portions of the American public , that they are bound so rigidly by the traditions of the past , as to be incapable of those improvements which are required by the changing phases of the present generation . No charge is more untrue or unfounded . The oldest of these colleges were not in the beginning servilely copied from the colleges of the old world , though funded at a time and by men who reverenced the traditions of the venerable schools in which they themselves had been trained . In their original constitution they were adapted to the condition and wants of the comurunnities for which they were provided , and in their growth and development they have undergone*successive transformations , according to the shaping spirit of successive generations . We have not designed to protest against reforms in the college system or in its administration . We are quite willing to admit that some are imperatively required . We are not displeased that questions concerning them should be freely discussed by any class of thinkers or writers , or before any tribunal . We insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these questions , and that the parties who discuss the subject should have clear and just conceptions of the ends of higher education , and some experience concerning the irmeans by which these ends can be most successfully attained . The recent agitation of these questions which has occasioned this series of papers , will , we are confident , result only in advantage to the higher education of the country , by calling attention to those reforms which the colleges require , and by vindicating their essential features from the objections of shallow and ill-informed critics . We are in no sense averse to the development of the college into a university . We believe this to be desirable and possible , with enterprise , patience , money , and time . But we are opposed to the employment of university instruction , and of university freedom and irresponsibility for classes which re // quire the discipline of the college . To introduce the option of the university , or the lectures of the university , to pupils who are grounded in nothing , but in a conceit of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impelled by aspirations to arrive speedily at the goal without traveling over the intervening space , tends buly to destroy the college by substituting the show of a university , and to sink the so-called university into a special school of technology . Were it not advocated in England by men who represent both the aristocracy of birth and of culiure , we should pronounce it to be an American expedient , to dignify superficial and limited attainments by high sounding names , and to substitute an apparently short cut over bushes and briars for a path that has been tried and found to be the shortest practicable . We are not opposed to trying every method and study by the criterion of usefulness , but we would always interpose the question . u&amp;ef'ul for what ? We believe that those studies and that discipline which are the most useful to train to manly thinking , to nice discrimination , to simple expression , as well as to noble purposes , and an enlarged acquaintance with man and his history , are the most useful studies in fact ; while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate trade , calling , or profession , is sophistical and misleading . We do not reject the mathematics from our course , though their direct utility in the vulgar sense seems to be more questionable than that of any other class of studies . At the same time , we question whether , in a general course , they should be pursued beyond the limit at which their best disciplinary effect seems to have been exhausted , and their special refinements and intricacies seem to confuse rather than to sharpen the wits , and to burden rather than to excite the powers . We would retain th' study of the classics , for the reasons which we have given at length , but we would , if possible , make the study serviceable to the cultivation of the taste for literature as well as to intellectual discipline . The design of this study in college should be not to train for the tastes and discriminations of grammarians and philologists , but for the mastery of these languages for pleasurable and easy reading . The sciences of nature have already received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can take the place of the humanistic studies as means of discipline , or that they can even be thoroughly taught and mastered except in special classes or in special schools , must , we think , be abandoned . The modern languages have already been introduced into the courses of many coileges . It is greatly to be regretted that the elements of French and German can not be required for admission in order that the college training might be more liberal and aesthetic . For this and many other improvements in the college course we must look to the preparatory schools . These ar3 an essential element in the system of higher education of which the college forms a part . Some of these schools are admirable , needing no special reform except in respect to general culture , as in Natural History , in Geography , History , and the English language , in all of which special knowledge and refinement , as well as the facile use of some modern language , is more important than is usually believed as a preparation for the highest advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defects charged upon the colleges of the country , are fairly chargeable to the low standard of general culture among the better classes in this country , and to the want of thoroughness and breadth in many of the secondary schools . We shall never forget the remark of one of the most eminent scholars of Germany-himself a courtier and man of the world as well as an accomplished classicist : " The great want of England and America is an organized system of secondary schools . You can not have a successful higher i**struction , till these are provided " , XVe believe it to be true , that if the tens of millions of dollars which have been wasted , and worse than wasted , in foundimig and equipping superfluous colleges and pretended universities in this country , had been bestowed in endowing and equipping a large number of classical schools of the highest order , the colleges themselves and the higher education of the country would long ago have been lifted to a higher plane . Perhaps we should have been ready by this time for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many long to see , and complain that if it were not , for the stupidity and obstinacy of the colleges , would have long ago come into // being . Will it ever appear ? When and by what methods will it come into being ? We answer , it will not come into being by prematurely introducing its studies and methods into the college . Nor will it be hastened by overloading the last year of the college course by a great variety of studies , a little knowledge of which is very desirable , and a short course of lectures upon which is therefore prescribed . The spirit of cram , and of the superficial and mechanical mastery of a few elements of many sciences , is the cnrse of the colleges as they are . To intensify this tendency is to commit the worst of all blunders . The university will come only as professors are fonnd capable of teaching more than the elements of the branches which they profess , and as pupils are found who are willing to pursue them with the requisite thoroughness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already qualified to give as valuable and as profound instruction as any professors in European universities . Some of them , indeed , are so occupied by college work , or by lread and butter labors , as to want the time and opportunity to prepare and give the formal instruction which an organized university class would require . Others have more leisure and would delight in nothing so much as in giving advanced instruction to pupils competent and desirous to receive it . The chief desideratum , however , is a sufficient number of pupils in any one place to furnish an inspiring audience , and to warrant the beginnings of organization . The cxperinients already made at Harvard and Yale are not without prorimise . We are glad to se* that another step forward has recently been taken at Harvard in the direction of systematic university instruction . The serious de8iderata in this tentative course would be acknowledged most readily by its originators and friends . It deserves1 however , the best wishes for its success-a good word for the enterprise which it exhibits-if it did not for it5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the number of persons in this country is exceedingly small , who are competent and desirous to eceive university instruction in branches which are not professional , and who are also not able and desirous to go to the continent . Or rather , we should say , the attractions // of travel , with the opportunity of becoming familiar with two or three European languages , are so decided as to present a very serious obstacle to the development of provisions for any university studies except those which are strictly professional . Not a few professional students seek to prosecute or to finish their studies in France or Germany . Of a large class graduating at Yale within a short period , a fifth visited Europe within the first year . Students who have the leisure to give a year or two to general studies in history , literature , philology , or any branch of philosophy , usually have the means of crossing the ocean , and , when they have done this , the expenses of living are lower than at home , and they meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to be fascinating to the natives of a new country like ours . It is ridiculous to hear such empty gasconading as was written within a few mouths , to the effect that it would not be very long before European students would flock to some great American university as freely as American scholars now go to Europe . We feel no disposition to depreciate American scholamhip or American thought . We are forward to acknowledge that some among us have no reason to be ashamed when measured by their peers in Europe . But a great university can not be built up in a day in an old country , nor in a new country , till many generations have provided the material . That material is something more than a few millions of money and a score of brilliant occasional lecturers . A great community of highly cultured scholars and literary men must first exist before the representatives of every branch of knowledge can appear who are competent to teach the choicest youth of the world , and before a large body of American pupils will be satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These facts should teach us good sense , which is another name for modesty in our expectations and promises . But they furnish no reasons why the beginnings of university instruction and study should not be made at once in connection with all the leading colleges . The professional schools already exist , and have flourished for many years , and so far as they have given thorough and scientific instruction , and have required an adequate preparation , have been the diejecta membra of a proper university . Let schools // of philology and modern literature , including the English , of the higher mathematics and physics , of geography and geology , of metaphysical , moral , political , and social science be added-or , in brief ; let a department of philosophy , in its comprehensive import , be added to the schools of law , medicine , and theology , and we have the skeleton of a university complete . We must be content with small beginnings in such a departmen ? for the reasons already given . One reason we have omitted . The sentiment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of learning for its own sake , and the pursuit of study for the satisfaction it brings , and the manhood which it trains , if University professors are to be encouraged by the presence of even a small number of pupils knocking at their door . As long as study is valued for the money or position it brings , and the theory of disciplinary study and of liberal culture is openly scouted in the forum and the market place , and attacked in the newspaper and the review , so long will the true university be unknown among us . We began these papers with no thought of writing a series . But the matter has expanded itself under our hands in a somewhat unmethodical way . We offer our thanks to those readers who have followed us with patient attention to the close .
