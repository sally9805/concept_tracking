txt ART . IX . -1 . Platform of . the Chicago Convention . Public Journals , 30th August . 2 . Letter of General 111/ic Clellan . Ibid. , 9th September . THE spectacle of an opposition waiting patiently during several months for its principles to turn up , would be amusing in times less critical than these . Nor was this the worst . If there might be persons malicious enough to think that the Democratic party could get along very well without principles , all would admit that a candidate was among the necessaries of life . Now , where not only immediate policy , but the very creed which that policy is to embody , is dependent on circumstances , and on circumstances so shifting and doubtful as those of a campaign , it is hard to find a represeiitative man whose name may , in some possible contingency , mean enough , without , in some other equally possible contingency , meaning too much . The problem was to hunt up somebody who , without being anything in particular , might be anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the professed object of the party was to save their country , but which was their country , and which it would be most profitable to save , whether America or Secessia , was a question that Grant or Sherman might answer one way or the other in a single battle . If only somebody or something would tell them whether they were for war or peace ! Thc oracles were dumb , and all summer long they looked anxiously out , like Sister Anne from her tower , for the hero who should rescue unhappy Columbia from the Republican Bluebeard . Did they see a cloud of dust in the direction of Richmond or Atlanta ? Perhaps Grant might be the man , after all , or even Sherman would answer at a pinch . When at last 110 // great man would come along , it was debated whether it would not be better to nominate some one without a record , as it is called , since a nobody was clearly the best exponent of a party that was under the unhappy necessity of being still uncertain whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time was getting short and the public impatience peremptory . " Under which king , be zonian ? Speak , or die ! " The party found it alike inconvenient to do the one or the other , and ended by a compromise which might serve to keep them alive till after election , but which was as far from any distinct utterance as if their mouths were already full of that official pudding which they hope for as the reward of their amphibological patriotism . Since it was not safe to be either for peace or war , they resolved to satisfy every reasonable expectation by being at the same time both and neither . If you are warlike , there is General McClellan ; if pacific , surely you must be suited with Mr. Pendleton ; if neither , the combination of the two makes a tertium quid that is neither one thing nor another . As the politic Frenchman , kissing the foot of St. Peter 's statue ( recast out of a Jupiter ) , while he thus did homage to existing prejudices , hoped that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , so the Chicago Convention compliments the prevailing warlike sentiment of the country with a soldier , but holds the civilian quietly in reserve for the future contingencies of submission . The nomination is a kind of political What-is-it ? and voters are expected , without asking impertinent questions , to pay their money and make their own choice as to the natural history of the animal . Looked at from the Northern side , it is a raven , the bird of carnage , to be sure , but whitewashed and looking as decorously dove-like as it can ; from the Southern , it is a doye , blackened over for the nonce , but letting the olivebranch peep from under its wing . A more delicate matter for a convention , however , even than the selection of candidates , is the framing of a platform for them to stand upon . It was especially delicato for a gathering which represented so many heterogeneous and almost IK stile elements . So incongruous an assemblage has not been // seen since the host of Peter the Hermit , unanimous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th e Holy Land of office . There were War Democrats ready to unite- in peace resolutions , and Peace Democrats eager to move the unanimous nomination of a war candidate . To make the confusion complete , Mr. Franklin Pierce , the dragooner of Kansas , writes a letter in favor of free elections , and the maligners of New England propose a Connecticut Yankee as their favorite nominee . The Convention was a rag-bag of dissent , made up of bits so various in hue and texture that the managers must have been as much puzzled to arrange them in any kind of harmonious pattern , as the thrifty housewife in planning her coverlet out of the parings of twenty years ' dressmaking . All the odds and ends of personal discontent , every shred of private grudge , every resentful rag snipped off by official shears , scraps of Rebel gray and leavings of Union blue , - all had been gathered , as if for the tailoring of Joseph 's coat . That a Hebrew should be chosen to call this motley collection to order was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first carefully removes all marks of previous ownership from the handkerchiefs which find their way to his counter , so the temporary chairman advised his hearers , as a preliminary caution , to surrender their convictions . This , perhaps , was superfluous , for it may be doubted whether anybody present , except Mr. Fernando Wood , ever legally had one , though Captain Rynders must have brought many in his following who richly deserved it . Mr. Belmont , being choseii to represent the Democracy of Mammon , did little more than paraphrase in prose the speech of that fallen financier in another rebellious conclave , as reported by Milton : - " how in safety best we may Compose our present evils , with regard Of what we are and were , dismissing quite All thoughts of war . " But we turn from the momentary elevation of the banker , to follow the arduons labors of the Committee on Resolutions . The single end to be served by the platform they were to coiistruct was that of a bridge over which their candidate might make his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built // as to satisfy the somewhat exacting theory of construction held by the Rebel emissaries at Niagara , while at the same time no apprehensions as to its soundness must be awakened in the loyal voters of the party . The war plank would offend the one , the State-rights plank excite the suspicion of the other . The poor fellow in ? sop , with his two wives , one pulling out the black hairs and the other the white , was not in a more desperate situation than the Committee , - MacHeath between his two doxies , not more embarrassed . The result of their labors was , accordingly , as narrow as the pathway of the faithful into the Mahometan paradise , - so slender , indeed , that Blondin should have been selected as the only candidate who could hope to keep his balance on it , with the torrent of events rushing ever swifter and louder below . It might sustain the somewhat light Unionism and lighter reputation of Mr. Pendleton , but would General McClellan dare to trust its fragile footing , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record , in short , under his arm ? Without these documents , General McClellan is a nobody ; with them , before he can step on a peace platform , he must eat an amount of leek that would have turned the stomach of Ancient Pistol himself . It remained to be seen whether he was more in favor of being President than of his own honor and that of the country . The Resolutions of the Chicago Convention , though they denounce various wrongs and evils , some of them merely imaginary , and all the necessary results of civil war , propose only one thing , - surrender . Disguise it as you will , flavor it as you will , call it what you will , umble-pie is umble-pie , and nothing else . The people instinctively so understood it . They rejected with disgust a plan whose mere proposal took their pusillanimity for granted , and whose acceptance assured their self-contempt . At a moment when the Rebels would be checkmated in another move , we are advised to give them a knight and begin the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what chance of their accepting offers which they rejected with scorn before the war began ? If they are not desperate , why is their interest more intense in the result of our next Presidential election , than even in the campaign at their very doors ? If they were not desperate , would two respectable men like // Messrs . Clay and Holcomb endure the society of George Saunders ? General McClellan himself admitted the righteousness of the war by volunteering in it , and , the war once begun , the only real question has been whether the principle of legitimate authority or the wanton insurrection against it should prevail , - whether we should have for the future a government of opinion or of brute force . When the rebellion began , its leaders had no intention to dissolve the Union , but to reconstruct it , to make the Montgomery Constitution and Jefferson Davis supreme over the whole country , and not over a feeble fragment of it . They knew , as we knew , the weakness of a divided country , and our experience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as to lessen the apprehension on that score , or to make the consciousness of it less pungent in either of the contending sections . Even now , Jefferson Davis is said to be in favor of a confederation between the Free and the Slave States . But what confederation could give us back the power and prestige of the . ld Union ? The experience of Germany surely does not tempt to imitation . And in making overtures for peace , with whom are we to treat ? Talking vaguely about " the South , " " the Confederate States , " or " the Southern people , " does not help the matter ; for the cat under all this meal is always the government at Richmond , men with everything to expect from iiidependence , with much to hope from reconstruction , and sure of nothing but ruin from reunion . And these men , who were arrogant as equals and partners , are to be moderate in dictating tennis as conquerors ! If the people understood less clearly the vital principle which is at hazard in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slavery and State Rights are merely the counters , and that free institutions are the real stake , they might be deluded with the hope of compromise . But there are things that are not subjects of compromise . The honor , the conscience , the very soul of a nation , can not be compromised without ceasing to exist . When you propose to yield a part of them , there is already nothing left to yield . And yet this is all that the party calling itself Democratic , after months of deliberation , after four years in which to study the popular mind , have to offer in the way of policy . It is // neither more nor less than to confess that they have no real faith in popular self-government , for it is to assume that the people have neither common nor moral sense . General McClellan is to be put in command of the national citadel , on condition that he immediately offers to capitulate . To accept the nomination on these terms was to lose , not only his election , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the platform evident , than it was rumored that he would consent to the candidacy , but reject the conditions on which alone it was offered . The singular uniform , half Union-blue and half Confederate-gray , in which it was proposed by the managers at Chicago to array the Democratic party , while it might be no novelty to some camp-followers of the New York delegation familiar with the rules of certain of our public institutions , could hardly be agreeable to one who had worn the livery of his country with distinction . It was the scene of Petruchio and the tailor over again - Gen. MeC . " Why , w ? iat , i ' th ' Devil 's name , tailor , eall'st thou this ? " Committee . " You bid me make it orderly and well , According to the fashion and the time . " Gen. McC . " Marry , I did but , if you be remembered , I did not bid you mar it to the time . " Between the nomination and the acceptance came the taking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vengeance , and suggesting the necessity of turning it , - a sudden cure which should rank among the first in future testimonials to the efficacy of Sherman 's lozenges . Had General McClellan thrust the resolutions away from him with an honest scorn , we should have nothing to say save in commendation . But to accept them with his own interpretation , to put upon them a meaning utterly averse from their plain intention , and from that understanding of them which the journals of his own faction clearly indicated by their exultation or their silence , according as they favored Confederacy or Union , is to prepare a deception for one of the parties to the bargain . In such cases , which is commonly cheated , the- candidate , or the people who vote for him ? If the solemn and deliberate language of resolutions is to be interpreted by contraries , what rule of herineneutics shall we apply to the letter of a candidate ? If the // Convention meant precisely what they did not say , have we any assurance that the aspirant has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may constitute an affirmative ; but surely the affirmation of two contradict6ry propositions by parties to the same bargain assures nothing but misunderstanding . The resolutions were adopted with but four dissenting votes ; their meaning was obvious , and the whole country understood it to be peace on any conditions that would be condescended to at Richmond . If a nation were only a contrivance to protect men in gathering gear , if territory mean only so many acres for the raising of crops , if power be of worth only as a police to prevent or punish crimes against person and property , then peace for the mere sake of peace were the one desirable thing for a people whose only history would be written in its cash-book . But if a nation be a living unity , leaning on the past by tradition , and reaching toward the future by continued aspiration and achievement , - if territory be of value for the raising of men formed to high aims and inspired to noble Qeeds by that common impulse which , springing from a national ideal , gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power be but a gross and earthy bulk till it be ensouled with thought and purpose , and of worth only as the guardian and pro*zioter of truth and justice among men , - then there are misfortunes worse than war and blessings greater than peace . At this moment , not the Democratic party only , but the whole country , longs for peace , and the difference is merely as to the price that shall be paid for it . Shall we pay in degradation , and sue for a cessation of hostilities which would make chaos the rule and order the exception , which would not be peace , but toleration , not the repose of manly security , but the helpless quiet of political death ? Or shall we pay in a little more present suffering , self-sacrifice , and earnbstuess of purpose for a peace that shall be as lasting as honorable , won as it will be by the victory og right over wrong , and resting on the promise of God and the hope of man ? We believe the country has already made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove that a democracy may bave as clear a conception of its interests and duties , as fixed a purpose in defending the one and ful // filling the other , a will as united and prompt , as nave hitherto been supposed to characterize forms of government where the iliterests were more personal and the power less diffused . Fortunately , though some of General McClellan 's indiscreet friends would make the coming election to turn upon his personal quarrel with the Administration , the question at issue between the two parties which seek to shape the policy of the country is one which manifestly transcends all lesser considerations , and must be discussed in the higher atmosphere of principle , by appeals to the reason , and not the passions , of the people . However incongruous with each other in opinion the candidates of the Democratic party may be , in point of respectability they are unexceptionable . It is true , as one of the candidates represents war and the other peace , and " when two men ride on one horse , one must ride behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is to be in the saddle and which on the croup ; but we will take it for granted that General McClellan will have no more delicacy about the opinions of Mr. Pendleton , than he has shown for those of the Convention . Still , we should remember that the General may be imprudent enough to die , *s General Harrison and General Taylor did before him , and that Providence may again make " of our pleasant Vices whips to scourge us . " We shall say nothing of the sectional aspect of the nomination , for we do not believe that what we deemed a pitiful electioneering clamor , when raised against our own candidates four years ago , becomes reasonable argument in opposing those of our adversaries now . The point of interest , then , is simply this : What can General McClellan accomplish for the country which Mr. Lincoln has failed to accomplish ? In what respect would their policies differ ? and , supposing them to differ , which would be most consistent with the honor and permanent well-being of the nation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in nominating him , " the record of his public life was kept in view " by the Convention . This will enable us to define with some certainty the points on which his policy would be likely to differ from that of Mr. Lincoln . He agrees with him , that the war was a matter of necessity , not of choice . He agrees // with him in assuming a right to emancipate slaves as a matter of military expediency , differing only as to the method and extent of its application , - a mere question of judgment . 116 agrees with him as to the propriety of drafting men for the public service , having , indeed , been the first to recommend a draft of men whom he was to command himself . He agrees with him , that it is not only lawful , but politic , to make arrests without the ordinary forms of law where the public safety requires it , and himself both advised and accomplished . the seizure of an entire Legislature . So far there is no essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except that Mr. Lincoln was in a position where he was called on to act with a view to the public welfare , and General McClellan in one where he could express abstract opinions , without the responsibility of trial , to be used hereafter as a part of his " record " for partisan purposes . For example , just after his failure to coerce the State of Virginia , he took occasion to instruct his superiors in their duty , and , among other things , stated his opinion that the war " should not be a war looking to the subjugation of the people of any State , " but " should be against armed forces and political organizations . " The whole question of the right to " coerce a sovereign State " appears to have arisen from a confusion of the relations of a State to its own internal policy and to the general government . But a State is certainly a " political organization , " and , if we understand General McClellan rightly , he would coerce a State , but not the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciates better than its victims would be likely to do . We find here also no diversity in principle between the two men , only that Mr. Lincoln has been compelled to do , while General McClellan has had the easier task of telling us what he would do . After the Peninsular campaign , we can not but think that even the latter would have been inclined to say , with the wisest man that ever spoke in our tongue , " If to do were as easy as to know what t were good to do , chapels had been churches , and poor men 's cottages princes ' palaces . " The single question of policy on which General McClellan differs from Mr. Lincoln , stripped of the conventional phrases in which he drapes it , is Slavery . He can mean nothing else // when he talks of " conciliation and compromise , " of receiving back any State that may choose to return " with a full guaranty of all its constitutional rights . " If it be true that a rose by any other name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a certain species of toadstool that would be none the less disgusting under whatever alias . Compromise and conciliation are both excellent things in their own way , and in the fitting time and place , but right can not be compromised without surrendering it , and to attempt conciliation by showin* the white feather ends , not in reconcilement , but subjection . The combined ignorance of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus as to what had been going on while they were in their cavern would hardly equal that of General McClellan alone as to the political history of the country . In the few months between Mr. Lincoln 's election and the attack on Fort Sumter we tried conciliation in every form , carrying it almost to the verge of ignominy . The Southern leaders would have none of it . They saw in it only a confession of weakness , and were but the more arrogant in their demand of all or nothing . Compromise we tried for three quarters of a century , and it brought us to where we are , for it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. And now that the patient is dying of this drench of lukewarm water , Doctor Sangrado McClellan gravely prescribes another gallon . If that fail to finish him , why , give him a gallon more . We wish it were as easy to restore General McClellan 's army to what it was before the Peninsular campaign , as he seems to think it is to put the country back where it was at the beginning of the war . The war , it is true , was undertaken to assert the sovereignty of the Constitution , but the true cause of quarrel was , not that the South denied the supremacy of that instrument , but that they claimed the sole right to interpret it , and to interpret it in a sense hostile to the true ideal of the country , and the clear interests of the people . But circumstances have changed , and what was at first a struggle to maintain the outward form of our government , has become a contest to preserve the life and assert the supreme will of the nation . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very germinating principle of our nationality was at stake , and that unity of territory was but another name for unity of idea , nay , was impossible without it , and undesirable if it were possible . It was not against the Constitution that the Rebels declared war , but against free institutions ; and if they are beaten , they must submit to the triumph of those institutions . Their only chance of constitutional victory was at the polls . They rejected it , though it was in their grasp , and now it is for us , and not them , to dictate terms . After all the priceless blood they have shed , General McClellan would say to them , " Come back and rule us . " Mr. Lincoln says , " Come back as equals , with every avenue of power open to you that is open to us ; but the advantage which the slaveholding interest wrung from the weakness of the fathers , your own madness has forfeited to the sons . " General McClellan tells us that , if the war had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion to declare when in active service , reconciliation would have been easy . " We suppose he refers to his despatch of July 7th , 1862 , when , having just demonstrated his incapacity in the profession for which he had been educated , he kindly offered to take the civil policy of the country under his direction , expecting , perhaps , to be more successful in a task for which lie was fitted neither by training nor experience . It is true he had already been spokeit of as a possible candidate for the Presidency , and that despatch was probably written to be referred to afterwards as part of the " record " to which he alludes in his recent letter . Indeed , he could have had no other conceivable object in so impertinent a proceeding , for , up to that time , the war had been conducted on the very principles he recommended , nay , was so conducted for six months longer , till it was demonstrated that reconciliation wa* not to be had on those terms , and that victory was incompatible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McClellan calls a radical policy by the necessity of the case . The Rebels themselves insisted on convincing him that his choice was between that and failure . They boasted that slavery was their bulwark and arsenal , that , while every Northern soldier withdrew so much from the productive industry of the Union , every fighting-man at the South could be brought // into the field , so long as the negroes were left to do the work that was to feed and clothe him . Were these negroes property ? The laws of war justified us in appropriating them to our own use . Were they population ? The laws of war equally justified us in appealing to them for aid in a cause which was their own more than it was ours . It was so much the worse for the South that its property was of a kind that could be converted from chattels into men , and from men into soldiers , by the scratch of a pen . The dragon 's teeth were not of our sowing , but , so far from our being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army that sprang from them , it would have been the extreme of weakness and folly not to do it . If there be no provision in the Constitution for emancipating the negroes , neither is there any for taking Richmond ; and we give General McClellan too much credit for intelligence and patriotism to suppose that , if , when he asked for a hundred thousand more men at Harrison 's Bar , he had been told that he could have black ones , he would have refused them . But supposing the very improbable chance of General McClellan 's election to the Presidency , how would he set about his policy of conciliation ? Would lie disarm the colored troops ? In favor of prosecuting the war , as he declares himself to be , this would only necessitate the draft of just so many white ones in their stead . Would he recall the proclamation of freedom ? This would only be to incite a servile insurrection . The people have already suffered too much by General McClellan 's genius for retreat , to follow him in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Rebels are to be appeased by any exhibition of weakness . Like other men , they would take fresh courage from it . Force is the only argument to which they are in a condition to listen , and , like other men , they will yield to it at last , if it prove irresistible . We can not think that General McClellan would wish to go down to posterity as the President who tried to restore the Union by the reenslaving of men who had fought in its defence , and had failed in the attempt . We doubt if lie had any very clear conception of what he meant by conciliation and compromise , except as a gloss to make the unconditional surrender doctrine of the Cliicago Convention a little less odious . If he meant more , if he // hoped to gain political strength by an appeal to the old proslavery prejudices of the country , he merely shows the same unfortunate unconsciousness of the passage of time , and the changes it brings with it , that kept him in the trenches at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes that the IRebels would accept from him what they rejected with contempt when offered by Mr. Lincoln , - that they would do in compliment to him what they refused to do from the interest of self-preservation . If they did , it would simply prove that they were in a condition to submit to terms , and not to dictate them . If they listened to his advances , their cause must be so hopeless that it would be a betrayal of his trust to make them . If they were obstinate , he would be left with the same war on his hands which has forced Mr. Lincoln into all his measures , and which would not be less exacting on himself . As a peace candidate he might solicit votes with some show of reason , but on a war platform we see no good reason for displacing Mr. Lincoln in his favor except on personal grounds ; and we fear that our campaigns would hardly be conducted with vigor under a President whom the people should have invested with the office by way of poultice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Presidential chair , with a country behind him insisting on a re-establishment of the Union , and a rebellion before him deaf to all offers from a government that faltered in its purposes , we do not see what form of conciliation he would hit upon by which to persuade a refractory * political organization , " except that prt*ctised by Hood 's butcher when he was advised to try it on a drove of sheep . " He seized upon the foremost wether , - And hugged and lugged and tugged him neck and crop , Just nolens volens through the open shop ( If tails came off he did not care a feather ) ; Then , walking to the door and smiling grim , He rubbed his forehead and his sleeve together , - There I I v* conciliated him ! ' " It is idle , however , to think of allaying angry feeling or appeasing resentment while the war lasts , and idler to hope for any permanent settlement , except in the complete subjugation of the rebellion . There are persons who profess to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to be willing that we should have immediate experience of the thing , by receiving back the Rebels on their own conditions . Mr. Lincoln has already proclaimed an amnesty wide enough to satisfy the demands of the most exacting humanity , and they must reckon on a singular stupidity in thek ' hearers who impute ferocious designs to a man who can not nerve his mind to the shooting of a deserter or the hanging of a spy . Mr. Lincoln , in our judgment , has shown from the first the considerate wisdom of a practical statesman . If he has been sometimes slow in making up his mind , it has saved him the necessity of being hasty to change it when once made up , and he has waited till the gradual movement of the popular sentiment should help him to his conclusions and sustain him in them . To be moderate and unimpassioned in revolutionary times that kindle natures of more flimsy texture to a blaze , may not be a romantic quality , but it is a rare one , and goes with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reared . Mr. Lincoln is a longheaded and long-purposed man , who knows when he is ready , - a secret General McClellan never learned . That he should be accused of playing Cromwell by the Opposition , and reproached with not being Cromwellian enough by the more ardent of his own supporters , is proof enough that his action has been of that firm but deliberate temper best suited to troublous times and to constitutional precedents . One of these accusations is the unworthy fetch of a party at a loss for argument , and the other springs from that exaggerated notion of the power of some exceptional characters upon events which Carlyle has made fashionable , but which was never even approximately true except in times when there was no such thing as public opinion , and of which there is no record personal enough to assure us what we are to believe . A more sincere man than Cromwell never lived , yet they know little of his history who do not know that his policy was forced to trim between Independents and Presbyterians , and . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to make England dreaded without satisfying either . We have seen no reason to change our opinion of Mr. Lincoln since his wary scrupulousness won him the applause of one party , or his decided action , when he was at last // convinced of its necessity , made him the momentary idol of the other . We will not call him a great man , for over-hasty praise is too apt to sour at last into satire , and greatness i*ay be trusted safely to history and the future ; but an honest one we believe him to be , and with no aim save to repair the glory and greatness of his country . But fortunately it is no trial of the personal merits of opposing candidates on which the next election is to pronounce a verdict . The men set up by the tWo parties represent principles utterly antagonistic and so far-reaching in their consequences that all personal considerations and contemporary squabbles become as contemptible in appearance as they always are in reality . However General McClellan may equivocate and strive to hide himself in a cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberately and unanimously adopted the Chicago Platform is the practical embodiment of the principles contained in it . By ignoring the platform , he seems , it is true , to nominate himself ; but this , though it may be good evidence of his own presumption , affords no tittle of proof that he could have been successful at Chicago without some distinct previous pledges of what his policy would be . If no such pledges were given , then the Convention nominated him with a clear persuasion that he was the sort of timber out of which tools are made . If they were not given , does not the acceptance of the nomination under false pretences imply a certain sacrifice of personal honor ? And will the honor of the country be safe in the hands of a man who is careless of his own ? General McClellan 's election will be understood by the South and by the whole country as an acknowledgment of the right of secession , - an acknowledgment which will resolve the United States into an association for insurance against any risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln , on the other hand , is the exponent of principles vital to our peace , dignity , and renown , - of all that can save America from becoming Mexico , and insure popular freedom for centuries to come . It is the merest electioneering trick to say that the war has been turned from its original intention , as if this implied that a cheat had thereby been put upon the country . The truth is , // that the popular understanding has been gradually enlightened as to the real causes of the war , and , in consequence of that enlightenment , a purpose has grown up , defining itself slowly into clearer consciousness , to finish the war in the only way that will keep it finished , by rooting out the evil principle from which it sprang . The country has been convinced that a settlement which should stop short of this would be nothing more than a truce favorable only to the weaker party in the struggle , to the very criminals who forced it upon us . The single question is , Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McClellan 's election insures the one , Mr. Lincoln 's gives us our only chance of the other . It is Slavery , and not the Southern people , that is our enemy ; we must conquer this to be at peace with them . With the relations of the several States of the Rebel Confederacy to the Richmond government , we have nothing to do ; but to say , that , after being beaten as foreign enemies , they are to resume their previous relations to our own government as if nothing had happened , seems to us a manifest absurdity . From whom would General McClellan , if elected under his plan of conciliation , exact the penalties of rebellion ? The States can not be punished , and the only merciful way in which we can reach the real criminals is by that very policy of emancipation whose efficacy is proved by the bitter opposition of all the allies of the Rebellion in the North . This is a punishment which will not affect the independence of individual States , which will improve the condition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove the rock of offence from the pathway of democratic institutions . So long as slavery is left , there is antipathy between the two halves of the country , and the recurrence of actual war will be only a question of time . It is the nature of evil to be aggressive . Without moral force in itself , it is driven , by the necessity of things , to seek material props . It can not make peace with truth , if it would . Good , on the other hand , is by its very nature peaceful . Strong in itself , strong in the will of God and the sympathy of man , its conquests are silent and beneficent as those of summer , warming into life , and bringing to blossom and fruitage , whatever is wholesome in men and the institutions of men .
