txt ART . X. -1 . Ninety Days ' Worth of Europe . By EDwARD E. HALE . Boston : Walker , Wise , &amp; Co. 1861. 2 . Notes of Travel and Study in Ito ty . By CHARLES ELIOT NORTON . Boston : Ticknor and Fields . 1860 . WE can not join in Mr. Hale 's general contempt for books of travel ; for we hold it to be the duty of an educated traveller , both to his friends and the public , to give them the results of his observation . Each sees the wonderful conglomerate , termed Europe , from a different point of view . Each tourist , so far as he relates his genuine experience , opens a window that looks out upon a different landscape , though he may go over only the beaten and well-trodden path so familiar now to every reading American . And those first experiences are what we want . The traveller can not , after a little interval , recall any but the most general impressions . He is glad to recur to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the route which he took , and of the various dates , name sofplaces , and minute objects of interest , which at the time seemed so fresh and remarkable that he considered them as forever imprinted upon his memory . Every one wishes to hear his friend discourse upon his L aveis abroad . If he has already taken 45* // the journey himself , he is pleased to compare another s Views and adventures with his own ; and if he has not crossed the ocean , he expects to at some time or other . That Europe is for Americans , seems to be the prevalent notion . Every one either has been abroad , or means to go if he can . And every one is right . He who has the means and the leisure to make a few months ' tour in Europe , and fails to avail himself of it , may be set down as the wisest of philosophers or the dullest of dolts . Each book of travels , then , is to stand upon its own merits , and has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its general right is legitimate , and whether it deserves contempt or not is a question in reserve . There is , indeed , one class of such books which deserves contempt , and will receive it without fail , - that in which the writer is so full of himself , and so preoccupied with antecedent opinions , that he sees nothing and hears nothing except the sights and the sounds within his own little sphere . We remember to have looked over a book of this sort , by a Romau Catholic priest , in which the reader was treated , not to Europe , but to the personal prejudices of the reverend gentleman in Europe . His verdict of London was , that it " was a vast and vicious city ; Mammon its king , Venus its queen , and Bacchus its clown . " He reports all the Protestant chapels empty , and all the Catholic churches full without exception . Alas for such a traveller , who is enveloped in his own cloud ! If a country is of heretical faith , it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs . There is a veil over mountain , lake , field , and city . The good iRomanist found the " H6tel des Bergues , " one of the very best in Europe , " inhospitable and uncomfortable . " But it happened to be in Geneva , where , to the reproach of the city , there were actually " no beggars to be seen . " A military parade which he witnessed in that city on a Sunday , seems to have been the first that he had witnessed in any European city . And he philosophically accounts for that particular day 's having been selected , by supposing " that the people were too busy on week-days in getting gain , " to spend time in military evolutions . He has not a word in condemnation for the Sunday public amusements and military paradcs so // universal in all the Catholic cities of the Continent . Mont Blanc has some charms , for that is in Catholic Savoy ; but the Lake of Geneva stands no chance of recognition , being so tainted with the dark stain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water , a medium-sized pond , said to be very furious when excited . " He sums up all by saying , that there " was nothing in , on , or about the lake that was either striking , fascinating , or even attractive . " The book of travels written under such an impulse as this is worthy only of contempt . He who is thus wrapped up in his own national , political , social , and religious prejudices , has nothing to write that we care to read . He has not really travelled abroad ; he fancied that he was seeing something of Europe , but made a grand mistake , for he was at home all the while . Yet we would protest against the unreasonable expectations entertained of most travellers . How much is demanded of them can be realized only by him who has been saved from perils abroad , to encounter the perils at home of curious questioners . What great things a few weeks ' travel are supposed to do for a person ! He is expected to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have fathomed all foreign policies ; to have become a connoisseur in art , so as to give a verdict upon all the great masters ; to pronounce upon all matters concerning education , religion , and government ; and to have seen all the great personages , especially all the kings and queens . The pussy-cat in the nursery-rhyme was asked where she had been , and the well-known answer was , " I have been to London to see the queen . " This is equally expected of all the pussy 's successors . There is something admirable in this instinctive persistency of expectation from the traveller . Still we hope that it is not all an idle notion in regard to the good often effected by a change of place , of surroundings , of modes of life , companions , and scenes . It is something to make a change . Dr. Kane describes the " rolling over of the iceberg in long , oscillating curves , " and the " rising of myriads of birds , which had roosted unseen in its clefts , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their unstable resting-place . " The unclean nests are dislodged ; the clean and freshly washed surface is // turned up to the light , and glistens , a clear mirror of the heavens . But a man carries " within him " his own standard , and it is of some consequence what that is , - what he has been used to at home . The name of Greenland , given to that country of rock , ice , and snow , may seem to us to have been given lucus a non lucendo , because there is hardly a green spot to be seen . But Crantz , the most exact of the missionary authorities , says that " it got the name from the Norsemen , because it was so much greener than Iceland . " When a man calls names and applies epithets , it is well to see what is the standard of measurement in his mind . The Ninety Days ' Worth of Europe is an individual but not narrow view . It recalls most vividly the faded impressions of the tourist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It gives what the author felt , saw , experienced , and encountered . It makes no pretension to connoisseurship in art , or insight into all the philosophy of manners , education , morals , and religion , but talks right on of the things that were beheld with the strongest interest by himself , so that the reader seems to be holding a pleasant conversation with the traveller , and listening to his freshest word . We regret , indeed , that Mr. Hale has not embodied in this book the letters which be wrote concerning ecclesiastical and religious life in the countries which he visited . Even with this addition , the book would not have been too large ; and Those of his friends who have not had access to these papers may rightly demand of the clergyman what he has to say upon subjects which , from his profession as a clergyman , he may be supposed to have regarded with no uninterested eye . We have read those " Sundays in Europe , " and we say that one does not get the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book bearing that title . But he does get a most lifelike picture of the ordinary route of travel from England to Italy . A short run was made through Ireland , and it is the best miniature sketch of Ireland that we have ever seen . The humor of the old country distils through every pore . The whole book is characterized by what may be called common sense . The writer has no mdcscribablo rapture : , but intelligent appreciation ; and where // he can not describe , he keeps silent . He illustrates size , distance , height , and sensible qualities by well-known objects . He brings , as the traveller ought , so much of Europe home with him , and the reader also can make himself at home . His general method of seeing is admirably expressed in the account he gives of himself : " You go first , my dear Miss Camel 's Hair , to wash in your general lights and shades ; you go afterwards to put on the drier color which makes your picture . " He tells what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is expected of him . Read the following account of the topography of Rome , and see how an eye guided by mother-wit looks at the Eternal City . " From the survey from the top of the Capitol Tower I have learned what no map ever told me , and what no traveller ever condescended to mention ,  --  what was the system of the change of residence from old Rome to new Rome , which may be called indeed , perfectly literally , the decline of Rome . The old chain of hills , excepting Janiculum , which is trans Tiberim , ran across a neck of meadow left by the Tiber , quite as the uplands on which Northampton stands leave the meadow between them and the Connecticut . Romulus , Ancus Martius , and the rest of those gentry , planted their people on these hills ; built the Cloaca Maxima to drain the ponds between them ; and , in short , provided , ns no Holy Father has done since , against this malaria , which is the real Attila which is to destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that left by the bend above the old Northampton Ox Bow , was left for Campus Martius , Field of the Equites , and occasionally such out-door theatricals as need large space ; and when Rome wanted to enlarge , it enlarged on the country side , toward the Alban Hills . Of this I had not meant to say so much ; but that the view from the Capitol instantly showed that , in fifteen hundred years , the same thing has happened as at our Washington in sixty . You know that General Washington and his commissioners meant that our Washington should be on the real front of the Capitol , not at its back , as it is now . That admirable high land which stretches towards the Congressional burying-ground and the NavyYard was their place for a city ; but that being held high by speculators , the part of Pennsylvania Avenue which was first built upon was the swamp between the Capitol and the White House . Just that thing has happened here . First one C*esar and another , with Palatium on the Palatine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , monopolized the hills ; then any number of middle-aged rascals followed their example . There was nobody in particular to prevent squatting ' on // these great Campus Martins commons , which probably came to be regarded as a sort of Back Bay ; and , in process of ungoverned centuries , Rome has got squeezed into the meanest set of narrow streets , wholly without plan , down on this low land , where the lower stories of their houses are semi-occasionally inundated by the Tiber , and where malaria makes itself at home . All this you see from the Capitol , looking west and north on modera Rome , south and east on the old line of hills , of which the Capitoline was a projecting spur . Northwest of you , on the other side of the river , are St. Peter 's and the Castle Angelo . Turn your back on them , and close in front is the Forum , stretching along to the Coliseum , flanked on one side by the ruins of Caesar 's Palace , and on another by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The distant panorama is superb ; and , since I have seen all this , I feel that I have seen , and in a measure understand Rome . " - pp. 13* - 137 . Mr. Hale gives us plain , natural , homely , and characteristic impressions of the works of art in galleries and churches . He does not pretend to render an artistic verdict , and to judge ex cathedra , but expresses his own individual views , He affirms that " there is no difficulty nor suspicion about the rank of the acknowledged great artists . " He picks out his own gems without catalogue , and finds that he does not vary much from the acknowledged standard . We are glad of this corroboration of what we had found true in our own experience , but had not the same boldness to declare . The different schools of art are readily made out , and the best works of each school ascertained , without a special initiation into the mysteries of art . To recognize true poetry , one need not be technically a poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sculpture , one need not be an artist . Mr. Hale says of Mr. Story 's " Cleopatra " : - " Till I saw it , I was dissatisfied with the work of the modern sculptors , almost without exception . If they could do nothing better than reproduce the antique mythology for me , I had a great deal rather have the classical representations of the antique than their reproductions If the nineteenth century has nothing else to say than Praxiteles said , or Phidias , let us have the remaks of Phidias undigested and unabridged . I always hated abridgments , and distrusted translations . I had rather read Homer 's Homer than Pope 's ; I had rather read Theocritus 's Eclogues ' than Gay 's ; and so I had rather see the Faun ' of Praxiteles than Canova 's Venus . ' All this I said steadily of all the modern sculpture that I saw , till I came to Mr. Story 's study . I say it still . // But there I was willing to own - and most glad , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to create a fine art of its own in sculpture , with methods of its own , for purposes of its own . There is no need of comparing these with the antique ; we do not compare Tennyson 's King Arthur ' with the Odyssey . ' But , without comparison , one can say , ( and how gladly one does say it ! ) 1-Jere is a work which belongs to our time , - to our conception of history , to our conception of character , to what we know of the unfolding of history and of character ; and it is a study wholly different , in its detail and in its result , from what the study of the Grecian schools , or of any schools but those of the nineteentli century , would or could have elaborated . ' " - pp. 142 , 143 . This is well expressed , except that the writer has allowed himself to use the wrong auxiliary , " had , " to signify his preference . We doubt whethQr the privilege of his familiar and conversational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitary example . In a single sentence , in another place , he characterizes aptly the difference between modern and antique statuary : " There is , in the antiques , a quality of energy ( Mp7eta ) , - of possible action , motion , desire of act and motive , - which the modern statues do not have . " We think , however , that his early lingerings in the Athen*um ought to have led him to make an exception in favor of Crawford 's Orpheus , which has no deficiency of the kind referred to , and which has always givei* us this impression of a lifelike , forth-putting energy . In speaking . of Rubens , he has one sentence which condenses a volume of criticism in regard to that artist* " Enthusiast as I am about IRubens , I would not have one of his sacred pictures in our church , if either of the Leopolds would give me one . No , not the Descent from the Cross ' itself , I believe ; though I possibly should make an exception for that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the epithet " lovely , " it seems to us , in speaking of Rubens . He constrains our admiration of his power , for he is as fertile , as unbounded , as free and joyous in his strokes , as Nature herself . He leads a wild , ditliyrambic dance , and the ordinary proprieties and niceties are disregarded . He has no prettinesses , no beauties , no sentimental graces , and he seems to ignore wholly the ordinary type of female loveliness . His own portrait , in // the altar-piece at Antwerp , gives a good idea of the artist as well as of the man . There we see the straightforward , powerful right-arm , each motion of which could bring out whole features , and place upon the canvas lines not to be altered or erased . His eye is clear , his attitude erect and strong , and he seems to be in the act of stepping forward , self-collected , eager , sure of his end . So almost all of the figures in his paintings are in motion , doing something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seems to choose , as the moment for representation , that of the most intense concentration of effort and living power . He never falls below this , which is the more wonderful , as he has generally taken subjects that are almost superhuman in the intensity of action , requiring an absolutely fearful vigor of expression : crucifixions in great variety ; Christ raised to and taken down from the cross ; Christ pierced with the spear ; Peter crucified with head downward ; Christ scourged and John beheaded ; virgins seized , blows inflicted , and every variety of torture experienced . In one of his Magdalens at the cross , there is , indeed , something approaching to the lovely ; there is a touching beauty of expression , as she takes hold of the bleeding feet , rests them upon her shoulder swept by the golden hair , and looks up at the soldier who pierces the side with his spear , which exhibits something of the love of the forgiven soul . Yet it is true that " he never went to the root of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he is always on the plane of natural power . He is strong enough to carry away the gates of the city upon his shoulder , but he does not build up that higher city " not made with hands . " There is not that which exalts , purifies , interpenetrates as with an ethereal beauty , drawing the beholder toward higher spheres of spiritual joy . He is a powerful , human , natural son of earth , and can not be truly called a sacred artist . The verdict which Mr. Hale pronounces we consider eminently just . In our author 's estimate of St. Peter 's , we find a complete refutation of the canon of criticism laid down by the ilomish priest already spoken of , who said , that " no one can truly appreciate the grandeur , beauty , and magnificence of St. Peter 's , unless he is a Catholic . " To be catholic and to be c* // Catholic are very different things . The Unitarian clergyman writes thus of the cathedral - " In all the grandeur - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brilliancy , not glaring , but vivid and enlivening , constantly comes over you ; and , in looking back , it is with the feeling that you have been in a blaze of glory I was wholly at home there from the first . I felt that I belonged to the church , and that it belonged to me ; that I had entire rights of my own there ; and that it was a temple by no means the special property of this fag-end of Christendom which is burrowing here at Rome . I do not think that I had any sense of wonder about it , nor of disgust with the little Romanisms , - the St. Peter 's toes , and so on . It is , and it is right , ' was rather my idea all along ; glad that Michel Angelo had planned it , and glad that anybody had built it . I was not and am not worried by thought of the taxes which paid for it , nor of what the stones might have been sold for , nor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been given to the poor . Indeed , the interior of St. Peter 's has been ( except the Vatican sculptures ) the most satisfactory thing in Rome . " - pp. 128 - 130 . We may dissent from this view , but we must at least give it the credit of unlimited catholicity and freedom from any conventional bias . We are disposed to wonder that St. Peter 's should have won from our author such a verdict ; and , for ourselves , we should agree with Mr. Norton 's estimate , that " It belongs to the architecture of the intellect , not to that of the imagination , - its chief feature is its size , not its design . St. Peter 's is contemporaneous with the Reformation ; and the character of the religion of the Papal court at that time is well perpetuated in a church built less as a place of worship than as a magnificent theatre for the splendid displays of Papal ceremonials . " The book of " Travel and Study in Italy , " from which we have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Mr. Hale 's , and is no less excellent in its kind . It is the record of thought , study , and mature contemplation . It is not a running comment of the passing traveller , as he strives to see the most that he can in a limited period of time ; but the ripe fruit of a studious , artistic , and cultivated mind and heart , - the result of observations , comparisons , and impressions , through years of familiar and genial converse with // the objects described , and the related topics of art , history , and social life in their universal bearings . We do not know a book which gives such an interior view of art , worship , society , life , ecclesiasticism , and the moral influence of external institutions , as this presents with regard to Italy . It is as impersonal and aesthetic , as Mr. Hale 's is individual and impressional . They may be taken as the representatives of entirely opposite methods of relating one 's travels , and yet each is good of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight-seer , who gives his off-hand sketch with all its personal details of experience , so pleasant to listen to when a friend narrates them , while the other is full of careful and scholarlike dissertation upon the great themes of religion , morals , government , and social institutions , as influenced by art , and influencing it in turn . The whole tone is American in the highest and truest sense , but nowhere is there an offensive Americanism . Mr. Norton traces the decline of art as the religious and truly Christian life ebbed away , leaving only luxury , dilettanteism , artificiality , and imitation . " The utter sterility and impotence of mind , " he says , " which have long been and are still conspicuous at Rome , the deadness of the Roman imagination , the absence of all intellectual energy in literature and in art , are the necessary result of the political and moral servitude under which the Romans exist . Where the exercise of the privileges of thought is dangerous , the power of expression soon ceases . For a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ external semblance of originality may remain , and mechanical facility of execution may conceal the absence of real life ; but by degrees the very semblance disappears , and facility of execution degenerates into a mere trick of the hand . The Roman artists of the present time have not , in general , the capacity even of good copyists . They can mix colors , and can polish marble , but they are neither painters nor sculptors . " - pp. 292 , 293 . There is one minor coincidence in these two books of travel not a little curious . Each gives us a description of the same " Shakespearian drama , " as performed at Antwerp and at Naples . Mr. Hale witnessed at Antwerp a comic opera , called Le Songe d'une Nuit d'Et6* . " It has nothing about Midsummer Night 's Dream ' in it , " he goes on to say , " but // introduces Williiim Shukspe*r , Queen Elizabeth , Sir John Falstaff , and Lord Latimer , entangled in the most absurd plot . The second act was at Richmond Terrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boat to the scene of action . " Mr. Norton went to see , at Naples , Shakespeare , Ballo in Quatro Parti , and it is essentially the same drama , wherein Falstaff figures as the guardian of the Royal Park at " Richemart . " Truly , in some shape or other Shakespeare seems present everywhere ; though here , we confess , rather as nominis umbra than as anything real . Well may Mr. Norton add , " This is fame . " Books of travel , like these before us , are valuable , as affording points of comparison and means of testing one 's own estimates and judgments . They keep open great questions of universal and purely human interest , and enable one to consider his own verdicts , and modify his own conclusions . Some of these questions we wish , before we close , to pass in review , and to state the general impressions which have been made upon us in reading books of European travel , and considering our intimate and growing relations with the European world . We deem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the minutke of travelled experience , that the difference of estimate in regard to man 's nature and position in the Old World and the New , is radical , and not superficial . There man is a ward under guardianship , a pupil under discipline at school , a pauper to be cared for , a vagabond to be put in the pound , a thing to be looked after and watched ; but not a man who can take care of himself , provide for his own safety and interests , and get his own living generally . Accustomed as we are to do our own governing in church and state , we are hardly aware what a position we here assume , as compared with the nations upon the European continent , blessed as they are with paternal governments to further their political well-being , and with maternal churches to care for their souls . That we can govern ourselves with no greater amount of loss , friction , and insanity than we witness , is certainly a great fact , and can not be overestimated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commonplace of rhetoric , but it is the real miracle of the present age . The idea that Toni , Dick , and Harry // are men , real men , and as such should have the responsibilities of men , and look after their own affairs , and settle all their own accounts , according to their own views of justice , good sense , and propriety , is foreign to the whole constitution of government , society , and religion in the Old World . Government is there a power over the people , and not the instrument of its will . Churches , schools , and legislatures ( where they exist ) are state machines , and speak and do what the " powers that be " ordain . That the child , in beginning to walk alone , should occasionally stumble , and sometimes have contusions upon his head , and black and blue spots here and there , is not surprising or very alarming . The great thing is , that he is learning how to use his own feet , and to walk somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first , - not so well or so rapidly as when his father or mother holds him by the hands ; but he is gaining strength , the capacity of selfbalancing , the faculty of locomotion , and , on the whole , general ability to keep himself from falling down stairs , and from otherwise mutilating his person by fire , water , steel , or any dangerous implement . The work is not done in a day , but it is done at last , and that by virtue of trying . The theory of authority and prescription has no belief in man 's walking alone ; he is made to be carried in the arms , or at least to stand in a standing-stool , with a few playthings in front to amuse him . After a while the poor thing , not knowing what to do with his superfluous strength and animal spirits , proceeds to kick away some of the slats of his cage , or , climbing to the top , as might be expected , comes down upon the outside with a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious parents that they at once contrive some higher enclosure , take away all rails that may serve as steps , and provide louder rattles , and a greater abundance of playthings . Then , when the poor thing becomes dwarfed , and has the rickets , or crooked legs , or some other monstrosity of development , they appeal to this to prove how necessary it is to protect and keep in the poor invalid weakling . Yes , the government provides churches , schools , police , galleries of art , public gardens , theatres , and amusements , - and what more would you have ? Only the privilege , we answer , to provide for themselves , to think and act // as men , to walk on their own feet , and to do business on their own account . In the Old World you are taken care of very nicely . Enter a railroad carriage and they lock you in , lest you should take a fancy to alight with a broken leg or crown . Take up a newspaper , and you will read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Go to the theatre , and you will witness such performances as the authorities approbate . Happy man , why not be contented with that which the gods bestow , without any anxiety upon your part ? Why , in France the government is so thoughtftil and considerate as to place a gendarme at the ticket-office of the railroad station to see that you have the right change given back to you . Paternal government , to be sure ! The next moment , you may , if you are a citizen , be drafted into the army , and sent , whether you will or not , to fight for the Italians or against them , for the Austrians or against them , - it is none of your business which , - the paternal powers take that care also off your mind . Here , in the least as in the greatest things , a man must look out for himself , help himself , and blame himself alone , if he come to any harm . Sometimes , when we see how stupidly we look out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own highest good , we are inclined to ask for something or somebody to do for us what we will not do for ourselves . A small contribution yearly from each inhabitant of any city might establish as good a free library , as good a course of scientific and literary instruction , as good a gallery of art , as is needed for general cultivation and amusement . Petty localisms and sectarianisms swallow up our time , our money , and our zeal . It should shame us to have , anywhere upon the face of the earth , any king or any government doing more for the people than we are doing for ourselves as social beings . Another point of importance is the influence of our country . When we hear anything said of our influence as a nation , we set it down as another of the commonplace boasts of a conceited rhetoric . But it is a sober and real fact , nevertheless , that our very existence as a people is now a vital and operating influence in the countries of the Old World , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement . There is the idea of a free country where the white man controls his own property , and is the disposer of his own time , means , and talents , - where one man is as good as another , and where the tools are all ready for him who knows how to use them . This idea gains vastly in power from its dwelling in the imagination almost exclusively , with small basis of actual knowledge . Hence we find very industrious efforts on the part of governments in the Old World , to present the worst side of our social condition and history ,  --  to spread abroad the knowledge of riots , murders , accidents , and crimes , which our newspapers so sedulously exaggerate , echo , and re-echo . The European press would gladly have us believed to be a people exclusively given to slave-buying , filibustering , and general commotion , - to cheating immigrants , and putting foreigners under a ban . But , as Falstaff says , " instinct is a great thing . " The people have an instinctive feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as for the most part " bosh and lies . " To be known as a citizen of the United States is a passport to the people everywhere . An Englishman and an American are looked upon with very different eyes . The English guinea secures a vast deal of outward respect and attention , but a certain halo surrounds the American , which secures something better than service , and that is confidence and trust . The servants , the hackmen , the porters , if you are an American , find at once some human bond of connection . Some question is asked about this and the other place in America . The hackman in England has some brother , or cousin , or neighbor in your country ; the porter wishes , as he lifts up your luggage , that he was where those trunks came from , - the Frenchman cries out " Vive la ll*pub1ique ! " - the soldier , as he shows you over the castle , breathes forth his sense of oppression and aristocratic restriction , - the Italian coachman curses aloud both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and again , and tells you that the day of reckoning is coming ; - and so , everywhere , in the heart of the common people , is this one dream of a free and democratic republic , an " island of the blest , " " fortunate fields beyond the Atlantic main , " where man is man , and not // an appendage to the state . Thus truly do we live not for ourselves alone ; and to send a cannon to Sardinia , or a shipload of grain to Ireland , and to liberate a Martin Koszta from the gripe of Austria , may be little things in themselves , but as symbols they are of great account . They are short texts , but there is a very long sermon preached from them . All that Americans do stands for something infinitely beyond the literal fact itself , - for the deepest longings and the most enthusiastic dreams of human souls . And we should think of this in our narrow systems of policy , our oppressive enactments , and our selfish rule . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passing away of the age of ecclesiasticism , and the transferring of spiritual energies , of thought and effort , to the present needs , the life , and the well-being of humanity . It is only as we look at outward , material embodiments that we can gain some estimate of the change that is taking place . Once London was a city of abbeys , convents , and churches . To every three acres of ground there was formerly a church , chapel , abbey , or shrine . The period of ecclesiastical rule has gone by , though , as a renmant of the old time , some of the vestries of London parishes have streets , lamps , and municipal privileges to look after , and noblemen take a pride in being members of these corporate bodies . It is worthy of note how the churches themselves feel that their day is over , unless they embody in themselves the rising spirit of the age . They establish , in England , not only Sunday schools , and free sittings , but day schools , ragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ragged school is maintained in connection with Dr. Camming 's congregation , in Crown Court , London , with a total attendance , including day and evening scholars , of two hundred and seventy-seven children . Connected also with the society is a mothers ' meeting to instruct and aid in sewing , mending , cutting out dresses , and managing children ; and to these are added a dormitory and a dispensary . Thus the germ of a broad Christian humanity is taking the place of the exclusive monastery . The kingdom of God is practically seen to be something more than meat and drink for the few , and to consist in love and right doing , - right doing both to bodies // and souls , - right doing to the poor , the outcast , and the depraved . On the Continent there are not wanting similar signs of the decline of ecelesiasticism . The place in Constance where John Huss was tried and condemned is now a warehouse ; a monastery in the Catholic Canton of Valais , in Switzerland , has become an institution for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany or France where there is not some church or convent turned into store-house or wine-vault . In Rouen , the seat of ancient ecclesiastical splendor , there are several strong , old stone buildings , which once were thronged by devout worshippers , and now are tenanted by their corpses in joint occupation with casks of Cognac brandy and famous Burgundy . Wherever ecelesiasticism exists at the present day , with its exclusive privileges , it seems to reserve for itself that of illiberality and meanness . Why is it that it should indulge in that contemptible narrowness of manifestation , which , if exhibited anywhere else , would at once receive its due of reproach ? Is it not amenable to the great human laws , and is not the day gone by when it had its own tribunal , and it s own packed jury , without regard to the opinion of the world ? In England , the exception to the liberality shown in throwing open museums , scientific collections , and objects of art , without cost or with only a nominal fee , is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shilling is requisite - or rather shillings are needed - to behold the monuments and shrines of the fathers ; to unlock the chapels ; to disclose the crypts ; to visit any but the most public part of the cathedrals . To go over St. Paul 's or Westminster Abbey costs nearly a dollar . It was the Papal government alone , that Divine successor of the Apostles , which forbade casts to be taken of the bas-reliefs of the Arch of Titus and other works of art , for the fitting up and adornment of the Crystal Palace at Sydenham . The Pope and his court make a trade of the sanctities of art and religion , and , like jealous hucksters , will admit of no interference with their line of business . They have a monopoly in the premises , and regard them as their specialty . So too in Antwerp , the grand altar-piece of " The Descent from the Cross , " which , if it were in the place // where it belongs , could be seen of all , gratis , is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We suppose that so many travellers are continually pressing to see it , that there is no time to perform this work ; and so , year after year , it remains in that little side-room , where it brings in so good a revenue . All travellers report the picture as being there to be cleansed . And it was certainly there four years ago . In a church at Cologne they have another " dodge " to extract the franc from the admirers of Rubens . There is an altar-piece of that artist , " Peter crucified with his Head downward . " Facing you , as you stand before the altar , is a painting which you suppose the genuine masterpiece ; but not at all , , - it is only a literal copy . The touch of bright silver on the palm causes the whole thing to swing round , and now half an eye shows which is the true picture and which the counterfeit . The reverent worshippers see the feeble copy ; the profane worldling with his silver key unlocks the reality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church ? One can almost hear the ardent Apostle exclaim , " Thy money perish with thee , ' thou who makest a trade in the holy sanctities of religion and art ! " This may seem a small matter , but it has a characteristic and almost symbolic meaning . It does not stand by itself , but is indicative of that want of true feeling in art and its relations to religion so well described in the " Notes of Travel and Study . " We pass willingly from this painful subject to impressions made by the two leading nations of Europe , - England and France . Each nation is represented by its capital . To see London before going to Paris is one thing ; to see it after that visit is another . After New York or Liverpool it is glorious ; but after Paris its lustres fade . Its architecture is typical of comfort , it may be , but is heavy , and without grace , as contrasted with French lightness and elegance . In reference to this point , it is a satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one 's own . Mr. Leslie , in his Autobiography , says - " How generally dinj , low , and tasteless do the houses of London appear on a return from 1*aris ! How heavy and cumbrous where ornament is attempted either on house or shop-fronts ! And how disagreeable to the eye is the dirty drab that so much prevails in London , // and which , under the name of stone-color , so soon degenerates , by the aid of the smoke , into the color of mud ! In Paris you see pure white or gray ; and where tints are used , which is always sparingly , pale reds , blues , yellows , or greens ; but I never observed drabs . " The appearance of each capital symbolizes the national characteristics . The English love solidity , comfort , strength , individuality ; the French idolize la gloire , that is , the shining , splendid , dazzling , external , without too rigid scrutiny of the interior quality . The English common-sense and practical stolidity subordinate to themselves every tendency to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and always aiming at effect . This is seen in their arts , their manners , their dress , and their living . They love showy and dazzling colors , and are prone to excessive imitation . They have a more subdued standard for the articles manufactured for the English and American market , than for those made for home consumption . Loving as they do la gloire , they have still the first Napoleon for their idol ; the people at large do not believe he was ever beaten in battle ; and those who know it to be the fact burn to wipe off the old score against Austria and England . The form of Napoleon is sculptured and painted everywhere , and meets you upon the ceiling of the church , surrounded by angels , and taken up by God into heaven . La Gloire is the Deity of the French ; and so they become liable to hallucinations , and can make a revolution as easily as they can get up a dance . The national victories are emblazoned everywhere . They love flowers passionately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are naturally attracted toward beautiful and bright tints and combinations of color . Any shop-girl or market-girl can whisk together a bouquet , which delights the eye , and whose effect transcends all our plodding study and effort . The public gardens are a fairy-land by night . The Champs Elys6es and the garden of the Luxembourg are at once a nursery , a play-ground , a place of gossip , a promenade , a lover 's walk , a concert-room , a flower-garden , and a palace of enchantment , under the open sky . The English parks , on the other hand , are solemn places for the people to walk in , and seem a part of the solid life of the people . London is a place for business , and the comfortable // locality of an Englishman 's house ; but Paris is the Frenchman 's home . In London , only five per cent of those who die die in the hospitals , while in Paris , no less than thirty per cent of the deaths yearly are in the public institutions . Sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to die among one 's kindred . But while the real French life seems an artificial and exaggerated affair , the acting of life upon the stage is very natural and true , with no extravagance or sentimental excess in the expression of feeling and enthusiasm . The French have no idea of law as a principle to be obeyed in and for itself , as the English have . They do not regard prescriptive rights or paper constitutions . The baton of the constable is to them a stick which they can easily break in pieces ; and what great harm is done , they ask ; but the bayonet of the gendarme is a different affair . They respect that . The Englishman , with all his matter-of-fact common-sense , has imagination enough to see the army behind the policeman 's staff , but not so the Frenchman . He understands only the logic of the musket . The Englishman 's ideal is comfort . So he makes his clothing strong and substantial , his house plain , roomy , and separate from his neighbors . The Frenchman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - and so he is gregarious , puts the best of everything outside , and shouts for the latest meteoric brilliancy . The Englishman is respectable , orderly , shaves nicely his cheek and chin , avoids all extremes , seeking the well-balanced mean ; the Frenchman exults in his moustache , and hurries away in ecstasies after new theories and novel attractions . In England everything is systematized , from a funeral to a coronation . For so much you get just so much , whether you furnish your house or order your coffin . Everything is graded and regulated , and the Times said , " Men rotted by regulation , and starved by system . " Yet to-day , the army and hospital equipments of the Frenchman , with all his vagabondism , are the admiration of every other people . The Englishman loves his Church for its decorous gravity , its routine , its respectability , and its venerable authority . He is opposed to change unless it comes in such a way that it does not seem change . The Frenchman , strange to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences , and yet has no such ruts in which he strives with all his might to keep the wheels . He has more simplicity of natural characteristics , and so away from La Belle Paris he is miserable and forlorn . The English can colonize ; the French never could found an empire out of France . They can hold military occupation for a while , but as fixed inhabitants they dwindle away on a foreign soil . In a word , comparing the three leading nations of Europe , - the French , the English , and the German , - we should characterize them thus . The French have talent , the English common sense , and the Germans genius . The French are vain , the English proud , and the Germans self-centred . The French are theoretical , the English practical , and the Germans ideal . The French live in a world of fancy , the English of fact , and the Germans of thought . The Frenchman is gay , the Englishman comfortable , and the German happy . The Frenchman is an Epicurean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German a Platonist . The Frenchman has manners , the Englishman morality , and the German religion . The Frenchman has taste , the Englishman head , and the German heart . The Frenchman flashes like a fire made of saltpetre , the Englishman burns and smokes like a fire of his own bituminous coal , while the German glows and heats , and will continue burning like a good solid anthracite fire , hard to be kindled and hard to be put out . It is hard to realize that , about a century ago , D'Avenant said of London , " I conceive your heroic game , called foot-ball , not very conveniently civil in the streets , especially in such irregular and narrow roads as Crooked Lane . " Pillories were then a common object in the streets . Mobs of carmen and chairmen insulted and pelted with stones and mud those who rode in carriages . Fielding complains that , in his capacity of justice , he had to make examination in one month into five different murders committed by gangs of street-robbers alone . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have derived its name from covering the place where hammer and tools were kept , to repair the vehicles breaking down in the bad roads and streets . When the king rode in // the state carriage to open Parliament , faggots were thrown into the deep ruts and holes . Compare this with the London of to-day , - extending thirty square miles in solid building , - its safe but thronged thoroughfares , its increasing provisions for security and comfort , its three thousand omnibuses , its six thousand gentlemanly and quiet policemen , its three millions of inhabitants , its seven water-companies supplying fifty millions of gallons daily , - an amount which in the year would cover the whole surface of London eighty feet deep . We boast of our cities , but London would swallow up the largest ten . The statistics are gigantic , and , in some respects , very curious . There are 40,000 persons employed in millinery alone ; 86,000 carpenters , masons , and painters ; 28,000 iii the learned professions ; the postage is 5,000,000 dollars yearly ; the duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our whole country . There are 15 bonnet-shape makers , and of these only one is a woman ; but to compensate , there are quite a number of female pyrotechnists . Out of five fanmakers , there is only one female ; but then , on the other hand , there are five female horse-shoers , one female mathematical-instrument maker , one female lighterman , aud one female manufacturer of razor-strop paste . Barclay &amp; Co. ' s IBrewery covers ten acres of ground , and manufactures 50,000 gallons of beer daily . To construct the St. Katherine Docks , the Hospital of St. Katherine , and 1,250 houses occupied by 12,000 people were torn down , and 24 acres walled in , at a cost of 12,000,04*0 dollars . The London Docks include within the walls , in the very heart of London , 90 acres . The area of their wine-vaults is 18 acres , and will hold 66,000 pipes of wine ; their warehouses will contain 120,000 chests of tea , and 24,000 hogsheads of tobacco . Besides these are the East India , West India , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We name these details , not for the figures alone , but as expressive of that mighty commerce of which England is the centre . London is the heart of the world , and to her and from her go the pulsating currents of life . Any fluctuation in Leadenhall Street , any move from Downing Street of the feeblest pawn upon the political chessboard , is felt in all lands . // It is not without reason that Mr. Hale recurs repeatedly to the home feeling that he experienced in London . In the part within the old city limits , with the familiar names of streets , the well-known haunts of old worthies , and the frequent memorials of the representatives of England 's true glory in the past , the American feels more at home than in any unfamiliar city of his own country . St. Paul 's dome and cross seem to be a part of his own youth , and at every step there is some old and familiar sight that seems to have belonged always to the life-experience . One feels that he knows many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his next-door neighbors at home . He can not believe that he has never before lived in those scenes . No modern books of travel have created such a sensation as existed twenty centuries ago in Rome with regard to Britain . From letters still extant , we learn something of the feeling that prevailed . Cicero writes to his friend Trebatius : " Catch one of the war-chariots , and come back as soon as you can , for I hear that there is no gold or silver in Britain . " To his brother Quintus he writes : " how delighted I was to receive your letter from Britain ; for I had great fear concerning you , on account of the sea and the rugged coast of that island . " The Roman writers refer to the Britons , at that period and for many years afterward , as a " fearful race , " " painted Britons , " and as " fierce to stranger guests . " Florns addressed these lines to Hadrian : - " C*esar himself I would not be , Were the choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foes , And hear their Scythian frosts and snows . " Nineteen hundred years have passed away , and the sceptre of the world has been transferred to that little , despised island of painted savages . The radii from the remotest lands terminate and centre there . Thence go scholars , engineers , manufactured goods , letters of credit , speculations in mines , roads , canals , and stocks in every country of the world . The land which had no silver or gold , but only tin , iron , and hunting-dogs , now draws gold and silver from every spot of earth . So that Shakespeare 's patriotic verse is true to the letter , where he describes England as // " this little world ; This precious stone set in the silver sea This blessed plot , this earth , this realm Dear for her reputation through the world . " The peculiar characteristic of England to-day is its union of most intense and progressive life with the most conservative and reverential regard of the past . It is a living synthesis of age and youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and advancing change ; of conservatism and progress . The one is represented in Westminster Abbey , and the other in the Crystal Palace ; the one built for God , and the other for man ; the one majestic , sombre , of solid stone , the expression of reverence , spiritual aspiration , and prayer ; the other , with ribs of iron and sides of glass , transmitting the sunlight , where children sport , and men and women walk among objects of art , science , and human interest , with music and means of supply for body , mind , imagination , and heart , for the toiling , city-cooped , and weary millions . In the Abbey , the visitor moves with uncovered head and solemn step through the aisles built for the generations resting beneath ; in the Palace , the cheerful throngs enter into the enjoyments of the passing moment . From the past , which embodied its spirit in the venerable Abbey , comes the influence of that sentiment , without which progress would be no onward and steady march , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and secular life of to-day . We may unite in Wordsworth 's apostrophe to England - " Fair land ! by time 's parental love made free , By social order 's watchful arms embraced , - With unexampled union meet in thee , For eye and mind , the present and the past With golden prospect for futurity , If what is rightly reverenced may last .
