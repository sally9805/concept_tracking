Hayne , Paul Hamilton , 1830-1886 : " AWAY WITH THE DASTARDS WHO WHINE OF DEFEAT . " from Poems , in The Southern Poems of the War ( 1867 ) BY PAUL H. HAYNE , OF SOUTH CAROLINA . Away with the dastards who whine of defeat , And hint that the day of destruction draws near , Who counsel " submission , " or whisper " retreat , " With the traitor 's mistrust and the renegade 's fear . What ! doff the strong armor , and yield us as slaves To lust and to robbery , banded with might , While the standard that symbols our liberty waves , Still flaming and fair in the front of the fight ? By the souls of our fathers ! I hold them accurst , The caitiffs who falter and flee from the strife , Who would slake at Dishonor 's foul cess-pool the thirst Of a passion  --  the meanest and basest  --  for life ! Go ! crouch in the forest ! Go ! hide ' neath the rock ! Slink , pallid and scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill your lost ranks in the field Of death and of conflict  --  most gallant of men ! The soul of the brave saint of Orleans is here , It thrills in the voices , it burns on the cheek Of women who heed not the wail of despair , And scorn the false words which the craven would speak . " Submission , " ah ! yes ! we 'll submit when the sod , Lies blackened and bare on the tombs of our race , And " retreat " when the call of our merciful God , Shall bid us disband in His kingdom of grace ! Charleston , May 10 , 1862 . Hayne , Paul Hamilton , 1830-1886 : BUTLER 'S PROCLAMATION . from Poems , in The Southern Poems of the War ( 1867 ) BY PAUL H. HAYNE , OF SOUTH CAROLINA . " It is ordered that hereafter when any female shall , by word , gesture , or movement , insult or show contempt for any officer or soldier of the United States , she shall be regarded and held liable to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocation . " Butler 's Order at New Orleans . Aye ! drop the treacherous mask ! throw by The cloak which veiled thine instincts fell , Stand forth thou base incarnate lie , Stamped with the signet brand of hell . At last we view thee as thou art  --  A trickster with a demon 's heart . Off with disguise ! no quarter now To rebel honor ! thou would'st strike Hot blushes up the anguished brow , And murder fame and strength alike . Beware ! ten millions hearts aflame Will burn with hate thou canst not tame . We know thee now ! we know thy race ! Thy dreadful purpose stands revealed Naked before the nation 's face ! Comrades ! let mercy 's fount be sealed , While the black banner courts the wind , And cursed be he who lags behind ! O ! soldiers , husbands , brothers , sires ! Think that each stalwart blow ye give Shall quench the rage of lustful fires , And bid your glorious women live Pure from a wrong whose tainted breath , Were fouler than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians , men ! Think that each breeze that floats and dies O'er the red field , from mount or glen , Is burdened with a maiden 's sighs ; And each false soul that turns to flee , Consigns his love to infamy ! No pity ! let your thirsty brands , Drink their warm fill at caitiff veins , Dip deep in blood your wrathful hands , Nor pause to wipe those crimson stains . Slay ! slay ! with ruthless sword and will , The God of vengeance bids you " kill ! " Yes ! but there 's one who shall not die In battle harness ! one for whom Lurks in the darkness silently Another and a sterner doom ! A warrior 's end should crown the brave , For him , strong cord and felon grave ! As loathsome charnel vapors melt , Swept by the rushing winds to nought , So may this fiend of lust and guilt Die like a nightmare 's hideous thought . Nought left to mark the monster 's name , Save  --  immortality of shame !    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
