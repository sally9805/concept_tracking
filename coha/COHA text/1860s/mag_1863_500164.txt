THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE REBELLION . AMONG all the subjects of human cognizance , the least understood , and therefore the most difficult of anticipation , are those which concern the acts of men , as individuals or in society Presumptuous , indeed , would be that man who should undertake to foretell the exact results of pending political or military operations , complicated as they must be by innumerable unknown and undiscoverable contingencies , which lie hidden in the circumstances of the actual situation . The difficulty of this investigation does not arise , however , from the absence of fixed laws controlling such events , but solely from our ignorance of those laws , and the extreme complexity of the conditions in which they act . The issue of existing causes is as certain at this moment , as it will be after it shall have become unalterable in history . No accident can disturb or thwart it ; for , in truth , there can be no such thing as accident , except in our imaginations , and by reason of our incapacity to trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which connects together all events whatever , in their inception , through their continuance , and to their end . All enlightcued thinkers of the present age have recognized this great truth ; and yet none have been able to apply to social and political affairs the sole admitted test of genuine philosophy , the prediction of future results from known antecedents . Indeed , the wisest and most competent of political observers have always been the most cautious in their indulgence of the prophetic spirit , and the most ready to acknowledge their ignorance of what tfse future will bring forth in the great field of political and social affairs . Gasparin , in his late admirable book , ' America before Europe ' ( according to his American translator ) , has this very modest passage on this subject : Not feeling any vocation for the character of prophet , I shall take care not to recount here , in advance , events that are abont to happen . I marvel at people who are so sure of their facts . The future has not the least obscurity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself to protesting against the positive assertions which have contributed but too greatly to mislead the opinion of Europe . My humble theory is this : the defeat of the South is probable ; the return of the conquered South to the Union is possible . ' But while political or military vaticination ' is proverbially unsafe , and therefore to be carefully avoided by all judicious inquirers , and especially by practical statesmen , it must at the same time be admitted that some of the general laws controlling such events arc well understood ; and whenever all the facts of a case are known and appreciated , and the laws applicable fully comprehended , then it is possible to anticipate the results of that particular combination with absolute certainty . Other causes may interfere , and modify these results-may accelerate or postpone them , or entirely absorb and conceal them in the general issue of complicated affairs . Yet the particular results themselves are not , and can not be defeated or annulled . They are merely transformed by a sort of composition and resolution* of social and political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanics , when two or more forces not concurrent in direction , impel a body in a line altogether different from that in which either of the forces may have acted . Every physical impulse , it is said , which is initiated anywhere on the earth , is felt to the extremities of our solar system-every motion of the smallest particle of matter communicating its effect , however inappreciable , to the 20 // most distant planet , and as far beyond as the power of gravitation may extend . It is precisely so with all social events , even those of the most insignificant character . Every one of them has its appropriate influence , which is indestructible ; and they all combine to make up the great whole of human action , the results of which at any specific period are only the necessary and inevitable consequences of all antecedent facts . It was the opinion of that most accomplished political philosopher , Burke , that politics ought to be adjusted not to human reasonings , but to human nature , of which reason is but a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the meaning of which is , simply , that the reasonings do not comprehend , as premises , all the complicated facts which enter into any important political problem , and hence the conclusion in such cases can not be absolutely certain , and ought not to be implicitly received . It would be extremely difficult to explain how polities could be adjusted to human nature without the exercise of reason , which alone can regulate the process of adjustment . But we may certainly claim that , in the lapse of nearly a century since Burke wrote , the reason has been considerably enlightened , and something more has been learned of human nature itself ; its apparently capricious and irregular phenomena having been ascertained to be the subjects of systematic order , as complete as that which prevails in all other departments of nature . The laws of social existence and development have been to some extent discovered , and recognized as being uniform in their operation , so that the natural and necessary course of human events may be anticipated , though as yet in a dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many wonders ; but the greatest of them all is this important truth , which has just begun fairly to dawn upon mankind . It is already so firmly established , that no intelligent man who is fully up with the knowledge of his epoch , can admit the least doubt that all events , however complicated , whether social , political , military , or of any other kind , are controlled by general laws , as uniform and certain in their operation as the laws of astronomy , of physics , or of chemistry . The complexity of conditions under which they operate , makes these laws extremely difficult of discovery and of application . But the infinite combinations of influences which press on the minds of individual members of society , and make the acts of each one of them apparently uncertain and arbitrary , exhibit a truly wonderful degree of uniformity , when considered in their operation on the whole mass of a nation . It is by the investigation of these wide and general effects , that the great laws of human action and development are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , in the present state of our knowledge , with all the light afforded by such history as we have of the past , and with all the experience of the present generation , the sum and substance of what we can claim is no more than this : that some influences of a social and political nature may be traced to their certain results , though , from the intricacy of all social facts , their vast extent in a great nation , and especially when international interests are concerned , and from our necessarily imperfect acquaintance with all these varied , multiplex , and powerful conditions , we can not always foresee what conflicting causes will intervene to counteract , modify , and control the actual issue . It is therefore only in the most general way that anything can be said with reference to the future in social or political affairs . In two former articles contributed to Tim CONTINENTAL , we have endeavored to point out the causes of the rebellion , ' finding them in events and conditions contemporaneous with the birth of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political prin // qwq not assert that the converse of this proposition would have been true , and that the Government as a centralized power , would have abolished slavery more certainly , and sooner , than the most backward of the separate States may now be expected to do , under the complex forms of our present Constitution . In a consolidated government , the power of the majority would have been competent to effect fundamental and universal changes , - even to the extent of abolishing slavery ; but without the existence of separate States , with their independent local legislation and administrations , the gradual undermining and destruction of the old systcrn would have been a process of extreme procrastination and difficulty . It would have been a gigantic undertaking , convulsing the whole nation whenever attempted , and yet demanding the exercise of its united authority for its accomplishment . We should not have had the effective antagonism of the Free against the Slave States , nor the demonstration which results from the striking contrasts between the two systems in their effects on civilization , in all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Contiguous States , with separate jurisdictions , admitted a divergence of customs , laws , and institutions , remarkable in its character , and fraught with momentous consequences to the whole sisterhood . Nothing like this could have occurred under the consolidated form . It is true , according to the principles we have heretofore enounced as having been established by universal history and experience , slavery must have disappeared eventually , alike in a consolidated or a federal form of government ; for it is now well understood by all enlightened thinkers , that different forms of polity may either facilitate or embarrass the natural development of society , but can not actually create or altogether destroy the tendency to improvement . This tendency is innate in man , and independent of all forms of government , though not wholly unaffected by them . But in our vast country , under a centralized system , however democratic , it would have been far more difficult to initiate the work of emancipation , on account of the magnitude and unity of the power to be moved , and for want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent authority of the states in a confederacy . Qur own experience , and the recent example of Russia , may serve te convince us that a consolidated representative republic would probably have been less favorable to the abolition of slavery than an imperial and despotic government . The serf-owners of Russia , had the question been submitted to them , would have been as little disposed to vote for the destruction of their system , as the slave-holders of America have shown themselves inclined to submit to the voice of the majority under our republican institutions . Thus , it was characteristic of our peculiar political forms , that they gave opportunity for the complete trial of each of the two plans of social organization which grew out of the early introduction of African slaves into the colonies . For while it seems to be clear that the federal system was most favorable to the disappearance of slavery from those localities where circumstances made emancipation easy and advantageous , it is equally plain that it afforded full scope to the growth and influence of the system of servile labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and otherwise adapted to the productions of the region , and to the prevailing sentiments of the people . The confederated form of government , therefore , almost of necessity originated the antagonism of Free States against Slave States ; while , at the same time , and from the same cause , it enabled the opposite sections to give infinitely greater force and effect to this antagonism , than would have been possible // under any other constitutional conditions . Rebellion might possibly have been initiated within the bosom of a consolidated republic , and such a government might well have been broken into two or more fragments ; but this would have been far less likely to happen in that case than in existing circumstances . At all events , there would have been no room for the dangerous doctrine of secession , and that plausible pretext would have been wanting to the incipient rebellion ; nor would there have been anything equivalent to the State organizations which unfortunately afforded the ready means of immediate and most effective combination . The inestimable advantages of our complex political system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishing local legislation and administration in a number of partially independent States , were in some measure counterbalanced by a natural tendency to discord among the parts , and a capacity for independent action in support and perpetuation of dangerous divergencies of opinion and policy . If some States could repudiate slave labor , and gradually build the fabric of their prosperity on the safer basis of universal education , others could , with equal disregard of everything but their own will and fancied interests , cherish and encourage the original system of servile subordination and compulsory ignorance of the laboring class , with which all the States started into their career of independence at the commencement of the Revolution . And , unhappily , both parties to this discordant social action were unrestrained by any constitutional obligation , or by any common authority whatever , in the indulgence , within their respective limits , of mutual hatred and vituperation , with all those numberless and exasperating injuries which no law can either notice or redress . These conflicting capabilities , with their attendant dangers , lurked in the body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born with it ; they grew with its growth , and strengthened with its strength , until the fatal hour when rebellion undertook the wicked work of its destruction . Whatever may be the actual issue of the struggle-whether the attempted dismemberment shall prove a success or a disastrous failure-the effect of the civil war on the character of our institutions must be commensurate with the organic character of the causes out of which it arose . So profound a disturbance of the existing social order , so vast an upheaval of the very foundations of the whole political fabric , must either rend it into fragments , and make necessary a complete reconstruction , or must cause it to settle down upon a basis firmer and more lasting than that on which it has hitherto rested . We think it almost absolutely certain that tbe latter result will be brought out in the end . It can not be possible that our system will be utterly destroyed ; and ig against all human probabilities , it should be momentarily overthrown , it will rise again hereafter in greater splendor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will have passed . The federative system , on this continent , will never be abandoned ; it will be far more likely to be extended much beyond its present limits , even including that immense territory which has been the theatre of its origin and glorious progress down to the present day . Its superiority over any system of consolidated power on a large scale , is beyond all doubt , inasmuch as it provides effectually for the perfect freedom of local legislation and administration , and for the full participation of all the parts in the government of the whole , as to those questions which concern the general interests . But in this very distribution of powers always consisted the greatest difficulty and the most threatening peril ; for nothing but actual experience , long continued , could adjust to each other with perfect accuracy the // nicely balanced parts of this complicated political machinery . The principle of local independence is naturally liable to exaggeration and abuse . The State authorities have ever shown a tendency to claim absolute sovereignty , and to array their will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , forever recurring in the important exigencies of our national life , has never been definitely settled , and perhaps it could not be , except under the pressure of a great and critical emergency like the present . One of the most important consequences of the rebellion will therefore be to dispose of this question forever-to settle the boundaries of the local and general authorities , and to fix them permanently and unalterably . This might possibly have been accomplished in the appointed way , by conventions and explanatory amendments to the Constitution . But such proceedings would have been subject to all the uncertain contingencies and delays involved in partisan struggles and popular elections , and to all the imperfections of halfway measures and expedients of compromise , born amid angry contentions , and bartered for by ambitious aspirants to place and power . By no other means could a complete and adequate arrangement of the difficulty be brought about so effectually as by the terrible lessons of this lamentable civil war . Nothing else would have been so well calculated to clear the eyes of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insight into the character and demands of the crisis . Great disasters , which destroy the fortunes of men , and disturb the prosperity of nations , never fail to awaken the human soul , and impart to it some new and important truths . The sufferings and calamities of the war are indeed great and overwhelming ; yet there will be some compensation for them all , in the sad experience we shall gain , and in the stability which will result to our sorely tried institutions in the future . Even ig against all apparent possibilities , the rebellious States should finally conquer their independence , not only the old Government , but even the new one itself or the batch of new ones that will spring up , will have learned the most salutary lessons from the whole course of this sanguinary struggle . No sundering of such ties as have always heretofore existed among these States can ever take place peaceably . Both we and our enemies will have been taught the never-to-be-forgotten truth , that secession is civil war . And we should probably have reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemn and portentous one , that permanent separation of these States is nothing more nor less than perpetual war , with the accompaniments of large standing armies , vast public debts , oppressive taxes , loss of liberty , and progressive decline of civilization . This state of things would , however , eventually cure itself . What is called the balance of power in Europe has been brought to its present condition of imperfect stability only through centuries of war . What bloody commotions should we experience before the conditions of stable equilibrium could be attained by the warring States of our broken Union ? Each pj*tty fragment of the discordant mass would contain within itself the germs of precisely such a struggle as we are now passing through . For though the Confederate Government may have ostensibly recognized the actual sovereignty of the separate States composing it , and thereby pretended to establish the principle of secession as a right , the war will not have reached its termination before that doctrine will be practically and effectually destroyed in the very contest for its assertion . At the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so strong a government will be indispensable to this achievement , and to the maintenance of the new power , that the very principle which presided at its birth will be superseded // and destroyed by the paramount necessities of its existence and condition . Any one of the deluded States which might in that case attempt to assert this right , would soon find , in renewed calamities , the folly and danger of the theory on which it is founded . Nothing but the hope of foreign intervention has sustained the cause of the rebellion until the present time ; and the realization of that hope can alone keep up its vitality , and give it success in the future . The disparity of strength and numbers in the two sections is decisive of the whole case , if they be left to conclude the fight themselves . The question is one of means and men , of resources and endurance ; and when we consider the effects of the blockade , and of the probable action of the slaves under the policy of the President , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great length of time can be required to bring the contest to an issue , even if the armies of the Union should not at once succeed in overwhelming the enemy and taking possession of his country . In spite of discouraging delays and military blunders , and of all the waste of life and means which have hitherto marked the conduct of the war , the great*struggle is still progressing rapidly , though silently , in other fields than those of battle , and with other weapons than bayonets and artillery . The sinews of war are gradually becoming shrivelled in the arm of the rebellion . Every bale of cotton locked up in the ports of the South , or hidden in its thickets and ravines , or given to the flames by the ruthless hands of the guerillas , is so much strength withheld from the enemy , and , in the vast aggregate , will eventually be equivalent to the overthrow of his armies and the capture of his cities . The large number of slaves rushing to our lines , and the still greater number rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected , in another year , to make even his supply of bread pre canons , and still further to paralyze his strength and destroy his means of resistance . But in addition to these accumulating difficulties and misfortunes , our armies are everywhere moving down upon him apparently with irresistible force , and threaten to anticipate the slower , but not less certain work of physical exhaustion . He is hard pressed in Yirginia , where his pretended capital is again menaced ; he is driven out of Kentucky and Missouri ; and is fast receding before our victorious forces in Tennessee . We have penetrated into Mississippi , and await only the swelling of the waters to capture its last stronghold , Yicksburg , when the great valley from Cairo to New Orleans will be in our possession , and the rebel confederacy will be sundered through its very spine . We hold important points on the Atlantic coast and in the Gulf including the great metropolis of the South , New Orleans , and the whole coast of Texas . By her own energies alone , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid from abroad , there is not the remotest possibility of prolonging the contest for another year , much less of establishing the Confederate Government on any permanent basis . And even with such interference , supposing it to be successful , the career of the new power would be brief and full of trouble . It would merely exchange its position of equality in the old Union , for one of degrading dependence and subserviency to some one of the great European Govemments . The system of slavery could not be preserved . The demoralization has already gone too far ; and no French sovereign or English administration could safely venture to interfere in our quarrel for the purpose of upholding that institution . In the midst of a dissolving social organization , this exhausted and fragmentary American power , galvanized into temporary vitality by the sinister aid of foreign arms , would be compelled to undertake the // task of determining its boundaries , defending its frontiers , and reorganizing its chaotic society . All this would have to be accomplished in the presence of a still powerful adversary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assert them , as opportunity would permit , in th' face of all opposition . European affairs are not yet so thoroughly adjusted , and the peace of that continent established on so firm a basis , that complications may not be anticipated at almost any moment , which would at once free America from the disgraceful trammels of foreign intervention . It is doubtful whether such a movement from Europe could be successful , even under all the deplorable difficulties which now beset our country . Let any one of those Governments lay its hand on the United States , and revolution would probably hasten to rear its awful head , and so arouse the people of the continent as to shake and endanger the very thrones which now seem to be most firmly established . The unfriendly blow aimed at us might possibly react upon its authors , and transfer to them the misfortunes and disorders which now afflict this country . So just a retribution is not beyond . the probabilities of the present situation in Europe , whether intervention should come from the English aristocracy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everywhere , are on our side ; their strong arms may not be slow to vindicate the judgment they pronounce , and to follow the sentiments and sympathies which animate their generous hearts . But in spite of all difficulties and discouragements , at home or abroad , we firmly believe our righteous cause will eventually prevail , and the Union be restored to even more than its former glory . The overthrow of the power of the rebellion , the utter exhaustion of all its resources , and the frightful derangement of its entire social economy , will leave the people of the South in a condition of helplessness which will render further resistance impracticable . An immediate resumption of hostilities will be effectually prevented by the military force which will necessarily be maintained for some time after the close of the final campaign of the war ; and before the strength of the rebellious States can be recruited for another similar contest , new ideas will be engendered , and new sentiments of attachment to the Union may be expected to grow up and take the place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its horrors . An inevitable change of institutions in the South , with moderate and conciliatory measures on the part of the North , will serve gradually to heal the dangerous wound , self-inflicted , which has so nearly destroyed the very existence of the fairest and most favored part of our country . In the end , a homogeneous society will extend over the whole Union , and new vigor will be infused into our political organization , by reason of its recovery from the terrible disease by which it has been attacked and for a time utterly prostrated . The alterative effects of this critical danger overcome , and of the treatment rendered necessary , will doubtless be one of the most important consequences of the rebellion . The dogma of secession , as applied to our complex government , is inconsistent with reason , and has often been effectually refuted by argument . But sophistry , stimulated by ambition , was ever ready to renew the controversy , and to perpetuate it in all the forms of vicious logic and plausible ratiocination . The appeal to force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it has already discomfited the whole theory , and it will not end short of the utter annihilation of the very idea of secession as a right , and as a remedy for any evils , fancied or real , which may be suffered or imagined under our Government . After the close of the war , when men look back to its bloody fields and its awful vot. iii. -3 // sacrifices , they will be amazed at the insane folly which permitted them to consider the great American Union , with its honorable history , its wonderful progress , its immense power , and its proud standing among the nations , as a mere league among petty states , to be dissolved at pleasure-as a thing to be broken into fragments , and to be divided among ambitious aspirants , to be made the sport of domestic faction , or of foreign rapacity and domination , changing its form and proportions with every change of popular feeling and every restless movement of popular discontent . These fatal delusions will be made to disappear forever , and in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image of a majestic Government , tried in the furnace of civil war , made aclid and immovable by its grand and successful efforts to resist the threatened overthrow of its power , and becoming paternal by the recovery of its wonted strength , which will permit and require the exercise of magnanimous forbearance even toward those misguided citizens who bave raised their traitorous hands against it . Thus , with the awe and fear which will be inspired by the tremendous energy put forth to conquer the rebellion-an energy which will appear only so much the greater and more imposing in proportion to the difficulties and dangers met and overcome-there will be mingled the better sentiments of love and veneration for a Government which reestablishes order , secures protection to all civil rights , and restores , unimpaired , the liberties which have been disregarded for a time , in order that they might be permanently saved . To the people of the United States , the Union will be what it never was before , and what it never could have been without the sad experience it is undergoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effected , or any violence done to the principles on which our system is founded . The change will be solely in the spirit in which our institutions will be administered , arising from the altered sentiments and feelings of the whole people . They will see their Government in a new light  --  a light thrown on it by the grand events of the rebellion , revealing capabilities and powers not hitherto known to exisS and *hibiting it as the sole refuge in times of . commotion and danger , standing unmoved amidst the storm , impregnable to all its violence . In the pub*lie recognition , by universal acquies. e*i , it will be considered stronger than efore ; and this transformation will be as much a change in the minds of the people as in the character and functions of the Government itself . There is , however , no good reason why the central power lould acquire inordinate strength , and absorb any part of the legitimate functions of the local governments . A more liberal interpretation of the Constitution will somewhat extend the federal powers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acknowledged authority ; nevertheless , consolidation need not be the subject of serious apprehension . At the beginning of the war , when the Union was sorely beset with the most imminent dangers , . the executive power was extended far beyond its ordinary limits ; and perhaps this excess of action has been in some cases too long continu*d , and has been made to embrace objects . not le*itimately within the emergesicy which originally justified the departure . But even und* present circus*stances , there can be no just cause for alarm . There can be no real danger , until the people shall have become either overawed and silenced by terror , or careless and indifferent to the encroachments on liberty . Such is evidently very far from being the ease now . The recent elections have shown how entirely free is the expression of opinion , and how completely untrammelled the political action of the people , who , in this instance , have been charged with following // their leaders even beyond the bounds of just opposition , into the dangerous position of giving encouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own peculiar construction on these popular decisions , and it is difficult to determine , with any accuracy , what is their actual import . We only know that so extensive a change , affecting the position of many of the largest States , indicates a serious dissatisfaction of some kind ; though it is by no means probable that the people have intended to sanction the extreme and mischievous views of some of the candidates , who , here and there , have secured their election . Factious divisions in the loyal States , at this critical period , would be ruinous to the cause of the Union . They would distract the public mind and weaken the arm of the Government so as to endanger its success in the war . There is no indication of any such intention on the part of the people , whatever may be the designs of some of those who have been successful leaders of this threatening opposition . And the only effect which ought to follow the recent popular demonstration is to admonish the Government , and check it in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which it is now engaged . The necessity for decision , vigor , and courage , is indeed apparent ; and the temptation to go beyond the limits even of proper martial energy , is perhaps a sufficient excuse or those in power , whose deep sense of responsibility and honest zeal in a l*oly cause may sometimes lead them *tray . It is not always given to men in high position to remain cool and calm in great emergencies , and to take comprehensive views of the requirements of so tremendous a contest , as its aspects vary from time to time . The necessary exercise of military authority for the preservation of the Government , however harsh and severe it may be , will be everywhere justified , and even applauded . Butthere are limits which even military license ought to respect ; and when the executive authorities go beyond the bounds of reason and necessity , they ought themselves to be grateful to those who may have the courage to throw themselves into the breach and sternly resist the violation of right . The men in power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by subservient partisans , whose fears or selffsh purposes may induce them to applaud , when they ought to condemn and reprove . Unfortunately , when such parasites are listened to and rewarded , there is little hope of just and patriotic action ; and this state of things leaves no channel of escape , through which the public discontent can be manifested , except that of partisan opposition , which , in the existing crisis , is perhaps more dangerous even than the evil it pretends to condemn and cure . While party divisions , in the midst of dangers such as now threaten us , are greatly to be deplored , we can , nevertheless , derive some satisfaction from results which otherwise we can not altogether approve . All the essential principles of freedom still remain , through this great trial , undestroyed and unsuppressed by terrorism ; and the popular patriotism and sound common sense , though liable to be misled at first , will eventually pronounce a just and enlightened judgment . Parasites and flatterers may shrink from the task of dissent ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression ; and happy will be our country if their honest warnings , given upon the sober second thought , ' shall be noticed and duly heeded . There will then be no danger of any serious invasions of liberty , or of any permanent absorption of the proper constitutional functions of the States by the Federal Government . Doubtless the central power will be , and ought to be strengthened . Its standing army will necessarily be larger than before the rebellion ; the public debt will be greatly increased ; the taxes will be heavier* // and the revenue and disbursements larger . Though its functions will remain essentially the same in nature , they will have a broader sweep and a greater power . This enlargement of its ordinary action will naturally invest it with all the means and capacities necessary for its own protection , and without any change of the Constitution , it will be recognized as the true embodiment of our permanent nationality , forever paramount in its appointed sphere and appropriate functions to those of the individual States composing it . The sum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and centrifugal forces of the system will have become so completely adjusted to each other , that from this time forward the eternal equilibrium of the whole will be secured . The States will not be shorn of any power rightfully theirs , and necessary for their safety and progress ; but they will be fixed in definite orbits , with the limits of their authority distinctly circumscribed and established . All social changes , sooner or later , produce their appropriate effects on political institutions ; and no results of the rebellion will be more prominent and important than those which will follow the inevitable disappearance of slavery . A new system of labor will be inaugurated in the border States , as well as in those now in rebellion . The great act of emancipation may not be immediate ; nor is it by any means desirable it should be . So radical a change in the condition of millions of uneducated men would be quite as inconvenient , and , indeed , disastrous to themselves , for the time being , as to their present owners . Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the resources of both parties would be temporarily much diminished , if not nearly destroyed . But , whether suddenly or gradually , this fundamental change must take place ; for it is self-evident that slavery can not survive the present struggle . The proclamation of the President , which is to take effect on the 1st of January next , will make emancipation more complete and speedy ; but the same result would have followed the stubborn resistance of the rebels , even without that momentous act . It would be a mischievous error to believe that emancipation was originally the aim and object of the war on the part of the Union , and that the liberation of slaves , which was sure to follow its progress , is the direct act of our authorities , and not the proper consequence of the rebellion itself . A war waged for and on account of slaveryfor its increase and perpetuation-necessarily , by its own nature , puts that institution at stake , and risks it on the contingency of failure . Compelled , in defence of the national unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern States , the world acquiesces in that sound and necessary policy , which releases the slaves , and sets them free forever , as fast as they come within the protection of our armies . The proclamation is a measure of the same nature , intended to destroy the resources of the enemy , and to wound him in his most vulnerable point . But it can accomplish little more than the previous policy ; for the slumbering hopes of the slaves were *roused by the first gun fired at Charleston in the beginning of the struggle . Every movement of armies , and every bloody battle , which has since taken place , has only served to inflame their desire for freedom , and to fix their determination to obtain it . They have received and gladly welcomed the obscure idea , that , in some way , this sanguinary conflict was initiated for their benefit , and will not end without their complete emancipation . In this they are not mistaken . The final suppression of the rebellion by military force will be the perfect consummation of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South herself . If she persevere in her stubborn resistance to the au // thority of the Union , the great measure of liberation will be the result of her own blind and wilful acts of madness , and this as well through their natural and necessary consequences as by the terms and import of the President 's proclamation . Let slavery destroy itself . It is a just and righteous judgment that , in its atrocious effort to destroy the nation , it should accomplish chiefly , if not solely , its own violent and bloody death . Such retribution often attends the commission of great crimes ; but it seldom happens that effects so momentous for good flow from the infliction which seems intended only for punishment . Under all circumstances , with or without the proclamation , slavery must disappear soon after the suppression of the rebellion . From that time , the States will become more and more homogeneous in their social organization . This will tend to promote unanimity among them all , and therefore , by an obvious process , to strengthen the rightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our country , comprising so many varieties of condition and climate , and such diversities of production , rising through every grade of elevation , from the Atlantic seacoast to the central mountains , and thence again descending to the shores of the Pacific , with mighty rivers running through nearly twenty parallels of latitude-this magnificent seat of republican power affords the most unbounded resources for industry in all its employments , and for commercial interchange of productions on the most gigantic scale . With free labor prevailing everywhere throughout this vast and splendid region of the temperate zone , no limits can be assigned to the national progress . The population , wealth , activity , and intelligence of the most favored among the Free States at the present day , can alone offer the measure and example of what the whole will be in the full maturity of the new system . No European complexities of inter-state relations , no oppressive restrictions on domestic commerce , no fatal divergencies of opinion and feeling , no important differences of language and literaturenone of these obstructions to harmony and progress will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Union . All that the earth yields from her teeming surface , or from her deep-embowelled mines ; all that enterprise can accomplish with exhaustless means , the best facilities , and the most stupendous objects ; and all that genius can create , when stimulated by the richest rewards and the freest opportunities for untrammelled exertion , will supply us with the means and materials for an almost infinite variety of pursuits and occupations ; but , at the same time , the essential unity of our complex institutions will be maintained , and their power extended and exalted by the homogeneity and uniformity of social conditions which will prevail more and more with the lapse of years and the succession of generations . The blood of all kindred races will be mingled with advantage in the veins of the cosmopolitan American ; religions will be harmonized and unified by the most fraternal liberality and unbounded toleration ; and the common enlightenment of the whole people by means of universal education will exalt them to a condition of unexampled power and prosperity . Just as dissensions among the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cordial cooperation will give immense strength to the whole . Nor will this increase of power be at all dangerous , because it will be only the legitimate consequence of the greater progress and prosperity of the States themselves . To whatever height the greatness of the Union may attain , it will be determined exactly by that of the States which compose it  --  the pyramid of its power being made up of theirs , which are but the enduring // blocks of which the mighty structure is built . If social unity and political strength will be promoted by the suppression of the rebellion and the disappearance of slavery , the ties of our Union will be made stronger also by other causes . Emerging from the war victorious , not only without being seriously injured , but with eventual and speedy increase of power , the Union will command the respect of foreign nations in a higher degree than ever before . Those European nations , or rather their rulers and nobles , who now in their malignant envy hope for the permanent dismemberment of America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be none the less advantageous to us for being forced from them in spite of their present hate and detraction . If the division of our country would destroy its influence abroad , and subject the parts to constant intrigues and interference from foreign powers , the restoration of the Union with even more than its former glory will give us unexampled weight in the counsels of mankind . Our unexpected and astounding exhibition of military power , our thorough command of the American continent , and its immense resources , hardly yet begun to be developed , and the unlimited prosperity which the future will assuredly bring us , can not fail to strike the minds of European thinkers , and to awaken deep interest among the European people . The stream of immigration , interrupted by the war , will be renewed with at least its former fulness , and will keep pace with the demands of our country for labor and population . The South may then be expected to receive her full share of this increase by people from abroad , and will then commence that process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she can never attain any high position in the scale of civilization . The large public debt destined to be incurred , may be expected to have some influence in preventing immigration and improvement ; but unless the war shall unfortunately linger far beyond the period at which its end is now anticipated , the liabilities of the Government will not be so great as to prevent the speedy return of our usual prosperity . A different and far better system of taxation will be requiredone more favorable to commerce and at the same time equally productive , or at least sufficiently so to meet all our liabilities and provide for the extinguishment of the debt within a reasonable time . One of the advantages attending this great debt and modifying its certain evils and burdens , will be the necessity of devising a stable revenue system , intended solely to provide means for sustaining the Government and meeting the public obligations . Periodical changes , often depending on party ascendency and popular elections , have hitherto marked the financial policy of our Government . So long as the sources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate , we could well afford to make experiments , and even to depart from the true principles of taxation , or at least to do so without any very serious or ruinous consequences . Now , however , when the public expenditure is about to be vastly increased , and when it will be for the first time really felt by the people , it will become the first duty of our rulers to study the extent and true character of our resources , and to adjust the burdens of taxation , with all practicable fairness , to the respective capacities of all classes and interests . We may expect to have a system stable and permanent in its principles , if not in its details ; and the basis of this system will be a wise arrangement of duties on imports , which must , from various reasons , ever form the great bulk of our taxes . It is not an American maxim that a great public debt is a public blessing ; nor is it likely that an educated and eminently practical people like ours // qwq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
