IT is to be supposed that all who take any interest in the progress of architecture in America , have watched with pleasure the recent indications that the profession is tending to that unity of aim and purpose without which no art can make any impression on its time . But , whether there be watchers or not , it is certainly true that , within a very few years , architecture has taken on a new phase in America ; not only has the number of architects increased , the number of thoughtful , studious , and earnest men in the profession has also increased , and all the signs promise that , if we have not seen the last of bad building-whether that term imply ugly , unmeaning design , or unsound construction , or both-we have , at least , seen the beginning of good building . It could easily be shown that this improvement , although the sign of it are , as yet , somewhat scattered , is the result of conviction and effort , not of accident ; that it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear on examination , to spring from the thought and labor of several men working quite independently , ad not from the influence of any single one , to be diffused , ad not the work of a clique or schcol , this ought to please us better and to be more reassuring to us ; it would prove that the public is being educated , and that the growth is from a root , and not a mere implanted grat Perhaps some will think it is too early to hunt for signs of Spring , and will declare that the bluebird we anounce has sung out of season , and that these crocuses are over bold ; but objectors will remember that we do not say the Spring is come , but only that , as the np-country people have it , the back of the Winter is broken . Our bluebird may die , perhaps , and build no nest ; the flowers may be covered . with an April snow ; but , for all that , the bird ad the flower belong to the Spring , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what hasbeen done here in architecture already , would , no doubt , prove an interesting study , and would be wo7rth reading . Indeed , it is a great pity that some of our wealthy young men with a taste for architecture that , at present , is only dangerous to the community , because it teases them perpetually to try their hand at what they call " original " work-it is a pity that some one of these gentlemen would not put us all under obligations to him . by visiting the older-settled portion of our country , and measuring the fbw interesting examples of brick ad wooden architecture that the vandal hand of " taste , " and the le cruel hand of time , have left a There is an old church in Binghain , Massachusetts , if not the oldest , then among the oldest , churches in the country .

Then , beside , there are the few wooden houses of the last century , left in such old towns as Gloucester , Massachusetts ; houses that , to our thinking , have never been surpassed in this country in elegance of proportion , comfort of internal arrangement , or the purity of their ornamentation , although this last belongs to a poor period . There were three of these houses when we knew the beloved old town , and we presume that two of them are still standing and good for another hundred years . They belonged to Mr. Hough , to Dr. Dale , and . to Captain Low . In the terrible fire of 1864 , Mr. Hough 's house , though saved , was seriously injured , and Captain Low 's had to be blown up to pievent the spread of the flames . Here and there in our older cities , are to he found wooden spires , like that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like that of the present New York Postoffice , which show a man of taste and perception doing his best in a narrow field and with poor materials . Boston and Philadelphia preserve the most of these indications of a good day in the past , hut New York , which had them in plenty , has been so flowed over by the stream of emigration and changing populations that her architecture has shifted back and forth , and taken all shapes , like the sand at the bottom of our hay . Hardly anywhere in the country , however , is the study of the earlier building necessary to understand the building of the present . It can not be said that there has been a growth , as in the older countries , from rudiments modified by successive occupations . Rarely , except in New York , has there been more than one ocenl ) ation . The emigrants brought with them the architectural ideas of their time and country , and reproduced them in literal copies , carrying their desire to see home repeated . so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they did not improve upon their models . ilardly ever were they able , in fact , to do more than copy in mini*ture and with diminished orncmentation , the buildings , houses , churches , halls , they had left over seas . Then came the Revolution with its eight years of education , development , discipline ; a time of hardship and poverty , suffering and loss , in which art and literature , learning and science , died in their birth , or lived a starved and dwindled life , and architecture had no better chance than the rest . After this came the " classical " mania , a pale reflection of the affectations of the French " First Empire , " with its make-believe worship of Greece and Rome ; and then came-nothing , and then , to-day . We laugh at // the " classical period , " with its wooden pedirnents , its porticos of wooden pillars , and its dread of chimneys ; but it was a fatal period , for all its folly . It established itself among us as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Patent Offices , Treasury Buildings , Girard College , United States Banks , Custom louses , and keeps on giving them ; to-day , even , builds us a new County House , pedimented and pilastered a la mode , and , in all likelihood , will give us a new Post-Office in the same style . The period that followed the classical mania was one of transition . All the people who had money to build with , built pediments and pillars , of stone if they could afford it , which , thank heaven , very few of them could-otherwise , of wood , painted to look as much like stone as possible . If our readers remcmi ) er , there was also a little spurt of philo-Egyptianism here and there , which left traces of itself in our " Tombs , " and in the entrance gate of Mt . Auburn Cemetery , over whose sham , wooden sublimity Fanny Kemble , in her piquant and clever " Journal , " bursts out into an honest fit of indignation . Beside these there were standing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarded by Sphynxes , and their fronts stuck about with cheerful emblcms-scarabey , winged globes , dog-headed Anubis , Thoth , Ammon , and lotus . But this was mere pedantry and affectation ; the whim of rich people , who , as usual , did not know what to do with their money . As for the great body of the people , if they had to build , they followcd the true Gradgrind style , four walls and a roof ; with boles for light and air , and larger holcs for ingress and egress . Of architectural design , of beauty , of taste - from Dan to Beersheba all was barren . At that time it would have been hard to prophecy from what quarter the next moulding influence would come . If a man had looked to culture , refinement , general education , to produce it , he might have supposed that Boston would be the true east for that sunrisin g ; but , from first to last , the arts owe almost nothing to Boston , and the omens in that quarter are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be suckled on theories , all would go well with her in that pleasant Massachusetts country , but neither art nor artists thrive there . If by chance an artist gets born there , lie has this choice presented very early : To jilt the muse , to starve , on to eoriie to New York . If he be rich , he goes to Paris , gets airs , and comes back to sing monotonously for the rest of his days , " There is no art but French art , and Couture is its prophet . " Therefore it happened that , though at the period we speak of ; Dame Nature was doing a good many blessed deeds in Massachusetts ; might have been seen in the twilight , if one had had eyes , leaning on a rail fence and musing over Concord ; on , in bright , Summer days , ripening the huckleberries in the sunny Lexington pastures for the little tow-head Socrates , that he might earn his Greek Test a-I // ment by picking them ; or smiling-such a smile ! - as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hers ; yet the man she needed . for this work was a slip she tended in another field . They called him Downing the nursery-man 's boy ; that blackeyed , black-haired lad , sitting studious over his books in the Montgomery Academy , helping his father and elder brother in the nursery- , or botanizing with afihble , enthusiastic IDe Liederer , consul from the Netherlands , over the low-lying Newburgh hills . A poor boy , son of poor parents , with no advantages , few acqunintauces , few books ; this was nature 's instrument to waken our people to a desire for beauty and grace . For , before these things can be , they must be desired . And Downing 's books had much to do with teaching us to desire them . Nature has a snubbing way with her at times ; can do unkindest things . One has to put up with much from her , to forgive bi-oken promises , to stand tearful or aghast over her double meanings found out too late ; to be brave when she passes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has planted . She played false to this boy of hers , as she has done with many another . She gave him a yearning desire for the true , the beautiful and the good ; panted the seed deep in his heart , saw it burst the ground , saw leaf after leaf unfold , and then , as if she had wearied of the play , took wing , and left him , and went about her other errands . Thus deserted , young Downing had to look about him for what help lay nearest , and as ill-luck would have it , he found the very worst advisers close at his elbow . For he was not a genius ; if he had been , then everything would have been different . Then Nature might have gone or stayed . He would have given her snub for snub* 0-cnius converts difficulties to helps , makes something ont of nothing . Downing had not genius , but lie had talent of a rare kind , and better , perhaps , than talent , he had a clear purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some things he must be dependent on others . His education had been only partial . Things essential to success in the path he had chosen , he did not have , lie could not draw , for instance ; could not ever draw a straight line . Others then , must draw for him . Yet the mechanics who worked for him said . that he could always describe with admirable clearness what lie wanted mna ( it , and his eye was so true , that he spied faults without the aid of compass or rule . He had a nature of great sensitiveness to form and color ; he had great self-reliance ; he had a thirst to learn that he might teach ; and it is no slight praise to say that from the first , no man can point to an opportunity within his reach and say , " This he missed , this he neglected . " The real value of Downing 's work , was not in his positive teachings , for , if he had lived , he must have supplanted , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the impetus lie gave // to the love of beauty , to culture , to the arts that make home beautiful . henry IV said , he wished that every French peasant might have a fowl in his pot . Downing , though no king , wished a better wish , and followed it with a deed , lie planted a flower in every poor man 's garden . Perhaps , after all , we must take back something of what we have said against Nature . It may be , if she had made Downing finer , trained him choicer , given him wiser teachers , he might have failed to do his peculiar task . For that task was not to teach the taught , to set wealth at new ways of spending money , to widen the domain of luxury . It was a much higher work than this . It was to infuse into the whole mass of the people a love of flowers and trees , a love of home , and a desire to make home lovable , a desire for a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial way of living ; and no doubt he saw , as well as we , that until the whole people came to be of this mind , and to desire these things , the higher teacher , the artist , must work in vain . It may well he that had Downing been asked , when young , whether he thought more would be gained by teaching the rich and educated than by teaching the poor and the untaught , he would have given the answer that his life did not give . It would be wrong to say , out of mere compliment , that , in the beginning , his sympathies were with the poor and the ignorant , or even with " the working class , " as we must call them , for lack of a better name . The glimpses that he caught of the possible refinements and elegance of life in the houses of a few rich people of real education and culture intoxicated him for a time ; not less , the aroma that 1 ) reathed from the pages of certain books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intoxication was necessary to him . lIe needed to look very far beyond his actual surroundings ; to know that there was another kind of life , that something better than bread and water is in God 's storehouse , that the earth has better crops than beets and turnips , that beauty is a common possession , and not the exclusive property of the rich nd wise . Certain noses will involuntarily turn up in these later days if a man venture to allude approvingly to Downing 's books on architecture and landscape gardening ; worse still , if he happen to speak of the houses lie built . But there is nothing surprising if we have outgrown the actual performance of the teacher . Architectui'e in England owes an immeasurable debt to Welby Pugin : he had a flaming zeal that outran his own capacity , and worked by the hands of every young architect in the kingdom to lay the corner stone of the revived art of building . Yet Well ) y Pugin has left nothing really good in architecture behind him . Downing was not Pugin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same day ; but he had all Pugin 's zeal in his own world , and did , every day , the best he could . The set an immense number of Americans thinking , and so // catholic was he that he sought out and welcomed every one who could contribute anything to help on the work . The first books he got hold of  --  and there were no better within his reach to be borrowed or bought-were the old men , Repton , Price , and-Heaven save the mark ! - Loudon ! He believed in London a long whileLoudon who had not the first word of any Gospel-and , worse than this , he came under the cruel claw of . It would be scandalous to name him , and , yet , for his evil deeds , he well deserves it . His epitaph is writ ; t is Vaubrugh 's : Lie heavy on him earth , for he Laid many a heavy load on thee ! But , then , he is not yet ready for his epitaph ; he still eats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This it is not civil to regret ; but we may , with reason , regret that he still builds , still insists on shutting us up in donjons and fortresses , sets us at dinner in vaulted halls , and keeps us waiting at our front doors till the porteullis be raised . What discomfort he has caused , and will cause , till his medieval spirit shall be at rest ! What heaps of money he has wasted , and worse , what numbers he has disgusted with architecture ! Yet , for a long time , Downing treated this person with great respect and consideration , acknowledged his indebtedness to him , put his designs into his books , and recommended him to his friends . The best that we can say for him in this matter is , that he did not continue long the victim of this infatuation . But , as we have said , Downing 's actual work need not trouble us : t is his influence that makes his name worthy to be remembered . He left no single work , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no beautiful house built here in our day , there is no garden that woos the Summer , that does not owe something to his memory ; his name must long be spoken by Americans with affectionate respect . NThat Downincr did for us , then , was to stimulate the public mind to a desire for a better material way of life . He made us want better houses-more convenient , better built , prettier , with hay windows , gardens , slips of lawn , and good fruit in plenty . lie had that eloquence that he made a man or woman believe that everything beautiful lay just within reach . It seemed the most feasible thing in the world to build a house , and nothing was ever seen like the way the vines would run over it , the roses glow on the lawn , and the trees you only planted yesterday bear fruit to-morrow . Of course all sorts of people indulged in these bewitching experiments , and a great many failed from sheer greenness and stupidity . Also , a great many succeeded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones to prosper on . The end was , that the first point in education was gained . The pupil was interested . 10 // To-day , it seems to us , the architects are again in advance of the public . The architects have taken a great stride in the last fifteen years . Mr. Downing taught the general public ; he hardly inIluenced a single architect . The sudden growth in the profession is owing to several causes . First , individual minds were powerfully stimulated by Ruskin . Then there came over seas a few strong , able , individual men who taught by word and work . Calvert Vaux , Leopold Eidlitz , Wrey Mould-there is a great debt of gratitude due these men . Then there was the general stimulus of competition and of intercourse , the enlarging effects of travel , photographs and . books , our young , ambitious men sharing in the new-born enthusiasm of their contemporaries in England and France . The architects , then , such of them as deserve the name  --  and their number is quite respectable-are becoming established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design ; they are studious , reflecting , ambitious to link their names to worthy work ; already many of them have done so . But the public has not so high a standard , and seems to care very little for good work . Here it is , to speak candidly , that the negative influences of Downing 's work are felt almost as positive evil . He did not throw his weight strongly , clearly on the side of good , faithful architecture . He was eager , first of all , for pretty , tasteful results , and showed how they might be produced at the least expense to serve temporary ends . We firmly believe that had he lived he would have come to think differently ; but we know , too well , that this was what he thought and what he taught . This is why his books are outworn so soon , and why the young architects to-day hold them in small esteem . They served a certain use , but they lacked the vitality that is given by a principle . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monumental work , true that he set up for admiration a bad period , a dull and tasteless time ; but his vitality consists in the face that he is identified with the teachings of good principles ; he stood for earnest , truthful work ; he was always hammering a way at the necessity for sound , honest construction . The particular application of his principles is of no account with us to-day , but his principles are everlasting ; they are opposed to all sham and deceit . It is true that our architecture is in a bad way . We are building as badly as we can , and as ugly as we can . The other day they took down and carted off two old landmarks of New York-St . Thomas ' Church and Stuyvesant Hall . Certainly these were ugly structures ; but are the buildings that will go up in their places like to be a whit better ? Miss Jones gives yesterday 's bonnet to her maid , and laughs to herself at the figure the creature will cut in " the horrid old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion which Sophie Soust or Marie has just opened has any advantage over the discarded top-knot , except that of newness ' ? Look at the // new Academy of Music ; look at the proposed Cranston Hotel , the new County House , Mr. Beecher 's Church , the proposed Catholic Cathedral ; t is hardly unfair to say-look at the new Post Office . Can we build worse than these things ? A few excellent buildings prove that this is the fault of the public , and not of the architect . The Corn Exchange and the Brooklyn Academy of Music , the work of Eidlitz ; the New York Academy of Design , by Wight ; Mould 's churches- " All Souls , " " The Holy Trinity , " the Presbyterian Church in Forty-second Street , and his Parish School attached to Trinity Chapel-these , with , perhaps , Trinity Chapel , by the younger Upjohn , and various smaller buildings by other men , are proof enough that if good work were called for , it could easily be supplied . The fault of our not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the public and with the committees that represent the public . Take a single example . The trustees of Mr. Beecher 's church called for plans for a new building . Many were sent in , among them one by Mr. Mould , a strikingly original work , not merely beautiful and interesting , as is everything that he produces , l ) ut remarkable even for him  --  a design whose inventiveness and fitness of adaptation would have made it noticed anywhere . Yet this design was not so much as considered , and we are told by an architect who has no personal reason for his admiration , that he , in vain , tried to get the committee to consider it . Well , we all know what is the result of this committee 's labors . This is only one example , but they lie thick about us . Here are three great public buildings about to be erected  --  a new building for the War Department at Washington , a new Capitol at Albany , a new Post Office in New York . Does any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good building in either of these cases ? Iramensely costly buildings we shall get , that we may safely reckon on , but nothing good to look at . The new Post Office will only shut off a little more of our scanty napkin of blue sky , and smirk. with some unmeaning phiz or other- " Classic " or " Renaissance "  - -  at the pretentious and ugly , because unsuitable " Herald " Office over the way . The truth is that we must wait still longer before the public will be in a position to demand good buildings for its . illoney . We are not educated up to the point where we can take no pleasure in unmeaning ornament , in crude plans , in flimsy construction . It needs that we be made to feel , in what is called a practical way , the evils of bad building , the solid advantage of good building . Perhaps the late developments with regard to . insurance may do something to hasten the day of better things . But it must necessarily be slow work . It can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings , well planned , beautiful in design . The few that have already been erected here have been . of great service in stimulating thought and pointing out a better // way . But the fact that the architects themselves are moving in the matter of the public education , that they are combining their efforts to persuade the public to look at the subject of architecture from a higher point than it has been accustomed tothese things are matters for sincere congratulatioii ; and not the least encouraging element in the prospect is , that these movements are the drawing together of influences hitherto separate , and working , if not in opposition , yet apart and solitary , but now brought together out of a common conviction . The professional tour of observation which Mr. W. Ware is now making through England - sent out , we believe , by the American Institute of Architects - promises to have happy results . Everywhere he has been received with generous cordiality , and all opportunity freely given him to know what has been accomplished and what is being done , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; whenever it has seemed to be desirable , addressed the architects at their various social and professional meetings , and by his good sense , modesty , and tact , has done much to excite an interest in the work of our own men . Nor has the result of his visit , thus far , been confined to good wishes and sympathy ; an interchange of ideas and productions has also been begun . The Royal Institute of Architects has sent out to the American Institute , through Mr. Ware , copies of all its papers , reports of proceedings , monographs , etc. , and added to these a large collection of architectural photographs , drawings , and tracings of the works of its members , among whom are to be found every architect of note and ability in the United Kingdom . The American Institute has not been slow to respond to these expressions of good will . It is preparing to make the best return in its power , by sending to England a collection of photographs and drawings representing the progress of the profession in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or exclusive spirit , nor will any attempt be made to give a more favorable impression of our condition than would be just , by sending only the best that has been accomplished here . Invitations have been sent to all the architects who are in any way entitled to the name , to send either drawings , or photographs and tracings of drawings , of their best work , to the Secretary of the Institute , in New York , for transmission to England . The response to this invitation has , thus far , been general , and there is every prospect that a large portfolio will be collected . One great advantage of this proceeding will be , that our architects will , for the first time , submit their work to competent judgment , and get a verdict on it worth considering . And it is much to be desired that the intercourse thus happily begun between American architects and those of England , should be extended to the French , among whom a movement is taking place , similar to that going on in England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architect the equal of Viollet-le-Duc , as distinguished for his learning and scholarship as for his professional skill , and who , by his enthusiasm , his energy , and wonderful industry , is doing the work of many men in regenerating architecture in France , and helping it to regain its ancient glory . His " Dictionary of Architecture " and his " Conversations on Architecture , " are already influencing our younger men , and sowing the seeds of higher teaching than has yet come to us from any quarter . At home his influence has been great enough to produce an actual revolution , and give a serious blow to the school that has , thus far , arrogated to itself the name of " French , " and which is responsible , both here and abroad , for much of the degeneracy that architecture has fallen into . It is greatly to be wished that our American Institute of Architecture should ally itself with this important movement , and bring it in some way more directly to bear upon our young scholars . There would be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect of developing a style of architecture suited to our wants as a people living an individual and peculiar life , under new conditions of climate and temperature ; for the excellence of M. Tiollet-le-Duc consists in the practical character of his teachings , in the fact that they are founded , not on whim or fashion , but on principles , and that they are not formal nor degenerate , but enthusiastic and creative . They will not teach our young men to design in a particular style or school ; but they lay a broad foundation on which to design well whatever may be required , to be governed in design by the eternal laws of comiuon sense and nature . We have already had too much of one kind of French influence , and too many bad buildings have been designed , and too many built , iu the style which the present Emperor-whose taste is of a very low order-has made fashionable , but which , happily , he has not succeeded in making national . Now let us enter into sympathy with the real France  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and learn what she can teach us of the true principles of building . And let us trust that by another decade , when these buildings that do so little credit to our culture , and are in such ludicrous contrast to the metropolitan claim we so loudly make , shall be tumbled down to make room for others , the public will show its growth in refinement and intelligence by demanding structures in their place that will represent its highest class , its most thoughtful , its best taught-structures built , not to be pulled down , but to endure  --  to become a part of our civil and national life , landmarks of our history , lit servants for our noblest uses , silent and venerable teachers of thii*s not to be forgotten or despised .
