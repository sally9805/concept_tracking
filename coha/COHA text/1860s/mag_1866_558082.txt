txt 7. - The Daily Public School in the United States . Philadelphia : J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. 1866. 8vo. pp. 168 . THIs *areful-looking pamphlet is devoted to an exposure of the shortcomings of our system of Common Schools . It is based on an analysis of the system as it exists in four leading States , Ohio , Pennsylvania , New York , and Massachusetts . The analysis , indeed , is not quite so thorough or so methodical as it might seem at a hasty glance , - the author 's mind being apparently too full of what he considers the defects common to all to dwell much upon individual peculiarities ; but it is evidently the work of a man of sense , candor , and considerable experience , and his opinions are the better worth listening to because they are // quite opposite to the prevailing opinions . There is , perhaps , no covert or fastness from which we should imagine it would be more difficult to dislodge the American peacock than the Common School . Here he expands and suns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accepts as his due the tribute offered to his superiority by the envy of crowned heads and of the aristocratic scoffers of Europe . This is the pleasing theme of newspapers and popular orators . One of the most intelligent journals in the country lately urged , as an argument in favor of international copyright , the opening it would give for the introduction of our school-books , and in due course our methods of popular education , into England . There is no doubt some ground for this selfglorification , but still it is not a wholesome temper , and it hinders progress by blinding us to defects which we may be sure exist . Of late , indeed , there have been doubtful and warning voices . Professor Atkinson , in his Lecture before the Institute of Instruction at New 1-Javen , confesses his fears " that , with all our boasted improvements , if our cotton-mills did not approach nearer to the ideal perfection *f cotton-spinning than our schools do to the ideal perfection of teaching , they would speedily ruin their stockholders . " And whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the products of that lucrative branch of industry in this country , or has noticed the tone which the discussions of popular education are taking there , will he somewhat prepared for the disquieting conclusions at which our author has arrived . " It is our firm belief , " he says , " that the confidence reposed in our present common-school system is delusive , and that , while specific branches of knowledge have advanced in later years , and some spheres of education have been greatly widened and improved , the work of preparing the great body of the school-children of the country for the duties and responsibilities of life is very imperfectly done . " There is , indeed , some difficulty in fixing a standard . To determine , for instance , how many persons in a given district can read and write is , our author remarks , as hard as to determine how many of them are " well off . " The standard which he proposes can not certainly be called an unreasonable one . He would only require " that every individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well taught in reading , spelling , writing , grammar , geography , and arithmetic " ; but he says ( p. 65 ) , " In the course of fifty years ' pretty close observation of a great variety of men and women of diverse temperament , social relations , capacities , and pursuits , we have scarcely found one in a thousand that could spell , read , write , or speak their mother tongue with propriety " ; and his obsdrvntion of many thousands of children and youth has satisfied him that ( p. 11 ) " nine in ten of them are incompe // 29* tent to read properly a paragraph in the newspaper , to keep a single debt-and-credit account in a mechanic 's shop , or to write an ordinary business letter in a creditable way . " And it is from a Massachusetts tcacher too that he cites the remark that ( p. 123 ) " the culpable neglect of the New England schools in teaching their pupils how to write a letter is proved a hundred times every year in the letters we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters which disgracefully abound with false grammar , bad spellin* , , and worse punctuation . " These are not cheerful pictures , nor does our author encourage us to believe that matters are substantially improving , lie is " by no means prepared to admit that the schools of to-day make better readers , spellers , and writers than were made by the schools forty or fifty years ago . " Then , " what was lacking in facilities was lar*ely made up in application and painstaking . The young mind was not distracted with a score of different studies . Nobody dreamed that rhetoric and philosophy , political economy and constitutional law , had a place in the daily common school . " The system must be judged by its fruits , and , moreover , relatively to the general development and progress ; if the schools are not better , they are worse ; " the arts and sciences have advanced marvellously , but whether the people more justly appreciate their social and civil privileges , whether the virtues of honesty , industry , temperance , and reverence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspicuous now in the ma*ss of the community as they were then , is vcry questionable . " XXThether we fully share these gloomy views , or whether there may be something to be said on the other side or not , there is some truth in the notion that the cheerful view is the distant one , and that in general those who see the schools near at hand , without any professional or other disturbing bias , are the least satisfied . Those who see them at a distance see a good deal of show and bustle , and they are ready to conclude that the high average of intelligence and cultivation which they see , and which no doubt is highest where the schools are the best , is the direct product of the schools . The opposite view is , the wonder that schools in the midst of so intelligent a people , and completely subject to their control , should be so lifeless , so little in earnest or discriminating either as to what is taught or the way in which it is taught . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise , the imposing array of academies , lyceums , colleges , with their programmes , their diplomas , and their professorships , may be due to the working of a very different spirit from that which moved in the original conception of the New England schools , - that the glory of that conception is in danger of being counterfeited for the behoof of // something of a very different nature , - and a doubt whether the real demand is not in many eases rather for something to be used as the badge of social distinction than for education . There is certainly no excess of political economy , philosophy , or even of rhetoric , that is , of the reality of these things , in the community , but a great deal too much of a cheap and flashy show of them , a smattering of names and phrases with little thought of knowledge , but only a desire to be supposed to know , and to get thereby some credit or advantage , without any gain , but only to the obstruction , of real enlightenment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves whether something of this spirit might not be found even in the Normal Schools of which we in Massachusetts are so proud . The idea is an attractive one ,  --  to teach the teachers , to raise the whole level of education by elevating the sources . But are they teachers that we are teaching in these schools ? In 1862 , two hundred and seventy-five pupils entered the four Normal Schools of the State . how many teachers came out ? What proportion of the pupils went there with the intention of devoting themselves to the profession of teaching ? These questions our author does not find it easy to get answered . The Normal School at Sn1cm , he says , has been open ten years . The number of graduates from this school alone is seven hundred and fifty-eight . Yet it appears that only about four per cent of the teachers in the State have been under normal-school instruction . What becomes of the rest of the graduates ? One of the New York school reports says , " The graduates of the Normal School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attraction for the girls is the improvement of their matrimonial prospects . In the reports of our own State , we find a good deal of general enthusiasm , but nothing definite as to final results . What anybody can see for himself in the villages and farm-houses is an increased number of young ladies of a dressy turn , who read the magazines , and perhaps write in them , - who often have delicate health , not often much capacity or taste for the primary duties of women . There is a marked increase in the number of candidates for any genteel employment that does not require much hard work , but not a very manifest advance in the application of trained intelligence to the arts of life . The sort of ambition which these higher schools and " academies " often nourish , and which has a considerable share in keeping them up , has no doubt a good side to it . It is a vanity of comparatively a high kind ; still , so far as it is vanity , it will be apt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hint of an experienced observer like Professor Atkinson ( Lecture , p. 41 ) , that it leads in many cases to the worst mischief deserves attention . At any rate , there is no reason why // the public should pay for gratifying it , under the pretence of improving the schools in which the public are directly and generally interested . The defects of the school system our author considers to be directly traceable to neglect of the primary schools , - in which alone nine tenths of the people get all the education they have , and with which alone therefore the State has properly anything to do , - in favor of the advanced or " graded " schools . These he thinks ought to be left to private enterprise . And certainly there is a manifest distinction between the two classes of schools as regards their claims to public support . The community has a direct interest in giving to every one of its members to whom it can he given so much elementary instruction as shall put within his reach the means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is little danger of being too wholesale or indiscriminate here , or of doing the work too thoroughly , , for its efflciency depends on its thoroughness . An education which is not thorough so far as it goes , gives only a stunted and abortive product , and fails of the best fruit of education . We must all be smatterers in many things ; but every man must at some point or other touch the hard pan of unyielding reality , and not be content to let well en6ugh alone , - else he lacks foundation , he is a waverer , never sure of himself , and never surely to be relied on to stand to any conviction he may have . For it is the moral element that avails , - not what is learned , but the temper in which it is learned ; and the habit of looking only to what will serve the turn pervades and vitiates the whole fibre of the mind . But when we come to special preparation for particular tasks or exceptional positions , the case is entirely changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be special qualification as a reason for every step , and the danger from an indiscriminate and wholesale system is immense . No risk need be incurred in strengthening the child 's limbs to run his future course ; but if we are to take him up and carry him forward on his course , we ought to make sure that it is the right course , else every step may be a step farther out of the way . This , however , is just what can not be done by the machinery of public administration , especially in a democracy . Demberacy is not a good contrivance for administration ; in fact , it is probably the worst for that purpose of all forms of government . Perhaps the strongest proof of the inherent virtue of our democracy is , that it can bear such bad administration as seems to be inevitable so soon as we get beyond the sphere of the direct personal interest and immediate agency of the whole people into the spfrere of officials . Upon this point , it seems to us , our author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . lie puts it upon the diversion of public sympathy and support from the primary to the // higher schools ; but this might not be of itself a sufficient objection . The high schools , were they really higher , that is , if they taught better what if behooves everybody to learn , even if they did not come into so direct contact with the people , might yet have-*an indirect effect greater than anything that could be effected directly . The highest motives owe their efficiency with the mass of mankind to their indirect , and as it were refracted influence , in places where they have little direct effect . But the real evil , as it seems to us , is that the so-called advanced education often does not aim at education at all , but at something else ,  - -  at a longer list of accomplishments , excellent perhaps in themselves , and in their proper place important and essential , but , when used in this way as costume or decoration , sure to be the cover for pretence , to distract attention from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderment for the intelligent interest of the public . The radical ailment which our author finds everywhere in the existing state of things is not so much a want of action on the part of the community , as a want of interest . People give their support , but in a heedless , unsympathetic way . They are generally ready enough to vote money for the schools , and they look ( p. 47 ) with a " misty , indefinite respect upon the array of officials , and the manifold involutions of the red tape that connects them together ; but all this will not begin to compensate for the absence of a hearty good-will towards the school , of a discriminating appreciation of its value to them and their children , or of a disposition to co-operate actively in measures which look to its efficiency and gradual improvement . " This want of appreciation , however , is not necessarily connected with any particular list of studies , nor does it follow at all from the fact that the studies are too much advanced for the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to know a good farmer from a bad one . Our fishermen appreciate Agassiz 's mastery readily enough without much knowledge of ichthyology . Superiority of attainment is no bar to a sympathetic appreciation ,  --  on the contrary , assures and strengthens it . But it is easy , under guise of something superior and advanced , to set up , and even to get accepted by the people , somethiug which is merely remote and in no vital connection with their thoughts and feelings , - in which they take no real interest ; but they accept it as an idol , their adoration of which accordingly will not be of an edifying kind . The notion of a higher culture to be bestowed by the more enlightened in the community upon their less favored brethren is plausible , and , in one aspect of it , sound . But then it implies that mankind are really brethren , partakers of one spirit and not merely of one animal organization ; so that whatever is // truth for one may be felt as truth by every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not likely to go out of fashion , for it is the way , and the only way , in which civilization advances ; but the method of this education does not consist , when it is at its best , in substituting the thoughts and feelings of one class of persons for the thoughts and feelings of another class , but in a more just and more vivid appreciation and more thorough realization by the few of the thoughts and feelings of the many ; and the means accordingly will not be the ordinary machinery of the State , for that is applicable only where men can be lumped and treated in the mass , as we treat paupers and criminals . Exceptionally , this may be needful ; as , for instance , in dealing with savages , it may be needful to make them conform to some extent to civilized practices , without much regard to their views or feelings . But such a mode of proceedin* is at best provisional , and only preliminary to any education , for to the same extent it ignores what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine , but only a will ; and education , in proportion as it is passively accepted , instead of being the object of a free and intelligent interest , ceases to be education . The notion of a state education , therefore , seems to rest on a fallacy ; it must be either useless or else injurious ; it is either a mere form , and can accomplish nothing , or else it must be obstructive . Take , for instance , the view lately set forth , in his usual attractive style , by Mr. Matthew Arnold , in the essay entitled " A French Eton . " His proposal , reduced to its simplest terms , is that the middle class in England shall use its control of state action to improve middle-class education . The middle-class spirit , he says , is full of rawness , hardness , and imperfection ; it is under-cultivated , intolerant , bitter , unlovely ; it can not be safely allowed to have its own way , but needs to be transformed by being liberalized , enlarged , ennobled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not by the actual governing class , the aristocrats , for they are all for letting everything alone . Not by the voluntary combination of the middle class itself for voluntary combination is casual and precarious . It must be , he says , by public agency , " by beneficence working by rule . " But why should that be incompatible with voluntary combination ? Why may not what is voluntary be at the same time done by rule ? in other words , Why may , not the free-will of the people be the rule ? Why should it be the will of somebody else , or theirs of another time ? What Mr. Arnold proposes amounts to this , - that the middle class in its corporate capacity should rule to their good the middle-class considered as individuals . But this expedient , though Mr. Arnold treats it as an experiment to be tried , is extremely familiar to us in America . We acknowledge its value , its indispensableness in certain cases ; but // our experience has not led us to extend , but rather to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it useful , but dangerous . It is good for the custom-house , and for carrying the mails , though even here we feel its dangers ; it is good , in short , for the daily chores of life , which must be done and may safely be left to machinery , but not for the more vital functions ; so that we have restricted it more and more , and even recklessly as it has sometimes seemed , in our anxiety to keep it from intrudin* where it might do fatal mischief . We treat it rather as an indispensable evil , than as a good ; not at all as beneficent where it can be avoided . The danger apprehended , however , is not , as Mr. Arnold seems to fancy it is , the danger of active interference on the part of the state with the liberty of individuals , but of apathy , the creeping in of a lazy habit of regarding public affairs as if they concerned each man only in his corporate capacity , as tax-payer , voter , legislator , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among individuals . Whatever threatens this result , whatever threatens to substitute the tax-payer for the man , to make private persons look upon public questions as something which they do not need to understand ,  --  as the business of a board or of a state official , and not their business , - is much more to be dreaded than almost any conceivable faults of administration ; it is the beginning of ossification , or of " fatty degeneration , " in the body politic . Our tendency from the beginning has been towards a state of things in which the individual is not to be taken care of but to be forced to take care of himself , and in which his participation in public affairs is not limited to concurring from time to time in a rule made for the general guidance , but is felt to bring with it an unceasing personal responsibility for the rule , - that it shall not be fixed once for all , but shall keep pace with his advancing convictions . The early legislation for the schools in the Puritan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were compelled to teach their children and apprentices , and the towns to make provision for schools . But what was it that was to be taught ? Not merely a catechism or a code ; these could have been taught more easily without teaching the children to read or write , and more safely , for the dan* , er from the paternal point of view was , to say the least , as great from too much as from too little learning . For with these potent arts a power was placed in every hand against which no institution , no authority , was safe , but thenceforth must stand upon truth and reason , and not upon reverence or upon force . Individual conviction was placed first , and the corporation second . It may be said , nothing of the kind was intended hy the Puritans ; at any rate this was what they did , and this made what was done memorable . And their // 1866 . The Daily Public School in the United States . tone and the way they went about the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What gave grandeur to the idea of the New England school system was the scope of it . It was not a special provision for a class , nor even for a community , but it was put at once on the ground that education is needful to all men , everywhere , and the want of it barbarism . And had the object been a system of beneficence working by rule , it would have been better to place the whole matter in the hands of a compact body of state officials , fully possessed of the rule and expert in applying it , instead of leaving it to be spelled out anew for every fresh case . This is what the Roman Catholic Church does ; the Church is sparing of principles , careful in the application of them , and prefers trusting to the trained intelligence , tact , and cumulative experience of a body of functionaries devoted to the purpose , rather than to individual initiative ; very well disposed , accordingly , towards education , meaning by that the imparting of authoritative opinions , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opinions by the mass of the ignorant and vulgar . This method has its peculiar advantages ; it is no doubt the best way of getting any given piece of work done . It is easy to point out the superiority of a corps of experts for the performance of any branch of the public business ; only thus can business be thoroughly organized . The . drawback is , that the function becomes identified with the functionary ,  - -  his faults become part of the system ; nor is this the worst , for not only do his vices and crotchets become rooted and organic , but even his virtues are obstructive , - the nicer the adaptation , the more incapable of expansion and the more inevitable the tendency to routine or to fanaticism . It is a choice of evils ; one set of dangers or the other must always be encountered . We have made an election , and we can not expect to unite inconsistent advantages . In a democracy things must be done democratically , that is , substantially , by those whose interests are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The original scheme of free schools in Massachusetts had nothing in it of the character of a state education ; the officials were town officers , and the money was raised and spent by the towns . In Plymouth Colony , a free school having sprung up apparently without any official sanction whatever , before the townships had acted on the recommendation of the General Court to set up a schoolmaster in each town , the Court , in aiding the school from the profits of the Cape fishery , declared that they did so only " until such time as that the minds of the freemen be known concerning it . " The subject is too wide to be more than touched upon here , but it is worth considering whether the apathy and want of interest complained // of ; and the want of vitality in the schools , may not be in some measure the consequence of departure from the original idea , - wbether , in our zeal to help forward the good cause , and to re-enforce it with material means and appliances , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said ( and the charge was not denied by those best qualified to judge ) to have been " put to sleep " by the State School Fund when it became so large as to supersede the necessity of taxation , and to have awakened only when taxation was resumed . We may think ourselves safe enough in Massachusetts ; but the parental and bureaucratic spirit , where it has any foothold , is plausible and seductive , and needs watching . At all events , the States where the school fund is relatively more considerable , and especially those where large tracts of land have been given by the general government in aid of education , if they have not the good fortune to squander them before they become valuable , will need to exercise this vigilance . And in this connection some of our author 's statistics , although , as already hinted , they are neither so full nor so methodical as could be wished , seem to us instructive . As to the four States which he particularly examines , he tells us that ( p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that 0/ito furnishes one teacher to every thirty-four pupils , at an expense of $ 4 for the year for each child . Pennsylvania allows one teacher to every forty-three pupils , at $ 3.75 for each child . New York gives one teacher to every thirty-four pupils , at $ 3 each ; and Jfassac/lusetts one teacher to every twenty-five pupils , at $ 8 each . " As to the proportion paid by the State , he gives us no available figures for Pennsylvania or Ohio , and for New York only in the " rural districts " ( p. 104 ) , where ( in 1864 ? ) there was paid apparently about $ 1.70 from the State funds , and $ 1.30 raised by taxes and rate-bills for each child . In Massachusetts there was naid in 1863 from the State fund about twenty-one cents for each child , or say one sixteenth as much , compared with the whole sum expended , as in New York . In New York ( 1863 ) " not two thirds " of the children reported between four and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it seems by an average of five years that , of those that go at all , a majority go but for a very short period each year . In Massachusetts the average attendance ( 1862 ) was about four fifths of the number returned between five and fifteen. * In Ohio , where the income of the school fund is one and a half millions , somewhat more than one third of the children between five and twenty-one In 1864 - 65 more than thirteen fourteenths of all persons returned in Massaehu setts as between the ages of five and fifteen attended the public schools in winter , and more than nine tenths in summer . ( Twenty-ninth Annual Report of the Board of Education , p. 13. ) // attended school " once or more during the year . " As to other States we have no data at hand , except a few in the " American Journal of Education , " Vol . I. , whence we extract the following ( 1854 ) . Ia North Carolina the school fund amounts to $ 1,700,000 ; in Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , concerning whose operation there is only the remark that there is " no efficient system of common schools " in the State ; in Alabama there were distributed $ 237,515 , raised by taxes $ 1,300 ; in Mississippi ( 1852 ) $300,000 were distributed . In New Hampshire the whole capital of the perinaneat school fund is $ 16,435 ; raised by taxes for dj.strict schools , $ 231,434 . Without making too much of these scanty data , or going into the questions of cause and effect , they suggest , it seems clear as a matter of fact , that State aid does not of itself lead to good results , and that the best results are reached where the original spirit of reliance upon the towns most prevails . The real efficiency of the schools depends everywhere , at last , upon the personal interest they excite in those who use them ; and this will naturally be greatest where the money spent comes directly from their own pockets . The notion of superseding this sole motive-force in any degree by a piece of machinery that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same fallacy in a reliance on the State as in reliance as a monarch or a patron ; it seems so much force over and above , but the force is wasted in friction and reaction . Our fathers exiled themselves to escape from a state system of religion , and there is no reason why we should look with more favor on a state system of education . This does not mean that men ought not to combine for these ends , but only that they are not to be undertaken by one set of men for another set ; that the combining agency is not to be any external influence , but an inward attraction of each to his proper affair and to others as united in a common interest . The following extract from the Report of the School Committee of Concord for the year 1860-61 seems to us a good summury of what is to be said from this point of view - " We see no reason why the Concord schools should not be made to cover all and more than all that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is much illusion about our high schools and so-called universities . The sciences and the arts taught there can usually be better learned elsewhere by the earnest student . They give golden opportunities , but throw a thousand obstacles in the way of using them . Worst of all , they seem to stifle that enthusiasm for learning and virtue , without which the highest culture is impossible . A Massachusetts township , with its central village , lying in partial seclusion , yet partly connected with the great world , is one of the best universities , or may be made so . In it , by a careful and well-pursued method , we may train our children and youth to far better purpose than most // colleges or cities can do . Nor let it be supposed that such a plan would require great expense , or a condition of things very different from the present . A permanent school committee , representing all interests and all sections of the town ; permanent teachers , who could see the fruit of their labors year after year ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture of the children , with a little change of method and a little lengthening of the time for which children shall he kept at school , - would gradually give us advantages greater than any public or private course of instruction in the State now offers .
