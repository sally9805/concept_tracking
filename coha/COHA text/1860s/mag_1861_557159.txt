The Works of FRANCIS BACON , Baron of Verulam , Viscount of St. Albans , and Lord High Chancellor of England . Collected and edited by JA1tw*S SPEDDING , M.

Vols . XI . - XVI . Boston : Brown and Taggard. 1860 - 61 . THERE is much in the phrase , " a great name . " It is to the credit of our race that a great name has never been acquired but by a great nature . Little natures have had every opportunity , and all that Fate and Fortune Could do for them ; but their names , in the long run , have remained as little as their natures . Tradition is the mother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which her mother gives her . She does not soften it , but she seldom falsifies it . History , born out of Tradition , is the Nemesis of the Past . Let living men beware , if they care for posthumous reputation . There are men *iose voices are heard afar by aid of clap-trap sounding-boards ; but when their voices are silent , their names will be heard no more ; the honest and impartial Future will give no echo to the vociferations of the humbug Present . Wisdom , " saith Holy Writ , " is justified of her children , " 13* // and here we may put " Humanity " for " Wisdom . " Humanity is , upon the whole , charitably generous , but also sternly just ; she pities and protects her dwarfs ; but as she does not give them the soul , neither does she give them the fame of her giants . Nor does she deal ungently with her dwarfs . Generally she glorifies them with a delectable self-consciousness . She makes them think that the local is the universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is power , and that notoriety is fame . To use an illustration from ileine , she sometimes puts the dwarf on the shoulders of the giant , and then the dwarf can see farther than the giant ; but , as Heine says , though the dwarf can see farther than the giant , he has not , and never can have , the giant 's heart . The trust which Bacon had in posterity was worthy of a great nature , and it has been entirely justified by the immortality of his great name . It is a good sign of the times and of our country to have a demand for the words of original and primal minds . If human words were ever from the inspired heart of nature , they were those which came from the pen of Francis Bacon . His is among the few creative minds of the world . They have been , indeed , very few ; but , make them the fewest , his must be among them . Every such mind alarms men , and provokes opposition . Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by so noble a thinker as John Locke . Yet the first efforts of childhood at reasoning prove the rectitude of the syllogism , and all the achievements of philosophy glorify its triumphs , for they all rest on reason , and syllogism is the method and law of reason . So the argument by Induction was as old in action as human nature , but the man who would first push it into practice passed into fame as its originator . Bacon is this originator , and this is his place in modern philosophy . Aristotle was not the inventor of the syllogism , Bacon was not the inventor of induction ; both are equally the children of humanity ; and , to the end of time , all that reason will reason - since they can not reason otherwise - deductively and inductively . Great men of olden times overlooked not the inductive process in thought , but they did not understand its due value ; the fame of Bacon lives in the fact , that of all modern men he , and he alone , gave it forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are issuing the most elegant and complete edition of Bacon 's Works that has ever as yet appeared . It is prepared in England by the united labor of three learned scholars , and is wanting in nothing that ample erudition and critical sagacity can supply . Nor is aught lacking to beauty and convenience which the utmost skill in the externals of book-manufacture can furnish . All that comfort and taste can desire is attained in the size of the volume , the tint and texture of the paper , the correctness and delightful clearness of the printing . It is very remarkable what improvements have of late years been made in the two last particulars , - correctness of type and clearness of letter . The art of printing seemed on its invention to start at once into perfection , manually and mentally . The setter of types and the reader of proofs were , in their respective departments , master-workmen . But then the art began to decline , the artisans became careless , books were confused and dim on the face of the page , and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each volume . It is not so now . Not only have we a distinct and brilliant page , but an admirable accuracy of text . And all this is done so rapidly ! To think of it ! A huge newspaper is printed in a portion of a night , equal to an octavo volume of five hundred pages , containing all forms of composition , from a recondite dissertation to a puff on " The Industrious Fleas , " yet the whole appears at dawn in the most readable type , and void of an important error . This is a modern achievement , not in the least inferior to any of the wonders of which our age can boast , - an achievement in which mind and mechanism must run equally their rapid race together . The stupendous genius of Bacon has never been a matter of doubt or discussion . The impression of its greatness was at once profound and powerful ; it had not , like the genius of many other great men , to await the slow course of time for the revelation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late years have attempted with respect to it has been exposition , - one of the most eloquent of such attempts being that of Lord Macaulay , which , after all , is rather rhetorical than philosophical . This splendid disquisition serves better as a foil than as a commentary , and by contrast shows us the massive // grandeur of Bacon 's mind ; for if a writer of such power and grasp as Macaulay almost appears shallow or impertinent in the effort to estimate the intellect of Bacon , what must be the might and majesty of the intellect that so dwarfs a great author by its presence . When a man of large dimensions seems small beside another , we then apprehend how huge that other is ; for the true size of the symmetrically built giant we do not discern until we see that a burly fellow of six feet looks near him like a boy . And such is the contrast between Bacon and one of his most brilliant and vigorous expounders . The intellectual greatness of Bacon has rarely been questioned by those whose language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Coke may well count for nothing , - nor has it been questioned by foreigners of adequate authority . The intellectual homage to Bacon has been continuous and consentaneons . Considering the magnitude and originality of his mind , this seems at first surprising , since all such minds have in the beginning met with contempt and opposition . But the minds so treated have usually been minds that came into contact with some popular idea , belief , passion , or prejudice ; or , quite as bad , perhaps worse , with established interests or professional traditions . Copernicus , Tycho Brahe , Galileo , Harvey , and others , were men of this order . Their discoveries in science were demonstrative , and irritatingly touched the nerves of the ordinary faiths and experiences . They at once provoked anger as offensive innovations , and their authors were regarded as insolent dictators . But Bacon , though intellectually the radical of radicals , did not come into contact with those sensitive points of professional jealousy and popular alarm . His thinking was not specific , but generic ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or this point or that he would establish ; he preached no new creed , he taught no new philosophy . What he did aim at , and what he did accomplish , was to institute new tests of evidence , and a new method of philosophizing . His comprehensiveness saved him from those immediate hostilities to which men more definitely scientific were exposed ; and he had not to wait for his fame until progressive knowledge had forever put to silence sophistical pretenders and ignorant gainsayers . Then , deep and broad as the genius of Bacon is ,  --  re // mote , too , and recondite , as in many qualities it is , - it has also elements in it that are near to humanity , that instanfly excite applause , and that stir the sympathetic admiration of every age . His was a genius , great not only in " the large discourse of reason , " but quick with intellectual emotion , thoughtfully and most humanly wise , as eloquent as it was speculative , and picturesque in all the vivid and concrete analogies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature could supply . He was , withal , an orator , a lawyer , a courtier , a statesman , a man of high birth , a man of high rank , a man at last of the highest secular office , next to royalty , - always a man of business and of the world . The teacher of a new scientific truth is , in most cases , very differently related to his contemporaries . He is generally a recluse , usually silent , shy , and poor ; far away from the mass , often suspected by the few , and having his methods of expression in formulas and symbols that have no alliance with coiumon language , and that can not be interpreted to the common mind . All this the genius of Lord Bacon escaped , original and wonderful as it was , because , supreme though it was in reason and thought , it was no less so in fancy and imagination . It was marvellous in new and grand ideas ; but they were such ideas as easily transfused themselves into eloquence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the ideas . About the intellectual genius of Bacon , we repeat , there has been and there is no ' dispute . But so it has not been as to his moral character . That this should be at all disputed , is presumptively unfavorable to Bacon ; for genius like his is not severely judged , and an immortal fame can cover a multitude of sins . There is a cant which insists that the world is jealous of its great minds , scanty in praise , plentiful in censure , unjust in judgment , and unmerciful in penalty . This , like all cant , is false . There are great minds , indeed , which the world does not easily or readily understand , and in its ignorance it often acts toward them with injustice , sometimes even with cruelty . But Bacon does not belong to this order of minds . He was not an outlaw from the world by daring novelties either in science or in creed ; on the contrary , he was an active citizen of the world , by office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world heartily admires , even when it can not fully comprehend them , he was one of its acknowledged magnates . To genius which the world can thus feel it is commonly more than indulgent . The errors of such genius are not merely overlooked . Sometimes they are admired , even imitated , and very dark sins are often lost to sight in the halo of its splendor . Men of brilliant genius can almost with impunity be guilty of conduct which would consign ordinary men to hard and hopeless condemnation . Thus it may be , either because the general moral sense is weak against the strength of mental power , or because such power charms and deceives the general conscience , or because there is a spiritual and human worth in such power that outmeasures and outweighs its vices . We have no time for theoretical explanation ; but the fact is , men of eminent and vivid genius are not so often neglected sufferers or persecuted martyrs , as they are spoiled and petted favorites . Examples could be cited , but the citation is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been otherwise treated , he is a strange exception among the great minds whose power has acted directly on the living world , and against whom the living world had no hatred or strife of controversy . It is strange that , if he was comparatively blameless , obloquy should have fallen on his name in his own day , and have clouded his memory ever since . And yet we might refer to the instance of Bacon himself , as an illustration of our idea on the general reverence for greatness and genius . Granting , for the sake of argument , that the accusations against him were calumnies , they have generally obtained credence . But in spite of this belief , his name is held in veneration , and his supposed misdeeds are so referred to , even by those who have judged him the most severely , as to seem of no account in the measure and the majesty of his gifts and acquisitions . In our day there prevails a strong desire to reconsider and reverse historical and traditional verdicts . Thomas Carlyle is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the force of a mind singularly learned , eloquent , actualizing , and dramatic ; and yet the process shows in our time a want // of imaginative and ideally creative power . In the sphere of mind , men do not now make , so much as criticise ; and , with an immense activity of reasoning , they set themselves to take the historical and traditional Past to pieces . This method has been applied to absolve the memory of monsters ; and why should it not be applied to exalt the memory of the mighty ? Robespierre , it has been made out , was an ascetic patriot . Why should not Attila by and by become a long-seeing civilizer , and his sword of merciless slaughter be considered as the sword of a merciful reform ? Let Bacon have all the benefit which such criticism can give him . Our own humble idea is , that hc* does not need it . He himself left his memory to posterity , and posterity has substantially done it justice . Such a man is above all personal advocates ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned humanity ; and that jury is sure to do him full and impartial right . Bacon has been attacked in some assailable points of his character . We do not remember that any of his assailants ever , on the whole , failed to admire him , or to pity him with the pity of admiration . Whenever they have mentioned what they considered his faults , they have done so as believing that the faults were proved ; and this certainly they had reason to believe , not only from the most solemn judicial verdict , but from the most painful personal confession . Their spirit has not been the spirit of accusation , but rather that of apology , and though they have earnestly stated , they have not vindictively urged , what they could not honestly defend . But some say now that all this was wrong . One recent defender of Bacon maintains that the highest intellect implies association with the highest virtue . Perhaps so ; but this makes no allowance for human infirmities and for casual lapses . The whole mental and moral history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united with occasionally mean or evil doings . David had a great intellect and an inspired soul ; yet he seduced the wife of the brave Uriah , let Uriah sleep at his chamber-door , and sent him back to the ranks , in which he boldly battled , charged with a letter for his own assassination . We say that Solomon was wise ; but that does not hinder us from saying that Solomon // was also wicked ; yet wickedness is always folly , - Solomon himself being the judge . These instances might be carried link by link along the chain of history . We content ourselves with two or three more cases . Julius Oa*sar was possessed of high intellect . But though he was one of the noblest of IRomans , one among the greatest of great men , his treacheries and cruelties make us almost ashamed of human nature . The elder Cato , a man of strong intellect , was hardhearted , and a miser . Brutus , so lauded for his patriotism , was yet not unwilling to turn an " honest penny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the subject of eulogy in this recent remodelled criticism , was , according to all trustworthy evidence , a flirt , a coquette , a virago , a despot , of harsh temper , of exacting manners ; of whims and jealousies more than feminine , yet of stern hardness of heart more than masculine ; a mongrel tyrant between the sexes , of which authentic history gives no similar example . Yet no writer tells the truth who denies to Elizabeth high and commanding powers of intellect . Mr. llepworth Dixon , notable as the opponent of Macaulay on the character of William Penn , has undertaken to vindicate what he thinks the long-slandered character of Bacon . The English edition is brilliantly reproduced by Messrs . Ticknor and Fields , who may truly be called the Belles-Lettres publishers of America . The book is full of zeal , ardor , and admiration . No doubt can be entertained of its sincerity . Every line of it shows the impassioned love of the author for his subject . There is nothing which enthusiasm and research could do that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an immortal name . With what success he has done this , we must leave his readeis to decide . We must say - ungracious as the saying may seem , and unwillingly as we declare it - that the premises of his arguments do not lead us to his conclusions . This , of course , may be our fault , and not his . " I am bound , " said Dr. Johnson to an opponent , " to furnish you with arguments , but I am not bound to furnish you with brains . " If we do Mr. Dixon injustice , we are willing to take the ignominious side of this position . // We admit his minute and Careful research . It must have been a wearisome toil to mouse among the mouldy documents of the State-Paper Office . But what are these researches worth ? For some bald facts they may be of value , - for opinions and deductions they are worth nothing . All contradictories of English historical theories can be proved from the English State-Paper Office . Thomas * Becket may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . a cruel tyrant ; or , on the other hand , Henry II . may be shown to be a patient sovereign , and Thomas * Becket an ambitious , ungrateful , and upstart churchman . We are now told on such authority that Henry VIII . was an amiable and a popular king , and that he did not marry and execute his wives and faithful slaves without the best of reasons . There is no character so dark or gross that it may not be illumined and beautified by a dexterous use of the State Papers ; nor is there any character so true and lovely , that may not in the same way be blackened and befouled . The best Protestants appear as miscreants in records of the reign of Mary , and in those of the reign of Elizabeth , martyred Catholics appear only as conspirators and traitors . The author 's manner is unfavorable to his purpose , at least with sober and reflective minds . A style so vehement and convulsive is not the style to impress inquiring and earnest thinkers . Throughout his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one-sided controversialist , and uses all the ingenuities of a special pleader . Bacon with him is everything that is good and great . " Of no sect , " says the author , " he represents in Parliament the patriotic spirit of all the sects . Not himself a Puritan , he pleads with Hastings for reform ; not himself a Roman Catholic , he lifts his voice against persecution for concerns of faith ; not a courtier , he votes with Cecil for supplies . " All this is historic fancy . The assertions have no sufficieiit proof from history . If that proof is worth anything , it broadly goes to show that Bacon was wanting in heroic moral qualities ; that in the presence of power he was timid and infirm , and that , had his ethical courage been equal to his intellect , he might possibly have done as much for the reformation of society as for that of science . But he was in his active life nothing of a hero , whatever he was in his // contemplative . Arbitrary disregard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the multitude , hard-hearted indifference to the infliction of pain and death , distinguished the rulers of his time ; appropriate institutions of the time were therefore the Star-Chamber , the rack , the dungeon , illegal and irresponsible imprisonment , a disgusting favoritism that was a shame to national character , and selfish monopolies that were destructive to national industry and commerce ; yet we do not find that to these vices and abuses Bacon offered or attempted to offer any open resistance . We have no more doubt that he , speculatively , was tolerant , than we have that he was intellectually great and wise ; we believe also that by nature he was merciful and humane ; but still we have no evidence that he met the spirit of tyranny , of bigotry , and of persecution in his day with any direct or vigorous opposition . He knew well the folly and the wickedness of persecution ; but he did not remonstrate against it , he did not in protest , action , or indignation put his august authority on the side of human nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhuman spirit which ruled in high places . It may be said that the age and its circumstances were against him . But if he was in intellect immeasurably beyond the age , why was he not also in his moral nature transcendently above it ? Goodness and justice are the highest truth of life , and the great man to whom glory is given because he reaches far beyond the age in the truth of science , can not have the age for his apology , if he miserably falls short of this truth of life . A great lover of truth should be a lover of all truth , a doer of the truth as well as a thinker of it , of practical as well as speculative truth , of truth that is manifested in action , as well as of that which is proved by demonstration . But all that Bacon did not give to philosophy he gave to his own personal affairs . He was intent on office and promotion . He was thwarted and impeded in his struggles by jealous and inferior men , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its natural position . This urgency for place , and the constant effort against obstruction , may have hindered the more free and noble culture and expression of his moral nature , and may have trained him into habits of caution , cQmpliance , and // subserviency , which did not radically belong to his character , - may have hindered the world from giving to the man the same admiration it gives to the thinker . As it is , nothing so proves the wonderful spontaneity of intellect in Bacon as the fact that his grandest speculations were merely incidental divertisements amidst the toils of his official engagements and his political ambitions . Mr. Dixon is a stanch friend and a good hater . Bacon is his client . He seems to thiiik that Bacon is on his trial , and that he ( Mr. Dixon ) is the man called by the predestination of history to defend him . He is stalwart and brave in his selfelected vocation . But he means to make out a case for his client at any cost . It is not enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat down the character of every one else with whom Bacon comes into contest . We had all supposed that Lord Essex was rash and wrong , unwise , imprudent , though of a generous temper . We had imagined that he held a sort of friendship for Bacon , and we think that the part which Bacon took against him in the fatal political prosecution has been always regarded as much in sorrow as in anger . But all this pathos and poetry of history and tradition , of ballad and drama , disappear in Mr. Dixon 's critical analysis . " Essex is poor . Dress , dinners , horses , courtesans , exhaust his coffers . If he can not pay in coin , he will in place . His servant Francis Bacon shall be the Queen 's solicitor . Essex swears it . " Such is the manner in which the author presents the relations between Bacon and Lord Essex , and it is certainly not very honorable to either sjde . Essex pledges himself to Bacon for a place ; and Bacon , in that expectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , as Essex fails to obtain the promised appointment , the nobleman must otherwise pay his agent and attorney . We repeat that this representation gives no honor to either party ; for while it denies all generosity to Essex , it takes away all disinterestedness and dignity from Bacon . Essex was Bacon 's employer , and Bacon was the hired mercenary of Essex . This relation of the parties is stated by the author with still greater clearness and fulness in another passage - " Unable to pay his debt by a public office , Essex feels that he ought // to pay it in money , or in money 's worth . The lawyer has done his work , must be told his fee . But the Earl has no funds . His debts , his amours , his camp of servants , eat him up . He will pay in a patch of land . To this Bacon objects ; not that he need scruple at taking wages , not that the mode of payment is unusual , not that the price is beyond his claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . To pay in land is the fashion of a time when gold is scarce and soil is cheap . Nor is the patch too large ; at most , it may be worth ? 1,200 or ? 1,500 . After Bacon 's improvements and the rise of rents , he sells it to Reynold Nicholas for ? 1,800 . It is less than the third of a year 's income from the Solicitor-General 's place. ** So here are two great Englishmen , of high birth , talent , and position , engaged in the meanest barter , - the one willing to pay for service with an office , the other willing to accept the payment , and , when he can not get it , taking in its stead a paltry compensation . Both men were base , or the age itself was so base as to nullify all reasoning about it which assumes a high standard of character . If Essex was bad through the corruption of the age , Bacon was hardly better . If there was a deluge of general depravity , both morally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral or historic ark which could be launched to save the character and memory of the one , which ought not to save the character and memory of the other . One thing is clear , - such a compact imposed on neither side iioble or chivalric obligations . If the author 's statements are true , History has made a radical mistake , and a vast amount of sentiment and poetry has been worse than wasted . When , therefore , Essex was prosecuted for high treason , there was nothing to hinder Bacon from engaging in the case , more than any other lawyer who sought for office and worked for fees . It is said in favor of Bacon , that he kept in the background , and seemed to have small liking for his function . It is said also in his favor , that he went through his melancholy task with all due courtesy and moderation . We know that the contrary has also been said , but we are willing to believe the most generous representation . If , however , Bacon was mild to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his memory . According to his picture , Essex must be placed amongst the darkest villains of history . If history had a daguerrotype // gallery for its scoundrels , such as police offices have for rogues , Essex , according to the limning of Mr. Dixon , should have his portrait hung near to those of Guy Fawkes and Catiline . Yet men will cherish traditional illusions , and even live in them . Do what you may , you can not disenchant them . Deep and deadly toward all social and conservative interests as are offences against the state , you can not transfer to political crimes the infamy of personal ones . When , therefore , it so happens that political criminals have qualities which secure men 's affection and admiration , legal or ethical reasoning goes for nothing against the power of sympathy ; and sympathy will rule wherever there is no antagonist passion , - nay , it will survive when every antagonist passion has long been dead . It is therefore a misfortune to the memory of any man , when he has been engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prosecutor conducts himself otherwise than in a spirit of elevated rectitude and official disinterestedness . Bad as was Catiline , Cicero has not entirely escaped censure as to speeches and actions against him . There can be no doubt concerning the legal guilt of Robert Emmett ; yet the great fame of Plunkett has never been able to throw off the load of obloquy heaped upon his memory by the speech which he made against the unfortunate and youthful culprit . Many lies were told about Plunkett 's relation to the case and to Emmett 's family , which , years afterward , the great orator took the trouble to refute . But , if we may use a vulgarism , we would say , " Such refutations will not stay refuted " ; the old popular convictions will re-appear , and no learned replies will put them down . These convictions become all the more obstinate , when it is seen that interest and ambition have been on the side of the pleader . No impartial persons now suspect the honesty of Plunkett as to the political sentiments which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech was not a forensic necessity , and politically it served his wealth and his ambition . The same , in the general estimate , was the case with Bacon in relation to Essex . If the part which he took on that occasion did not directly promote , it was coincident with , his objects of wealth and of ambition . Such circumstances are always suspicious . The purest and the most sin-14* // cere may thus encounter undeserved odium . The remark which Dr. Johnson makes on the change of Dryden 's religion , involves the principle that we have been here expounding . " That conversion , " he observes , " will always be suspected that apparently concurs with interest . He that never finds his error till it hinders his progress towards wealth or honor , will not be thought to love truth only for herself . " Under Mr. Dixon 's guidance we come to the following results : Lord Essex was a profligate nobleman ; Bacon was his hired servant ; Bacon expected great reward , but had at last to put up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out the naughtiness of Essex , and soberly counselled him on the errors of his ways ; naughty Essex did not heed the counsels , but rather grew naughtier and naughtier ; he in fact became a wicked conspirator , - and Bacon , pure and patriotic , in the love of queen and country , righteously used his supreme eloquence against a man whom he had once regarded as a friend , and who had been supposed his benefactor . We do not believe that men will generally take the side of Mr. Dixon in this controversy . Their repugnance to it may , indeed , be prejudice ; if so , it is a prejudice that does not speak badly for human nature . That Bacon was commanded by the queen to do what he did , has small force against this prejudice . Bacon , as Mr. Dixon represents , was no timid friend ; but he was a brave and loyal subject . Bacon , according to the author , was never a timeserver or a fiattere# . Yet Bacon , as can be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulsome terms of eulogy , even on matters in which he must have known that James was a charlatan . Bacon must have thoroughly known James , known him exactly as he was ; for his insight into character was as keen as his intelligence of nature was comprehensive . ( Yet he addresses extravagant praise to this timid tyrant , this shambling autocrat , this unbelieving persecutor , this silly twaddler , this white-livered bigot , this ungodly egotist , this measureless and unscrupulous liar , this unmanly abortion , born without natural courage or natural affections , this maudlin master of dirty favorites , this learned monkey , this strutting incarnation of all // wretched vanities and contemptible pretensions . Such is the creature whom the mighty Bacon deigns to applaud . James , forsooth , was the second Solomon ; but that did not hinder him from slowly wearing out in prison the best years of IRaleigh , and from at last , in a spirit cowardly and cruel , sending him to the scaffold ; it did not hinder him from draining the resources of the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not hinder him from torturing poor Peacham , and sending to the stake Legat and Wrightman . This James , whom Bacon never resists , has the unenviable distinction of being among the latest European potentates who burned men for religions opinion , and who continued the use of torture . Partisanship or hero-worship has in our time become a prevailing spirit in history and in biography . Calm and impartial truth few writers are willing to find out or tell against the era which they patronize , or the idols to which they bow down . There are Protestant historians and novelists who can see only righteousness and glory in the reign and character of Queen Elizabeth ; Catholic historians and novelists who see only piety and purity in the character and the reign of Mary . Yet in the reign of Mary Protestants were burned by hundreds , and in the reign of Elizabeth Catholics were also by hundreds racked , hunted , hanged , - all , not only with the consent , but with the approval of these unnatural women . Lord Burleigh , as Hallam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of torture in England . It was only a very gentle sort of torture . This puts us in mind of an incident . " By the by , " said one young man to another , " are not you married ? " " Yes , " replied the other , " moderately . " So it was with Lord Burleigh 's torture . The government tortured only " moderately . " ; no man , woman , or child was injured by it . Here is the case of a tortured woman , who was bruised to death in York , March 25th , 1586 , as described by an eyewitness - " The place of execution was the tolbooth , six or seven yards from the prison . After she had prayed , Fawcett , one of the sheriffs , commanded them to put off her apparel ; when she , with four women , requested him on their knees that , for the honor of womanhood , this might be dispensed with . But they would not grant it . Then she // requested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn their faces from her during that time . " The women took off her clothes , and put upon her the long linen habit . Then very quietly she laid herself down upon the ground , her face covered with a handkerchief , and most part of her body with the habit . The door was laid upon her ; her hands she joined towards her face . Then the sheriff said , Nay , ye must have your hands bound . ' Then two sergeants parted her hands , and bound them to two posts . After this they laid weight upon her , which when she first felt she said , Jesu , Jesu , Jesu , have mercy upon me ! ' which were the last words she was heard to speak . She was in dying about one quarter of an hour . A sharp stone as much as a man 's fist had been put under her back ; upon her was laid seven or eight hundred weight , which breaking her ribs caused them to break forth of the skin . " This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rich citizen of York , who , for standing mute , suffered the peine forte et dure . ' She had harbored a priest in quality of a schoolmaster ; and at the bar refused to plead guilty , because she knew that no sufficient proof could be brought against her , or not guilty , because she deemed such a plea equivalent to a falsehood. " - Lingard 's History of England , Vol . Viii . pp. 473 , 474 . Blackstone maintains that torture is contrary to the letter and the spirit of English law . ilallam contends for the same doctrine . English law holds human life sacred , and not to be taken , until crime , legally proved , subjects the culprit to the penalty of death . Even on simple , painless examination , no man by English law is obliged to criminate himself , - how much less then , by agony , to accuse himself and others ? The individual right to life involves , as Blackstone teaches , that of health and limb ; all such rights are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be considered innocent until he is upon sufficient evidence *condemned . Old Burleigh asserts that no torture was used in England so as to cause bodily hurt or injury to a*y person . It flattened , however , the body of poor Margaret Middleton , and crushed the life out of her . The atrocious absurdity was carried into the reign of James I. We have still in existence manual evidence of the paralyzed and dislocated wreck in which it left the man to whom it was applied . Before Guy Fawkes was put to the " question , " he wrote his name with a bold and firm hand ; but he could not afterward stagger through a portion of it . // Mr. Dixon re-tries the case of old Peacham , and not at all to the advantage of old Peacham , nor , as we think , very successfully to the vindication of Francis Bacon , of Bacon 's coofficials , or of the king . We think that this historic and moral accusation remains unrelieved , and the guilt of the parties concerned in it involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set aside , such as nature must always abhor , such as the moral sense of mankind execrates , such as every advancing age must regard with increasing disapproval , with wondering and indignant sorrow . Yet the fact of great men 's taking part in the crimes of their age against human nature , is not so lamentable as the modern sophistries by which the criminals are defended . Those great criminals may have been wrong by perversion , by mistake , or by means of influences and temptations which overruled their better knowledge , and which they had not strength of conscience to resist . But when advocates not only excuse but justify them , not only justify but glorify them , these advocates are false to the instincts of history , and this falsehood tends to corrupt the moral sense of the present age , and to confuse our moral judgment upon past ages . Who can doubt that Bacon as a man felt that torture was inhuman , - that as an historian he knew that it was not customary in England , but unusual , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English kings , which recommend merciful justice , and denounce cruelty , in the administration of law , - that as a jurist he was aware that torture was not consonant with English law , that it was a despotic assumption , a savage and illegal innovation ? If then , in spite of human feeling , history , scholarship , and law , he gives torture the sanction of his presence and authority , why should he not suffer the penalty which posterity inflicts on the wrong-doing which connects itself with immortal names ? We would willingly enter no further into this matter ; - but leaving it here , we should not be int*lligible as to the ground of our statements and conclusions . We will therefore briefly present this Peachain case , first in its broad historic view , and secondly in Mr. Dixon 's special view . Edmund Peacham was an old clergyman of Somersetshire . He was not , it seems , contented with the government or the // times , and he scribbled very hard sayings about them in the privacy of his study . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never published , and , as the author averred , never intended to be preached or to be published . The man became suspected , and his papers were seized . In the course of this sermon he spoke with contempt of James 's life , of his prodigality and follies , of his favorites and dogs . He wounded the vanity of James , and this must have been a direful offence . The old man was dragged to London , and committed to the Tower . The king would have it that his crime was high treason , and wrote a tract - " The True State of the Question " - to prove it . Coke , the Chief Justice , would not admit that such was the true state of the question . In his judgment the offence was a criminal slander , but not high treason . James loved argument , but , like every weak reasoner , he had a hard will and a vindictive temper . Old Peacham was put to the torture , and was examined , according to Secretary Winwood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and after torture . " Bacon was present . He was also the agent of the king to consult with the judges separately , one by one , on this case . Every person ought now to be aware that , in the days of James , such consultation implied - whenever the crown and the subject were opposed - both threatening and command . Yet the mighty Bacon was agent in such a business . Coke declared this proceeding illegal . Old Peacham was carried back to Somersetshire , was there tried for high treason , was found guilty , was not sent to execution , but saved all his prosecutors the last remorse of shedding an old man 's blood , by dying soon after in Taunton jail . The verdict of a coroner 's jury might properly be : " Died by the visitation of God , of torture , imprisonment , and old age . " The king had his way and will ; he defined treason as he pleased , and he had judicial and executive officers to give to his way and will the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is Mr. Dixon 's view : - " Evidence remains in the books at Wells , and in the records oC her Majesty 's State-Paper Office , to prove that he was one of the most despicable wretches who ever brought shame and trouble on the Church . It is there seen that he was a libeller . It is there seen that he was a // liar . It is there seen that he was a marvel of ' turbulence and ingratitude It is in evidence that he outraged his bishop by a scandalous personal libel , and that he did his worst to get the patron to whom he owed his living hung . " We care nothing about the character of old Peacham , except as statements about it have reference to the principles of historical and moral reasoning . We submit that these are general assertions ; they are not specific statements , and are not supported by specific proofs . Old Peacham may , for aught we know , have been a sad sinner ; but we do know that any clergyman writing against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diocesan record , and that any man writing against " Prerogative " in the time of James could not have in the " State Papers " a good character . Peacham did indeed criminate persons ; but it was not till after torture , and we read that in such circumstances people have , in the worst way , criminated themselves . This monstrous old Peacham , Mr. Dixon informs us , declared that " the king himself was a creature not alone unfit to reign , but unworthy to bear the name of Christian or of man , " - all of which we " most potently and powerfully believe " ; and we hold , moreover , that , if not prudently , it was " honestly set down . " " Winwood , " says the author , " put him under question ; when the odious old sinner falls into deeper and more odious sin . " The odious old sinner , put into terror of his life , no doubt tells all the lies which he thinks will cause his tormentors to spare him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informs us : " Peacham must be interrogated as Guy Fawkes was interrogated . " The italics are ours , and we hope that our readers will keep in mind what we have said on the interrogation of Guy Fawkes . Immediately preceding this terrible phrase the author says : - " Here are seditious libels against the crown , of ' which Peacham asserts that he shares the authorship with Sydenham and the privity with Paulett and Berkeley . How is Winwood to prove the mystery ? The law has but one course . Peackam must be interrogated as Guy Fawkes was interrogated . " And this is set down by a writer of the nineteenth century . It is not true . English law was , in the torture of Peacham , or of any one , grossly violated . It is hardly so had that James // caused the violation , or that Bacon witnessed it , as that any man in our day should call the abominable atrocity by the sacred name of law . Whether old Peacliam was virtuous or vicious , we think that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the end , but we have the best authorities for saying that he was illegally treated . Bacon consented to it all ; in thus giving to injustice his agency and authority , he made himself a culprit before the moral judgment of history ; and this historic verdict Mr. Dixon has not refuted or reversed . Did Bacon in his judicial capacity accept brib ' *s ? This vexed and painful question has been so often and so thoroughly discussed , that we will not here open it again , and we wish that it had long ago been given to the charity of silence . We do not think that , as to the substantial accusation , the minute inquiries and distinctions of Mr. Dixon have in the least cleared the memory of Bacon . The income of judges was , lie says , in the time of Bacon , derived from fees , as that of attorneys and counsellors is in our own time . There is here no just analogy . The payment of a judge by fees has no likeness to the payment of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties the relation of impersonal and immutable justice . This is the ideal of a judge ; and notwithstanding the many gross contradictions to it in fact , the least civilized races and ages hold to it in principle . If such an official is paid by fees , they are established by some rule , which he does not make , and can not honorably violate . Even in our own day there are offices , which are at least semijudicial , that have incomes from fees , but to whose incumbents no suspicion of dishonor does on that account adhere . An advocate is very differently situated from a judge . His talent is at his own disposal , and whatever people are willing to pay for the use of it he can honorably accept . If two parties wish to engage him , he has the choice between them , and , without any social blame , he may take the side on which he receives the largest fee . But to do this would be the direst infamy in a judge . Moreover , an advocate must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that party he is bound honestly to do his best . An honest judge can belong to neither party , and as he can not equitably take money from either // party for justice , neither can he for his talent . The laborer is indeed worthy of his hire ; but the labor of a judge is sacred , and he must take no hire which would throw even the shadow of suspicion on its sacredness . The advocate disputes ; the judge decides . The advocate is , by necessity , a partisan ; the judge is , or ought to be , the trusted representative of social equity , and his official character should be a security for universal confidence . Even an advocate is under bonds and conditions . He must not take wages , and be unequal to his work . He must not take wages , and be negligent of his work . In the one case he is an impostor , and in the other he is a rogue . He must not take money from opposing parties , for then he enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rogue . A fee may be no more dishonorable to a judge than it would be to an advocate , but there must be this difference : the fee to the judge must be a legal and a fixed one ; the fee to the advocate is personal , voluntary , and subject to the marketable values of ability , reputation , and success . If the judge accepts from any party that which the state does not allow him , he violates his trust , he abuses his office , and he takes a bribe . If the . state does allow to its magistracy the liberty of receiving indiscriminate bounties from suitors , the state is worse than barbarous , is below a condition of law , and wanting in that which is the essential life of a state , - an organic constitution for the due and impartial administration of justice . " Bribe " is a hard word . It is a term from which the basest and the most corrupt men shrink . The vulgar malefactor who sells the testimony or perjury which sends his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even to himself , that the price paid him was a bribe : it was simply a reward . Calcraft , the notorious English executioner , would consider it foul insult if the exorbitant hire of his hangmanlabor were called a bribe . It is merely a professional honorarium . The rascal who barters his vote , whether as elector or representative , for money or for office , will not in the secrecy of his own mind confess that he has been bribed . His pay or place he can not bear to regard as venal ; the pay was only recompense for his time and trouble ; the place was due // to his abilities . And we must say , that in these vile matters the lowly sinners are not the worst . Poveriy is in itself a dire temptation , and in lowly transgressors it is often poverty that consents , and not the will . For this reason , if for no other , while we punish the lowly , we must not spare the exalted . It is right that a venal motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bribe " is such a word . It is a plain word , a short word , a strong word , and it is no wonder that even villains shrink from it . An assassin may be hired , but he can not endure to think that he is bribed . A criminal more guilty than ten thousand assassins may sell his honor and betray his country , yet he will not recognize that the dirty wealth which has been thrown to him , as burglars would throw poisoned pudding to a dog , was a " bribe , " a deadly deception , which kills while it satiates . So strong in human nature , so obstinate in the " last recesses of the mind , " is the sense of honor and conscience , that men , and women too , who most basely violate it , seek for terms which disguise the violation . They can commit the sin , but they revolt at the word which distinctly defines it . They seek to save some remnant of self-respect by translating the names of their vices into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which they would hide their shame . " Bribe " is truly an infamous word ; and to apply it lightly to the character of others may be almost as bad as to deserve its application to one 's own character . We do not wish to accuse Bacon of bribery in the worst sense . We allow much for the manners of the day . We take also into account the peculiar temperament of the man . His tastes were on a large scale , as well as his thinking . The age was not wealthy . Yet from men of station it demanded enormous expenditure . Bacon in this respect entered fully into the spirit of his age . He had an innate sense of true beauty and true grace ; yet withal he loved the show , the pomp , and the magnificence which the age exacted from its aristocracy . He spent lavishly , and he had never spared ; he was in money matters simple , careless , and easy : so he got thoughtlessly into difficulties , then into temptation , then suddenly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreseeing and great though it was , did not anticipate or measure . The vindication of // truth and justice does not require that we should condemn Bacon as mean and sordid ; but neither does the best apology for Bacon demand that we should pronounce him upright and innocent . Bacon , no doubt , generous and good-natured , suffered much through the vices of his servants ; and he , the grand iconoclast of mental idols , became himself the victim of social falsehoods and illusions . If Bacon was as entirely clear in the grave affair of presentswe will not call them bribes - as Mr. Dixon would have us to believe , then his character is the most marvellous puzzle and paradox in history , and history itself may fitly be considered as no better than au old almanac . If Bacon took only customar* fees , then he was in no sense to blame , and he should have stood manfully on his integrity , He should have defied his accusers , and , with the right upon his side , he must have beaten them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been so unanimously against him . It seems to have been so hopeless a case as to reduce even friends to silence . That Bacon should have been so deserted in his hour of sorrow is passing strange . If he had only done what all other judges were habitually doing , it seems impossible that he could ever have been driven into this indefensible position . Bacon , on the showing of Mr. Dixon , was not an unpopular or unloved man ; why theii was there no public protest against this treatment of him ? That the Lords and Commons of England , as well as the public , should conspire for the ruin of a lofty and admired man , is a problem which we can not solve , or even understand . Bacon was envied . So is every man , small or great , who has advantages over others . The man who wears by necessity a dirty shirt envies the man who regularly wears a clean one ; the man who has but one shirt envies the man who has a dozen ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shirt envies the man who possesses the whole garment . It is the same with mental and social advantages . But no envy of Bacon 's mental or social superiority can account for the general assent to his condemnation . There was no popular dislike to him , and at court there was against him no vindictiveness . If the king did not deeply understand him , or cordially like him , he seemed most sincerely to admire him , and gave him the fullest // confidence . Yet this king , despotic as he was , had to succumb before the strength of the prosecution ; but by the intervention of his pardoning prerogative he generously shielded Bacon from the worst of the terrible sentence pronounced against him . This proves that against Francis Bacon there was no severe or bitter feeling in the heart of the king ; and that the royal clemency was never censured , shows that against Francis Bacon there was no severe or bitter feeling in the heart of the nation . The greatest difficulty in this problem , however , is the confession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that confession , or he did not . If he told the truth , he was guilty ; if he did not tell the truth , he was a liar , a coward , and a hypocrite . The defenders of Bacon 's absolute innocence provoke the statement of this unworthy alternative , and fix upon him , by their side of the dilemma , a baseness of which the severest of his critics have never accused him . They would , in fact , justify the superlative epithet of contempt which constitutes the point of Pope 's famous line . Pope usually thought more of pungency than of truth , as most wits do . The line is really unworthy of serious notice , and has had no lasting influence against the genuine fame of Bacon . With this even Bacon 's own deepest faults do not interfere . Give him credit for sincerity in the confession of them , there is moral sublimity in the sadness of his contrition , and an everlasting lesson to the world . Refuse such credit , sophisticate motive , explain away fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penitent , but a saint , - you then , knowingly or not , do deadly harm to a great man 's memory , and , in mistaken zeal , add injury to insult . " The lie against nature in the name of Francis Bacon , " writes Mr. Dixon , " broke into high literary fame in Pope . Before his day the scandal had only oozed in the slime of Welden , Chamberlain , and D'Ewes . Pope picked it , as he might have picked a rough old flint , from the mud , fanged it , poisoned it , and set it on his shaft : - Meanest of mankind ! ' What if it be a lie ? May not a lie kill ? " It was not the only scum which in Pope 's day frothed to the head . What man then believed in nobleness , even in intellect , unless that intellect // were of the lowest type , or served the basest cause ? The sole end of wit was defamation , the sole end of poetry vice . Of pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All glorious characters , all serious things , if not gone wholly from the minds of men , lingered in their memories only to be reviled . When Bacon became the meanest of mankind , Raleigh was assailed , and Shakespeare driven from the stage . Rowe was tainting our national drama , St. John undoing our political philosophy , Hume training his mind through doubts of God for the task of painting the most manly passage-of-arms in all history as our greatest blunder and our darkest shame . How could Francis Bacon have escaped his share in this moral wreck ? " We must soon come to a close , and we will approach it by a few remarks on this passage . The wicked , sceptical , miserable , and **26;856;TOOLONG eighteenth century has had many hard blows ; but here is a shower of them , delivered with the utmost force of rhetorical pugilism , particularly against the English portion of it , and especially the days of Pope . It is most extraordinary if ten syllables of Pope did more injury to the memory of Bacon than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the sadly solemn confession of the great man himself . If this be so , " the satirical rogue might well boast that those were afraid of him who feared not God . We do not think that Pope 's day deserves all the hard things Mr. Dixon says of it . Pope was born in 1688 , and died in 1744 . Take the intellect of the day : was it of the lowest type , and did it serve the basest cause ? Or , if not , had it yet none to believe in truth , none to admire or sustain it ? Among the intellects of this period , and belongiiig to the share of England in science and speculation , we may begin with Newton . Pope was thirty-nine years old when Newton died , and consecrated the memory of Newton in an epigrammatic epitaph which is something more than praise , and little short of blasphemy : - " Nature and Nature 's laws lay hid in night ; God said , Let Newton he , and all was light . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speculation , theology , and criticism of that day we find the names of Berkeley , ilutcheson , Clarke , Waterland , Doddridge , 15 * // Sherlock , Bentley , and Bishop Butler . These men were not merely men of intellect , but also men of high virtue . What Mr. Dixon may consider " pure genius** we can not say . Genius , in the conventional limitation of the term , is mostly confined to power in imaginative literature . In this sense , or any other , England in the eighteenth century was not void of genius , not even in the part of that century which we may call " the time of Pope . " But not measuring that time too strictly , we may credit to it IDe Foe , Addison , Steele , Congreve , Richardson , Swift , Pope , Young , Allan IRamsay , Thomson , Fielding , Sterne , Gray , Smollett . These may not be considered as having had the most lofty inspiration , but we know not where their names can be placed if not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what age some of them could be equalled . Was " the sole end of wit defamation " in Addison , Steele , Fielding , Congreve , or even in Swift and Pope ? Raleigh , it seems , was assailed at this period , but , worse still , he was beheaded in another , yea , by the tyrant whom Bacon served , and who made Bacon Lord Chancellor of England in the same year ( 1618 ) in which he cut off the head of Raleigh . If rude speech on the memory of Raleigh was wrong in the day of Pope , what shall we say of silence in the day of Bacon , when a great word from a great man should have been spoken for one who was a brother in his greatness ? But that word was not spoken . The manner in which Mr. Dixon refers to flume , every candid mind must regret and reprobate. flume alludes temperately to the alleged faults of Bacon , and , referring to him intellectually , writes : " The great glory of literature in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The application by Mr. Dixon to flume of the odium theologicum was therefore as uncalled for as it was undeserved . The idea of flume 's " training his mind through doubts of God " for writing his History , is as illiberal as it is absurd , the mode of stating it as illogical as it is illiberal , and the rhetoric as bad in taste as it is in temper . flume had nothing to do with the charges against Bacon , and to abuse flume is not to defend Bacon . flume as well as Bacon was a great thinker , and while language and thought exist , flume 's name as well as that of Bacon will continue among the memories which the world will not allow to die . // Mr. Dixon seems to ascribe to the time of Pope a peculiar disregard to all high genius . Shakespeare was put away from the theatre ; nevertheless he was praised , edited , abundantly printed ; and shortly after the time of Pope , Garrick flashed like lightning on the stage , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never before seen them opened . The stage of the time was indeed poor in tragic writers , but it was not wanting in comic , while in both tragic and comic authors it was rich compared with the paltry and plagiarized dramatic writing of our own day . But worst of all crimes chargeable on that period , in Mr. Dixon 's estimation , was its treatment of the character and memory of Bacon . Yet the critics who have done the greatest moral damage to that character and memory belong to the present , and Mr. Dixon , accordingly , with a mixture of sadness and severity , takes to task Lord Campbell and Lord Macaulay . Both of these men , however , have done justice to the genius of Bacon , and neither of them could have maliciously purposed to do injury to his character . With no intention to do wrong to Bacon , they were zealous to do right to morals , and their judgment was what the broad and open view of facts seemed to warrant . If they have misjudged Bacon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor yet from any indisposition to believe the best as to his character . It is not true that Bacon was peculiarly depreciated in the age of Pope . On the contrary , we meet high and reverential mention of him by writers of the period , who had the greatest number of readers , and commanded the readiest attention . There is , we admit , a shallow and paltry criticism in " The Guardian " ( 1713 ) on Bacon 's historic style ; but here is the spirit in which a writer in " The Tatler " ( 1710 ) refers to Bacon 's genius . The idea of the essay is , that " the greatest and wisest men in all ages and countries were renowned for their piety and virtue . " " I shall in this paper , " the writer observes , " only instance Sir Francis Bacon , a man who for greatness of genius , and compass of knowledge , did honor to his age and country , - I could almost say to human nature itself . He possessed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest authors of antiquity . // He had the sound , distinct , comprehensive knowledge of Aristotle , with all the beautiful lights , graces , and embellishments of Cicero . One does not know which to admire most in his writings , the strength of reason , force of style , or brightness of imagination . " Here is the manner in which a writer in the same periodical ( 1709 ) refers to Bacon 's character . The writer is alluding to eminent persons who suffer injustice from their contemporaries . " All that is incumbent on a man of worth , " he says , " who suffers under so ill a treatment , is to lie by for some time in silence and obscurity . till the prejudice of the times be over , and his reputation cleared . I have often read with a great deal of pleasure a legacy of the famous Lord Bacon , one of the greatest geniuses that our own or any country has produced . After having bequeathed his soul , body , and estate in the usual form , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign nations , and to my countrymen after some time be passed over . ' " Bacon is thus alluded to in " The Spectator " ( 1712 ) - " One of the most extensive and improved geniuses we have had any instance of in our own nation , or in any other , was that of Sir Francis Bacon , Lord Verulam . This great man , by an extraordinary force of nature , compass of thought , and indefatigable study , had amassed to himself such stores of knowledge as we can not look upon without amazement . His capacity seemed to have grasped all that was revealed in books before his time ; and not satisfied with that , he began to strike out new tracks of science , too many to be travelled over by any one man in the compass of the longest life . These , therefore , he could only mark down , like imperfect coastings on maps , or supposed points of land , to be further discovered and ascertained by the industry of after-ages , who should proceed upon his notices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sound like the utterances of an age that repudiated Bacon , either as a man of genius or a man of social and moral worth . We are now near the end of our task . It has not been to us a gracious or a pleasant one . The spirit in which we have looked at the subject has not been quarrelsome or captious . We have the utmost desire that every great man - if so it could be - should have a spotless reputation . The most lowly should have protection against calumny , as well as the most exalted ; but the lowly are soon forgotten , and the scandal // goes as rapidly into oblivion as its subjects . It is not so with the exalted . They are the property of Time , History , and Humanity ; and their crimes or virtues become as memorable as their names . Every effort , therefore , to clear such names of bad report , is just and generous . Whatever we may think of Mr. Dixon 's book as to its logic or its literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his motive . He has labored diligently to remove all clouds and shadows from a mighty reputation . But the greatest man is small in the presence of a great principle , and let what may become of the man , the principle must be maintained . If the principle is sacrificed , the cause of truth and right suffers , but the man is not saved . Be faithful to the true principle , and the true principle will always in the long run justify the true man . We must not try to force historic judgments , for in such efforts we shall be more likely to confuse the moral instincts of the public than to rectify them . We hold Lord Bacon in reverential admiration . He was one among the small number , the elect upon earth , that intellectually can truly be called great . We bow down our minds in homage to his power , and pay to it all the deference which one of the sublimest of images of Divinity should have . We give this tribute not only willingly but enthusiastically . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bacon was one of the sublimest . We rejoice that publishers undertake to circulate his works , and that critics are laboring to vindicate his character . But he was a man immeasurably beyond the common size . The human race can hardly produce a judge fit to preside upon his trial . The ordinary mind in gauging such a man seems like a mosquito on the step of a pyramid , or a flea leaping about on the solemn face of the Sphinx . If it is difficult to find a judge for such a man , how much more difficult must it be to find a jury ! for the trial by jury means the trial of a man by his peers . Where , then , shall we look for juries on men upon the scale of Bacon ? And yet men even like Bacon are not above or beyond trial . There are moral instincts that in history hold the greatest to account , instincts by which // they are surely , and , as we think , justly judged . But whatever exceptional censures these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them can not fail of the world 's best memory and worship . They are men of vast capacities , they can and do commit great sins ; the sins , however , are merged in the magnificent worth of their general deserving , and in spite of their failings the heart of humanity throbs toward them as immortal benefactors . Bacon was one of those benefactors . Bacon had a great nature , a great human nature . If he sinned deeply , he confessed humbly ; and despite of all the worst faults charged upon him , his character still ever remains grand to the intellectual and moral judgment , to the intellectual and moral imagination of the world : to this judgment and imagination the fondest of admirers may safely commit the character of the immortal Francis Bacon . To discuss it is almost to insult it .
