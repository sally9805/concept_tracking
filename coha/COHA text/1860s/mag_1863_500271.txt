S THE flESTINY OF THE AFRICAN RACE IN THE UNITED STATES . MANY persons may be disposed to receive with a large share of scepticism the affirmation that there is an as*ct of the negro question , ' which has not , within the last thirty years of ceaseless aoitation , undergone a thorough discussion . Yet such an assertion would be perfectly . true . There is one side of that question , at which , during all the fierce excitements of the time , we have scarcely looked ; and which many , even those who have taken an active and leading part in the controversy , have not carefully studied . The morality of our system of slavery has been fully and thoroughly discussed , and may be considered as finally and forever se4tled , in the judgment of all right-minded and impartial men throughout Christendom . It may henceforth be taken as the consen.sus omnium gentiurn , that men and Women , with their children and their children 's children forever , can not rightfully be made , by human laws , chattels personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been discussed . Its relations to wealth , to industry , to commerce , manufactures , and the arts , as well as to education , public intelligence , and public morals , are so well understood , that it is not probable that the efforts even of Jefferson Davis , or the whole Southern confederacy , ' with the aid of such transatlantic allies as the London Times , will be able , in respect to such matters as these , to change or even to unsettle the judgment of mankind . But there is another class of questions on which the public mind is as unthoughtful and unenlightened , as in respect to these it is thoughtful and intelligent . We have pretty well considered what consequences may be expected from the continuance of slavery ; but we have neglected to inquire , on the supposition of the emancipation of the negro , what will be his condition , what his future , and what his influence on our national destiny . Upon such questions as these , we have , during the controversy , dogmatized much , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion , but very little calm , thoughtful discussion . There is no lack of earnest and confident opinions in the public mind in relation to this class of questions . It is in respect to this very side of the negro question , that prejudices the most intense and inveterate are widely prevalent ; prejudices , too , which have exerted the most decisive influence on the controversy , through every stage of its progress . The masses of the American people believe in those principles of political equality upon which all our constitutions are founded . They not or4y believe in them , but they cherish and love them . They perceive , too , by a kind of instinct , what many a wouldbe philosopher has failed to see , that the application and carrying out of those principles necessarily involve the fusion of the entire mass to which they are applied , into one homogeneous whole ; that we can not have a government founded on political equality , consistently with our having an inferior and proscribed class of citizens ; a class , from whose daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose sons we are not willing , either in this or in any future generation , to give our daughters in marriage . Political equality implies that the son of any parents may be raised to the highest offices in the government , and wear the most brilliant honors which a free people can confer . And the masses of the people instinctively see , or rather // feel , that it is impossible to admit to are , to a great extent , the descendants such equality a class to whom we deny , of the most enlightened men of the and always intend to deny all equality world , heirs by birth to the highest in the social state ; and with whom we civilization of the nineteenth century . are shocked at the very thought of ever The Africans , on the contrary , are the uniting our race and our blood , known descendants of parents who I am not now saying where the moral were taken by force from their own right of this matter lies ; or whether , country , and brought hither as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as chattels and beasts of equality with the negro , the masses of burden to the highest bidder ; and have the people are right or wrong . I am even now no civilization except what only affirming , what certainly can not they have acquired in this condition be successfully denied , that while they of abject slavery ; separated , too , from *tain and cherish it , they will never the dominant class , not only by this be willing to apply to him this doctrine stigma of slavery , but by complexion of political equality . They will always and features so marked and peculiar , resist it , as carrying with it , by inevi- , that a small taint of the blood of the table consequence , that social equality servile class can be detected with unerrto which they are determined never to ing certainty . If history decides anysubmit . If the doctrine of political thing , it is that a system of politic*d equality , so fundamental to our system equality can not be formed out of such of government , is ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to embrace the colored man , it is against it . qwq joy ? And if admitted to political , then surely to social equality also . And to many it seems perfectly clear that the universal emancipation of the negro carries with it by inevitable necessity his admission to the full enjoyment of all equality , political and social , and his becoming homogeneous with the mass of the American people ; and the fact that they think so is the only adequate explanation of the inflexible energy of will with which they resist all measures which are supposed to tend in the smallest degree toward emancipation . And they think themselves able to give unanswerable reasons for the bitterness with which they note everything which is expressed by the word abolitionism . ' They assume it for a fact , which admits no contradiction , that the natural increase of the n*ro race in this country is more rapid than that of the white man . So far as my observation extends , the great majority of the peoph* believe this with an undoubting faith . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggerated form in newspaper paragraphs ; although ( as I shall presently show ) a mere glance at our census tables disproves it . It is also assumed , with a faith equally undoubting , that if the slaves were all emancipated , the negro race would still increase as rapidly in freedom as in slavery . lEmancipation , it is said , would at once cast upon the country four millions and a half of free negroes ; and by the rapidity of their increase , they would , at i*o distant day , become a majority of the whole population . If then , it is further argued , you emancipate them , and yet withhold from them a full participation in all our political privileges , they will be hostile to our government , a great nation of aliens in the midst of us , who would be the natural enemies of our institutions . An internecine war of races , it is said , must follow . Even here it would be well for persons who entertain such gloomy apprehensions , to re member that if these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sequel that they are not ) , even then , emancipation could not make of the negroes more dangerous enemies to our institutions than slavery has made of the masters . It is also said that the only possible mode of escaping all these horrible results , would be to admit the negro , if he must be freed , to all the privileges and franchises of the Constitution , and amalgamate him entirely with the mass of American society . Thus it is taken for proved that emai*-cipation would carry with it the equarity of the negro and the white man in all their relations . I believe it to be true beyond reasonable doubt , that the great majority of the American people do at this time accept this substantially as their creed on the question of emancipation . They do not mean to justify slavery ; they abhor and hate it ; they regard it as economically , socially , politically , and morally wrong . But they regard emancipation as tending directly and inevitably to incorporate the negro into the mass of American society , and compel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a solution of the question they feel an unconquerable aversion . It shocks their taste ; it violates their notions of propriety and fitness ; they resist it by a sort of instinct , rather than from set conviction and purpose . Nor is there one man in a thousand of us , who is not conscious in himself of a certain degree of sympathy with this view of the subject , however much we may think that we morally disapprove it . With enslaving the negro , and reducing him to an article of merchandise , or depriving him of one of those moral rights which God has given him as a man , we have no sympathy . But if , in full view of a proposition to break down all the social barriers which now divide the races , so that our descendants and those of the colored man shall form one homogeneous people , we interrogate our own // consciousness , we shall discover that we , even those of us who have most eloquently and indignantly denounced prejudice against color , ' are compelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American people , in utter and unconquerable aversion to such an arrangement . It is probable that this article* may fall into the hands of some friends of mine whose judgment I greatly respect , and whose feelings * should be most reluctant to wound , to whom these sentiments will at first view be far from agreeable . But for many years I have entertained them with undoubting confidence of their truth ; and at this solemn crisis of our nation 's destiny it becomes us to lay aside all our prejudices , and to endeavor to reach the truth on this momentous question . I repeat it : this side of the subject has not been fairly met and considered in this discussion . The time has come when we must meet it . Emancipation is an indispensable condition of the restoration and perpetuity of the Union , perhaps even of our continued national existence . The one great objection to emancipation , in the minds of the people , North and South , is the bc*ieg so confidently and even obstinately entertained , that it carries with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races , which would destroy us , or the amalgamation of our race and blood with that of the negro . If we mean , as practical men and statesmen , to seek our country 's salvation by means of emancipation , we must , in some way , relieve the national mind from the pressure of this objection . Till we do so , the masses of the people will say to us : We do not approve of slavery ; we abhor it ; but if we are to have the negro - among us , we believe in keeping him in slavery . ' All of us , who are in the habit of talking with the people on this subject , know that almost in these very words we are met at every street corner . We must answer it , or in some form slavery will still continue to be the curse of our country , and to hurry it on to an untimely and ignominious end . Let it be distinctly borne in mind that it is not the moral equality of the negro to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only indirectly assailed by the inveterate national prejudice of which I speak . Those masses of the people who have no pecuniary interest in slavery , trample on the moral rights of the colored man only because they are made to believe themselves placed under the hard necessity of doing so , in order to resist any approach toward that politic*d and social equality with him to which they are determined never to submit . Show them how they can concede to him the former without conceding the latter , and they will gladly do it . For myself , nothing can be added to the intensity of my conviction not only that the colored man must be protected in the full enjoyment of all the moral rights of humanity , as a condition of our prolonged national existence ; but that the masses of the people never will consent to a political and social equality with the negro race . How then can the public mind be assured that to emancipate the enslaved race , to confer on them all the moral rights of humanity , does not involve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internecine war of races on our own soil , or the fusion of the two races into one homogeneous people ? One answer , which satisfies many , is , the freedmen must be colonized in some unoccupied region of the earth , where they may be separated from the white man , and build up for themselves an independent and homogeneous nationality . I have no controversy with this proposed solution of the difficulty , or with the excellent men who are advocating and promoting it , with an earnest patriotism worthy of all honor . But I have grave doubts of the adequacy of this solution to meet the momentous exigencies of the present crisis . // At least , I feel no necessity of resting the whole cause upon it , when there is another solution at hand , which certainly is adequate , furnished by the very laws of nature which the Creator has established , and so certain in its operation , that we have only to strike the fetters from the limbs of the poor slave , and recognize his manhood , and God will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the evils we have so much dreaded . That solution is found in a great law of population . It is necessary , therefore , that I should state this law , and prove its reality , and its adequacy to meet all the necessities of the case in hand . Whenever two peoples , one of which is little removed from barbarism , and the other having the full strength of a mature civilization , are placed in juxtaposition with each other , on terms of free labor and free competition , the stronger will always either amalgamate itself with the weaker , or extinguish it . In the former case , civilization undergoes an eclipse , almost an extinction . The homogeneous people resulting from such a union , occupies a position in the szale of civilization much nearer to that of their barbarous than that of their civilized parents . Numerous and conclusive examples of this have occurred in the progress of the French , Spanish , and Portuguese colonies in proximity to the various native tribes of this continent . They have generally amalgamated freely with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has in every instance resulted . When that eclipse is to end , we have not the foresight to determine . The English colonies , cn the other hani , in all parts of the world , have steadily refused to enter into any marriage relations with their barbarous neighbors , or to recognize as belonging to their community any half-breeds springing from licentious and illicit connection with them . Here , too , the results are almost entirely uniform . The extinction of such barbarous tribes brought within the sphere of their competition has been rapid and almost if not absolutely invariable ; while the English colonies themselves have preserved the civilization of the parent stock in almost undiminished vigor . A mere general view of the history of European colonization in barbarous regions of the earth , does therefore afford a very striving proof of the truth of my proposition . And it is much to our purpose here to remark , that the very aversion to incorporating the negro into our nationality , which is so firmly fixed in the minds of the masses of the people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outgrowth of slavery . It is the same national characteristic which , in all parts of the world , has prevented the English colonist from intermarrying with his barbarous neighbor . Call it by what hard name you please , call it prejudice against color , ' and denounce it as eloquently and indignantly as you may , it is one of the most remarkable and one of the most respectable features of the English colonies wherever found , and one of the chief *auses of their preëminence over those of other European nations , in civilization , wealth , and power . But what it is chiefly to our purpose to remark is , that while it is to the colonies themselves the cause of unequalled prosperity and rapidity of growth in all the elements of national greatness , to their savage neighbors it is the cause of rapid and certain extinction . Precisely in such relations to each other will the white and colored populations of the United States be placed by an act of universal emancipation , the substitution of free labor and free competition for the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand the history of the colonial offshoots of England shows that the amalgamation of the races will not follow , it shows with equal clearness and certainty that the rapid extinction of the // colored race will follow . Here I might rest the whole argument , with a high degree of assurance of the soundness and certainty of my conclusion , that the result of emancipation must be , not the amalgamation of the races , not an internecine war between them , but the inevitable extinction of the weaker race by the competition of the stronger . I say the competitiow of the stronger , because , to avoid extending this article to a very unreasonable length , I must assume that the reader is sufficiently versed in American history to know that even the Indian perishes , for the most part , not by the sword or the rifle of the white man , but by the simple competition of civilization with the Indian 's means of subsistence . I might , I say , leave my argument here ; but to do so would be great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts , which show to a demonstration , that the case of the negro in his xelations to the European population of this country is embraced in the law just stated . In the first place , the two races are not amalgamated . Intermarriages between them are so rare , that few of the readers of this article can remember ever to have known one . Such marriages are regarded as monstrous and disgraceful , though the law should , as in some of the States , recognize them . One sentiment in respect to them pervades the whole community , and that a sentiment of aversion . Those halfbreeds which spring from licentiousness , or even from the very few lawful marriages which have occurred , are not accepted as standing in any nearer relations to the white man than the pureblooded African . In those States where slavery has been longest extinct , and the colored man has been relieved from all legal disabilities , the line between the two races is as sharply drawn to-day as it was two hundred years ago . On such a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment . The experiment already tried does prove that the Anglo-American and African populations of this country can not be amalgamated , either by freedom or slavery ; and those who pretend to fear it , are either trying to deceive others for selfish and criminal purposes , ' or else they are wofully deceived themselves . Nor are the apprehensions of those who dread the rapid increase of the negro , at all sustained by facts . That fear of a coming internecine war of races , in case the colored man is emancipated , which haunts some minds , has no foundation except in ignorance of the real facts . In no portion of our history has our colored population ever increased with a rapidity nearly so great as the white population . From 1790 to 1860 the colored population increased in the ratio of 1 to 5.86 ; and the white population in the ratio of I to 8.50 . If we compare them for any shorter period , we shall always find that the white population increased the more rapidly of the two . From 1790 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for during that period the slave trade was in full activity , and tens of thousands of Africans were imported as articles of merchandise . But from 1790 to 1810 , while the colored population increased in the ratio of 1 to 1.81 , the white population increased in the ratio of 1 to 1.84 , although during that period the white population of the country was very little increased by immigration . How it has happened that this point , which our tables of population make so entirely plain , has been so much misapprehended , and why the prevailing notions respecting it are so erroneous , is not easy to explain . The above estimate also reckons all half breeds as belonging to the colored population . ( See De Bow 's Compendium of the United States Census of 1850 , ' Tables 18 , 42 , and 71 . ) But this is not all . A careful examination of Tables 42 and 71 of the volume above referred to , will show that the increase of the colored race in freedom // is certainly not half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to doubt whether our colored populalion has ever increased at all , except in slavery . From 1790 to 1800 the free colored ' population almost doubled , evidently by the emancipation of slaves ; for during that period the slave population of Connecticut , Delaware , New Hampshire , New York , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , and Vermont was greatly diminished , while that of New Jersey and Maryland was very little increased . In the last mentioned the increase of her slave population was only 2+ per cent . in ten years , while the increase of her free colored population was 143+ per cent , in the same period . These figures leave no room for doubt that the rapid increase of the free colored population in all that decade was caused by the fact that the great mass of the people were honestly opposed to slavery , and therefore the work of emancipation went on with rapidity . From 1800 to 1810 the increase of the free colored population was 72 per cent. , under the continued though somewhat slackened operation of the same cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 72 to 25 per cent. ; for the very obvious reason that most of the Northern States had now no slaves to emancipate , while the Southern States were holding to the system of slavery with increased tenacity , and emancipation was becoming less frequent . From 1820 to 1830 the ratio of increase was again raised to 37 per cent . in ten years . By referring again to Table 71 , it will be seen that in that decade , New York and New Jersey emancipated more than 15,000 slaves , adding them to the free colored population . From 1830 to 1840 the rate of increase declined to 21 per cent. , and from 1840 to 1850 to only 12j per cent. , and to 10 per cent . from 1850 to 1860 . These figures prove that from 1790 to 1840 the increase of the free colored population depended chiefly on the emancipation of slaves , and leave no reason to believe that its own natural increase ever exceeded 12+ per cent , in ten years ; while the average increase of the slave population is nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white population 34 per cent . in ten years . Thus , beyond controversy , the reproductive power of the colored population , alwa , ys greatly inferior to that of the white population , is yet not half so great in freedom as in slavery . This difference is to be accounted for in great measure by the wicked and beastly stimulus applied to the increase of slaves , that the chattel market may be kept supplied . There is no reason to suppose that the increase of the free colored population would be in a greater ratio if all were emancipated ; but , as will appear from considerations yet to be presented , much for supposing that it would be in a much smaller ratio . How then would the case stand on that supposition ? In 1860 there were about 27,000,000 of our white population , increasing at the rate of 34 per cent . in ten years ; and less than 4,500,000 of colored population , increasing ( on the supposition of universal freedom ) in a ratio not exceeding 12* per cent . in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timid man who , in this relation of the parties , fears anything from the increase of free negroes . A war between these two races , so related to each other , is simply absurd , and the fear of it childish and cowardly . Slavery may multiply the colored population till its numbers shall become alarming ; but if we will give freedom to the black man , we have nqthing to fear from his increase . But this certainly is not the full strength of the case . There is no good reason to believe that the natural increase of the free colored population is even 12+ per cent . in ten years , but much for suspecting that even this apparent increase is the result of emancipation , either by the slave 's own act , or by the consent of the master . If we take our departure from Qhicago , make the tour of the lakes to the point where 9 // the boundary line of New York and Pennsylvania intersects the shore of Lake Erie , then pass along the southern boundary of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along that river and the Atlantic coast to the southern boundary of Virginia , thence along the southern boundaries of Virginia and Kentucky to the Mississippi , thence along that river to the point where the northern boundary of Illinois intersects it , and thence along that boundary and the shore of Lake Michigan to , the place of departure , we shall have embraced within the line described ten of the thirty-four States of the Union . By an examination of Table 42 , already referred to , it will be seen that outside of those ten States the free colored population not only did not increase between 1840 and 1850 , but actually diminished , and that all the increase 8f that decade was in those ten States* Why then was there an increase in those ten States , while in the other twenty-four there was an actual decrease ? I think this question can only be answered by ascribing that increase to emancipation . In Kentucky , Virginia , Maryland , and Delaware , slavery is unprofitable and declining , and acts of emancipation frequently occur . Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave law of 1850 , were favorite resorts of fugitives , perhaps partly on account of the known sympathies of the Quakers . Ohio , Indiana , and Illinois , were also resorted to by fugitives , both on account of their easy accessibility from adjacent Slave States , and their proximity to Canada , and also because such labor* as a fugitiwe from slavery is best able to do , is there always in demand . These States have also received thousands of colored persons , brought to them by humane and conscientious masters , for the very purpose of emancipating them . From 1850 to 1860 the facts are still more striking . The increase which occurred was not , as would have been true of a natural increase , scattered pver our whole territory , and in some proportion to the colored population previously existing , but almost wholly , either where the unprofitableness and decline of slavery was leading to emancipation , or where from any cause the fugitive slave law of 1850 was not strictly enforced . Examples of the former are Maryland , Virginia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois , Michigan , Iowa , and even Massachusetts and Connecticut , in the latter of which it had been declining for twenty years previous . With the . facts before us , then , furnished by the United States Census , from 1790 to 1860 , how is it possible to believe that the colored population of this country has ever increased at all except in slavery ? How can we help seeing that it is slavery , and slavery alone , which has swelled their numbers from a little more than half a million , as it was in 1790 , to near four and a half millions at the present time ? Yet there are millions among us that turn pale at the thought of emancipation , lest thereby we should be overrun by the multiplication of the colored race ! There are millions who would be thought intelligent men , who think they have propounded an unanswerable argument against emancipation when they have asked , What will you do with the negro ? ' We may well ask what shall we do with the negro , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of burden and articles of merchandise . But on the supposition of freedom , thc question has no significance . The men who are always scaring themselves and others by such fears are either very ignorant or very hypocritical . But the case will be still stronger when we come to inquire , as we must before we close , into the causes of the facts which have just been presented . There is no reason to believe that the slower increase of the colored race is at // all due to any original inferiority in the powers of reproduction , or that any such inferiority exists . Its causes are to be found wholly in the different circumstances , characters , and habits of the two peoples . The negro is , to a great extent , a barbarian in the midst of civilization . He is destitute of those comforts of life , that care , skill , and intelligent watchfulness , which are indispensable to success in rearing children in the midst of the dangers , exposures , and diseases of infancy . His dwelling does not afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or from the heats of summer : it is ill warmed and ill ventilated ; he has not an unfailing supply of food and clothing suited to the wan.ts of that most frail and delicate of living creatures , a human infant . Hence a large portion of his children die in infancy . On the last page of the Appendix to the volume already referred to , is a most instructive table , showing the truth of this operation . Thus in 1850 the white population of Alabama was 426,514 ; the colored population , slave and free , was 365,109 . In that year the deaths of white children under five years of age were 1,650 ; of colored children , 2,463 . That is , only two thirds as many white children died as colored ; and yet the white population was greater almost in the ratio of 7 to 6 . By running the eye down the table , it will be seen that similar facts exist in every State where there is a large colored population . These facts leave us in no doubt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always slower than that of the white population . This occurs , as the table just referred to shows , under slavery , where the pecuniary interest of the master will secure his watchful cooperation with the parent to preserve the life of the infant . But in freedom the same causes act upon the colored race with vastly more destructive effect . The preservation of infant life and health is then left solely to the care , skill , and resources of the parent . The result is that decay of the colored rac* which we have seen indicated in the census . It is essential to our purpose that this point should be made quite plain . It is obvious that there is in every community a lower stratum of population , in which wages are sufficient to support the individual laborer in comfort , but not sufficient for the support of a family . This not only always has been so , but it always must be , as long as competition continues to be the test of value ; and competition must continue to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property is protected and preserved . Nor is this , as many superficial thinkers of our day have thought it , merely the hard and selfish rule by which Shylock oppresses and grinds the face of his victim : it is a necessary and beneficent law of the best forms of society which can evr exist in this world . The welfare of society in all the future imperatively requires that it should be propagated from the strong , the sound , the healthy , both in body and mind , from the strongest , most vigorous , and noblest specimens of the race ; and not from the diseased , the weak , the vicious , the degraded , the broken-down classes . Thus only can the life and health of society be preserved age after age . This is as necessary as it is that the farmer should propagate his domestic animals from the finest of his stock , and not from the diminutive , the weak , and the sickly . And it is accomplished in well ordered society by that very law of wages just stated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are unfit to be the parents of the coming generation , that are thrown into that lower stratum where wages are insufficient for the support of a family . And just in proportion as the entire structure of society is pervaded by intelligence and virtue , this class of persons will abstain from marriage , by prudently considering that they have not a satisfactory prospect // of being able to support a family . It is thus only that the horrors of extreme poverty can be avoided at the bottom of the social pyramid . The severity of this law of wages and population can thus be greatly mitigated and the comforts of life be universally enjoyed ; but the law itself is necessary and beneficent , and never can be repealed till human nature and human society are constructed on other principles than those known to us . To apply this to the question before us : When by the act of emancipation the negro is made a free laborer , he is brought into direct competition with the white man ; that competition he is unable to endure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stratum , which has just been spoken of , where he can support himself in tolerable comfort as a hired servant , but can not support a family . The consequence is inevitable . He will either never marry , or he will , in the attempt to support a family , struggle in vain against the laws of nature , and his children will , many of them at least , die in infancy . It is not necessary to argue to convince a candid man ( and for candid men only is this article written ) that this is , as a general rule , the condition of the free negro . And it shows , beyond the possibility of mistake , what in this country his destiny must be . Like his brother , the Indian of the forest , he must melt away and disappear forever from the midst of us . I do not affirm or intimate that this must be his destiny in all countries . In the tropical regions of the earth , where he may have little to fear from the competition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiply his race . Let him try the experiment . It is worth trying . Far be it from me to intimate that the negro is the only class of our population that are in this sad condition . In our large cities and towns there are hundreds of thousands of men who have no drop of African blood in their veins , and who are more clamorous than voL. iii. - 39 any other class against negro equality , who , through ignorance or vice , or superstition , or inevitable calamity , are in the same hard lot ; their children , if they have any , perish in great numbers in infancy , and they will add nothing to the future population of our country . That will be derived from a stronger , nobler parentage . Their race will become extinct . Their case differs from that of the colored man only in this , that they are not distinguished by color and features from the rest of the population ; so that the decay of their race can not be traced by the eye and the memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to see why the colored population has been , for a considerable time , declining in New York and New England . In those States population is dense ; all occupations which afford a comfortable living for a family are crowded ; and the competition of the white man is quite too much for the negro . If emancipation were now to be made universal , the same thing would rapidly occur in all parts of our country . The white laborer would rush in and speedily crowd every avenue to prosperity and wealth ; and the negro , with his inferior civilization , would be crowded everywhere into the loWer stratum of the social pyramid , and in a few generations be seen no more . The far more rapid increase of the white race would render the competition more and more severe to him with each successive generation , and render his decay more rapid , and his extinction more certain . I am well aware that this article may fall into the hands of many excellent men who will not relish this argument , nor this conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor negro in slavery . But they would not say so if they would consider the whole case . If slavery were a blessing to the black man , it is so great a curse to the white man that it should never be permitted to exist . The white man can afford to // be kind to the negro in freedom ; but he can not afford to curse himself with being his master and owning him as his property . On this point I need not enlarge , for I am devoutly thankful that the literature of Christendom is full of it . But slavery is not a blessing to the negro , even in the view of his condition which I have presented ; it is an uxmitigated curse . To a man of governed passions and virtuous life , it is infinitely better to be an unmarried freeman , enjoying the comforts of this life , and the hopes of the life to come , than to live and die a slave , and the parent of an interminable posterity of slaves . To a being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curse , whether in slavery or freedom ; and it surely is not obligatory on us , or beneficial to the colored man , to preserve the system of slavery for the sake of perpetuating a succession of such lives down through coming generations . Slavery , by forced and artificial means , propagates society from its lowest and most degraded class , from a race of barbarians held within its bosom from generation to generation , without being permitted to share its civilizing influences . It thus propagates . barbarism from age to age , till at last it involves both master and slave in a common ruin . Freedom recruits the ranks of a nation 's population from the homes of the industrious , the frugal , the strong , the enlightened , the virtuous , the religious ; and leaves the ignorant , the superstitious , the indolent , the improvident , the vicious , without an offspring , and without a name in future generations . Freedom places society , by obeying the law of propagation which God imposed on it , upon an ascending plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnatural law of propagation , places it upon a descending plane of ever-deepening vice and barbarism . That dread of negro equality which is perpetually haunting the imaginationa of the American people , is , therefore , wholly without foundation in any reality . It is a delusion , which has already driven us , in a sort of madness , far on the road to ruin . It is , I fear , a judicial blindness , which the all-wise and righteous Ruler of the universe has sent upon us for the punishment of our sins . The negro does not aspire to political or social equality with the white man . He has evidently no such destiny , no such hope , no such possibility . He is weak , and constantly becoming weaker ; and nothing can ever make him strong but our continued injustice and oppression . He appeals not to our fears , but to our compassion . He asks not to rule us : he only craves of us leave to toil ; to hew our wood and draw our water , for such miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ award hima grave . If we deny him this humble boon , we may expect no end to our national convulsions but in dissolution . If we promptly grant it , over all our national domain , we may expect the speedy return of peace , and such prosperity as no nation ever before enjoyed .
