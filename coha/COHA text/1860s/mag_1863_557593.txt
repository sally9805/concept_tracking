txt Anr . IV . - Lectures on Moral Science . Delivered before the Lowell Institute , Boston . By MARK HOPKINS , B. D. , LL . B. , President of Williams College ; Author of " Lectures on the Evidences of Christianity , " etc . Boston : Gould and Lincoln . 1862. l2mo. pp. 304 . THE announcement of a new work on Moral Science is quite likely , we imagine , to excite , in the minds of some who may chance to see it , a feeling bordering on impatience . It will probably be concluded at once by such persons , that some one who has a special attachment to his own methods of exhibiting the received doctrines of ethics , or who has fancied himself , as to some details by no means essential , wiser than those who have written before him , has produced another work rather for his own gratification than to meet any existing want . It has become so common a thing of late for each teacher to think it necessary to make his own text-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrons of colleges and schools , grow weary of perpetual change and jealous of new attempts . It is not strange that , in relation to a work like that before us , some unfavorable impression should exist in the minds of such as have little or no knowledge of the subject . // But more than this . It would be by no means surprising , if even some who have been students of ethical philosophy , and are reputably well acquainted with the course of ethical discussion , should find the doubt arising in their minds whether another volume on the already hackneyed theme can fairly claim attention . Have not the profoundest minds , from Aristotle downward , exhausted their acuteness in the propounding and illustration of the principles , and the analysis , comparison , and demonstration of the essential truths , of morals ? Have they not penetrated into the mysteries of psychology and of intellectual philosophy and logic , and traced the relations of these departments severally to moral philosophy ? Have not Aquinas and his fellow-schoolmen , Grotins , Hobbes , Leibnitz , Shaftesbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Paley , and the rest , again and again dug over the whole field ? Have not men of the latest schools in Germany , France , England , and the United States gathered up , adjusted , and arranged in convenient manuals the results of these various labors ? What need , then , can there be of another digest of received opinions ? If it were true that the strong minds that have heretofore grappled with the difficulties of moral science had been altogether successful in their inquiries , - if they had reached conclusions that were entirely satisfactory , and had wrought out a complete and coherent system of ethics , so that no room remained for any further advance , - then certainly one might well be content with either of several recent treatises which we could name as works of marked ability . The fact , however , is quite otherwise . Notwithstanding the vast importance of questions pertaining to morals , because of their immediate bearing on human character and happiness , it is true beyond denial , both that the progress of ethical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successively constructed have not been such as to satisfy inquiry . With how much of laborious speculation , and by what gradual advances , the nature and the elementary laws of moral action have been philosophically determined , Sir James Mackintosh has clearly shown in his elaborate and elegant Dissertation ; while in regard to many even of the fundamental principles of theoretical // morality the disputants have seemed to wage interminable controversies , - to debate like Milton 's angels , " And find no end , in wandering mazes lost . " The great modern movement in speculative philosophy , - inaugurated in Scotland by Reid , and producing there , as its best fruit , the vigorous , learned , and to a great extent original discussions of Sir William Hamilton ,  --  contemporaneously revealing itself in Germany by Kant , and culminating at length in Hegel and his disciples , - including also the eclecticism of Victor Cousin , and the modified and fragmentary transcendental system of Coleridge , - has affected the intimately related department of moral philosophy so far , at least , as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The result , on the whole , has been manifestly favorable . Since the time of Mackintosh , even , there has been a very considerable advance as regards some of the details of moral science . On one point after another , light has been thrown , sometimes by direct and sometimes by collateral inquiry . But yet , as to the relation of the several parts of the science to one another , and the principle on which the whole should be compacted , there has been , it can not be denied , a great deal of confusion and uncertainty . The so-called ethical systems have palpably lacked coherence . They have seemed rather like aggregations of distinct and partial truths , than like real systems , the parts of which have been reduced to actual unity in virtue of their necessary and clearly perceived mutual dependence . Indeed , we are inclined to think that the new interest in ethical discussions which has of late been manifested , is itself to be taken as proof of an existing conviction that there were still serious deficiencies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is able to make any important contribution to the supply of these deficiencies , he certainly has a claim to a candid and thoughtful hearing ; and a really fresh and original discussion , attempting nothing less than a thorough re-investigation of the whole subject from a new position , may well be heartily welcomed by all thoughtful readers . It is such a discussion that is furnished in the volume now // before us . President Hopkins is well known to the reading world , by various published essays and discourses , - several of them collected and republished in a substantial volume , - and by his able course of Lectures ou the Evidences of Christianity , delivered some years ago before the Lowell Institute , and now used in Harvard College and elsewhere as a textbook . Ever since his entrance on the Professorship of Moral Philosophy in Williams College , from which , on the resignation of Dr. Griffin , he was transferred to the presidential chair , his reputation as a man of thought , and as a clear and able writer , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from year to year , with an extraordinary interest , not only by those for whom they have been specially prepared , but also by large and appreciative audiences which they have drawn together . Several of these have been published , and widely read and admired by the lovers of fresh and penetrative thought . From a writer of such antecedents , addressing himself deliberately to the task of constructing a system of moral science , and offering to the world the results of his maturest thought , a contribution of solid value would naturally have been expected . It would seem but reasonable to look for some extension of the circle of vision , or , at the least , for some scattering of old mists that had hung over no inconsiderable portions of the field . How far President Hopkins has met the expectation which the announcement of his work must certainly have excited , our readers may judge when we shall have laid before them , in as summary a way as possible , what he has actually done . We will endeavor to exhibit clearly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salient points of the discussion . Those who are at all familiar with such studies will easily adjust the subordinate topics so as to fill up the outline harmoniously for themselves . After a graceful dedication to the graduates of Williams College , Dr. Hopkins foreshadows the line of inquiry which he proposes to pursue , in the following paragraph of his Preface - " Philosophy investigates causes , unities , and ends . Of these it is the last two that are chiefly ' considered in the following Lectures . // Happy - it has been said - is he who knows the causes of things . ' But in a world where there are so many discrepancies , both natural and moral , he must be more happy who knows the arrangement of things into systems , and sees how all these systems go to make up one greater system and to promote a common end . An investigation of causes respects the past ; of unities and ends , the present and the future . Of these the latter are more intimate to us ; and he who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with herself ; and man with himself , and the individual with society , and maa with God , - who can see in all these a complex unity , and can apprehend their end , - will have an element of satisfaction far greater than he who should know the causes of all things without being able to unravel their perplexities . " The first Lecture opens with a parallel between astronomy and moral science , for the sake of exhibiting the reasons for the comparatively slow progress of the latter . As the chief of these are mentioned the difficulty pertaining to the observation of all mental phenomena , arising out of the fact that the mind is at once the observer and the observed ; the want of a careful discrimination between the science of morals and other related subjects ; the great complexity of the science itself ; the fact that observation and analysis become more difficult in proportion as we approach what is most intimate and central in ourselves ; the want of definite terms , and the deficiency of men in practical virtue . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own ethical system . This is done with precision and simplicity . The great difficulty in discussions on morals has always been to find a solid basis on which the several parts might be built into a real unity . It has been clearly seen by many writers , that there ought to be discovered some central principle or fact which should determine the order and harmony of all the rest . This has been the thing sought in the various inquiries as to the nature or ground of virtue ; in those that relate to the origin of the moral sentiments , and to the question of a moral sense ; and in those that pertain to the doctrine of an ultimate right , eternal and immutable . But , as in astronomy the assumption of wrong hypotheses , while it seemed to afford an explanation of // some of the well-known phenomena , served only to complicate and darken others ; so in morals the assumed centres of the proposed ethical systems have been proved false by their failure to solve the difficulties on all sides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attempt to find a new position that shall fulfil the required conditions , Dr. Hopkins begins as follows - " Moral philosophy respects the character and conduct of men only as there are acts which they ought or ought not to do . Wherever the word ought , indicating duty , can go , there is its domain ; and the point beyond which that can not go fixes its limit . Whoever can answer in all cases these three questions , - 1st . What ought to be done ? 2d . Why ought it to be done ? 3d . How ought it to be done ? - has mastered the science of morals . " In answering these questions we may seek aid in various directions . I propose to inquire , at present , what aid we may derive from a consideration of ends , as they stand related to all rational and moral action . " In acting morally , man also acts rationally ; but it is the characteristic of rational action , that it involves the conception of an end . Except in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rational being can do , or that a moral being ought to do . " - p. 40 . " An intelligent ' being , whose end would not be revealed in itself ; would be an absurdity . If the end were not revealed to itself ; it would be lost . It is the possibility and measure of such knowledge that determines the possibility and measure of any philosophy of man . " The perfection of man , viewed merely as a product of divine power , must consist in his adaptation and capacity to attain the end for which he was made . " - p. 42 . That there may be no obscurity in the discussion arising from any possible ambiguity in the use of the word end , in reference to man , this word , which is to play a very important part , is carefully defined . It is intelided to represent , not a simple , but a complex idea . The elements of this idea are given in the following passage . " As intelligent and responsible , the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to do something ; as capable of enjoyment , it is to enjoy something ; and as a creature made by God , his end is to be that which will enable him to do and to enjoy all that God intended // he should . He is to be something , to choose and do something , and to enjoy something ; and his whole end will be to be what God intended he should be , to choose and do what he intended he should choose and do , and to enjoy what he intended he should enjoy . He who should fail in any of these , would fail of attaining his whole end . " - p. 43 . To give still greater precision to the doctrine of ends , Dr. Hopkins states , that an end may be attained in either of three ways : by instinct , blindly ; by obedience to a rule , that is , by faith ; or understandingly and rationally . He also distinguishes ends as subordinate , ultimate , and supreme . A subordinate end is one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related . An ultimate end is one that is chosen for its own sake , without reference to anything beyond . A supreme end is that to which , among ultimate ends , all others are subordinate . A subordinate end is not necessarily a good in itself . It may be in itself an evil ; as when , for example , a surgical operation is chosen for the relief it promises . An ultimate end is always some form of good . Thus the pleasure to be derived from seeing the landscape is the end for which we ascend a mountain and place ourselves in a position to gain the view . In this connection it is shown that the relation of volition to an ultimate end is never direct . Some action proximate to the end is the direct object of volition . We will to gain the position . The pleasure of the prospect follows . Man can not , therefore , make happiness a direct object of volition . He wills the doing of acts which God has made the condition of happiness . This fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is asserted that an end involves some form of good . The question of course arises , What is a good ? To this it is answered , that a good must be either some form of enjoyment , satisfaction , blessedness , or that which is the occasion , cause , or ground of such enjoyment . A good supposes sensitive , conscious beings , whose faculties are in action . Without such beings and such activity there would be no good . But good , as connected with the activity of such beings , must lie either in the activity itself or in its results . Activity itself , however , without results , would not be a good , and still less // would it be so with results which were evil . But we learn from Consciousness that any sort of normal activity produces enjoyment , satisfaction , blessedness , according to the faculties that act ; so that there are many forms of good , the combination of all which , in the highest possible degree , must constitute the whole good of man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an end that is wholly for its own sake . The highest good would result from the activity of the highest powers in a right relation to their highest oblect . This statem*nt is of great importance , as it involves the rule of right . The course of action which secures to man the whole good for which he was made must be right . To the primary question , then , in morals , What ought to be done ? Dr. Hopkins replies , To ascertain the end for which we were made , and to seek to accomplish that end . To the second question , Why ought it to be done ? he replies , Because of the intrinsic worth and excellency of that end . If there were nothing valuable in itself , there would be nothing that ought to be either chosen or done . On the choice of the supreme good by the rational will is grounded an immutable morality . We have thus given our readers , in a condensed form , and nearly in the words of the author , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumption of the fact , derived from his constitution , that man is created for , and fitted to attain , a certain end , and must in the attainment of that end fulfil all his moral duty , as the fundamental fact in moral philosophy , in the light of which all its details must be explained , and by which they may all be harmonized and bound together , is that which gives its distinctive character and marked originality to the work before us . The conception of man 's duty as affected by his relation to an end , is not indeed altogether new . Others have incidentally adverted to it . Several writers have seemed to catch occasional glimpses of the truth , who have yet failed to seize and hold it , and to perceive its important bearings . Even Dr. Samuel Clarke , as if half unconsciously recognizing the doctrine of ends , though contrary to his own theory , is quoted by Mackintosh as saying , " The Deity acts according to the eternal relations of things , in order to the good of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCIENCE . moral agents ought to be governed by the same rules for the good of the public " ; * the meaning of which is , that the good of the universe is the supreme end of God and man alike , and that this determines God 's conduct , and should determine that of man . Jouffroy , who agrees with Malebranche in making virtue to consist in the love of the universal order , still holds the following language : " Destroy the idea of order , and no longer is there anything sacred in itself to the eye of reason ; consequently nothing obligatory , and no moral difference between our ends and actions . But restore this idea , and the universe and man become at once intelligible : an end appears for all and every creature , a sacred order which every rational being is bound to respect . " - *-  In a recently published treatise by Dr. Hubbard Winslow , we find this forcible statement : " There is no moral excellence in merely seeking our own happiness ; but there is moral excellence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness is involved . Hence our true end of all ends , morally , is the glory of God , whilst our end of all ends , instinctively , is our highest happiness ; and as our moral and instinctive being was never designed to be separated , so our duty and happiness must be eternally united . " j Our moral duty and our happiness are here seen to be dependent on our end . These may serve as examples of the manner in which others have spoken in respect to ends . The idea of constructing a system of moral science on the basis of man 's relation to his end does not , however , appear to have occurred to any previous writer . President Hopkins differs from those who have gone before him , not only in the different place which he assigns to the conception of m*n 's relation to his end , but also in the different conception which he forms as to what actually is man 's highest good . In these two things we find at once the foundation of his system and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshness and value as a contribution to the world of thought . Having set forth clearly his doctrine in r.egard to ends and to the highest good , the remainder of his treatise is occupied with the task - a I Introd. to Ethics , p. 68 . Mackintosh 's Dissertation , See . 5. * Winslow 's Elem . Mor . Phil. , p. 288. // task most laborious in its nature , but acutely and carefully performed - of carrying these primary conceptions through the whole science , and adjusting into harmony with these all the statements of the various particular truths . He has found what he believes to be the clew to the previously perplexing labyrinth , and he endeavors to prove it to be the right one by actually threading the mazes by its aid . The first step in this process is an exposition of the different forms or grades of good . Here it is shown that a general classification may be made on the basis of the distinction in our constitution between susceptibilities and powers ; the former giving pleasure and the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrimination , iDr . Hopkins unfolds his view in the following comprehensive statements . *We now turn from this broad classification of good to inquire for the basis of one that is more exact . We speak of good as higher and lower , and we have an instinctive feeling that some forms of good are higher than others . Is there a criterion by which we may determine what is higher and what is lower ? " In answering this question , I hope for indulgence if I enter upon a range somewhat wide . Moral science has usually been studied as isolated . My wish is to connect it with the laws of that physical system which not only supports man , but has its culmination in him . I wish to show that there runs through both one principle of gradation , and one law for the limitation of forces and activities , and so of the forms of good resulting from them . If this can be done , it will add to both physical and moral science the beauty of a higher unity than has commonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been but one author for both . " All good , and all arrangements for good , are the result of some activity . They are in or from it . Arrangements conditional for good are the product of forces ; good itself , of faculties . A faculty is a force united to personality , and subject to the control of the will . What we need to find , then , is a common law for the subordination and limitation of both forces and faculties . This we find in their relation to each other as conditional and conditioned . The forces that are at work around us and the faculties within us , from the lowest to the highest , may be ranked as higher and lower as they are or are not a condition one for another . That which is a condition for another is always the lower . " - p. 63. 33* // We find accordingly , in the next place , a very ingenious and striking illustration of this gradation of good , as determined by the forces and faculties with which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places gravity , as the primary force , and conditional for the activity of every other , the lowest of all . The next higher force is the attraction of cohesion . Next to this comes chemical affinity , the compounds formed by which are conditional for the action of that power which we call life . But the inorganic is also conditional for the organic or living world , in which we find three great forces with their products . These are the vegetable , the animal , and the rational life . Of these , vegetable life , the lowest , is conditional for animal life ; and this again for the rational and moral life , by which man is allied to God . We will here quote the exact words of the author . " We have , then , finally and highest of all , this rational and moral life , by which man is made in the image of God . In man , as thus constituted , we first find a being who is capable of choosing his own end ; or , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole nature . This is moral freedom , and in this is the precise point of transition from all that is below to all that which is highest . For everything below man the end is necessitated . Whatever choice there may be in the ngency of animals of means for the attainment of their end , - and they have one somewhat wide , - they have none in respect to the end itself . This , for our purpose , and for all purposes , is the characteristic distinction , so long sought , between man and the brute . Man determines his own end ; the end of the brute is necessitated . Up to man , everything is driven to its end by a force working from without , or from behind ; but for him the pillar of cloud and of fire puts itself in front , and he follows it or not as he chooses . " In the above cases it will be seen that the process is one of the addition of new forces , with a constant limitation of the field in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that of cohesion . Cohesion rests upon it as upon a base . The sphere of cohesion is wider than that of chemical affinity ; that of chemical affinity wider than that of life ; that of vegetable life wider than that of animal life ; and that of animal life wider than that of rational life . Hence the plan of the creation may be compared to a pyramid , growing narrower by successive platforms . It is to be noticed , however , that , while the field of each added and superior force is narrowed , yet nothing is // dropped . Each lower force shoots through , and combines itself with all that is higher . Because he is rational , man is not the less snbject to gravitation , and cohesion , and chemical affinity . He has also the organic life that belongs to the plant , and the sensitive and instinctive life that belongs to the animal . In him none of these are dropped ; but the rational life is naited with , and superinduced upon , all these , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural head and ruler of the world . He partakes of all that is below him , and becomes man by the addition of something higher . " - pp. 66 , 67 . This law of gradation , it is shown , is to be traced , not only throughout the physical constitution of man , but also in the mind itself ; giving , in the former , those systems which are for building and repairing , those which are for support and locomotion , and those which are for sensation and direction , each lower system being conditional for the higher ; and in the latter , the intellect , or cognitive faculties , conditional for the emotive nature , and this again conditional for the conative powers , or desire and will . Beginning at the lowest point of sensitive life , it is found , at every ascending step , that each force acts for its own end , and then that this end is the condition of something higher . From this view come two most interesting and important results . First , a clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers and faculties . To the question , - which has been hitherto one of the most difficult in morals , - How far may any given form of inferior good be sought ? - the answer is , that it may be sought up to that point at which it has fulfilled its end , that is , at which it is most perfectly conditional for the higher good to which it stands related . Advancing from each form of inferior good to that next above , when we reach the highest form of good , - that which results from the highest moral activity , - the limitation ceases . To the enjoyment of the highest good there can be no limit but that which is found in the capacity of the being ; since that good is conditional for nothing beyond The other result of this admirable gradation is , that in it is found the principle of unity for the universe . Each force being not only conditioned for a higher , but being precisely such as is best conditioned for a higher , the universe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only one great whole , but an orderly and wel-adjusted whole . In this universe each force and faculty , and each particular form of good , has its own place and value definitely determined , and all are combined as essential parts of the complete and harmonious system , the one grand and beautiful unity . This view leaves nothing isolated or fragmentary . It satisfies the comprehending reason . We have endeavored to exhibit , as fully as our limits will allow , this part of Dr. Hopkins 's course , both because it is rich in interest of itself , and because it embraces most of the elements , or primary statements and distinctions of his system . We have thus far been occupied chiefly with the second and third Lectures . On the next four we shall not dwell long . In accordance with his general principles , as already stated , after distinguishing spontaneous from voluntary mental activity , Dr. Hopkins goes on to classify the faculties as they are related to ends . He divides the faculties or powers into two great classes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends beyond themselves , and those in whose activity we find ends beyond which there are no others . The first class is again divided into those faculties which indicate ends , as the instincts , the appetites , the desires , and the natural affections ; and the intellect , in the light of which we pursue ends . These do not necessarily imply a moral nature . The second great class includes the powers that belong to man as a person , - reason , moral affections , and free will . These are the moral nature . The most important parts of practical ethics are discussed in the light , and by the aid , of this classification . A new interest is here thrown over topics that were trite , and many original suggestions will repay the intelligent and carefnl reader . With the seventh Lecture the discussion reaches a loftier region of thought . It here grapples with those questions pertaining to the moral nature of man , which , as they are of the utmost impoi*tance , have also been found to involve the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of high and keen debate among the acutest thinkers of all schools . The more familiar one is with past discussions , the less sanguine will be his hope of being able so to handle // these questions as to give satisfaction at all points , even to the most candid inquirer . Here , however , as elsewhere , Dr. Hopkins avoids the style of controversy , and proceeds calmly on in the exposition of his own results . Truth is not only best exhibited , but is most likely to be rightly apprehended and received , when thus set forth . It was shown , in an earlier Lecture , that the specific difference between man and the brutes is , that man is endowed with the capacity of knowing the end for which God made him , and of either choosing or rejecting it . What then , it is asked , are the powers needed in order to enable him to choose his own end ? What are the elements of personality , and the a priori conditions of a moral act ? First of all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are used with less precision . It often denotes , in the older writers , the power by which the mind understands , deduces , concludes from premises . But since the animals do all this , they felt the necessity of making the word include something more and higher , and yet did not determine precisely how much or what . Since modern discussions have distinguished between the understanding , or discursive faculty , and the reason , or the intuitional power , there has been less confusion . Dr. Hopkins denotes by reason that which gives origin to the word rational , that in virtue of which man necessarily has certain ideas and beliefs , or rational intuitions ; not as innate , but as appearing infallibly on the proper occasions . The distinction between reason thus defined , and the moral reason , we shall best give in the exact words of the author . " Of ideas and beliefs thus given , those that are moral are so peculiar that philosophers have properly attributed their origin to what they have called the moral or spiritual reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be moral . This something more comes from its complexity as higher than mere primitive cognition or rational intuition . In the first two classes of intellectual products above mentioned , the intellectual element is almost sole . In the third , there is the synthesis of a rational product with that of sensibility . But here , not only intellect and feeling are involved , as in the mere contemplation of the beautiful ; the will is also reached . The idea of obligation is nothing except as there is in it not only feeling , but a requisition // upon the will . As a product of the moral reason is an idea , there is in it intellect ; as it is an idea of obligation , there is in it feeling ; and as this feeling is that of an imperative upon the will , it is clear that , in a normal state , the activity of the moral reason would involve that of the whole man . It is as nearly a synthesis of intellect , feeling , and will as is possible and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason and others there is the same difference as between a cannonball that is heated and one that is not . They do not lie still and cold , but respect action , and are oC such a nature that we can not be indif. ferent to them . " - pp. 161 , 162 . Along with the moral reason , and the moral ideas and affections connected with it , there must be further , as essential to personality , a Rational Will , - a will in freedom . The element of will is presupposed in every act which we recognize as moral . A man can have no responsibility and feel no obligation in regard to anything that has no connection , direct or indirect , with the will . Free will completes the personality requisite to the doing of a moral act . In the performance of such an act , however , there is involved of necessity reference to an end . The idea of an end involving a good is implied in all acts of rational choice . A rational being must know his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his end ; and thus all the prerequisites of a moral act . A moral act is one which respects the supreme end . Obligation to choose this end is affirmed in view of it as good ; and such a choice is approved as right . It is in connection with the rational choice - the immanent preference - of an end , that the ideas of obligation and moral law , of merit and demerit , of reward and punishment , arise ; as also the ideas of right and wrong , which are always relative , expressing either fitness or unfitness in reference to an end , and having a moral quality only when they relate to specific moral acts , or to the state of the affections in reference to the supreme end . Virtue consists in the abiding choice or preference of the supreme good , and becomes holiness as it condemns and abhors whatever would obstruct the attainment of that good . Moreover , since the supreme good is found in the highest moral activity , which is LOVE , the conclusion reached by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by revelation , // that , in the highest activity of his highest powers , man perfectly fulfils his duty and attains his true end . The question next arises , whether virtue , or holiness , and happiness can be identified as objects of pursuit . Kant said , No . So have said many others , before and after him . Dr. Hopkins replies in the affirmative . According to his principles , the formula for the highest enloyment is the highest possible activity of the highest powers ; and his formula for virtue is the highest normal activity of the moral powers , which are the highest . The formulas are , for substance , identical ; and the things themselves , if not identical , are at least as inseparably connected by natural law as light is with the sun . Moral good , it is maintained , differs essentially from all other good , and is fitted by its peculiar attributes to be the highest good . The three attributes specified are these : First , it is independent of anything without the mind , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is accompanied with approbation , - a feeling of complacency and hope not found in connection with any other good . Thirdly , the activity required for its attainment is identical with that required for the general good . Virtue or holiness does , therefore , stand in a causal relation to such good . We will here once more quote , on a vital point , the author 's own words . " Do we say , then , that the end for man is happiness ? No . The good here , the highest good , is from the normal activity of the moral powers . As such , that activity is obedience to the law of God , however revealed . It is all that can he commanded or directly willed , or that can be approved and honored . It is virtue ; it is holiness . Do we then say that virtue , or holiness , is the end for man ? No ; for in this holiness there is a , blessedness wholly distinctive and peculiar ,  - -  higher , purer , nobler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and as inseparable from the holiness as light is from the sun . Not , then , in happiness without holiness do we say is the true end for man , for without that the happiness could not be ; not in holiness without happiness , for without that the holiness could not he and he holiness , any more than the sun could he the sun without its light . But we do say that the true end for man is HOLY HAPPINESS , that is , BLESSEDNESS . Not the oxygen alone do we need , not the hydrogen alone , but the water , - that living water of which if a man drink he shall never thirst . " - pp. 193 , 196. // To complete the treatment of this part of the subject , it only remained to notice the relation between natural and moral good . Moral good results directly and necessarily from moral goodness , and moral evil directly and necessarily from moral badness , or wickedness . We naturally conclude that moral goodness should also have a causal relation to natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the present state we do not find it so . This often shocks our sense of fitness , and for this difficulty philosophy affords no adequate solution , though some of its suggestions may , in some degree , relieve its pressure . The present state seems , therefore , to direct our thoughts forward to a future life ; and if this be admitted , it is seen that the want of right adjustment which we feel may be , and probably is , only temporary , - the result of a present derangement of the Divine order . Under a perfect moral government , we must conceive that there can be no opposition between natural and moral good , but that moral goodness will be causal for both alike . We have been so full in the exposition of our author s views thus far , that we must content ourselves with briefly referring to two or three topics more . One of the most important of the remaining points discussed is found in the opening of the ninth Lecture . Dr. Hopkins here endeavors to determine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moral science . In looking at an outward act of a moral being , and inquiring into its character , we may trace it backward to its source , or forward to its consequences . Going back to the moral activity in which it originated , we find in some mode of this the moral quality of the action , in view of which we say that it is virtuous or vicious , good or bad . Going forward , we reach the consequences of the action , which we characterize as useful or injurious , right or wrong ; terms which , as has been shown , denote relation to an end , and not , in strict propriety , moral quality . To attribute moral quality to actions apart from the moral activity in which they have their origin , as is done by many writers , it is insisted , is not only inaccurate in itself , but productive of great confusion both of language and of thought . Moral quality President Hopkins will have attributed only to the activity of a moral agent , a responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the choice of the highest end . An action is right when it is the action most directly conducive to the attainment of that end . Moral philosophy properly confines itself to the sphere of moral quality . What , then , is the province of conscience , and how far is it infallible ? We have seen that , in the system under review , conscience is a function of the moral reason . Of course its action is not directly dependent on the will . If the conscience be unperverted , and see the subject about which it judges as it is , its decision may be relied on as infallible . Or , to state the same thing differently , in deciding between good and evil clearly apprehended according to the nature of each , conscience infallibly approves and commands the good . But while it infallibly asserts the obligation to choose the supreme end , and must , therefore , assert the obligation of acts as right which are seen to be essential to the attainment of that end , there is room for misjudgment as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through this misjudgment conscience may approve as right what is not right in fact , and condemn as wrong what really is not wrong . The conscience may be perverted by moral causes . It may be misled by errors of the judgment . It may be improved , like other faculties , by training , or may act imperfectly for want of training . In the case of a perfect being , the voice of conscience will be simply the voice of approval , speaking peace perpetually to the soul . The tenth Lecture discusses the relation of virtue to rectitude , and to expediency and prudence . Where virtue exists , there can be a failure in rectitude only by mistake . The want of virtue involves guilt , and this stands related to the incalculable consequences which a personal God , acting as moral Governor , may inflict in the form of direct punishment . The want of rectitude involves a departure from the line of conduct demanded by the nature of things , and draws after it the natural evil which the wrong action , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong not to the sphere of virtue , which is concerned with ends , but to that of rectitude , which is concerned with means for the attainment of ends . The origin of moral distinctions Dr. Hopkins finds in the // Divine character and will . In this connection he expresses his disapproval of what he characterizes as the common mode of speaking of the nature of God , as if this were something behind his will and determining his conduct . iDr . Hickok had before presented this view with great strength of statement. * Both these writers deny that there is any nature in God lying behind his free and rational activity ; and think that to ascribe to him such a nature is to make him a mere causa causata . Whether anything like this has been really intended , or fairly implied , when the Divine nature has been spoken of , there may be some room to doubt . But we find just here a good illustration of the inadequacy of language as the instrument of such discussions ; for President Hopkins is still obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rational nature ? ) - determines his will and action . Go back as we may , lie says , we find simply a personal God , rational and free . As such , he is a law unto himself , subject to no necessity , except the necessity there is that reason should act rationally . Is not this , then , a real necessity ? Does not Dr. Hopkins allow this when he says that , instead of a blind fate , the conception of God as supernatural gives us that moral certainty which accompanies the highest freedom ? Is it really anything more than this that good thinkers have meant when they have spoken of the nature of God ? We do not remember to have met with a stronger assertion of a nature in God anywhere , than one which we have noticed in a little work on practical religion , which has recently been published . " God , no less than man , " says this writer , " has a nature , and within that nature laws by which he is irresistibly governed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is probable , indeed certain , that , if xve could see clearly into the depths of the Divine counsels , we should find nothing arbitrary or adventitious in any of the works or decrees of the Almighty ; nothing , I mean , which could have been otherwise than that which it is . Choice is the glory of humanity , - its distinctive attribute ; raising a man as high above the inferior creatures as it sinks him below Deity , for to choose is obviously as human as is to err ; iafinitc wisdom can see and take but one way . " t Rational Cosmology , p. 52 . I The Patience of Hope , p. 130 , note . // Yet , immediately after these strong expressions , we read - " What is Predestination , the Christian form of Fatalism , but this , - the everlastin* purpose of God towards good , which sin by its very nature contradicts ? " But what is the purpose of God more than a determination of his will in the light of his infinite reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still it may not have been amiss to call attention to this point , and to insist that there is nothing back of the reason and the will of God , as they have done . It is certainly a grave error to conceive of God as lacking any element of the highest possible freedom . We must conclude our analysis of the work before us with simply stating , that it is further shown that man 's true end may be pursued not only as apprehended distinctly , not only by reason , but also by instinct and by faith , these acting in coincidence with reason ; that , in a lecture on rights , it is maintained that rights have their origin in the will of God , expressed in the constitution of man 's active nature , and as connected with the attainment of his end , - so that alienable rights are those which are not essential to the attainment of his end , and inalienable rights those that are thus essential ; and , finally , that the discussion closes with a consideration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality the solemn sanctions of religion . It will be seen by all who are familiar with the subject , that , in pursuing his own course , President Hopkins has travelled straight through the disputed territories of moral science . If his premises are sound , and he has reasoned from them consistently , - if his doctrine of ends is valid , and there is no material error in the attempted adjustment of all parts of the system to it , - then , certainly , an important advance is made in this discussion . Some of the most difficult and hitherto unsettled questions - the Gordian knots of theoretical ethics - are finally disposed of , and the science is rendered more harmonious and complete . It is of course to be expected that the different schools already existing will form different judgments as to the degree of success attending this new effort ; but , characterized as it is by great candor combined with marked ability , it can not fail to be kindly and respectfully // received , even by those who may dissent from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lectures have very important bearings on other related subjects , particularly on theology ; but the consideration of these , not altogether suited to our pages , we must leave to those within whose province they more appropriately fall . We shall , however , in conclusion , make some general suggestions on one or two of the more essential points involved in the proposed system , the substance of which we have endeavored to give to our readers . The central question in morals must always be , What is the ultimate object for man as a moral being ? Is it his own happiness , demanded by the instincts , apprehended by the intellect as included in the highest happiness of the universe , and pursued with a just regard to that ? Is it an ultimate right intuitively perceived by reason and recognized as imperative by conscience ? Or is it something different from either ? The principal moral systems , hitherto , appear to be grounded on one or the other of the conceptions above named , or on some modification of one or the other of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Hopkins proposes what he believes to be a tertium quid , a new conception , on the basis f which a system may be reared , which , instead of being identical with either of the others , is something intermediate , and involving a synthesis of the radical ideas of both . Such a system he has endeavored to construct , as we have seen . Has he succeeded ? Let us recapitulate , in the briefest possible manner , the main elements of his system , of which we have given a somewhat full analysis . Not right , but moral good - holy blessedness - is ultimate . Obligation is affirmed in connection with choice , - the choice of an end as good . The supreme good , the end for which God made us , results from the highest moral activity , - that is , from the highest love of goodness for itself , and not as related to something beyond . Moral reason perceives the supreme end by direct intuition ; and conscience , which is a function of the moral reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemns whatever stands in the way of its attainment . // Virtue consists in the free and rational choice of the supreme end ; and right , in the doing of those things which stand directly related to that end as means . Moral quality appertains only to the moral activity of a person . It does not belong to actions in themselves , and apart from such activity . It will be seen , that , while the theory which regards happiness as ultimate makes virtue to consist in pursuing one 's own happiness in the way demanded by a due regard to the happiness of all , - and while the theory which regards right as ultimate makes virtue to consist in obeying the categorical imperative of conscience commanding the right simply as right , - Dr. Hopkins 's theory , which regards moral good as ultimate , makes virtue to consist in the choice of the end for which God created the rational soul , - the holy blessedness to be found in the highest moral activity , - this immanent or generic choice of course involving all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory , moral reason intuitively apprehends holy blessedness as " the last end of God in the creation " of man . God has created him , not for mere happiness , not for mere rectitude , but for that good which is the synthesis of the two , - the good included in the activity of his highest powers in a right relation to their highest object ; which necessarily involves the two inseparably combined . This good , moreover , as supreme , is seen , in the light reason , to be altogether excellent in itself . It commands the approbation of the rational soul . Because it is a soul endowed with moral reason , the human soul recognizes in this good that beyond which there can be to it no other good that in the attainment of which the highest development and perfection of its being , the discharge of its highest obligations , and the complete fulfilment of its end , are realized . But because this supreme good includes in it happiness , it by no means follows that this theory makes happiness - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory does . The choice of this good , for its own intrinsic excellence , is not the choice of it as a utility . It does not make utility the ground of virtue . It lays the foundation for an immutable morality , by making virtue to consist in the choice of that 34* // which moral reason sees to be supremely good , for its own sake . We have seen it suggested , in a notice of the book elsewhere , that President Hopkins is inconsistent with himself ; that , while he professedly rejects the theory of utility , his principles really involve it . We think this criticism not well founded . It strikes us , on the contrary , that it is one of the distinguishing features of the treatise , that it exhibits a rigid and unflinching adherence to the first principles or truths asserted , from the beginning to the end . We have marvelled at the coolness and the courage with which the author has pursued his way across the old battle-fields of mighty men . We think that , whatever else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be allowed that he has fairly carried it through the whole sphere of morals , and has logically developed its results . Whether these results are identical with those of the utilitarian theory , our readers have before them the means of judging for themselves . If to avoid utilitarianism it be necessary to have a theory requiring man to act without any regard whatever to what is useful , and implying that God has made a universe that is of no use at all either to himself or to his creatures , then doubtless Dr. Hopkins should be classed as a utilitarian ; but not otherwise . If any should choose to regard his system as including all that the best thinkers have intended , when they have made utility the ground of virtue , this is what he himself has claimed ; only lie supposes that it involves also something more , namely , that likewise which is intended by the best thinkers who hold that virtue must find its ground in the eternal , absolute right . But inasmuch as Dr. Hopkins makes good , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were one so disposed , by disregarding his definitions and distinctions , so to misrepresent him as to make him seem in fact to favor the utilitarian theory . It is none the less true , however , that his system is essentially and self-consistently of a different character . Hopkins In making good ultimate , instead of riolit Dr believes himself to be sustained by the results of a careful analysis of man as a moral being ; and he is confirmed in // his conviction of the correctness of his analysis , by the fact that it leads him as a philosopher to assume precisely that to be the highest end for man which is declared to be his highest eiid by the revealed law of God ; namely , supreme love to God as to the highest moral object to which he stands related . In fulfilling his end , therefore , on this theory , man leads the life of love ; freely , spontaneously , without constraint of law , devoted to that which his highest reason approves and rests in as absolute excellence or goodness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element of virtuous life must , on the other hand , necessarily be subjection to law , - obedience to the eternal rule of rectitude ; in other words , duty , constraint , first , and only secondarily affection , - affection always implying the apprehension of a good , and good itself being secondary , according to this theory . The love of the absolute right does not seem to be a possible conception , as man 's nature actually is . Or if it be maintained that the absolute right may be chosen as a good , then good becomes the ultimate object after all , as Dr. Hopkins has maintained , or at least the two become identified . It is a further advantage of the system under review , if its conclusions be accepted , that it harmonizes , or brings into coalescence , the teleological and the a priori systems of morality . The recognition of a moral governor is an indispensable condition of any moral system . Accordingly , it was formerly the usual course to prove the existence and attributes of God inductively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to deduce from these man 's moral relations and duties . Although the logical process in this mode of reasoning was always incomplete , the method was nevertheless valid quoad hoc , carrying the mind , through the convictions of the understanding , up to a point at which reason intuitively saw the rest . Since Kant , on the other hand , it has been fashionable to decry the argument to the understanding as worthless . It has been held that our knowledge of God , the Absolute Being , the All-Perfect , is an intuition of the reason , or , in other words , of the rational mind in the light of reason ; and that the same is true of the ultimate right and of moral obligation . Does , then , this system which // ascribes to man , in virtue of his moral reason , an intuition of his end , and of his obligation to attain it , and assigns to the understanding all questions which relate to the choice of means , and to the sphere of cause and effect , adjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make one symmetrical and perfect whole ? If it does this , as the author believes that it does , it is a great service rendered to philosophy . We should transcend our proper limits were we to dwell longer on the topics treated in the volume which has occupied us , and to which no brief analysis can render full justice . We have done what we could in so few words to make a fair exposition of what the author has proposed to himself . We have chosen to present his systep.1 of moral science as it is , and to call attention to its distinctive peculiarities , rather than to pronounce for ourselves positively on its results . " Non nostrum inter vos tantas componere lites ! " A new system of morals must gradually work its way into the appreciative thought of those who have been trained to other views . It is hardly to be supposed that the author of such a system would himself be able to adjust all parts in detail to his new point of view , without leaving some incongruities apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this discussion as a whole , that it bears the impress of extraordinary intellectual strength , and is characterized by patient and independent thought , and by a grateful freshness and elegance of treatment , not less than by originality of plan . President Hopkins uses language generally with precision , and expresses his meaning in few words . Here and there a paragraph or sentence , by its rhetorical spirit and turn of expression , reminds one that the author in writing had the demands of an audience in mind . If these passages should strike any as not altogether in the best style of philosophical discussion , it will be remembered that the task of interesting a popular assembly with such themes , and holding their attention through a series of lectures , must have seemed formidable enough , even with all possible accommodation of the mode of address to the public ear . There is nothing , however , really objectionable in these rhetorical expre*siOn5 on the contrary , they are often // striking and beautiful in a high degree , and serve to give animation even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ascribed some slight defects of arrangement , occasioning a few repetitions , and the partial consideration of a topic in different places , when it might perhaps better have been exhibited at once . A reader , with the volume in his hand , can turn back if he chooses , and review a point passed over ; but for the hearer , it may be necessary that what has been said should be recurred to , and even restated in some new connection . The work embraces in its outline the entire field of moral science , and is well adapted for a text-book in the hands of a competent instructor . Such an instructor would of course give greater fulness to the outline , and assist his pupils to trace out the system into more minute details than a course of lectures would allow . The work has nothing ungenial in its tone , nothing to prevent it from gaining a kind reception ; and when it has had time to find candid and discriminating readers , it must be regarded , even by those who may dissent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid value . It is gratifying to observe that increased attention is paid in our country to intellectual and moral science . The appearance of several new text-books in both these departments , some of them containing no small amount of fresh and vigoroiis discussion , may fairly be accepted as proof that such is really the fact . Intimately connected as these studies are with the development of theoretical and practical Christianity , with sound . principles of government and political economy , and with individual and social virtue , the importance of giving them a larger share of attention in every course of liberal education , and of presenting them in the best form for study and instruction , can not well be overrated . To have thoroughly mastered such a treatise as this which we have noticed , and to have followed out the trains of thought which it suggests , is to be armed with trenchant weapons against the sceptical and virtually atheistic philosophy which young men of education and thought must now encounter on every hand . It is not so much , perhaps , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions , as it is in a thorough acquaintance with // the whole field of inquiry , a knowledge of what the greatest thinkers have achieved from their several stand-points , that the safety of the earnest inquirer will be found . Let our young men clearly see in their courses of study that the difficulties connected with moral and religious truth , and about which sciolists so often talk and write with flippancy , have in them nothing new ; that they have occupied the noblest intellects of the race , and , by their patient and candid examinations , have been steadily diminishing ; and that they have never had , at any time , sufficient force to shake the firm foundations on which the best wisdom of the world has rested , and they will not be forward to renounce what they already hold as the accumulated solid gold of ages , for the sake of catching at some glittering tinsel of the hour . " Doth any man doubt , " says Lord Bacon , " that if there were taken out of men 's minds vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would , and the like , but it would leave the minds of a number of men poor , shrunken things , full of melancholy and indisposition , and unpleasing to themselves ? The most effectual way to prevent the minds of men from being filled with what is worthless , or becoming , through emptiness , poor shriluken things , is to have inwrought with their earliest and most profound convictions the substantial and ennobling lessons of a just philosophy of the nature and the duties of man as a moral being , and as related to the invisible and the eternal . We hope the day is not distant when such studies shall hold a far more prominent place in the curriculum of our universities and colleges than they have hitherto held . The late Mr. Choate , in one of his richest and most elaborate orations , insisted on the " Conservative Influence of the Bar . " f If our beloved country is destined , as we yet confidently hope , to weather the present storm , - if , with the wisdom drawn from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrestling with adversity , she is to hold steadily on to a noble national manhood , and towards a future worthy of her youth , - she will need the highest influences of a conservative and healthful culture to temper the ardor and to steady the im // pulses of her freely developed life . She will find such influences eminently in her chairs of Moral Philosophy , if these are what they should be , - if , as in the work we have now reviewed , it shall be clearly shown , in the halls of public instruction , that reason and revelation are coincident in their teachings , the latter confirming and enforcing the former , as with the solemn voice of God . Under such training , it may be confidently anticipated that there will come up men of clear and right perceptions , of sturdy principle , of incorruptible integrity , and lofty aims , - men who shall be worthy to be the statesmen , legislators , and magistrates of a great and free republic , destined to be for the world an exponent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
