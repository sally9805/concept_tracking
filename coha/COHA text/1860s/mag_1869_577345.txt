ANCHORED OFF BJNGIIAMTON. * BINGHAMTON is not a seaport town - on the contrary , it is more than two hundred miles from the sea-board , and the rivers Susquehanna and Chenango , between which the city is located , are hardly damp enough at this point to float a scow or a flat-bottomed pleasureboat . Nevertheless , I came to anchor about two miles above Binghamton , skywards , after taking thirty-six annual voyages on the sea of life . My six preceding voyages had been tempestuous and unsuccessful . Sometimes I had carried too much sail , sometimes Ihad been disappointed in my anchor and had drifted-my compass had often failed me , my chart was at fault , my ventures were unlucky , my owners had become dissatisfied , my ship was in sad want of repair ( and I had lost all of my possessions excepting that , and one invaluable jewel ) , when I came at last to anchor off Binghamton . Let me here drop metaphor and speak in plain language . At thirty-six years of age I was rapidly becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inebriate Asylum at Binghamton , for reformation of character and restoration of my shattered health . For some time before deciding to come , I had heard much of the Asylum from advising friends to whom it was manifest , as it was to my own mind , that a change in my order of life must be made , and I had given much consideration to the subject . My health at last decided in a most impetuous manner , and I came . I had found it to be imposible to break off from the habit of excessive drinking in New York , after trying repeatedly to do so . Arguments ( and none argued to me in more convincing language than I argued to myself ) were * The value of this article depends much upon the fact that it is a frank and earnest statement of actual and recent personal experience ; while the logic of its cenclusion may he questioned . of no effect . My intellect presented the moral ethics of the question to my soul ; my conscience displayed the crime of the action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noisily to my brain ; and I still kept on drinking . It did not seem to me so much a lack of power to resist the drink , at the moment when the taking it was known to me to be the criminal overstep of temperance , as it was the lack of the will to exercise that power . I do not bring before you any excuse by pleading an overwhelming craving which can not resist the glass . I am not sensible of this in my own case , and I do not believe in it , excepting in instances where the subject is partially insane ; in which case nothing but enforced total abstinence will effect any remedy , as a razor would be taken from the reach of a person with a morbid tendency to self-destruction . I do not propose to allude to such cases in this article , nor to allow of any such excuse in those to whom I address my own experience , for I am confident that such instances are of very rare occurrence , and that the discussion of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is terribly injurious to the really guilty drinker . Nor do I propose to treat upon that temporary sick condition of body and mind resulting from the reaction of a prolonged spell of intemperate drinking ( which I have gone through with , again and anain , almost to death ) that demands the agency of alcoholic stimulants as a prompt restorative-for that is not the craving of the appetite , but the call of nature , to be responded to , under advice , as a physical requirement . I do not propose , either , to make a sensational magazine-article , for I have no ability or inclination to do so . I will lay before yom* , in all seriousness , my own experience , knowing that there are far , far too many of the readers of // this Magazine to whom it will be absorbingly interesting ; not for the sake of him who writes it , but for their own sakes ; or , for the sake of those whom they love , perhaps , more dearly than their own lives . I will try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details in reference to the place itself , which he may not find elsewhere , and concerning which I can remember to have desired information before I started from the city . The man who , like myself , has acted in discordance with his own judgment and sacrificed his power to control himself to his own self-indulgence to such an extent that his will is partially paralyzed by the force of habit ,  - -  whose mental muscles ( if I may use such an expression ) are relaxed so that the mind and judgment can not exercise themselves upon the will-who finds in the city , or in the society which surrounds him , or in the business that he pursues , temptations to excess that he would gladly escape-let him leave for three months all these belongings , and come to anchor up here with me , and quietly and calmly glance back upon his past career ; and , while he rests from the cares of business , let him prepare bimselt morally and physically , for the rest of the battle of life that lies before him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grief in time gene by , spot the turning point , overhaul our books , " and when found , stick a pin in . Come at once ,  --  do not wait ,  --  regard it as a matter of life or death ; and , if the latter , where would your business then be , and what kind of a memory would you leave behind for your friends l Leave every thing ! Business , social ties , wife , children , all ,  --  if you can not conquer the habit of intemperance where you are ; or , which is f/ic same thing , if you are not actively and successfully engaged in conquering it . Leave your business with a friend , and your children with your wife , and bid good-by to all for three months ; you would have to do it if death summoned you ,  --  do it now when ljfc summons you . There is no shame or disgrace in the act ; there is in remaining as you now are . Put three hundred dollars in your pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your trunk ( the more the better ) , and get aboard the Erie Railroad . Binghamton is about eight hours ' ride from New York city . There is no occasion for a preliminary correspondence with the Superintendent . You can come right up . from the station in a carriage for three dollars , and bring your luggage with you , as to any other hotel . You will go into the office and see Dr. Day ( waiting for no introduction , for he knows you very well ) , and pay him for thirteen weeks ' board , in advance , at twenty dollars per week , and will be at once assigned* a room , after answering some formal questions to a printed registry kept in the office . I have , you will notice , been taking for my companion , so far , a manof mature years and family ties , who is sincerely desirous of conquering the habit of intemperance , and I have . no&amp; alluded to any possible difficulty in the way of procuring the necessary funds . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resident of the State of New York , he may have very material reduction made from the regular terms in his case ; but a correspondence must be entered into with the authorities , on his behalf before he arrives . The accomplished and learned President of the Board of Trustees , than whom there is not a more active philanthropist in the world , Dr. Willard Parker , said in my hearing , " If a man is worth saving , we want to try and save him , and would rather take him for nothing than turn him away on account of his poverty . " But as a general rule , the money can be spared , for as an investment it is safe and sure ; and , invested for the restoration of a body , it may prove the ransom of a soul . There are men of immature years , and who are not desirous of conquering this habit of excessive drinking , who come up here . They had better stay away . No one should come here , old or young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is idle , useless , and demoralizing . To drink at home to excess is bad enough . To drink in a strictly temperance establishment , where drink can only be obtained by a sacrifice of honor , is many more times worse , and much more injurious , physically and morally , to the one who transgresses . To the friends or guardians of very young men , I would say , do not send your boys here unless they themselves strongly desire to purge themselves from the evils of an early acquired habit of intemperance . Do not send boys against their will , or unwilling men of weak minds , who are suffering from this evil thing , for they will be but company to each other in their debauches . Such men in coming here seem to consider that they have openly declared that they are drunkards , and therefore it is necessary for them tn keep up their character for consistency , even if they have lost all other character ; separated from the mild restraint that home , society , or a lingering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves up to liquor whenever they can obtain it . No expostulation , no rules , will keep them soberphysical confinement alone will do that ,  --  and they will come back to you ten times worse than they left you . This is not a penitentiary , it is an asylum , a resting-place , and a man who comes to it must* , will to be cured ; it must be the one object in his life up here , always present , always pressing , to his mind . To such a man the institution is an asylam for the time being , and wards off the overpowering temptations of his ordinary life , and enables him to recuperate . To any other man it must do more harm than it can do good . If you are now , as you read this , in a low state of bodily health , resulting from excessive drinking , and it is impossible for you to dispense with stimulants ; - if you have suffered from epilepsy , or from delirium in any form , and feel yourself to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a tried medical man ( if he knows your habits and constitution , so much the better ) , and he will put you into a proper condition to undertake the journey . If you can get a friend to come up with you , do so ; or , best of all , your wife , or sister , or mother , because they can see , and satisfy themselves with , the pleasant domestic arrangements of the place ; they will be made quite welcome , so long as your health is any matter of immediate anxiety , and will return home with a happier sense of security , perhaps ; but however that may be , remember that the place is ready for you now , at one just as you are , and that however sick you may be , you will be well and carefully treated . Of course , you must have some suffering and mental anguish to go through , whether you be here or elsewhere , before you get right again . Poor friend ! do n't I know it ? there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no power on earth to minister any comfort ; there is no drug or subtle essence that can ward that off ; but , here , there is one cheering , soft thought for you to turn your sick spirit upon , and that is : I have at last taken the st*p to stop this ; if Idie n , 1 shall die trying to amend the past , and if I live , I WILT* live this life no more again farever . And , you will live ; and as strength comes back , and you climb , at last , out of hell ; and appetite , and blessed , blessed sleep return to you , you will have the new sensation that you are now in the right path , and your past habits of life , are , at last , lwhind you . Whatever may have been the medicinal means used for you during the necessities of your illness to bring you through ( and they vary , according to the judgment of the attendant physicians ) , there is no more alcoholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whatever may be your opinion of total aktinence , or your expectation ultimately as to its practice in your own person while you are here , it is an absolute rule of conduct , a law of the Medes and Persians , a law from which there is no appeal . The propriety and necessity of this is manifest ; // July , and the mind must not , under any circumstances , admit the possibility of allowing any excuse for the opposite action , whatever be the desire or apparent necessity for it , or feeling of confidence in the safety of the action itself . This is part of the treatment you are under , and from it you will find out , m your own experience , that there is no indispensable necessity for you to use liquor as a digestive , or curative for the ailments to which you have been in the habit of applying it ; that the depression you suffer from ,  --  the sick headache that threatens you ,  --  the attack of dyspepsin you dread , will yield to , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that exercise , rest , wholesome food , and above all , sleep , will more than answer the purpose . And , when you have got to know this , it will be a material help to you in dealing with the use of stimulants by-and-by . Perhaps this has been a turning-point in your past experience , then fail not to note it honestly . You will probably have K*romide of Potassium* ' administered to you , until your outward manifestations of nervous derangement are controlled , and then you will be left to Nature 's remedies ; and you will go to bed night after night a clean , sober man , and you will sleep all the night , six hours , eight hours ( ten hours at first ) , without any waking up during the interval . Think of that , my friend , who art glad if thou canst coax four hours of forgetfulness out of twice that number of drinks ; has that no attraction ? arid to wake up without a headache , without a sense of degradation , with a clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have these no attractions I The twenty dollars a week that I left you paying to Dr. Day is required to be paid in advance for three months ( $260 ) , that the authorities of the place may have a claim on the resident , should it be necessary to enforce it ; that is to say , if he leave without the consent of the Superintendent , he forfeits the money he has paid ; and it is considered that three months should be passed here , unless obvious reasons exist for an earlier departure ; in that case the unused balance of the money is returned . There are no &amp;ttra expenses not included in the payment , it covers medical attendance , washing , gas , fire , &amp;c. , &amp;c . You will find your room to be neatly carpeted , about 20 x 14 , water laid on , and marble washstand , pretty iron bedstead , and good bed , with delicately white bed clothes . The whole appearance of the room is that of one of the upper rooms in the Continental Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted with gas , and on one side of the building looks out into the courtyard of the establishment , where there is always something going on ; and on the other side , over the beautiful valley of the Susquehanna . You can read all about the description of the building in Mr. Parton 's article in the October number of the Atlantic 3lagazine for last year . I have only been here during a very unpleasant winter season , and have not seen the place , outside , to advantage ; in the summer time , I am told that it is very beautiful and pleasant , and I can quite believe that it is so . You will notice the following regulations posted up in your room : NEW YORK STATE INEBRIATE ASYLUM . It being the object and purpose of the asylum to reform and , as it were , edaccie anew such persons as seek its benefits , it becomes absolntely necessary , theref*ne , that rales be established , and thEt they be carried ont with military precision . 1st . Patients are required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sunday . 2d . Strict attention to order and cleanliness in all respects is required . Cd . Lights in the rooms are to be extin : , uishcd at 10 o'clock r . N. 4th . Patients desiring to go beyond the premises , must obtain permission from the Superintendent . 5th . Patients are required to be punctual at meals . 13th . As profanity is always shocking and vulgar , even to those familiar with the practice , it is expected that a proper regard for the feelings of others , as well as gentlemanly instinct , will prevent its use by any inmate of the asylum . *th . Patients are cautioned against any unnecessary conYersation with the workmen or // servants of the asylum , and it is requested that any disrespect or inattention on the part of any employee be immediately reported to the Superin teudeut. 8th . As the Superintendent is prepared , and always ready , to give special medical advice and treatment in any case when it is necessary , all other prescriptions and all nostrums and patent medicines are positively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any patient that the above Rules , strictly respected , are esseatial to the comfort end happiness of all interested , and any wanton and persistent violation of them will be considered sufficient cause for expulsion . As YOU read these regulations , do not be piqued with them-remember what you have come here fur , and put down any thing in them that goes " against the grain " to part of the penalty you have to pay . There is nothing in them excepting what is advisable or necessary for the object sought , and their scrupulous insistance by the authorities varies in accordance with the status of the inmate . With regard to the first regulation , it is a very simple thing to do , the daily morning and evening services rarely exceed ten minutes ; the morning Sun4ty service is selected from the Episcopal form , and takes up about half an hour , the evening Sunday service comprises the order usually followed in a Presbyterian church , and the chaplain of the asylum preaches a sermon of about thirty minutes . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played by some one of the patients as accompaniment to the musical part of the services . I would ask leave to say , in this place , that I have been much surprised at the number of persons here as patients , who possess a more than ordinary knowledge of music ; it is a trait that at first astonished me , and has afforded me much pleasure that was quite unexpected . There is a good Weber piano in the receptionroom , from which we often have good harmony discoursed . The meals are served three times a day , breakfast at 8 A.M. , dinner ati P.M. , supper atO P.M. ; they are well served so far as attendance is concerned , and the table is as well supplied as one would expect . The food is wholesome , and there is plenty of it , though full use is not made of the means at hand . I dare say that in the fruit season much more may be expected , for there is a large and fine kitchen-garden under cultivation . The money that yqu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can , if you like , deposit in the office ; and , wanting any thing from the city , you can save yourself the trouble of going , by writing an order for what you want , and leaving it with one of the clerks ; it will be sent for through a messenger , and the amount charged to your account . This is , however , quite optional on your part . If you want to go down to Binghamton , you can do so . The Superintendent will give you a " pass , " unless you have demonstr4ed by your conduct that the going to the city is too great a temptation for you . But I do not think that you will want to pay that chartered hamlet a very frequent visit , for a duller and less interesting place it has never been my ill-fortune to see . There is positively nothing to attract you ; no library or reading room or museum , nothing in the shopwindows , and less in the stores . The only- amusement is to read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributing establishment , how Silas Isanes will sell at " public vendue , " &amp;c. , &amp;c. , " eight fowls being the property of so and so , " to " satisfy the claim of so and so ; " or , how " a red cow was found upon the premises of the undersigned , and will be sold to defray expenses in accordance with the statute , in such case made and provided , ** &amp;c. , &amp;c . The outskirts of the city have some pretty residences , and there are good walks in the neighborhood . But whether you intend to go " down town , " or to walk the other way , if you desire to pass off the grounds , you should first get a " pass " from the Superintendent . You may know that you do not need to get this , but you should do it as a recognition of his authority , which it is as . much your interest to support , as it is of the citizens of New York city to support Judge Barnard in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of material for recreation and amusement inside the building  --  a good bowling-alley , billiard tables , and a small theatre suited for parlor theatricals . There is a literary club , where papers of consider ? able interest are read on stated evenings , and where chess , whist , and other games can be enjoyed . There is a library ( penuriously limited ) and a reading-room , in which are the leading daily and weekly papers , and the usual supply of American and foreign periodicals . The mail is received twice a day ( Sundays excepted ) at about 11 A. M. and 6 r. *. ; the address , " Care of Dr. Day , Binghamton , New York , " with your name , or initials , is sufficient to find you . The Western mail usually comes up in the first distribution , and letters posted in New York city at the general post-office before 3.30 i ' . M. of the previous day . The evening mail brings letters posted in New York up to 8 r . M. of the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no restriction in regard to the use of tobacco in any form , and it is consumed to an enormous extent , no attention being paid by the generality of the residents to the sanitary rules that should control its use . The same may be said of coffee , and thus , in many instances , the unwise and unlimited use of these two stimulants injures the physical health of the inmates . But the object of the Institution is to inculcate the habit of total abstinence from alcoholic stimulants , on the principle that that , and that only , is the sole security for the man who has been an intemperate drinker ; it therefore interferes in his diet with nothing else , and leaves to a person 's own judgment the use of narcotics and stimulants of an unalcoholic nature . Perhaps this is advisable . Drinking coffee , smoking , or the use of tobacco in any other form , is to some extent beneficial , as well as pleasant ; but it ceases to be beneficial before it ceases to be agreeable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opportunity to test the reformation of his habits of seW-control , July , and to practice his power of self-denial on a less dangerous agent than alcohoL There are opium patients up here sometimes , and , of course , a special treatment is required in their case . I am not aware if it be the desire of the Trustees to receive such ; but I should think that it would not be , for they present so opposite a class of patients to the intemperate drinking man , and have so many particularities that do not exist in his case , that the very fact of their mixing with and comparing notes with the reforming inebriate , , is dangerous to the well-being of the latter . What I mean to say is this : there are so many excuses for the opium-eater for continuing his habit when it is once strongly formed-nay , it is death at last and prolonged pangs before that for him to stop short ,  --  that in listening to him the inebriate is likely to confound his own case with the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect is bad , for the inebriate must come to consider that he holds the power to cure himself ; that his not exercising it is his own guilt , that ( after the first physical requisition , necessitated by a course of intemperance , is past ) he holds in his own hands his cure and his salvation ; that there is no excuse for his falling again , no palliation for him if he does so , it is his own crime , knowingly and willingly committed . Do not let me here be construed into suggesting any discouragement for the opium-eater . I know that he can , and does continually , successfully overcome , heroically , this habit . I only want to convey the idea that this , in my opinion , is not a favorable place for him to effect a cure. * * As an example of the truth of any opinion , I would mention here the following incident : After I had finished this article , I read it aloud up at the Asylum to three gentlemen , with whom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following letter , and I put in the sentences about not wishing to discourage the opium eater , &amp;c . At the time I read this to him , I was not aware that be had been so affected by the habit : " DEAR FRIEND : I wish to tell you how very much your manuscript has pleased me . Perhaps I might criticise some of the theories as they relate to causes for inebriety ; hut this , however , is of no importance , more than to suggest rcmcdics some The // inmates of the Institution are , of course , changing all the time . During the months that I have been here , the society has been attractive and agreeable , presenting a much higher average of intellect and attainments than would be found in any miscellaneous collection of the same number of men . I am told by the Chaplain of the asylum that it is usually the case , and he has a good opportunity of judging . Of course , among ninety or a hundred men there will be many varieties and dispositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the attractions and repulsions of individuals , will spring up . This one thing , however , you will be obliged to recognize in the social organization of the place , viz. , that good fellowship , brilliant conversation , and friendly intercourse , or , for the matter of that , gossiping scandal and stupid bickering , do not require the aid of stimulants to develop them , or to increase their enjoyment . Billiards need not mean beer or brandy , ten-pins , whisky-toddy , nor a rubber at whist or euchre , " drinks for the party . " This you are compelled to notice , and it what in consonance . The chief value your paper has for me is the clear and certainly easy enough rule of life you lay out . Easy enough ? No ! but attainable , and OCCO reached , a triumph so great , as to make all other victories easy .

The victims of opium are badly off , unless they can fly to some place like this ; besides , it is not unusual to trace this habit to that other one of drinking . In my own case , I looked for relief in delirium to opium . This last vice overshadowed the first . And while I live , I can never be sufficiently thankful for having been brought here , against my will , too . My dear fellow , for God and Heaven 's sake , say nothing to discourage the opium-eater .

Perhaps this has been another turningpoint in your past experience , then fail not to note it honestly . On every Wednesday evening there is a lecture in the chapel by the Superintendent , of a chatty and conversational description , and all the inmates are specially invited to be present . Dr. Day is a total abstinence man in his habits , and is a strong , healthy-looking man , in the prime of life . The lectures , as a general thing , partake too much of the ethical view of intemperance , and it is to be regretted that they do not enter more into the therapeutics of alcoholism and the physical organization affected by the misuse of alcohol . Dr. Day insists upon total abstinence , at once and forever , as the only course for a past intemperate man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical necessity , upon the ground that such a man has lost both his moral and physical ability to control himself in this thing . He bases his opinion upon the fact ( and herein he is to be attended to with the most absorbing thoughtfulness on the part of the listener ) that in an e perie**we of twelve years ' constant intercour8e w'c*th inebriates of all ages and disyositions he has er known a n who had been intemperate to be able to drink at all without falling again into ex*cess ; and that he has known , and now knows , of many instances where , by practising total abstinence , such a man has been restored to the full powers and enjoyments of health . But Dr. Day does not suppose that he has heard from more than twenty-five per cent , of those who have been under his care , and is constantly receiving back for re-treatment those who have left him apparently cured , and strong advocates of this measure . You must form your own opinion of the Doctor 's lectures for yourself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only as they are parts of the systeln under which you have placed yourself for treatment ; but after all the // Doctor is but a man , and this question must be settled by yourself alone and unaided . The Institution removes from you the immediate operating causes for drinking , and puts you under certain rules and regulations by which you voluntarily consent to be guided during your residence here , and Dr. Day advises you according to his lights and experience , but you , yourself , have got to do the work , and find the way to do it . Having now introduced you to the Institution , and familiarized you with the outside life of the residents , I will guide you to the threshold of the real educational department of the place , the door of your own room . Here , within its four walls , you must fight the fight out with yourself , with no living aid from any man . You have to do with yourself as you are at present , a man under the influence of an evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1st . What l*rought you under that hcthit ? 2d . What keeps you under it ? Now , to answer the first question we must look this thing straight in the face , and on your honesty in meeting this issue depends , to a great extent , the result you are striving for . Let us , once and for all , cast from our minds excuses of " hereditary disposition to intemperance , " and " our peculiar organization ; " we must not consider these at all in bringing this matter face to face with our judgment . If these things do exist they are but curious physiological facts , and may perhaps be useful in forming our judgment upon the falls of others , but not upon our own . Shall I , poor , weak , pitiful creature , crouching down under the weight of my self-indulgence , point to yonder man and say , " If God had only made me strong like him ,  --  if I had the force of will that has sustained him - if I had been born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how happy and blessed should I be I ' , Think you not that his position has been gained through strife and hardlywon battles with self ? Are you to July , lower him from the place he has gained by finding excuses for yourself in what you call " his superior organization ? " Has he no wounds to show , received in his struggle with himself ? And where are your scars ? You basely surrendered to slavery . He fought against it , and has won . Perhaps you have sonwtimes gone wrong at this point in time gone by ; if so , fail not to note it honestly ; and remember that it is with our own conscious sense of outraged responsibility that you have to deal . Am I too severe in the conclusion that I am leading you to , in answer to our first homequestion-think of it , my reader , in the integrity of your own heart . Are you conscious of any real excuse in giving way to intemperance ? Are the excuses that you hear others make for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in language yourself , in your heart of hearts ? Do you really think that your indulgence is the result of your " easy disposition , " of " your love of sociability , " of " your generous impulses ? ' * Do not these very attributes , if you possess them , cry out against the indignity of the accusation ? do they not throw you back on the plain , broad , staring fact that guilty inclination has guided you , and self-gratification has leen your aim and end ? Do not the thoughts of other habits to be dropped point unmistakably to this answer , as they cloud the view of the pure self that might have been ? Here is my answer to the first question . Now , to answer the second . Have we exercised our will not to do this thing , as much as we have exercised our will to do it ? In my own case I am conscious that I have willed to do , more than I have willed not to do ; but I am also aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is impaired . I am not satisfied , therefore , to say that my absence of inclination , or will , to do otherwise is alone the reason that this habit holds to me . And to demonstrate this , let me present before you three rules that I laid down for myself soon after coming into the asylum . I felt PUTNAM 'S MAGAZINE . // then , as I said in the commencement of this article , that it was the will to exercise the power to do that I lacked most ; and I determined to test myself by these slight things , which to myself I made real and important things . 1st . Do some one thing every day that I do not like , no matter , having *xed upon it , how trivial or unimportant , or even foolish , it may seem , whether physical or immaterial , whether it be a minute matter affecting my personal habits or social intercourse ; or of a higher moral character ; do it , and do it the more , persistently and conscientiously the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diary , and put down every evening in it all that I can remember of my actions and during the day . thoughts 3d . Read six verses of the Book of Psalms or Proverbs every morning . I found , on commencement , the 2d and 3d a little tiresome , and while they continued so I let them take the place of ' the first ; but as they became habits , and , being simply mechanical , required but little exercise of power , I insisted upon exacting the first . Here I had a fight , and yet there was the consciousness of the will existing to do the thing . I put it off till the last moment , I would not think of any thing to do during the day , I would try by ingenious reasoning to argue myself into the absurdity of the action . I would try to palm off trifling things in the place of some one thing that had already arranged itself in my mind as the disliked thing for the day . I was compelled to see in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I had set before myself to obey this rule , as a curative agency , I tried to shirk it and evade it ; and it became manifest to me how relaxed was the power that I could bring to bear on the will , and that I was in an abnormal mental condition ; but I persisted , and I conquered . I found out thus the following answer to the second question I had put to myself , viz. , that not only had my will kept me in this habit , but my power to exercise my will to break off from it was voL. iv. -2 impaired . This was a great point to arriv* at , because if you find out just where the damage is , you know where to apply the remedy ; and the remedy in this case is clear to my mind ; first to put the will to work on the side which it is disinclined to , and then insist on exercising the Jower to carry it out against all pleas to the contrary . Try this simple plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your power on slight things before again meeting the enemy that has so often conquered you ; but in any thing that you do set before yourself as a mental task up here ( outside of the great obligation itself of total abstinence ) do not press it upon yourself to irksomeness to an extent that will interfere at all with the object sought for . I am afraid that you will think me very self-asserting in the way I am writing , and may retort on me , " Physician , heal thyself . " Pardon me , dear reader , if P be so ; and I feel that I merit the replication ; but I am telling you my own experience , and of what I found useful in my own case , as I started to do . It is laid upon my mind to write as I am writing . It may be said , here , that all this mental discipline might be gone through with , without coining to an Institution of this kind , and the same result arrived at in one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been done ! it has been tried over and over again , and has failed ! Change of scene , avowal of infirmity , absence from the cares of business ; and , above all , the olligation of total abstinence , allied with all these , ai ? e great aids , and are all to be found in this asylum . There , weakness of character and want of self-command lead into snares ; and conscience has no fair play in the entanglements that surround one . Here , one 's lot is , for the time at least , fixed ; one has but little to fear , nothing to work for but one 's ultimate cure ; and , above all , leisure to think . Ah ! it is hard to take the back track in this thing in the city ; the strain of business , the attractions of old habits and fellowship , are very strong on the side of self-indulgence , // while the mind itself is in the sick condition I have alluded to . Think of the return to business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intemperance  --  the tangled condition of affairs , the neglected accumulation of work , the feeling of despondency , and entire inability to take up the end of the chain where you dropped it , the cold chill that runs down your backbone as the attempt is made , the shaking hand , the hateful feeling of self-disgrace ;  --  and the remedy , and the poison , next door ! Here , there is no such remedy , and no such malarious atmosphere while your real cure is daily progressing ; and here , you will find the difference in the result to that of all previous efforts . If your cure be not real up here , and you again fall , after the remedial treatment that I have sketched out has been pursued to its apparent end , what then ? Is there no hope ? Is there no hope for those who fall again and again I I answer there is hope just so long as the will to reform lasts , and no lrnger . So long as the will to practice the remedial course is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulated and cultivated , and the same course is always at your disposal . Only remember that each time you fall now you get weaker and feebler ! you are not like Ant*eus ; Earth is not your Mother . And each time you are felled by this thing you are more soiled and damaged by it , and more unfitted for a higher sphere of manhood . But you must not allow yourself to think of the possibility of such a degradation in the future . Here , in this little chamber , perhaps for the first time in your life , you are to be alone with yourself , to make an intimate friend of your own individual manhood , undisguised , as it really exists ; and , what do you find ? Thoughts , intelligence , knowledge , wishes , cravings ! Is this me ? It is new , strange , wonderful to contemplate ! And this bodily personality , has it the power to control , to fashion , to exhibit , to demonstrate this me ; and ,  --  oh , horror of horrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Oh , wonderful perfection of the beauty that might have been , that may be ! Oh , sublime combination of ideas and wishes ! Oh , cestacy and wonder of self-observation ! God in heaven , let meD never lose sight of myself again ! Why did 1 never know that I had such an inmate in my body before ? This room shall never be desolate to me with this companion . Physical suffering and infirmity need not interfere with this ; the sense of its possession is its own enjoyment . Time shall not hang heavily , for I can always retire to my newly found friend . " My heart is glad , and my glory rejoiceth , my flesh , also , shall rest in hope . " I do not know that this feeling will come to you at first , it did not so come to me ; it gradually stole over my mind as , step by step , I sought an undisguised acquaintance with myself . Perhaps you have arrived at this intimacy before , but I think not . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To me it sepms to present a motive that I have lacked in my past experience , and to throw a different light upon my life . I can see now that there has been a conflict going on in me all the time , between my spiritual nature , which is me , and my physical nature , which contains and demonstrates me ; and that I have ministered to my physical body , so that I was gradually lapsing into the condition of a mere animal . Ecstatic thoughts , that would occasionally present themselves , would seem to ' ally themselves to a desire for physical stimulants for cooperation , and would then die an unnatural death , and leave me nothing but the animal enjoyment . Now these thoughts are present to a perfect and overwhelming extent , without the aid of stimulants , in a somewhat prostrated condition of body , and there is no desire for any artificial stimulants ; on the contrary , there is an absolute loathing to connect that with them , either as a motor , or encourager . Certainly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The thoughts that come to your mind will not , however , always be of a very // pleasant character ; but they must be met and followed out to the end whence they tend ; such are those thoughts that lead you to the fact of the humiliating position you hold , in having made it desirable for you to occupy this room . This you must accept as one of your penalties , giving it its proper weight in your mind , and no more . The expression of want of confidence in you by your friends , and their manifestation of it in what may seem an abrupt and unkind mannerthe absence of attention to you on their part by not writing to you so frequently as you expect , and a thousand other minor things , are all to act as penalties . Do n't be a coward , do n't be discouraged ; you know you are right now , and not fearing any humiliation yourself , take all of it on yourself , and try to ward off any , even the very least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . There is one great lack in life bere that will manifest itself to you very soon after taking up your residence , and that is regular occupation . If you can remedy that by bringing some employment from the city that can occupy your time , you will be much benefitted thereby . Mere amusement or patient idleness is very demoralizing . I do not think that you will want to stay longer than three months ; but the wishes of one 's friends should be seriously regarded on this matter ; at the same time , it is not well to remain when the doing so becomes irksome . And now , in conclusion , I may be asked , what is your rule for the future I Do you intend to practice " total abstinence ? " I answer , I do not intend to make the practice of " totalabstinence " the security on which I shall depend in my future life. * There are many reasons * J am aware that here I lay myself open to be misunderstod , and I do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any thing further on the matter . what I want to convey is , that I do not regard the practice of total abstinence to be the reliance upon which I depend . I can foresee circumstances in which the enforcement of that practice might render me mpleasant and ohjectionahle in future social relations ; and I have no wish to he turned into a disagrecahie prnar of why total abstinence should be expedient for a once intemperate man ; and a notable one is that it makes it manifest to others ; that his abandonment of drinking is real ; another may be the sense of security that it gives to his friends , to whom he owes all the reparation that lies in his power ; but I am opposed to magnifying the importance of the practice itself as the only salvation for him who has once been an inebriate , as there is danger in placing exclusive confidence in it . Of course , it is a self-evident fact , that if a man does not drink be can not get drunk ; but I do not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who has once been intemperate again drinks at all , he must drinlo to excess . " The latter is entirely a compound of moral weakness , which weakens . It is to be our effort to remedy , not succumb to the evil . I do not like that superstitious awe of what is termed the " first glass ; ** it does not seem to me to be a healthy symptom . The act of drinking must not be confounded with the crime of getting drunk . I have known men who , reforming from drinking , clung to this idea as their security , who are now in a ten times worse state than they were ; and I know men who show that they are thoroughly reformed , who yet drink moderately of both beer , wine and spirits . For myself , if I practise total abstinence , it will be because I fear the effect of stimulants upon a growing tendency to vertigo , for the same reason that I would not drink a glass of iced water rapidly when in a very heated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge in this matter for yourself . If salt , obnoxious to myself and distasteful to my friends . I sincerely wish to turn my back on the Cities of the Plain , and walk henceforth with the Abrahams of the world to seek a better and nobler resting-place ; and in doing so , I hope , with them , to take the goods the gods provide for me on my journey . Amusement and cheerfolness must be cultivated , as well as the sterner moralities , and my future life must not be one continual moan over past errors ; but if in this thing of drinking I can not exercise moderation , then better , far better , will it he to exercise the most scrupulous abstinence than a in to sink into excesses , and , as I feel now , that will be done , if my weakness he such that I can not exorcise moderation . // qwq may devcrur , the mole that lives under ground , and the eyeless dwellers in dark caves , must have some light , though they have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Man , who was made a little lower than the children of light , stands in deadly fear of the arch enemy of his race , the Prince of Darkness , and his whole life here below is one continuous struggle for light . From the moment when he first comes forth out of darkness into light , man longs and yearns to master the powers of darkness that surround him wherever he lives upon earth . Everywhere he has but six months of day , and must submit to six months of night , however different the distribution may be in different zones . If he lives in the favored regions of the equator , he may enjoy days , of which the shortest is but half an hour less than the longest ; if fate has assigned him a home near the poles , he has to endure a night of six months , for which even a day of equal length seems but . a sorry compensation . Even in the happiest of regions , in the temperate zones , the nights exceed the days fo*long winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most but seven hours ' rest out of the twenty-four , it is evident how much time man would be doomed to spend in painful darkness , if he had to depend for light upon Nature alone . From time immemorial , therefore , he has bent all the efforts of his mind towards the supply of artificial light . The laborer desired to extend the time , when the work of his hand and the fruit of his skill could provide for his wants ; the idle patrician preferred spending the evenings with merry friends , and the people at large enjoyed nothing more than festivities at night , when the day 's work was over and its troubles were forgotten . It is remarkable , however , that nowhere in the vast and teeming realm of industry does man ' s ingenuity seem to have been longer at fault , in devising the best means for accomplishing so simple a purpose , than in this question of light . For thousands of years organic substances , rich in carbon , have been used , without further preparation , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from the forest , torches rudely formed of the pitch that nature afforded in its roughest form , and rushes gathered from the swamps , were kindled and shed their feeble glimmer amid stifling odors and blinding clouds of smoke . These primitive contrivances have by no means disappeared from among us ; it is not only in the Highland glens and the dark valleys of the Black Forest that resinous pieces of pinewood light up many a lowly hut ; our backwoodsmen , the thrifty , frugal farmer of Yermont , and the proud , poverty-stricken planter of the South , spend even now many a winter night by the flickering light , which , like many pretty things we love to see , pleases us by its merry play , its dancing lights and fitful shadows , but works destruction te the eye and brings ruin to many a fair form . As civilization advanced apace , and blackened toof-trees and weeping eyes led men to look for safer means of supplying light , the fatter oils , tallow , wax , train-oil and like materials were chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the strange inconsistency of the ancients , whose exquisite appreciation of the beautiful made them the masters of the world in all the fine arts , and yet allowed then ) to rest content with wretched oil-lamps , ill contrived , of evil smell and bad effects on health and cleanliness . For such were even the Roman lamps ; made of bronze and precious metal , they were models of elegance and artistic beauty , unsurpassed in their perfection of form by any thing that modern skill has ever produced ; and yet they blackened the richly-carved ceilings of imperial palaces with their smoke , and oppressed the breathing of the occupants of the room . Nor were these the only inconveniences connected with these beautiful , and yet so imperfect , works of art ; for the supply of oil , which they held , was necessarily small , and hence , when the revels lasted late in the night , fresh oil had to be poured in , and frequently // more than once . It was only at a later period , and for solemn occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed . Where costly lamps could not be used , the old-fashioned candle-which yet is never mentioned among the Greeks-was still in use . The usual house-lighting depended upon these wax or tallow candles , slips of resinous pine being only used out-doors . Instead of our wick , a pithy kind of rush was used , the indigenous papyrus of Italy ; these were covered with tallow for all the commoner purposes , while wax candles were mentioned with lamps in descriptions of splendor and profusion , just as they appear to this day on all festive occasions in company with gas . We have been equally faithful to the candlestick of olden times ; for the Romans had the very form which we now use , with the plate under the candle to protect the hand from the dripping of the hot wax and the Ilame from the draught of air . Strange as it seems , for nearly two thousand years human ingenuity could devise nothing better for the incessant and daily increasing demand : More light ! Generation after generation passed away , and the ill-smelling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only aids that man could devise , when he wished to prolong the time of his labor and his enjoyment . Diligent monks bewailed bitterly the harsh fate that compelled them to copy with tearful eye the gorgeously emblazoned works of their saints , and industrious mechanics , strained their eyesight by a dim candle to earn their scanty living . A piece of bright tin hung behind his light by an ingeniousmonk* a Welsh convent , formed the rude beginning of the reflector of our day , and the aid derived from a tall goblet of light Rhenish wine , that accidentally came to stand between the cobbler of Nuremberg and his light , led to the glass globe , filled with water , which now-a-days helps many a sad worker by night . Was not even St. Dominick found writing indus triously by a tallow candle , which be- , came a fiery trial to the arch enemy ? The saint had not seen the little black Prince of Darkness , as he crept cautiously from an opening in the fireplace ; but when he at last became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant into an ape , and with a thousand ludicrous gestures and antics he tijed to upset the grim gravity of the saint . But in vain ! The saint wrote and wrote , till the candle required snuffing . Evidently candles were not unjustly looked upon as allies of the devil . At once the latter began his dance anew , drumming on his belly and playing upon his nose as upon a flute . One more leap , and he sat upon the saint 's table . " Stay , " said St. Dominick , solemnly and imperatively ; " hold my candle till I have done . I command thee in the name of God ! ' * The poor devil was forced to obey . With one hand he humbly took off his little peaked cap , with the other he took the candle from the candlestick . But since patience is a virtue , and thus impossible to his kind , he soon began his antics once more , whirling his head all around , performing on all possible and impossible instruments , and presenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The latter wrote on undisturbed , casting only an occasional glance of quiet satisfaction at the fast diminishing candle . It was bound to the hand that held it , by his command ; in vain did the devil try to shake it off and to resume his natural shape . He could not break the fearful spell that held him , and now the flame began to touch his hand . He yelled , and called upon his familiar spirits to come to his aid , but they dared not enter the saint 's holy cell . St. Dominick smiles , and the devil is maddened to blind rage . But a saint 's smile has wondrous power ; the spell is loosened , and in an instant the released demon vanishes , leaving us as a legacy the saying , that we can not " hold a candle** to another . No invention has made such slow progress as that of light ; until in our own day ingenuity has suddenly advanced // with gigantic strides . Even the discovery of the wick was only made after centuries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oils and solid fats , which are almost exclusively used for the purpose of producing light , have this in common , that they can not be made to evaporate directly , but decompose at a high temperature into combustible gases . Hence they can not be kindled themselves , but require a wick , in whose delicate fibres the liquid or molten fat is gradually changed into gas by the flame itself . As this gas burns off ; it produces heat by its own flame , and thus the process is going on uninterruptedly , as long as fat and candle are not consumed . There is , therefore , no essential difference between the process which goes on in a candle , and that by which we burn gas ; there the wick is the retort and the flame is the fire that surrounds the latter at the gasworks . It was , hence , a great progress , when the wick was discovered , and the flame could thus be made to assume a steady , equal light . The discovery became a far greater blessing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not dispense with the wick even now , in the days of our farfamed progress . For ages , wick and fat were the only two elements used to produce light . The former was very much what it is now  --  a more or less substantial thread of hemp , flax , or cotton twisted in various ways . The fatty substances , on the contrary , varied with every country and every age . Man went first to the plants that grew around him , and pressed them into his service ; he took the oily seeds of rape , flax , and hemp , or the nuts of olive trees and palms , and gradually learned to press them , purify and clear them , till they would burn up completely , leaving little or no obnoxious residues . He soon found out their relative usefulness ; how the same quantity of linseed oil burnt twelve hours ; hemp oil , eleven ; rape-seed oil , twelve ; and olive oil , best and purest of all , also twelve hours . He discovered chat while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others ; and that the oil of poppy-seed is the cheapest and most available . Yast fields are covered in France and in Germany especially , and of late also in our Northwestern States , with beautiful crops of rape , which in spring shine brilliantly in the rich yellow of countless blossoms . Their brilliancy seems to predict the bright light that is going to spring from the ripened seed , while their fragrance fills the air far and near , and swarms of bees come from all sides to suck their sweet honey . Before the pods are ripened , the crop is reaped and the seed threshed out , to be spread on large cloths for the purpose of drying and of preventing too great a loss of seed . When quite dry , it is carried to the mill and there stamped or ground into large cakes , from which at last the rich oil runs off in golden streams , while the remaining substance , even when pressed again *nd again , furnishes nutritious food for cattle . The oil , however , is as yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it must first be clarified or refined  --  a process which was formerly carried on in a variety of ways , till in our day the agency of sulphuric acid is almost exclusively employed . The consumption of this oil is enormous , and to some countries a source of great profit ; thus the town of Lille in France alone produces annually rapeseed oil to the amount of five millions of dollars ! Nevertheless , the demand constantly exceeds the supply , and hence the olive of Southern Europe , the fruit of the Paulownia , the nut of the red palm , and countless other products of Africa and South America , have to furnish the means of producing artificial light . Even wax has to be gathered not only from the stores of industrious bees , who themselves but borrowed it from sweet plants , but also from the plants directly , as in the case of the wax-palm of the Andes . Finally , the search was even extended to the tiny mosses of our day , which were found to have ancestors of gigantic proportions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Thus the // English " mosses " and the Irish " bogs " had been found to consist of nothing but a vegetable mould of more or less density , according to the drain*gc-falla mass of giant moss in a state of compression and partially decomposed . When this substance was brought under the all-scrutinizing eye of modern chemistry , tile discovery was made , that it would furnish a fat capable of making candles ; and an Irish member , the O'Gorman Mahon , actually appeared in Parliament with some specimens of this manufacture in his hand . Where the vegetable kingdom does not suffice , man turns with eagerness to the world of animals , and lays them under contribution for his insatiable longing after light . He soon found out that all herbivorous animals deposit in their cellular tissues great masses of fat , which are admirably adapted for the purposes of combustion : and at once millions of sheep and of cattle were raised on the vast steppcs of Asia and Russia , of Northern Germany and Southern Africa , on the pusztas of Hungary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish nothing but their skins and their fat to provide for the wants of distant nations . The masses of tallow which are thus obtained , are perfectly surprising to all who do not watch the ways of the world 's commerce . Russia alone obtained , a few years ago , according to official publication , more than twenty millions of dollars for the tallow she exported , and England imported more recently an even larger quantity of the same material , mainly ? or her steam-engines . The sea is in like manner compelled to give up her treasures , and from the gig antic whale , who furnishes bhihber by the ton , to the diminutive fry , which has to be pressed by the ton , the denizens of the deep are all called upon to serve man for the purpose of giving him light . Spermaceti is to this day a beautiful , cheap material for candles , which would be more highly appreciated if it were less liable to adulteration . Where wax and sperm are still too expensive , recourse is had to stearine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1829 . It is nothing but mutton-fat , carefully purified , and then freed by acids from the oil it contains , which leaves behind a white substance , called stearine , and not unlike wax in its appearance and light-giving qualities . Finally , in our own day , the mineral kingdom even has been made the willing servant of man , and the pure oil , which gushes up from the very bowels of the earth , has , as rock-oil , petroleum , or kerosene , to burn in our lamps , affording even at the present stage of its history by far the cheapest light among all its numerous competitors . Whatever may be the material of which use is made for the purpose of lighting , its nature is that of an inflan4-mable fat , and its use lies in the actiok of the wick , without which it would give much smoke and but little light . For we have seen already , that what really burns is the gas developed from the oily substance , and that by it countless little particles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity of oxygen which is present in the flame , whether these atoms remain suspended for a longer time in the flame before they are burnt , or quickly pass off . In the former case th** obtain the highest possible temperature , and give , therefore , the brightest light ; in the latter , they burn instantly , and hence give only a passing light* requiring unceasing renewaL This is the case , for instance , with the tiny rushlights which Nuremberg sends to all parts of the globe . A little wick is fastened to a triangle of tin , supported by a cork , and floating on the oil that feeds the light . The latter is blue , and extremely weak ; if the wick is diminished , the light becomes still bluer , and at last has no effect at all , and any number of such lights would not give as much light as a common candle . Time reason is , that the little particles of carbon are burnt before they have had time to become incandescent ; as soon as they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change into carbogen , which , as gas , has no brilliancy . If the wick is enlarged , // on the other hand , the power of illumination increases , and far more rapidly than the consumption of oil . But this enlargement speedily reaches its limit , for a wick of undue size produces a dark red flame , abounding in smoke and scattering a profusion of soot through the air . Hence the necessity of increasing light , not by adding to the size of the wicks , but to their number . This is the reason why all the lamps which we know , from the longburied lamps of the Phcenicians , Greeks , and Romans , down to the quaint old forms still used in the houses of the poor , have very nearly the same wick . A like impediment stood in the way of increasing the size of wax-candles , and even the votive tapers seen in Catholic churches , and not seldom exceeding the height and size of a grown man , are either mere shams or give only a very moderate light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In spite of these troubles , which appear unbearable to the spoilt child of our age , oil-lamps and torches were all the light our forefathers had , in their houses and abroad . At home their ceilings were blackened , their linen soiled , and their faces disfigured ; in the streets they were stifled and bli*ided by the smoke a*sing from the beacons burning before the palaces of the great , and the torches in the hands of outrunners and link-boys . Large bonfires had to be kindled , to send important news from county to county , and beacons , consuming whole forests in a few years , lighted up banks of navigable rivers and the dangerous points of the seacoast . Even where the nobler structures of after ages guided countless vessels , the apparatus was more costly , but hardly more efficient . As many as eighty and a hundred lamps were sometimes burning in one of these watch-towers , aided by reflectors , and yet so feeble was their light and so treacherous in dark , stormy nights , that petitions were sent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the barbarous system of the Middle Ages . No improvement had yet been devised in lamp or candle , when , in 1784 , a Swiss philosopher , Argand , invented the circular wick , enclosed in a cylinder of glass . He was a man of uncommon ingenuity , who had already made various useful inventions in other branches of industry , and devoted himself to the study of this great question , how more light could be obtained . He needed lamps in great numbers for his manufactories , and as he had learnt by experience that the wick could not be made thicker without diminishing the light , it occurred to him to extend it in a circle . This increased the size , and at the same time gave him a central space within the ring , through which a current of air was brought to play upoa the wick , which prevented the forming of soot and increased the illuminating power . The discovery , which was thus in part accidental , as he had not originally counted upon the advantages derived from the strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , nevertheless , at once fully appreciated by the intelligent inventor . He immediately determined to seek a market , and as the English were then enjoying the reputation of being willing to reward liberally every invention that could aid them in developing and perfecting their manufactures , he determined to offer it for sale in London . Qa the way he came near losing the whole fruit of his labors . Like King Joash of old , Argand could not resist the temptation of exhibiting his treasures to the Assyrians , who were in this case represented by the savants of Paris , and one of them at once caught at the principle . While Argand went to England , and there , during the rigid examination to which his invention was subjected , was led to add the chimney , the same discovery was made in France by his rival , l'Ange . Both men had been led almost necessarily to the conviction , that an outer current of air must needs be at least as useful to the flame as an inner current , and as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet capable of resisting great heat , both fell upon the same contrivance , the glass chimney of // our day . Thus it came about , that while Argand is undoubtedly the sole inventor of the circular form of the wick and the inner current of air , he must share the not less important invention of the glass tube , which creatcs the outer current , with the Frenchman , YAnge . The latter had , in the meantime , presented himself ' ; lamp in hand , before the French Academy , and as the report on his invention was made a few days before his Swiss rival obtained a patent in England , the French people are apt to claim the whole proudly as their own invention . The matter was still further complicated by the strange retribution which befell the favorite of the Academy . He lost , in the annals of science and in the memory of the public , the fame of his discovery . First , it so happened that he thought it best , after the manner of the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his behalf ; as be did not know the editor , he prevailed upon a certain Mr. Quinquet to introduce him to the former . The editor , from carelessness or ignorance , stated in the article which he wrote on the subject , and which created a great sensation , that this marvellous Lamp with its brilliant light had been presented to him by Messrs . Quinquet and l'Ange . The public , always equally careless and ignorant , did not take the trouble to retain both names , and to this day the lamp is in France simply called a quinquet , after a man who had nothing whatever to do with the invention . Sic ruuntfata . Poor M. l'Ange was equally unfortunate , we learn from Friedrich Mohr 's inter sting monograph on that subject , when the Government at last decided to bestow upon him the well-earned reward . Argand had been signally unsuccessful in England , where his patent was attacked on all sides and rendered utterly unprofitable to him . He returned , almost heart-broken , to France , and endeavored to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shape of an exclusive monopoly for fifteen years ; but this apparent injustice roused the indignation of his competitor and the judges of the Academy , who jointly remonstrated with the Government . To cut the Gordian knot , both inventors were joined in the patent , and it was ordered that every lamp of the kind should bear a stamp with the words : Argand et l'Ange invenerunt . L'Ange was speedily forgotten , and in Europe and this country Argand alone is known and honored as the inventor . After all , however , he also had , like most inventors , to be content with the fame ; for very shortly after the patent had been granted , the French revolution broke out and swept away this monopoly with so many others . It is with our inventions as with our sins : Ce n'est que Ze premier pa8 qui coilte . If the first difficulty is once overcome , others quickly disappear , and additions are apt to be made with surprising rapidity . So it was with the Argand burner . Carcel soon added a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Light , when he carried the oil in superabundance up to the wick , so that the supply was never wanting and the flame never reduced . This gave not only a brighter and steadier light , but admitted also of a larger supply being filled in at once . The feeding of the wick was accomplished by a kind of clockwork , which was wound up and then set two miniatnre pumps in operation ; these supplied the wick to overflowing , and the superfluous oil dropped back again into the reservoir . The great expense caused by the complicated machinery prevented , however , these Cared lamps from being used by all but the richer classes , who still prefer them to all others . This led to the invention of the Moderator lamps , in which the same end is obtained by a powerful spring , which in its efforts to relieve itself from the pressure to which it is subjected , when the lamp is lit , sets a simple mechanism in motion , and thus raises the oil continually to the desired level . Next came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been used to increase the illuminating power of lights , from the humble tin plate of the // poor mechanic to the enormous mirrors which were used in lighthouses . A French engineer , Teuh*re , suggested certain changes in the form and the polish of these reflectors , by which all rays of light were caught and directly sent back , and called the new instruments catoptric instruments . They were , however , adapted only to large dimensions , and hence efforts were made to contrive like improvements for domestic purposes , which ended in the so-called Astral lamp . Here the reflector is , in the form of a circular screen , placed above the light , not polished , but of a dead white , and thus , throwing its soft , white light from above downward , well deserved the name of sidereal , or starlight . It is to this day the most perfect instrument of its kind , and would , no doubt , still be the favorite of all nations , if in the meantime a new material had not been discovered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hence required also new lamps . This was the gas obtained either from coal or mineral oil ; and although the use of the former is much improved by the Argand burner , and the latter can not be used at all without his chimney , his invention is yet essentially changed by the introduction of the new substitute . Almost at the same time with Argand 's invention , the restless longing after More Light had led to the astounding discovery that bituminous coal , which in its natural shape is unfit for illumination , could by skillful treatment , and especially by removing all sulphurous elements , be changed into a form which gave a cheap and brilliant light . This was the gas of our days , the product of dry distillation of coal , of which the purified coke remains . First introduced in 1812 in London and 1820 in Paris , gas is now burnt for purposes of light in all civilized countries , and gives us , at one great step , immeasurably more light for public and private purposes . It has enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no wick and casts no shadow with its reservoir ; it is obtained from a cheap and almost universal product of nature , and does not even destroy this , but leaves it behind in the shape of valuable fuel . It can be used without chimney , burning freely , and without forming soot ; used in an Argand burner , it gives an almost perfect light , abundant , and yet soft and steady . Nevertheless , it has its drawbacks also . The apparatus for making and distributing it . is so costly that it can not yet be economically employed for single houses , and is suited only , where a large consumption warrants such an outlay , for cities and manufactories . In towns , the necessity of undermining streets and keeping the pavement in a constant state of repair is considered a daily increasing objection ; while in houses its use is deprecated as unwholesome in chambers and unbecoming in ballrooms . Nor must we forget the difficulty with which it can be carried about , which is but imperfectly relieved by gutta percha tubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all precautions from neglect in shutting it off , or from accidental injury to the pipes . Hence lamps and candles are so far from going out of use , that their consumption has steadily increased during the last years . Under this stimulant , electricity was next called into aid in the search after More Light . The electric spark was changed into a continuous ray , and thus a light was obtained , which blinds the unprotected eye at a distance of five hundred yards . Its production , however , is difficult and expensive , and little use would be made of it , were it not that the electric light has already loved a great blessing-at sea . It has been found that every steamer can easily spare one or two horse-power , which suffice to work the famous electric generator of Berlioz , and thus to produce a powerful light , perfectly unaffected by the strongest wind or the heaviest swell . It flashes forth in a moment , when needed , and prevents thus collision in much-frequented waters ; it lights up the sea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commander to send signals to a dis // tance of ten miles . Its efficiency has been proved by actual experiments on a French monitor , the H*roine , on the beautiful yacht of Prince Napoleon and the mail-steamer St. Laurent . When the latter arrived late at night in New York harbor , the wharves were as bright as in daylight . But it serves other purposes besides . Electric rays can be sent from the machine , and no trace of them is seen on the way , till they have reached their aim , where a bright luminous spot instantly reveals every detail . Thus a hostile vessel may be illuminated and examined at an enormous distance , without being able to see its adversary ; for on land , the atoms constantly floating in the air form a luminous bridge for the ray of light , while at sea the particles are generally transparent , or so diluted , that they do not form the coinct 's tail which we see on shore . What a formidable power in time of war ! A vessel sails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she opens her batteries of light , and behold ! the coast lies in broad daylight ; the guns are pointed , the enemy is dislodged , and the vessel vanishes again into dark night like a phantom ! Thus the electric light , as yet nuavailable for domestic purposes , is of incalculable importance for the safety of navigation and the art of naval warfare . A far more formidable rival than gas and electricity is the oil which Mother Nature provides almost ready prepared , and which promises for the future an even greater supply of More Light than it has yet furnished . Its discovery produced the strange e1l*ect , that while the price of the oil fell to a fraction of its former value , it bestowed upon the lucky finders of oil-wells fabulous fortunes , which were often spent in a few months , as they had been made in a few months . This rock-oil is the product of enormous deposits of decayed coal , which seem to cover the whole new continent . In its natural shape it is a black fluid , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , which boils at a lower temperature than water , the so-called naphtha , explodes at very low heat , and is therefore too dangerous to be used directly for lighting purposes . Carefully enclosed in iron pipes and subjected to a strict surveillance , it serves , however , to he changed into gas and thus becomes useful indirectly . Another product is an asphaltic residue , which is also used for making gas ; but the most important is the purified rock-oil itself , which is perfectly colorless like water . It burns , with an open wick , in a very unsatisfactory manner , giving a feeble light and developing a large amount of soot with an intolerable , dense smoke . But used with an Argand burner , the chimney of which ha* been slightly modified , as experience has taught us , the flame , which before was four or five inches high , contracts to about an inch and a half , and now emits a brilliant , pure white light . No other flame , it will be seen , proves so clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contrivance ; the nature and the quantity of the material remaining the same , and only the apparatus for hurning it being slightly changed . The simplicity and the cheapness of the lamp in which petroleum is burnt , together with the low price of the material itself , have made the use of the new burning fluid almost universal , and it may be hoped that the only two objections which are still urged , the unpleasant smell communicated by the slightest touch and the danger of frequent explosions , which have cost more lives already than railways and steamboats together , may soon be obviated by the ingenuity of inventors . Another question of greater difficulty is connected with the extent to which Nature is likely to supply the desired material . The demand is increasing daily at home , and abroad , and as whole vast countries consume petroleum in enormous quantities without producing any at all , so that shipload after shipload is sent to Europe , the anxiety of a final failure is not unnatural . Coal and coal-oil are necessarily finite quantities . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlimited supplies , the vast mass of // soil which is saturated with oil will , properly distilled , yield in its turn a large quantity ; then the extensive deposits of bituminous slate , of peat and similar materials , which have been neglected since the discovery of rock-oil , will be restored to favor ; and , in all probability , when want sharpens the eyes of explorers , entirely new stores of antediluvian plants will be discovered . Even if petroleum should be found to be as useful for heating as it is for lighting , and railway trains and ocean steamers should be propelled by the new motor , for which probabilities increase every day , Nature will be found ready , like a kind mother , to supply with lavish hand what man needs in his struggle for More Light . In the meantime , however , great efforts have been made to obtain , by entirely new means , a light which is to surpass immensely all that has been known heretofore . It is not more than about fourteen years since Professor Bunsen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new metal magnesium in larger quantities , and at the same time showed the use that might be made of it for the purpose of obtaining a brilliant light . It proved to be a most curious metal , of ridiculously small specific gravity , easily melted at a low temperature , and still more easily distilled . A thin wire of the new metal , heated red hot , burnt with a most intense heat and dazzling brilliancy , leaving only caustic magnesia behind . Two great difficulties , however , presented themselves at the very beginning : magnesium was enormously expensive ; and the apparatus by which the burning wire is pushed forward is ratber complicated1 , The price will probably seon be reduced , as much has already been done in that direction . At first the pound cost several hundred dollars ; now the wire is sold at the rate of about five dollars an ounce , which gives a length of nearly a hundred feet . Factories have arisen in imitation of the first established at Salford in England , in which magnesium is rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening at the lower end receives the bulky mass , which then is pressed through by means of a powerful hydraulic press . The lamp in which it is burnt is as yet rather complicated ; the wire or ribbon is wound around a spindle , which is slowly turned by clockwork ; the end of the wire passes through a wire net , and is pushed forward at the required speed by the motion of the spindle . The metal , once lighted , burns with a brilliant white light , so soft , however , that it resembles moonlight . The French apparatus , in which the lamp consists of a threefold coil of wire , is said to burn more evenly and steadily , but the expense is still considerable . The main importance of the magnesium light lay , until recently , in its use for the purposes of photography . A negative , taken with Leroux 's lamp , required only thirty seconds , . and an enlarged picture could be taken in two minutes . Its brilliancy , surpassed only five hundred and twenty-seven times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case , because in the spectrum the violet rays prevail , which are chemically the most effective , and which are , in this aspect , surpassed by the sun only thirty-six times . The same advantages make it most useful for the exploration of subterranean spaces , to which no sunlight penetrates , and of the sea at greater depths . Piozzi Smith employed it , on that account , in bis most interesting explorations of the interior of the Pyramids . The Drummond light , which is produced by the burning of pure light in a mixture of oxygen and common gas , labors likewise under the same disadvantage of its great costliness ; though for the purpose of lighting up large buildings , public places and lighthouses , nothing more effective has yet been devised . For , unfortunately , oxygen , though abundant in the air as well as in all the solid bodies which we know , is difficult to obtain by itself , and hence very costly . All endeavors to produce it cheap enough to make it available for // commercial purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Boussingault , resulting in greater economy , but only for small quantities . In 1867 , however , a young French chemist , Mallet , devised an extremely ingenious method , in which , by a single heating , the oxygen was withdrawn from the atmospheric air , passed into a given body , and finally stored up in a gasometer . Upon this another chemist , Tcssi6 du Motay , has , a few months since , still farther improved , by charging simple potash with the oxygen of the air . This successful invention was at once encouraged by the authorities of the Empire , and practical experiments on a larger scale were made at the Hotel de Yille in Paris . A number of candelabra were erected with five burners each ; these burners are double , having one for bi-carbonated hydrogen and another for oxygen , both of which are varied in their passage through two very narrow channels ; a small stick of magnesium is in the centre between them . The light is magnificent , gaslight looking poor by its side , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that during a violent storm which had put out every gaslight in Paris , these oxygen lights continued to burn unmoved . The superiority of the new light is , therefore , established , but the question of economy remains to be solved . It must not be forgotten , that the oxygen system requires double pipes and a special apparatus , which increases the first cost . Then the magnesium is used up so rapidly , that it requires renewal every week , and this would seem to bring us back to the old-fashioned days of wicks . Finally , it appears that the light is pleasant enough at the distance at which it is seen in the candelabra , fifteen feet from the eye , but that it has to be softened by ground glass when used in the house . It is true , such lamps have been successfully made for the Emperor and some high officials , but only as experiments . Hence it would seem as if the new light also would be mainly useful for large establishments , theatres , hotels , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of streets and private houses . On the other hand , it is interesting to know how ingenuity , stimulated by partial success , has devised , in a few months already , means to obviate the main difficulties connected with the new system . Zircon , an absolutely indestructible metal , has been substituted for magnesium , and a new plan devised to prevent the possibility of explosion by a close wire of platinum ; while the inventor himself has established a factory of oxygen , which will furnish the material very cheaply . There is every reason to hope , therefore , that the present year will , in the material aspect of the question also , furnish a satisfactory answer to the daily increasing demand for More Light ! YES .
