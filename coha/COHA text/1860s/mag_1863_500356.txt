txt EARLY HISTORY OF THE PRINTING AND NEWSPAPER PRESS IN BOSTON AND NEW YORK . To write an article on the history of the Art of Printing , without paying our respects , in the first instance , to the Devil and Doctor Faustus , will be considered not only a violation of all precedent , but , as regards those individuals , a positive breach of good manners . They have so long been associated together , not only in popular tradition but in books , that the greater part of the reading world seem to think them to have been the original partners in the republic of letters . Indeed , for some absurd reason or other , the opinion is even yet quite prevalent that one of the original concern has been a silent partner , though not a sleeping one , in every printing establishment since . The proposition , to this*xtent , is certainly inadmissible ; and yet , from the moral condition of a large portion of the press , it must be confessed there is strong presumptive evidence that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs of men , he is not altogether neglectful of the press . Be this , however , as it may , the press has become , in this country especially , an engine of such great importance in the daily affairs of life-its energies are of such tremendous power , either for good or evil , that it is believed a few moments can be profitably spent in glancing at its rise and early progress in Boston and New York . The honor of setting up the first printing press in the American Colonies belongs to Massachusetts . Only eighteen years had elapsed from the landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth , before a press was in operation at Cambridgethen as populous as Boston . The project of establishing a press in the New World was conceived and almost executed by the Rev. Jesse Glover , a dissenting clergyman in England , who had interested himself largely in planting the colony , and a portion of whose family was already in America . Mr. // Glover raised the means of purchasing his press , types , and other necessary apparatus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he embarked for America in 1638 , but died a few days before the ship reached the shore . Cambridge was at that time the seat of the civil and ecclesiastical power in Massachusetts ; and as the academ5* which subsequently grew into Cambridge University had then been commenced , it was determined by the leading men of the colony to establish the press there ; and there it remained for sixty years under their control , and forty years before a press was established in any other colony . The first printer was Stephen Day , engaged in London by Mr. Glover , and supposed to be a descendant of the celebrated John Day , the noted printer . The second printer in the Colonies was Samuel Green , to whom Day relinquished the business in 1649 . Colonel Samuel Green , the late venerable editor of the New London Gazette , was a descendant in a direct line from the original printer of that name ; the family having uninterruptedly engaged in that business for nearly two hundred years . The elder Green printed the Indian Bibles and Testaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in the benevolent work of attempting the civilization and evangelization of the aboriginals of this country  --  a noble race of wild men , who have melted away before the palefaces , like the hoarfrost beneath the beams of the morning sun . The sturdy republican religionists of New England became very soon as chary of allowing the freedom of the press as were the Pontiff and the crowned heads of Europe . Some religious tracts having been published which the clergy and the General Court deemed of too liberal a character , licensers of the press were appointed in 1662 ; but in the year following , it was ordered by the Provincial Government that the printing press be as free as voL. xv. - lS formerly . ' This freedom , however , was soon exerted more freely than ever . The attention and the fears of the Government were accordingly again awakened ; and in October , 1664 , it was enacted that no printing press should be allowed in any other town or place of the colony than Cambridge ; and that no person or persons should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the allowance of at least two of a board of three censors appointed for that purpose . But even the licensers were not sufficiently rigid to please the General Court-for , having permitted the publication of that most excellent and pious litth* work , The Imitation of Christ , ' by Thomas *X Kempis , it was held to be heretical by the Legislature , and its further publication without a new revision was prohibited in 1667 . The principal specification against it was that it was written by a Popish minister . In 1671 , the General Court directed the revision and publication of the laws of the colony . Until that time the laws had always been printed at the expense of the commonwealth . But a wealthy bookseller , by the name of John Ushers applied for permission to publish them on his own account ; and to prevent Green from printing extra copies for himself , he procured the passage of an act prohibiting the printing of any more copies than he should direct ; and in this enactment we find the origin of copyright in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Usher for seven years . Green soon became a prolific printer . He came to this country so destitute as to be obliged to sleep under the shelter of a barrel ; but lived to an advanced age , and had two wives and nineteen children . He was early in life erected an ensign of the Cambridge r'ilitia company , and subsequently rose to the rank of captain , under which commission he served thirty years . So exceeding fond was he of his martial life , that , when extremely old , he was carried to the // parade ground in a chair to direct the exercises of his company . Some of his descendants have been engaged in the printing business for more than a century past in Connecticut . Others of his family established their business at Annapolis , in Maryland , in 1740 , where it has been continued by their descendants until the present day . The partner of the elder Green , for a number of years , was Marmaduke Johnson , who had been sent over from England by the Commissioners of Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language . He turned out badly , however , and , in two years after his arrival , was tried and convicted of making an unlawful impression upon Mr. Green 's daughter . The charge in the indictment was for alluring the daughter of Mr. Samuel Green , printer , and drawing away her affection , without the consent of her father . ' This was a direct breach of the law of the colony ; for in those good times , no young lady might venture to fall in love without , like a dutiful child , asking her father 's consent . But Johnson was doubly guilty , since he had a wife in England . He was therefore fined five pounds , and orderedtogohometo his first love . This order , however , was for a time evaded ; and he afterward found means of procuring a reconciliation with Green-his wife having probably died in the mean time-and of entering into a partnership with the rather of his American charmer . Her prudent father , however , as is most likely , obliged her to leave off loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inconstant typographer was married in 1770 to Ruth Cane of Cambridge . He then began to look up in the world , and was elected to the office of constable , which in those days was much more elevated than that of sheriff is now . In 1674 the first press was established in Boston by permission of the General Court ; and two additional licensers were appointed-one of whom was the Rev. Increase Mather . The printer was John Foster , who was also somewhat of an astronomer . He made and printed almanacs ; but died at the early age of thirty-three . He was a man of so much consideration that two poems were published on the occasion of his death . One of them concluded with the following lines : This body , which no activeness did lack , Now s laid aside like an old almanack But for the present s only out of date , Twill have at length a far more active state . Yea , though with dust thy body soiled be , Yet at the resurrection we shall see A fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , new in Heaven set forth ; T is but a word from God , the Great Creator , It shall be done , when be saith IMPRIMATUR . ' Whoever , ' says Isaiah Thomas , has read the celebrated epitaph of Franklin on himself will have some suspicion that it was taken from this original . ' One of Green 's apprentices was an Indian lad , who became master of the business , and assisted in printing Eliot 's Indian Bible . When King Philip*s war came on , however , his bosom was fired with amor patria , and he ran off and joined himself to his countrymen . Returning again , under the proclamation , after the death of the great Narragansett king , James , for such was his English name , obtained a pardon , and worked at the business for the remainder of his life . From Eliot 's account of him , he was the most accurate printer in the colony  --  the only one who was able to correct the press with understanding . ' He printed the Psalter and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as James the Printer , he assumed the latter as his surname . He married arid reared a family by that name , whose descendants were recently living in Grafton . The first newspaper published in North America was the Boston News Letter commenced in April , 1704 , by John Campbell . It was printed by the authority of the licensers , as a half sheet of what was then called pot paper-a -I // large size of foolscap . Campbell was a bookseller , and the postmaster of Boston . The paper was printed by Bartholomew Green . The first number contained the Queen 's speech to both houses of Parliament ; some notice of the attempts of the Pretender , James the Eighth of Scotland , who was said to be sending over Popish missionaries from France ; three or four paragraphs of domestic intelligence ; four items of ship news from Philadelphia , New York , and New London ; and one advertisement by the editor . The paper was continued fifteen years , weekly , upon the half sheet of foolscap , without a rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support. * In 1719 the editor made a great effort to enlarge his publication . He stated in his prospectus that he found it to be impossible , with a weekly half sheet , to carry on all the public occurrences of Europe , with those of the American colonies and the West Indies . He was then thirteen months behind the news from Europe , and to obviate the difficulty he resolved to publish every other week a full sheet of foolscap . He afterward announced , as the advantage of this enlargement , that in eight months he was able to bring down the foreign news to within five months of the date of his publication ! What a contrast between the newspaper of that day and our own ! Then news from England , five months old , was frcsh and racy . Now we must have it in twelve days , and even then send out fleets of newsboats from Cape Race to bring it to us two days sooner than steam can take the ship up to New york and Boston . Then , news seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an express . Now , if we can not obtain the news from Washington in less than the same number of minutes , we rave and storm , and talk * For the benefit of the curious reader , I would state that a perfect file of the Beaten News Letter is still preserved in the Worcester Ilistorical Library . There is also an imperfect file in the New York Historical Society Library . of starting new telegraph companies1 Then , four snug little foolscap papers a month contained all that the world was doing that any one cared to know . Now , a paper published every morning as large as a mainsail needs a supplement ; and I presume there is not an editor in any of our large cities who publishes half the new matter he gets prepared . The second American newspaper was the Bost Gazette , the first number of which was published in December , 1719 , by William Brookes , the successor of Campbell as postmaster . It was printed on half a sheet of foolscap by James Franklin , brother of Benjamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proprietor , printer , and publisher of the Gazette , however , were soon changed ; and in 1721 the New England Courant was established in Boston by James Franklin , who was both proprietor and publisher . With the establishment of this paper commenced the newspaper wars of America , which have continued ever since . Franklin , piqued at having been ousted from the Gazette , commenced attacking that journal with bitterness . He did not make the tjourant so much of a newspaper as an essayist ; and it was filled with discussions of the prevailing religious opinions of that day , and with attacks upon the public officers and the clergy . These essays were furnished by a society of nine literary gentlemen , who were called a set of freethinkers by some , and the Hell Fire Club ' by others . Young Benjamin wrote some of the essays , although the authorship was not at the time known . Among other matters , inoculation for the small pox was then warmly opposed as being highly improper . The character of the paper was spirited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not long in attracting muelt of the public attention , and in provoking the resentment of the colonial Government and clergy . The Rev. Increase Mather having been claimed in the Gourant as one of its // supporters , came out with a long and wrathful contradiction of the assertion . I can well remember , ' says that eminent and excellent divine , when the civil Government would have taken an effectual course to suppress such a cursed libel ! which , if it be not done , I am afraid that some awful judgment will come upon this land , and that the wrath of God will arise , and there will be no remedy . I can not but pity poor Franklin , who , though but a young man , it may be , speedily he must appear before the judgment seat of God ; and what answer will he be able to give for printing things so vile and abominable ? ' In sober truth , it would be well for all those connected with the press to bear in mind this passage from that excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one lie , once put into circulation ? It was not long before Franklin was arrested by the Government , and imprisoned four weeks in the common jail , for the conduct of his paper . The council also published an order , setting forth that Franklin had published many passages , boldly reflecting upon the Government of the province , the ministry , the churchi*s , and the college , and that it often contained paragraphs tending to fill the readers ' minds with vanity to the dishonor of God , and the service of good men-in consequence of which , it was resolved that nothing should be published in the said colony , that had not been first perused and allowed by the secretary of the colony . The order does not seem to have been enforced ; and the first number of the paper , after James Franklin 's release , contained anather essay from the club , of increased boldness . It was headed by a sort of a text as follows : And then , after they had anathematized and cursed a man to the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take him , then to make the sheriff and the jailer take the devil 's leavings . ' Other publications , equally liberal , and equally offensive to the civil authorities , were brought before both Houses of the General Court , and a joint committee was appointed to consider and report . This committee reported that the tendency of Franklin 's paper was to mock religion and bring it into contempt . ' They therefore recommended that James Franklin be prohibited from publishing anything not previously examined and approved by the secretary . The recommendation was adopted , but Franklin again disregarded the order , for which he was prosecuted for a contempt of the General Court ; but the jury ignored the bill . He was , however , bound to good behavior , in conformity to the order of the General Court . These proceedings were severely attacked in the American Weekly 3fiercury , which by that time had been established in Philadelphia ; and the Assembly of the Province of Massachusetts was denounced as being made up of oppressors and bigots , who made religion only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers were proclaimed to be remarkable for their hypocrisy , raised up as a scourge in the hands of the Almighty for the sins of the people . ' These attacks were undoubtedly written by the club in Boston and sent to Philadelphia for publication . But neither the club nor James Franklin would submit to the order of the Court ; and for the purpose of evading it , the name of James was taken out of the paper , and that of Benjamin substituted . The latter was then a minor , and this was the first introduction of his name into public life . But though a poor printer 's lad , the name thus first used as a shield for others who were behind the curtains , has since challenged the world for illustrious deeds of his own . With this change of the name of the publisher , came a new prospectus , probably the first effort of the kind , of the then youthful philosopher . This prospectus was rather an odd one , as will  - -  I // be seen by the following extract : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town with the most comical and diverting incidents of human life ; which in so large a place as Boston will not fail of a universal exemplification . Nor shall we be wanting to fill up these papers with a grateful interspersion of more serious morals , which may be drawn from the most ludicrous and odd parts of human life . ' The character of the paper , however , does not appear to have been changed for the better by the change of names . It was continued in the name of Benjamin Franklin some time after he had left it ; but the members of the club at length grew wearied with the labor , and . the paper expired in 1727 . James Franklin then removed to Rhode Island , and established the first newspaper in that State , at Newport . It remains to notice but one more of the early Boston editors , who seems to have been an odd fish-somewhat witty , but , to use a homely proverb , as rough as a rat-catcher 's dog . ' He first established the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston Evening Post . His name was Thomas Fleet . Massachusetts was then a slaveholding country , and Fleet owned several negroes , two of whom he instructed in the art of printing . Their names were Pompey and C*esar  --  the only two Romans , I believe , who ever belonged to the printing fraternity . These honest fellows lived and printed until after the war of the Revolution , having become freemen by the Constitution of Massachusetts of 1780 . Fleet was droll and witty in the conduct of his paper , especially in his advertisements . Witness the following advertisement of one of his negro women for sale : To be sold , by the printer of this paper , the very best negro woman in this town , who has had the small pox and the measles ; is as hearty as a horse , as brisk as a bird , wfll work like a beaver . ' There was a common evil existing in those days which , it is to be feared , has now become chronic . People were prone to omit paying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying sin , even against men of great religious professions . On one occasion he read them quite a severe lesson upon their injustice and oppression in this respect . Every one , ' says he , thinks he has a right to read news , but few find themselves inclined to pay for it . T is a great pity a soil that will bear piety so well , should not produce a tolerable crop of common honesty . ' It is , moreover , slanderously reported in the ancient chronicles , that Fleet was not blessed with the most beautiful and sweet-tempered wife and daughters in Boston . On one occasion he invited a friend to dine with him on pouts , a kind of fish then esteemed a great delicacy , and of which he knew his friend to be remarkably fond . I*is domestic matters , however , did not move along very smoothly that morning , and when they sat down to table , the gentleman remarked that the pouts were wanting . Oh no , ' said Fleet , only look at my wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *s newspaper in Boston , before William Bradford commenced the Yew York Garette , in October , 172* . It was printed on a half sheet of foolscap , with a large and almost wornout type . There is a large volume of these papers in the New York City Library , in good preservation . The advertisements do not average more than three or four a week , and these are mostly of runaway negroes . The ship news was diminutive enough ; now and then a ship , and some half a dozen sioops arriving and leaving in the course of the week . Such was the daily paper published in the commercial metropolis of the United States , one hundred and thirty-eight years ago ! Eight years after the establishment of Bradford 's Gazette , the Yew York Weekly JournaZ was commenced by // John Philip Zengar . This paper was established for the purpose of opposing the colonial administration of Governor Crosby , under the patronage , as was supposed , of the Honorable Rip Van Dam , who had previously discharged the duties of the executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great libel suit tried in New York was instituted by the Government in 1734 against Zengar . He was imprisoned by virtue of a warrant from the Governor and Council ; and a concurrence of the House of Representatives in the prosecution was requested . The House , however , declined . The Governor and Council then ordered the libellous papers to be burned by the common hangman , or whipper , near the pillory . But both the common whipper and the common hangman were officers of the corporation , not of the Crown , and they declined officiating at the illumination . The papers were therefore burned by the sheriff 's deputy at the order of the Governor . An ineffectual attempt was next made to procure an indictment against Zengar , but the grand jury refused to find a bill . The AttorneyGeneral was then directed to file no information against him for printing the libels , and he was kept in prison until another term . His counsel offered exceptions to the commissions of the judges , which the latter not only refused to hear , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bar . Zengar then obtained other counsel-John Chambers , of New York , and Andrew Hamilton , of Philadelphia . The trial at length came on , and excited great interest . The truth , under the old English law of libel , could never be given in evidence , and was of course excluded on the present triaL Hamilton nevertheless tried the case with great ability . He showed the jury that they were the judges as well of the law as of the fact , and Zengar was acquitted . The verdict was received with c*ieers by the audience ; and the corporation voted the freedom of the city to Andrew Hamilton , for the remarkable service done to the inhabitants of this city and colony , by his defence of the rights of mankind and the liberty of the press . ' The certificate was sent to Mr. Hamilton by Mr. Stephen Bayard in a superb gold box , on the lid of which were engraved the arms of the city with several classical and appropriate mottoes . Thus ever has power been arrayed against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people been ready to sustain it . Soon after the relinquishment of his paper by Bradford , it was resumed by James Parker , under the double title of The New York Gazette and Weekly Post Boy . In 1753 , ten years afterward , Parker took a partner by the name of William Wayman . But neither of the partners , nor both of them together , possessed the indomitable spirit of John Philip Zengar . Having in March , 1756 , published an article reflecting upon the conduct of the people of Ulster and Orange counties , the Assembly , entertaining a high regard for the majesty of the people , took offence thereat , and both the editors were taken into custody by the sergeant-at-arms . What the precise nature of the insult upon the sovereign people of those counties was , does not appear . But the editors behaved in a craven manner . They acknowledged their fault , begged pardon of the House , and paid the costs of the proceedings ; in addition to all which , they gave up the name of the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hezekiah Watkins , a missionary to the county of Ulster , residing at Newburgh . The reverend gentleman was accordingly arrested , brought to New York , and voted guilty of a high misdemeanor and contempt of the authority of the House . Of what persuasion was this Mr. Watkins , does not appear . But neither Luther , nor Calvin , nor Hugh Latimer would have betrayed the right of free discussion as he did , by begging // the pardon of the House , standing to receive a reprimand , paying the Thes , and promising to be more circumspect in future , for the purpose of obtaining his discharge . This case affords the most singular instance of the exercise of the doubtful power of punishing for what are called contempts , on record . A court has unquestionably a right to protect itself from indignity , while in session ; and so has a legislative body , although the power of punishing for such an offence , without trial by jury , is now gravely questioned . But for a legislative body to extend the mantle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an exercise of power of which it is difficult to find a parallel . Sure it is that a people , then or now , who would elect such members to the Legislature deserve nothing else than contempt . The fourth paper established in New York was called the Evening Post . It was commenced by Henry De Forest in 1746 . It was remarkable chiefly for stupidity , looseness of grammar , and worse orthography , and died before it was able to go alone . In 1752 the New York 3fercury was commenced , and in 1763 the title was changed to the New York Gavette and Weekly Idercury . This paper was established and published by Hugh Game , at the sign of the Bible and Crown Hanover square . It was conducted with taste and ability , and became the best newspaper in the Colonies . In 1763 , Game was arraigned by the Assembly for publishing a part of its proceedings without permission , and withal incorrectly . He was a gentleman of a kind spirit , and never had the power to withhold an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reprimanded , and discharged . As the storm of war drew on in 1775 , the Alercury contained a series of patriotic papers , under the signature of the Watch Tower . But as the British forces drew near to New York , the patriotism of Game began to cool ; and during the whole course of the Revolutionary war , his Miercury afforded very accurate indications of the state of the contest . When with the Whigs , Hugh Game was a Whig . When with theRoyalists , be was loyal . When the contest was doubtful , equally doubtful were the politics of Hugh Game . In short , he was the most perfect pattern of the genuine non-committal . On the arrival of the British army he removed to Newark for a while ; but soon returned to the city and published a paper devoted to the cause of the Crown . His course was a fruitful theme for the wags of the day ; and at the peace , a poetical petition from Game to the Senate of the State , setting forth his life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent and humor . His paper ceased with the war . Another paper , called the New York Gavette , was commenced by Wayman , the former associate of Parker . Th 1766 , Wayman was arrested for a contempt of the Assembly , upon no other charge than that of two typographical errors in printing the speech of Six Henry Moore , the Governor of the Colony . One of these errors consisted in printing the word NEVER for ever ; and the other was the omission of the word NO , by reason of which the meaning of the sentence was reversed . Wayman protested that it . was a mere inadvertency ; but so tenacious were legislators in those days of privilege , ' that an investigation was instituted ; but in the end the transgressor was discharged from durance vile , ' on condition of acknowledging his fault , asking pardon , and promising to behave more circumspectly for the future . The A*sembly , however , was more rigid in this case , from the suspicion entertained that one of the errors was intentional ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more annoying to authors and publishers than errors of the press ; and yet those who are unskilled in the art of printing , can // scarcely conceive the difficulty of avoiding them . The art of proof reading with perfect accuracy is an high and difficult attainment . To arrive at ordinary accuracy in a daily newspaper , requires the reading and correction of at least two proofs ; and even then an editor , who has not become case hardened , by long practice and long endurance , will often be shocked at the transformation of sense into nonsense , or the murdering of one of his happiest conceits , or the plucking of the point out of one of his neatest paragraphs , by a typographical error . In the early stages of the art of printing , typographical errors were far more numerous than in books of modern execution , where there is a real effort to attain to ordinary accuracy . It was then very common for a volume of ordinary size to contain page upon page of errata at the close . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Edward Leigh , On Religion and Learning , ' published in 1656 . At the close of the work were two folio pages of corrections in very minute characters . The author himself complains as follows : We have no Plantier or Stevens ( two celebrated printers of another day ) amongst us ; and it is no easy task to specify the chiefest errata ; false interpunctions there are too many ; here a letter wanting , there a letter too much ; a syllable too much , one letter for another ; words joined , which should be severed ; words misplaced , chronological mistakes , &amp;c . ' Leigh 's case , however , was not so hard as that of a monk , who wrote and published the Anatomy of the Mass , ' in 1561 . The work itself contained only one hundred and seventy-two pages , to which were added FIFTEEN pages of errata . The pious monk wrote an apology for these inaccuracies , which , if true , proved that his case was indeed a cruel one-clearly proving , moreover , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gutenberg in the invention , his brimstone majesty very soon became sick of his bargain . The monk avers that he wrote the work to circumvent the artifices of Satan , and that the devil , ever on the alert , undertook to circumvent him . For this purpose Satan , in the first place , caused the MS. to be drenched in a kennel , until it was rendered comparatively illegible ; and , in the second place , he compelled the printers to perpetrate more typographical blunders than had ever before been made in a book of no greater magnitude . But the malice of Lucifer did not end here . He compelled the priest to act under his influence while making the corrections ! But they were not all unintentional errors of the press in those days that appeared such . There were words and phrases interdicted by the Pope and the Inquisition ; and sometim*s by adroit management the interdicted word , though not inserted in the text , could be arrived at in the table of errata . It is a singular fact , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifth , although his Holiness carefully superintended every sheet as it passed through the press , has ever remained without a rival in typographical inaccuracy . Still more curious was the fact , that the Pope , in the plenitude of pontifical infallibility , prefixed to the first volume a bull of excommunication against any and every printer , who in reprinting the work , should ever make any alteration in the text . To the amazement of the public , however , when the Bible appeared , it swarmed with errors too numerous for an errata . In a *ultitude of instances it was necessary to reprint whole passages in scraps , and paste over the incorrect verses . Great efforts were made to call in the edition ; and it is now only to be found among rare collections , as a monument of literary blunders . If the Devil ever troubles himself about the correction of proofsheets , he was much more likely to be standing at the Pope 's elbow // while the Bible was printing , than to be bothering his head in regard to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . Typographical errors happen in a variety of ways ; sometimes by carelessness , sometimes by the ignorance and stupidity of the printer , and sometimes by design . Occurring in either way , they are often ludicrous , and sometimes productive of positive evil . A few examples of each variety will suffice . In the fine description of the Pantheon , by Akenside , the expressive phrase 5EVEICELY great , ' not being understood by the printer , who undertook to think for himself ; was printed serenely great . ' An edition of the Bible was once published in England , in which the word not was omitted in the seventh commandment . For this offence , whether by carelessness or by design , the archbishop imposed the heaviest penalty ever recorded in the annals of literary history . The edition was required to be called in and destroyed , and a fine imposed of ? *O , OOO sterling . There was a more severe punishment than even this awarded in Germany once , for a wilful alteration of the sacred text . It seems that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been rendered husband in the English translation , is lord in the German . It is the passage in which God tells Eve : And thy desire shall be to thy husband , who shall rule , over thee . ' The German word signifying lord is HERR ; and in the same language the word NARE answers for fool . The case was this : A new edition of the Bible was printing at the house of a widow , whose husband had been a printer . The spirited lady , not liking the subordinate station of her sex , and having acquired a little knowledge of the art , watched an opportunity by night to enter the printing office ; and while the form was lying on the press , she carefully drew out the letters H and e , and inserted in their stead the letters Na . The outrage was not discovered in season , and the Bible went forth declaring that man should be the woman 's fool . Such , probably , is too often the case , but the gentlemen would not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person committing such an offence must needs stand in awful apprehension of the fearful curse denounced in the conclusion of the Apocalypse . An edition of the Catholic Missal was once published in France , in which the accidental substitution merely of the letter u for an a , was the cause of a shocking blunder , changing , as it did , the word calotte ( an ecclesiastical cap or mitre ) into enlotte , which , as my readers are aware , means , in drawingroom English , a gentleman 's small clothes . The error occurred in one of the directions for conducting the service , where it is said : " Here the priest will take off his culotte ! " Among the errors that have occurred through design , was one which happened in the old Hudson Balarn*e , when the Rev. Dr. Croswell was the editor of that ancient and excellent journal . A merchant by the name of Peter Cole chanced to get married . Cole , however , was very unpopular , and was not one of the brightest intelligences even of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more no than yes , in her intellectual furnishment . It used to be a common practice in the country , in sending marriages to the press , to tack on a bit of poetry in the shape of some sweet hymenial sentimentality . In compliance with this custom , the groomsman added a line or two from one of the poets , where the bard speaks of the bliss , of the marriage state , when art meets heart reciprocally soft . ' The wicked boys in the printing office , however , corrected the poet , making the stanza read thus : When head meets head , reciprocally soft . ' Another instance , more ludicrous still , was the following : A lad in a printing office , who knew more about type setting than he did of the Greek mytholo // gy , in looking over a poem they were printing , came upon the name of Hecate , one of the lady divinities of the lower world , occurring in a line like this : Shall reign the Hecate of the deepest hell . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran to the master printer , and inquired eagerly whether there was an e in cat . Why , no , you blockhead , ' was the reply : Away went the boy to the press room , and extracted the objectionable letter . But fancy the horror of both poet and publisher , when the poem appeared with the line : Shall reign the HE CAT of the deepest hell . ' But let a form of types , arranged either for book or newspaper , be ever so correct when sent to the press , errors not unfrequently happen from yet another cause , viz. : the liability of now and then a letter to drop out , when the form has not been properly adjusted , or locked sufficiently tight in the iron frame which by printers is called a chase . How important the loss of a single letter may become is seen by the following example . A printer putting to press a form of the Common Prayer , the c in the following passage dropped out unperceived by him : We shall all be CHANGED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book appeared , to the horror of the devout worshipper , the passage read : We shall all be HANGED in the twinkling of an eye . ' Sometimes a whole page or a whole form drops through , and falls into what printers call pi-that is , a mass of all sorts of letters , stops , marks , points , spaces , forming a jumble of everything  --  and involving the dire necessity of assorting over the whole mass , letter by letter . In isolated punting houses , where they have but few workmen , and assistance is not near , such a catastrophe is a serious matter . An instance of this kind , which happened many years ago in the county of Oneida , is in point . An editor was putting his paper to press ( for in the country , editor and printer are often combined ) when down fell his form  --  a wreck of matter and a crush of words . There was no other printing office nearer than Albany , and it was impossible for him to rearrange his types for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at all hazards , on account of the legal advertisement* on the first side . He therefore hit upon the expedient of publishing his paper with a blank page , inserting in large letters , Omitted for want of ro I ' But , after all , when it is considered of how many separate and minute pieces of metal a book form or the page of a newspaper is composed , the wonder is that errors of the press are not far more numerous than they are . A single page of one of our largest papers can not contain less than 150,000 separate pieces of metal , each of which must be nicely adjusted in its own proper place , or error and confusion will ensue . But to return from this long digression of the early newspaper press of New York . A paper called the New York Chronicle was published during the years 1761- ' 62 , and then died . The New York Pacquet was next pi*blished , in 1763 , but how long it lived is not known . In 1766 , bit established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the course of the year was connected with Parker 's Ga2ette , the Journal , however , being printed as a separate paper . John bolt edited the first Whig paper published in New York ; nor , as in the case of Hugh Game , did his patriotism come and go as danger approached or receded from the city . In 1774 , Holt discarded the King 's arms , and took that engraving from the title of his paper , substituting in place of it , a serpent cut in pieces , with the expressive motto , Unite or Die . ' In January , 1775 , the snake was united and coiled , with the tail in its mouth , forming a double ring : within the coil was a pillar standing on Nagna Charta and surmounted with the cap of liberty : the pillar on each side was supported by six arms and hands , figurative of the colonies . On the body // of the snake , beginning at the head , were the following lines : United now , alive and free , Firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ever bless our land , Till Time becomes Eternity . ' The designs both of 1774 and 1775 were excellent  --  the first , by a visible illustration , showing the disjointed state of the colonies ; and the second presenting an emblem of their strength when united . Holt maintained his integrity to the last . When the British troops took possession of New York , he removed to Esopus , now Kingston , and revived his paper . On the burning of that village by the enemy in 1777 , he removed to Poughkeepsie , and published the Journal there until the peace of 1783 , when he returned to New York and resumed his paper under the title of The Independent Gazette ; or , The New York Journal Revived . Holt was an unflinching patriot , but did not long survive the achievement of his country 's freedom . In 1784 he gave his paper a new typographical dress , and commenced publishing it twice a week , being the second paper thus frequently published in the United States . He died , however , early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time by the widow ; but after undergoing several changes of name and proprietorship , it passed into the hands of Franxis . Greenleaf in 1787 , by whom it was converted into a daily paper , called the Argus , or Greenleaf 's New Daily Advertiser . A semi-weekly paper was also published by Greenleag called the New York Journal and Patriotic Register . Mr. Greenleaf was a practical printer and an estimable and enterprising man . He fell a victim to the yellow fever in 1798 . The paper was continued by his widow for a little while , but ultimately fell into the hands of that celebrated political gladiator , James Cheetham . The Independent Reflector was a paper commenced by James Parker in 1752 , and continued for two years . Among its contributors were Governor Livingston , the Rev. Aaron Burr ( father of the distinguished and unhappy statesman of that name ) , William Alexander ( afterward Lord Stirling ) , and William Smith , the historian of New York . The tone of the paper was unsuited to the ears of the men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and means were found to silence it . The belief was that Parker was suborned to refuse longer to publish it . The celebrated James Rivington began his paper , under the formidable title of Rivington 's New York Gazette ; or , The Connecticut , New Jersey , Hudson 's River , and Quehec Weekly Advertiser , in 1733 . The imprint read as follows : Printed at his ever open and uninfluenced press , fronting Hanover Square . ' It is well known that Rivington was the royal printer during the whole of the Revolutionary War ; and it is amusing to trace the degrees by which his toryism manifested itself as the storm gathered over the country . The title of the paper originally contained a cut of a large ship under sail . In 1774 , the ship sailed out of sight , and the King 's arms appeared in its place ; and in 1775 the words ever open and uninfluenced were withdrawn from the imprint . These symptoms were disliked by the patriots of the country , and in November , 1775 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horseback , beset his habitation , broke into his printing office , destroyed his presses , and threw his types into pi . They then carried them away , melted , and cast them into bullets . Rivington 's paper was now effectually stoppedomitted for want of room - until the British army took possession of the city . Rivington himself meantime had been to England , where he procured a new printing apparatus , and returning , established The New York Royal Gazette , published by James Rivington , printer to the King 's most excellent Majesty . ' During the remaining five years of the war , Rivington 's paper was the nrst distinguished for // its lies , and its loyalty , of any other journal in America . It was published twice a week ; and four other newspapers were published in New York , at the same time , under the sanction of the British officers-one arranged for each day , so that , in fact , they had the advantages of a daily paper . It has been said , and believed , that Rivington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , in fact , the secret informant of Washington . Be this , however , as it may , as the war drew to a close , and the prospects of the King 's arms began to darken , Rivington 's loyalty began to cool down ; and by 1787 the King 's arms had disappeared and the title of the paper , no more the Royal Gazette , was simply Rivington 's New York Gazette and Universal Advertiser . But although he labored to play the republican , he was distrusted by the people , and his paper was relinquished in the course of that year . In 17Th , Samuel Loudon commenced his New York Pacquet and American Adv tiser . When New York fell into the hands of the enemy , London removed to Fishkill , and published his paper there . At the close of the war he returned to the city , and began a daily paper , which was continued many years . We have thus sketched the history of printing , and of the newspaper press in Boston and New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of the Revolution . From these brief sketches , an idea may be formed of the germ of the newspaper press which is now one of the chief glories of our country . The public press of no other country equals that of the United States , either on the score of its moral or its intellectual power , or for the exertion of that manly independence of thought and action , which ought to characterize the press of a free people . What a prophet would the great wizard novelist of Scotland have been , had the prediction which he put into the mouth of Galeotti Martivalle , the astrologel of Louis the Eleventh , in the romance of Quentin Durward , been written at the period of its date ! Louis , who has justly been held as the Tiberius of France , is represented as paying a visit to the mystic workshop of the astrologer , whom his Majesty discovered to be engaged in the then newly invented art of multiplying manuscripts by the intervention of machinery-in other words , the apparatus of printing . Can things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king , interest the thoughts of one before whom Heaven has unrolled her own celestial volumes ? ' My brother , ' replied the astrologer , believe me , that in considering the consequences of this invention , I read with as certain augury , as by any combination of the heavenly bodies , the most awful and portentous changes . When I reflect with what slow and limited supplies the stream of science hath hitherto descended to us ; how difficult to be obtained by those most ardent in its search ; how certain to be neglected by all who love their ease ; how liable to be diverted or altogether dried up , by the invasions of barbarisms ; can I look forward without wonder and astonishment , to the lot of a succeeding generation , on whom knowledge will descend like the first and second rain , uninterrupted , unabated , unbounded ; fertilizing some grounds , and overflowing others ; changing the whole form of social life ; establishing and overthrowing religions ; erecting and destroying kingdoms- ' Hold , hold , Galeotti , ' cried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' No , my royal brother , ' replied Martivalle ; this invention may be likened to a young tree , which is now newly planted , but shall , in succeeding generations , bear fruit as fatal , yet as precious , as that of the Garden of Eden ; the knowledge , namely , of good and evil .
