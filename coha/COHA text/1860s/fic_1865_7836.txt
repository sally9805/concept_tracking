Shillaber , B. P. ( Benjamin Penhallow ) , 1814-1890 : THE DISMISSAL : Showing the Feeling of a Patriotic young Lady , on the Occasion of her Lover 's Recreancy. from Poems , in Poets of Portsmouth ( 1865 ) The time has come that we must part : I own no more the tender tie That lately bound us heart to heart , And say to all my hopes  --  good-by . I loved a Man . My love is dead ; For , when his country claimed his sword , He from the trial meanly fled , And died in living shame abhorred . He died to me : I 'll own no more The sway that once my heart inthralled : The time that 's passed I may deplore , But do not wish the past recalled . Take back your gifts . The golden chain You hung about my neck of old Would now a burden be of pain ,  --  Your cowardice pollutes the gold . I from my fingers tear the ring I long have worn in loving pride : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that gave it value died . I read your words with burning brow , So full of tender love for me ; But I absolve from every vow , And set you from your bondage free . I would have borne with you the toil , The burden , of obscure estate : I 'd not complain to be the foil Of adverse and invidious fate . With honor left to shed its light , We , self-sustaining , hand in hand , Might well have dared misfortune 's spite ,  --  The poorest , proudest in the land . But now I shudder as I think , Like one awakened from a dream , Of slumbering on the awful brink Of that black-moving hideous stream , Whose course leads on its darkling way Through ignominiousness and shame , Lit only by one lurid ray , To show my coward-coupled name . Escaped , thank God !  --  I rend the chain , And stand up disinthralled and free : The riven steel , the human pain , I give , my country 's cause , to thee . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No human love must intervene ; And better far than recreant taint Were early grave and memory green . Shillaber , B. P. ( Benjamin Penhallow ) , 1814-1890 : MASTER WEEKS 'S OLD FERULE. from Poems , in Poets of Portsmouth ( 1865 ) Grim relic of a distant time , More interesting than sublime ! Thou'rt fitting subject for my rhyme , And touch'st me queerly ,  --  Unlike the touch that youthful crime Provoked severely . It was a dark and fearful day When thou held'st sovereign rule and sway , And all Humanity might say Could not avert The doom that brought thee into play , And wrought us hurt ! Ah , Solomon ! that dogma wild Of sparing rod and spoiling child Has long thy reputation soiled , And few defend it : Our teachers draw it far more mild , And strive to mend it . Oh ! bitter were the blows and whacks That fell on our delinquent backs , When , varying from moral tracks , In youthful error , Thou madest our stubborn nerves relax With direst terror . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tingle of the wood That scored us as we trembling stood , And could n't flee it ; But I confess I never could Exactly see it . The smothered wrath at every stroke Was keenly felt , though never spoke ; And twenty devils rampant broke For one subdued , And all discordances awoke ,  --  A fiendish brood . And impish trick and vengeful spite Essayed with all their skill and might To make the balance poise aright ; And hate , sharp-witted , Ne'er left occasion , day or night , To pass omitted . I see it now !  --  the whittled doors , The window-panes smashed in by scores , The desecrated classic floors , The benches levelled , The streaming ink from murky pores , The books bedevilled . Small reverence for Learning 's fane , For master 's toil of nerve and brain : They saw Instruction marred with pain , And Alma Mater Was thought of only by the train To deprecate her . ' T is strange to have thee in my grasp , My fingers round thy handle clasp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew thee ! Then thou didst sting me like an asp , Foul shame unto thee ! But gentler moods suggest the thought , That still thine office , anguish-fraught , For our best good unselfish wrought , Had we but known it ; And we , with grateful spirit , ought To freely own it . Perhaps ,  --  but I am glad at heart That thou no more bear'st sovereign part In helping on Instruction 's art By terror 's rule ; That other modes will prompt the smart Than thee in school . Thanks ! old reminder of the past , For this brief vision backward cast : We measure progress to contrast Times far and near , Rejoiced , on summing up at last , We 're not arrear ! Shillaber , B. P. ( Benjamin Penhallow ) , 1814-1890 : TRANSMUTATION : Showing the Operation of a quick Fancy in working out spiritual Results from a real Subject . from Poems , in Poets of Portsmouth ( 1865 ) I see him every week , With his thin and wrinkled cheek , And a wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coat of homespun blue , That 's brushed the texture through , Bears many awheres about it a white and seedy speck . He 's in the stranger 's seat ; For no bending hinges greet The old man hoary , when he comes with slow and lagging pace ; And the velvet-cushioned pews All sympathy refuse With the waiter at the table for the crumbs of God 's free grace . There he sits , with eager ear , To catch the heavenly cheer , As the minister unfolds the glories of the Word ; And a smile his face illumes , As the apple gives its blooms , When , in its secret depths , the call of Spring is heard . At times a tear I 'll trace Steal down his care-worn face , As though some memory of eld were passing through his brain ; Then the smile will come once more , As , when the storm is o'er , The sun appears more bright through the lenses of the rain . His name I can not guess ; But interest no less Attracts my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face I see A mighty mystery That awes me , as with earnest eye its depths I strive to scan . Not with the pride of wealth , Not with the thrill of health , The human soul is strong in its world of joy and trust ; And , though drop away The props of mortal clay , There 's a glory born within not dimmed by earthly dust . I see upon his brow A regal glory now ; And the poverty and pain are transmuted in its ray : No longer poor and old Is the form that I behold , But a soul rejuvenate , and risen on a life of endless day .
