txt ART . IV . - Reports of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs , 1855 - 1858 , with Accompanying Documents . THE improvement of the Indian tribes in the territory of the United States is a subject which appeals at once to the philanthropy and the statesmanship of the country . But the public mind slights it . We venture at this time to submit a few remarks in regard to the civilization of the Indians , and hope that , if they are of any worth , they may seasonably result in some practical good . In the first place , it will be interesting to glance at the political condition of the Indians , our authority being the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States and the opinions of the Attorneys-General . The Indian tribes are considered , not as foreign nations , but as domestic dependent nations . Chief Justice Marshall says of them - " Their relation to the United States resembles that of a ward to his guardian . They look to our government for protection ; rely upon its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their wants ; and address the President as their Great Father . They and their country are considered by foreign nations , as well as by ourselves , as being so completely under the sovereignty and dominion of the United States , that any attempt to acquire their lands , or to form a political connection with them , would be considered by all as an invasion of our territory , and an act of hostility . " They have a possessory title to the lands they occupy , subject to the sovereign title existing in the government by right of discovery . But that title is considered as sacred as a title in fee simple , until it is extingnished by voluntary cession to the United States . Within their territory they can make laws for // their own government ; but for acts done to our citizens in their territory they are answerable to our laws . They are not citizens , and can not be naturalized under the general naturalization laws ; neither are they capable of obtaining the public lands of the United States by pre-emption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attributes of sovereignty ; and yet they are virtually subjects . Oar relations with them are peculiar , and such as are not known in the laws of nations . They resemble in some respects relations which existed under the patriarchal institutions of antiquity , and the best idea of which is perhaps conveyed in the common phrase of " our red children . " * J* may be further remarked , that Congress has declared that " all executory contracts made and entered into by any Indian for the payment of money , or goods , shall be deemed and held to be null and void , and of no binding effect whatsoever . " Of course the status of some tribes has been changed by treaty stipulations , as in the case of the Stockbridge Indians and the Wyandotts , who have been invested with citizenship . It is estimated that there are now within the United States about one hundred different tribes or bands of Indians , exclusive of the remnants in the New England States , numbering in the aggregate from 320,000 to 350,000 souls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 46,355 , which received annuity payments from the government under treaties . The amount paid to them that year was $ 680,000 , which gave the average of $14.66 for each Indian . Allowing five persons to a family , each family would on an average have received $ 73.30 . The Secretary of the Treasury stated in his Report for 1856 , that in addition to the public debt " there is due under treaties with various Indian tribes , payable on time , the sum of $ 21,066,501.36 . " This , he stated , arose out of the extinction of the ludian possessory title to the public lands , and is a charge on the annual sales . ThQ estimate of annual expenses of the Indian department for 1856 was $ 2,593,483.88 . The army proper may almost be charged to our Indian expen * See Cherokee Nation v. State of Georgia , 5 Pet . Rep. 1 ; Worcester v. State of Georgia , 6 Pet . 515 ; Johnson v. Mackintosh , 5 Wheat . 543 ; Opinions of AttorneysGeneral , I. 465 , 645 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 746. // diture ; and the army estimate for the same year was more than twelve millions of dollars . Then there are to be considered various additional expenditures annually incurred on account of Indian troubles . For instance , a commission began in 1856 , and sat more than a year , to " ascertain the sum of money fairly due to the volunteers of Oregon and Washington Territories for their services in the Indian wars which threatened to lay waste those Territories . " And the Secretary of War informs us in his Report for 1857 , that " the amount ascertained to be due is a very large one . " In the Indian Deficiency Act of 1858 , $ 200,000 were appropriated " for restoring and maiiitaining , by peaceable measures , friendly relations with the Indian tribes in Oregon Territory , " and $20,000 to defray the expense of the several expeditions against Ink-padu-tah 's band which committed the atrocities at Spirit Lake in Iowa . From these figures and items , cited at random , a general idea may be conveyed of the great expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we will hereafter show the disproportion between this expense and the good that ensues . The character of the Indians and their capability of civilization are hardly yet , we think , understood and appreciated . When , in 1824 , the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions memorialized Congress on the subject of Indian civilization , they were met with the assertion , first , that their project was impracticable ; and , secondly , that , if carried out , it would destroy our valuable fur-trade ! Public opinion has advanced since that time ; but it is still a common opinion , that there are such inherent obstacles in the Indian 's character that he can not become a peaceable , industrious , and humane citizen . He is thought to be untamable . But , in fact , the main reason why the race has not advanced more is their ignorance . They have been ignorant of government ; with no law except that of retaliation ; and subject to no restraint except what might now and then be enforced by the genius and adroitness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great capacity . In no instance have they planned and carried on a campaign with comprehensive skill , or with enterprise adequate to final success . Even the conspiracy of Pontiac ,  --  // rescued from oblivion by a classic pen , - and the wars of the Six Nations , will bear us out in this remark . As their exploits have been characterized by wild ferocity , so their success has been the result of treachery . The disposition to take advantage by cheating or duplicity has always been a characteristic of an ignorant race . Thus , with the Indian it is a feat worthy of boasting , if he can fall on his enemy unawares ; and it is a rare triumph indeed , if he can , by stealth , take a scalp and incur no danger . The case is the same as in ancient Crete , where , we are told , even theft was regarded as lawful when performed with skill . Quacks , indeed , have imposed on the public by vending so-called Indian medicines ; but the Indians are sadly deficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure which they have some vulnerary salve , they rely in sickness upon conjuration and necromancy ; and how vain these remedies are , the ravages of disease among them have too often shown . In the domestic arts their knowledge is confined to the most simple tools and works . Their only successful manufactures are of beads and skins , except that among the Navajoes of New Mexico blankets of a very excellent quality are made . There are other circumstances besides their ignorance which have contributed to their abject state . Their isolated condition and the smallness of their numbers have precluded the mutual intercourse , imitation , and rivalry which have been powerful aids to civilization in more populous states . Furthermore , their peculiar habits have held them back in barbarism . Their education , if it can be so termed , has kept them in intellectual nonage . The traditional stories and songs rehearsed in their wigwams celebrate the achievements , in war , of their ancestors . They learn to revere the memory and to emulate the example of him who has performed the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken the largest number of scalps . They also aspire to oratory , and , while they are guiltless of the rhetorical atrocities often put into their lips by historians and novelists , their short , popular harangues are not without a certain rude eloquence . But manual toil they have not been taught to honor . " Labor to them , " say Messrs . Cass and Clarke in their communication to the War Department // in 1829 , " is a disgraceful employment ; and this sentiment , the cause or the consequence of their idleness and improvidence , encourages their attachment to war and hunting , the only occupations to which a warrior devotes himself . " There is also equal truth in the following statement of the Commissioner , ( Mr. Manypenny , ) in his IReport for 1856 - " As a man he the Indian has his joys and sorrows . His love for his offspring is intense . In his friendships he is steadfast and true , and will never be the first to break faith . His courage is undoubted , his perception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His judgment is defective , but by proper training and discipline his intellectual powers are susceptible of culture , and can be elevated to a fair standard . He can be taught the arts of ' peace , and is by no means inapt in learning to handle agricultural and mechanical implements , and applying them to their appropriate uses . " - p. 22 . Undoubtedly the Indian is intensely fond of his offspring , and especially of his male children . But how is it with his wife , or wives ( for the more he has , the greater man is he ) ? The wife is compelled to do the drudgery of the manage , and is looked upon as immeasurably her lord 's inferior . She is not even so far elevated as among the Oriental tribes , where woman is " A toy for dotards ' play , To wear but till the gilding frets away . " This accounts in great part for the uncivilized condition which it indicates . " All great men , " says Sir James Mackintosh , " have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , born of mindless and degraded women , was ever known to be enlightened . The most important part of a man 's education is derived from the instruction and moral influence of his mother ; and before we can succeed in elevating the Indians to a fair standard , we must reform their domestic habits , and let the light of knowledge and religion shine in upon the hearts of their timid and benighted women . Notwithstanding the excessive pride of the Indians , and their contempt for labor , they are ever ready to admit their poverty , and accept with strange satisfaction whatever charity bestows on them , be it a repast at the second table , a piece of tobacco , or an old garment . This admission of poverty will be noticed // in the following report of a dialogue , which took place at Washington two years ago , between the President and delegations of the Pawnee , Ponca , and Pottawatomie tribes . " The meeting took place in the favorite east room of the White House , in the presence of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Indians had been separately introduced to him , said : - " I am very glad to see you here , my children of the Far West . I have ever felt a deep interest in your welfare . You have come a great way to see me , and I give you a cordial welcome , and should be glad if you should explain to me what you desire me to do for you , and I should be glad to hear your suggestions . ' " The President 's remarks received frequent marks of approval from the Indians . " La-sharo-larl-a-oo , or the Big Chief , ' of the Pawnee delegation , spoke as follows - " My Grand Father , I have come a long ways to see you to-day ; and I am glad as well as you are . We would like to see you make haste and give us what is promised in the treaty , so that we may not be poor . I am very * , lad to see you in the situation that you are , - to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor . I do not think we will be poor and you will be the cause of it . I am in a hurry to get back and tell the news that we will not be poor. * " Na-sharo-ce-ted-a-co , also of the Pawnees , came forward , and spoke as follows - " Since I have seen you , I think I will not be poor hereafter . I come here to-day , and look about and see your splendid mansion , and it surprises me ; but still I know a white man can do anything and make anything , and I hope we will be put in the way to do these things , and not be poor . I hope you will take pity on us that we may not be poor , and may get all that is promised in the treaty . ' * also of the Pawnees , was the next speaker , as follows - " I am a young man , - not quite a man , for you can see my naked skin , which is smooth , - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the prospect of being made a white man if I am spared . It makes me have a big heart to-day to see you , and I think I will not be poor hereafter . ' " Wae-gah-sah-pi , or The Whip , ' a chief of the Ponca tribe , said - " My Grand Father , I call you Grand Father for no other reason than this : God made me of one color and you of another ; but God // was partial to you , and made you of a better color . You came into existence , and so did I. It was the will of the Great Spirit that we both came into existence . We have never had a chance to see our Grand Father until this time , and I am very glad you asked me to visit you . It was the will of the Great Spirit that made you more powerful than me ; it was the will of the Great Spirit that you should take this land from us , - this land that you stand on to-day belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father , and so am I. Everything that you have made , Grand Father , is worthy of attention , - is worthy of looking at . There is one thing that attracts the eye more than anything else , and I hope you will give inc plenty of it , - money ! We want money , my Grand Father . With it we can get anything we want . We do not want goods ; but if you give us money , we can buy what we please , and it lasts longer . My Grand Father , we want all the tools of the white men . We want the blacksmiths , the farmers , the millers , &amp;c. to live with us , and hope you will open your heart to us to-day . My Father , I do not speak from the end of my tongue ; it comes from the bottom of my heart , and I hope that what you say will come from the bottom of your heart . ' " Me-she-ke-ab , of the Pottawatomie Indians , said : - " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to assume other habits from what they had before , and to give themselves to work and imitate the white people . This has been your advice to us for years past . Prosperity has been with you . We wish prosperity to live with our people . We have come with the full intention of gettin* those things which are within treaty stipulations , to enable us to go on with our work . I am going to lay down my gun , and pursue something else for a livelihood . " ' The President , in his reply to these speeches , gave them some sensible advice : - I am glad to see you all on this bright and beautiful day , and hope the Great Spirit is smiling on our meeting , and that henceforth this meeting may be the sign of peace between the red children and the white children and the Great Spirit above . " Why is it that our red brethren are poor ? I will tell them how to become rich . They will always be poor while they live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - whilst they live in this way they must be poor . The white men are rich because they work , because they plough the soil , and sow the grain , and reap the harvest , and live in their own houses . If the Indians will follow their example they will be rich too , because the Great Spirit looks down with the same // kindness upon his red and his white children ; for they are all brethren , and without work no man can become rich . " It is my desire that my red children should have separate houses of their own ; that they should have their own land in their own place ; that their young men should learn the useful trades of blacksmiths , carpenters , and millers , and have all the comforts of the white man ; and whenever they shall do this - and they have it in their power to do it - I will always protect them in it . " I have one request to make of my children of the Pawnee and the Ponca tribes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy , and I will feel that their Great Father and my Great Father will approve of the deed . I understand that these tribes - both brave men , all brave men - have been at war ; and whilst they are at war with each other they can never improve their condition ; and I pray that the Great Spirit may at this moment appear before me ; and , I being a party to it , I hope that he may cause them to make peace and shake hands with me , and shake hands with each other in token of perpetual peace among each other . ' " The President at this point stretched out both his hands , and invited the representatives of the Pawnee and Ponca tribes to make peace , which they most willingly did ; and a more hearty shaking of hands or more satisfied body of Indians can not readily he conceived . At the conclusion of this part of the ceremony , the President said - I hope this peace will last as long as the sun shines and the rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact , that all the efforts of the government and of private philanthropy have thus far availed but little towards civilizing the Indians . The wild tribes that have been left to their own resources are probably better clothed and fed , and altogether more creditable members of the human family , than the majority of those which , by treaty stipulations , have come under the direct influence of the government . The latter have received enough aid to make them dependent , to relax their vigor , and hasten their decay . They are not wholly exempt from our authority , and yet are not brought under the wholesome restraint imposed on our own citizens . Instead of being governed by our laws , they are kept in awe by our arms . They are confined within limits too small for prosperous hunting , and too large to conduce to their ambition as agriculturists . They are brought into contact // with the whites just enough to catch their vices , and to learn to despise them . Prone to idleness , they are also victims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingering out an existence as wretched to themselves as it is unprofitable to the world . Yet our government has not been unkind to them , unless we may call indifference unkindness . For years and years they have furnished ample topics of pathetic rhetoric for our statesmen , who have declared with Delphic gravity that the only way to save the Indians was to teach them the arts of civilized life . For many years the policy pursued was to get rid of them by removals . This answered till it began to be apparent that our emigration would extend even to the Pacific , and cover the whole domain of the West . In 1826 the Secretary of War ( Mr. Barbour ) submitted with his report the outlines of a bill , whose provisions he recommended as tending to their civilization . It provided that the country west of the Mississippi , and beyond the States and Territories , and the territory east of the Mississippi and west of Lakes Huron and Michigan , should be set apart for their exclusive abode ; that they should be removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territorial government should be maintained by the United States ; and that there should be an extinction of tribes , if circumstances should justify it , an amalgamation of the whole into one body , and a distribution of property among its individual members . He also recommended that , as soon as the civilization of the Indians would admit of it , they should have a legislative assembly , composed of Indians , to be selected in the early stages by the President , and eventually to be chosen by themselves . A bill somewhat more practicable in its provisions was introduced into the House of Representatives in 18*34 , providing for the establishment of an Indian Territory west of the Mississippi , extending from the Platte River on the north , and the State of Missouri and the Arkansas Territory on the east , to the Spanish possessions south and west . It was the plan of the government to persuade all the Indian tribes east of the Mississippi to migrate to that territory , and settle as a confederacy of tribes . The bill provided a government for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the 6* // Indian chiefs , and to be governed by the chiefs , under the control and patronage of the United States . It also provided that the territory might be represented by a delegate in Congress . The bill was laid on the table , and never called up . Nor has any general law been passed to promote the civilization of these tribes . A. common expedient to which the government has resorted to keep peace among them has been to make them presents . But the President tells us , in his Message for 1857 , that this system " has proved ineffectual . " During the administration of General Pierce , the policy began to be adopted of concentrating the tribes on reservations for their permanent homes . In 1854 and 1855 several treaties were made with different tribes , in which was a provision substantially like the following - " That at such time or times as the President may deem advisable , the land herein provided to be selected as their future home , or such portion thereof as may be necessary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time , as the Indians may desire it , assign to each head of a family , or single persons over twenty-one years of age , a reasonable quantity of land , in one body , not to exceed eighty acres in any case , for their separate use ; and he may at his discretion , as the occupants thereof become capable of managing their business and affairs , issue patents to them for the tracts so assigned to them respectively ; said tracts to be exempt from taxation , levy , sale , or forfeiture , until otherwise provided by the legislature of the State in which they may be situated , with the assent of Congress ; nor shall they be sold or alienated , in fee , within fifteen years after the date of the patents , and not then without the assent of the President of the United States being first obtained . " - Treaty with the TFinnebagoes , 27th February , 1855 . This would seem to be a wise provision ; but we have yet to learn that it has in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . Here we might pause to inform our readers how Indian treaties are made . We can not indulge them with any satisfactory statement as to the manner in which such treaties are fulfilled . If the tribe is very remote and wild , the practice is to send out an agent or commissioners , with a large quantity of presents , and accompanied by an interpreter and witnesses . // If the presents are well selected and sufficiently numerous , a treaty is certain . The favorite plan , however , is to have delegations of Indians go to Washington and treat with the Commissioner of Indian Affairs . This is done if the tribe is not very populous . But it is often a source of jealousy and trouble in the tribe , it being almost as difficult for them to select delegates having the confidence of the whole body , as for their white neighbors to choose satisfactory representatives . To obviate this difficulty as far as possible , they send as many delegates as the government will provide for from the public chest . The delegation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treaty is concluded . The government agent and interpreter attend them during their sojourn at the capital , and they are sure to receive a share of favorable attention on public occasions and at the President 's levees . We have not directly said , but we wish it to be fully understood , that , in our opinion , the Indians are capable of being educated and civilized . We do not mean merely that they can be induced to adopt the domestic and social habits of white men ,  --  to till the soil , learn the mechanic arts , and engage in trade . We believe that they can be brought up to that supreme standard of civilization which is inculcated in the precepts of Christianity . Nor have they shown any absolute repugnance to being civilized . Some tribes , indeed , have , from the force of example , wrought out their own reformation . The remnants of the Six Nations in New York , the Choctaws , Cherokees , and other tribes west of Arkansas , not to mention some tribes in Kansas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-government and self-restraint which would be creditable to any community . That others have not improved is owing principally to the inefficiency of the means applied , and to a want of system in their appliance . When , more than twenty years ago , a missionary went among the Chippewas of Lake Superior , the chiefs said to him : " We will give you a home among us , and you shall be secure . You may instruct our children , but we can not spend time to be educated ; we must hunt . The traders will not take our education in payment for blankets and provisions . " There are many remote tribes which can not be expected // soon to be brought under the influence of civilizing agencies . All that can be demanded of the government at present in respect to them , is that they shall keep the peace with one another , and cease from their depredations upon our emigrants and travellers . With all these tribes , or nearly all , the United States have made treaties of amity and peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had no means of controlling them beyond the effect of a few presents and of military force . Both these means have been too sparingly employed to serve a useful purpose . The army is too small to operate as a police force over so vast a territory . One or two companies , in the extreme wilderness , among ten thousand Indians , are more likely to be awed than to inspire awe . The Indians seldom see enough of our force to respect it . Hence the protracted , expensive , inglorious , skirmishing wars that have occurred , and still continue in Texas and New Mexico . Our readers may remember an occurrence in 1854 , at Fort Laramie , in the western part of Nebraska . There was but one company stationed there , and that was not a full one . The Indians had often plundered the Mormon and other emigrants who passed , and , when remonstrated with , had even threatened to " wipe out " the fort itself . At length notice was taken of a particularly bold trespass , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a field-piece , to approach the camp of the Indians and seize the offender . His delivery was refused . The lieutenant ordered the fieldpiece to be discharged , which was done , and in a few moments the Indians , returning the fire , killed the entire detachment save one , who , wounded , dragged himself to the fort to tell the story of their fate . Then followed , the next year , General Harney 's expedition against the Sioux , resulting in his chastisement of them at Ash Hollow . The existence of permanent posts , thus scantily garrisoned , has been so utterly unavailing to keep the Indians under control , that some have urged the discontinuance of this policy . One officer of great experience ( General Jesup ) considers that the better use of our small army would be to withdraw it entirely from the Indian country ; when the Indians deserve chastisement , to send a sufficient force among them thoroughly to quell and punish them ; // and never to permit them to see or encounter our arms , unless in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deference to the opinion of so sagacious a soldier , we would urge that there should be established an increased number of military posts , and that they should have men enough to protect , by their presence and the known prestige of their strength , the country surrounding them . It occurs to us , also , that it would not be impracticable to curtail the expense of the transportation and subsistence of the army , by producing on the military reservations , under the patronage of the government , the forage and provisions necessary for the several posts . This might be effected in part by Indian labor . When our white citizens commit crimes , they forfeit their liberty and are obliged to serve the public . Why should the Indians escape a similar punishment if they violate their treaties of peace ? Let the experiment be tried of compelling those who are captured to labor for a certain period of time . At any rate , the cause of humanity demands that the different tribes shall desist from their hostilities among themselves and their attacks upon peaceable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribes , and as the power pledged to secure the neutrality of the great highways across our territory , the government is under the most solemn obligations to see that this is done ; and we can not but believe that the most economical way of doing it is to increase the number and strength of our military posts . It has been remarked , that the theory on which the government now proceeds towards the half-civilized or annuityreceiving tribes is to retain them permanently on reservations . The practice of removing tribes has of course retarded their improvement . A tenant at will does not take so much interest in an estate as the owner . Could it be expected that Indians would take much interest in cultivating land which they were destined to abandon to others ? Assure them they are to remain on their farms , and that their children will inherit and enjoy their improvements , and they will be incited to labor . Their reservations should be surveyed and distributed among them , so they may know what is their own . They have generally had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was so with the Winnebagoes in Minnesota , and the Shawnees , Kickapoos , and Delawares in Kansas . The latter selected for themselves a reservation in the valley of the Kansas River , including as luxuriant , diversified , and welltimbered a tract as could be found in the territory . When the tribes are once located , a deaf ear should be turned to all propositions for the sale of their reserves , unless it be of a surplus portion . As settlements surround them , their lands will rise in value , and many will be eager to buy them ; while there will always be some discontented Indians , who will be willing to remove for the sake of the money their lands will bring . White settlers , who voluntarily emigrate to the neighborhood of the Indians , with a strange inconsistency , are often found clamorous for their removal . This absurd disposition lately received a sharp rebuke from the Dacotah tribes , who memorialized the President to remove the whites to the east side of the Mississippi ! But on the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I concur fully with those of my predecessors who have stated that there have been two great and radical mistakes in our system of Indian policy , - the assignment of an entirely too large body of laud in common to the different tribes which have been relocated , and the payment of large money-annuities for the cessions made by them , - the first tending directly to prevent the Indians from acquiring settled habits and an idea of personal property and rights , which lie at the very foundation of all civilization With large reservations of fertile and desirable land , entirely disproportioned to their wants for occupancy and support , it will be impossible , when surrounded by a dense white population , to protect them from constant disturbance , intrusion , and spoliation by those on whom the obligations of law and justice rest hut lightly , while their large annuities will subject them to the wiles and machinations of the inhuman trafficker in ardent spirits , the unprincipled gambler , and the greedy and avaricious trader and speculator . Their reservations should be restricted so as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by actual cultivation , and should be properly divided and assigned to them , with the obligation to remain upon and cultivate the same . " - Report for 1857 , p. 4. // of the government to carry this theory into practice ; and especially is the Indian Bureau responsible for a practical realization of its maxims on the subject of reservations . Let us now suppose that a tribe is located , in pursuance of the foregoing theory , on a reservation adapted to its numbers . This , the Indians are told , is to be their home . We will imagine that they have ceased to smear their faces with paint ; that they have laid aside their bows and their loose blankets . Still the agents , the missionaries , and the teachers report that intemperance is working fearful destitution and misery among them ; that it is more injurious to them than it ever was among civilized white men , because it is among the Indians almost a universal vice . The question arises , Can anything further be done to save them from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Indians is five hundred dollars . The agent or any Indian can destroy liquor illegally carried into the Indian country , and Indians are made competent witnesses in prosecutions under the statute . These are the principal or only remedies ; and the consequence is that the law is frequently evaded . We think that the agent should be clothed with some judicial authority , and that a more summary process should be authorized to reach the wanton offender who is instrumental in furnishing " firewater " to the Indian . If the penalty were less for the first offence , doubtless convictions could be more certainly secured . This subject demands the prompt attention of Congress . The abolition of money-annuities would indirectly aid in suppressing intemperance . We could produce the testimony of every government officer or missionary , who has had any experience among the Indians , to prove that it is absolute folly to pay them money . There are some doubtless who turn it over to the trader for a fair equivalent . But generally it all goes in mass , and it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the treaties should provide for the payment for their lands in goods , provisions , and the means of education . This reform rests with the executive . But how shall we break up the community system ? The Indians virtually live in common . If one Indian is industrious and accumulates something for the future , the others , no matter // how indolent they may have been , regard him as a mean fellow if he does not freely share it with them . This of course discourages individual effort , and takes away the chief stimulus to industry . Probably the survey and distribution of their reserves in severalty will contribute much to break up this system . We believe , however , that the main cause of this mode of living has been their tribal wars . Dreading an attack from a hostile tribe , they unite together in villages , and have all things in common . What renders these attacks doubly aggravating and horrid , is the fact that the innocent are liable to suffer for the provocation given by others . Witness the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family near Crow Wing , in the spring of 1858 , by a party of Sioux . The following is from an authentic report of the massacre , written the day after it occurred . " Ottawa , a Chippewa past middle age , had been out with his family for several days , making maple-sugar . Hearing that the Sioux were about. , they came into town with what sugar they had , being over two hundred pounds . This was quickly disposed of for whiskey . Their lodge was on the island at the mouth of Crow Wing River , just opposite the village , and was very much exposed to any stealthy attack . In fact , Ottawa 's friends had advised him to move from the island on account of the suspicious proximity of the Sioux . But he replied that he had a spear and could kill a Sioux . At about one last night , the report of guns at their lodge , and the cries of the murdered , were heard on this side of the river .

Can it be expected that Indians will live separately from one another , and cultivate their farms , if they are to be liable to such havoc as this ? Before the community system can be broken up , and thus the first important step taken for their civilization , a stop must be put to the tribal wars . The government must inspire them with confidence that they will be safe . We will not attempt to say , in detail , how this is to be done . // One means will be to require the agent to be constantly on the reservation with them . He should have sufficient military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon other tribes . When depredations are committed , the offenders should be pursued and brought to punishment , instead of holding the whole tribe responsible . We doubt if the Indians who committed the massacre above narrated have even been reprimanded for their atrocious act . Certainly they might have been detected ; for they went through the settlements to their home , carrying their fresh scalps in a bag , and proudly exhibiting them as honorable trophies . After making it for the interest and convenience of the Indians to labor , it will be comparatively easy to educate them , and to foster among them habits of self-reliance and selfrestraint . The efforts to give them a literary education have most forcibly shown that " a little learning is a dangerous thing . " In most of the half-civilized tribes , the individuals who have received some book-learning have generally proved rogues , and exerted a bad influence . But these results , instead of discouraging the efforts of sensible and philanthropic men , will only impel them to greater exertions . The ignorant can not appreciate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accord , will strive for it . This has been the case with the Indians . When missionaries and teachers have gone among them , and offered to instruct their young , they have appeared to think that they were doing the teacher a favor in sending their children to school , even when the children were fed and clothed without expense to themselves . The general fund for the education of the Indians was created by the act of 1819 , which provided an annual appropriation of $10,000 . During some years since that enactment , not more than half of the appropriation has been expended . The Commissioner states , in a communication to the Secretary of the Interior , November 20 , 1855 , that for the previous ten years the amount drawn from that fund was $102,107.14 ; and that the aggregate amount expended for educational objects during that period was $ 2,150,000 , of which the sum of $ 830,000 had been contributed by privatc benevolence . Time reports for many years past exhibit very imperfect re YOL.xc. - No. 186. 7 // turns as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in 1828 the whole number of pupils in all the Indian schools was 1,291 . There was but a small increase in the number till 1842 , when the number returned was 2,132 . In 1848 the number was 3,682 . In 1853 it was 3,302 . It does not appear how many of these were of either sex . The reports are exceedingly meagre and incomplete , and indicate that little or no interest is taken in the subject at the Indian Bureau . Good success has attended manual-labor schools as a means of literary instruction . On such means the country must rely for the education of the rising generation of these tribes . It is no longer a matter of experiment ; for where the system has been applied with fidelity and patience , the best results have ensued . If more money should be appropriated and carefully expended for the education of the Indians , it would prove in the end wise economy . Whether our Indian policy remains unchanged or not , it is certain that the success of any civilizing measures will depend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the agents or other officers who are brought into direct intercourse with the Indians , and who are charged with the execution of those measures . Within a few years the government has withdrawn some of the trusts before reposed in the agents . As men they perhaps have had too much patronage , though as officers they have too little power . The Commissioner says : - " Power should be conferred on the agents to eject summarily all intruders from the reservations . They should also , be clothed with executive and judicial authority in matters pertaining to their agencies , and appeals from their decisions be allowed to the superintendents , and thence to the Department . " - Report , 1857 , p. 5 . Formerly agents were permitted to make the annuity-payments ; but now the Department imposes this duty on the superintendents . This is a significant fact , which admits of but one construction . It is certainly entirely inconsistent with the general theory of the government , that it should be represented among the different tribes by men who do not deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fif // teen hundred dollars per annum , and he is required to reside among the Indians . How is it that prominent and influential men seek such offices from mere pecuniary motives ? It is because they find opportunities to make money . Burke would have had much less indignation against the plunder of the Carnatic , if he could have foreseen the thrift which follows in the wake of one of our Indian agents . It is calculated that an agent can make a fortune during a term of four years ; but how they can do it remains a mystery . One way , of course , is to impose on the Department by false vouchers . In one instance an appropriation was made for a certain amount of agriculture for a tribe . A piece of ground was to be broken . The agent employed a friend to do this work , paying him the nominal price of sixty dollars an acre . Yet the " breaking " consisted merely of ploughing a piece of land which had once before been broken . Out of such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These officers are selected , not on account of any peculiar administrative ability , nor yet for their philanthropy , but because they have done some service for their party . Occasionally upright and estimable men are appointed ; but , however useful , they are liable to be removed through party influence , to give place to one who may be dishonest or incapable . The Indians form their opinion of the government from the capacity and character of the agent . It is of the greatest importance that he should be a trustworthy , able , and energetic man . Admitting him to be fit for the office , we think that he should be clothed with more authority . If the government has the right to keep military posts in the Indian country to awe and restrain them , it has the right to be represented there by a civil officer who has power to enforce just and wise regulations . It is necessary that the influence of the government should operate more directly upon the Indians . Our policy for their civilization should be carried out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being passive and indifferent , it should be active and earnest , with a view to far higher results than have been realized or attempted . Our object in what we have written has been to render service to a race which has both inflicted and suffered many // wrongs . In our judgment , no documents issued from the executive departments of our government are more interesting , or more deserving of general attention , than the Reports of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs , and the accompanying documents . These latter consist of the reports of the several superintendents , agents , and teachers . No one can peruse them without becoming deeply interested in the condition of the Indians . May we not hope that Congress , before the present session expires , will give candid and patient deliberation to the duties and interests involved in this important subject ?
