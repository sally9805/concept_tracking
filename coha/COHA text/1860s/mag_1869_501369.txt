IT means something , this outbreak of burlesque acting all over the world . No mere accident has made so monstrous a kind of entertainment equally acceptable to three publics so different as those of Paris , London , and New York . And by monstrous I do not mean wicked , disgusting , or hateful , but monstrously incongruous and unnatural . The peculiar trait of burlesque is its defiance both of the natural and the conventional . Rather , it forces the conventional and the natural together just at the points where they are most remote , and the result is absurdity , monstrosity . Its system is a defiance of system . It is out of all keeping . Its ideal figure , if it has an ideal , might be Julius C*sar in top boots and spectacles , carrying a baggy green cotton um - brella . Now the great dictator might have been the better for the services of all these articles . His moral majesty did not lift him above the every-day needs of men ; but in our idea he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all of the absurdity . We can not think of him as blowing his nose on a red bandanna handkerchief more than we could so think of Jupiter . But burlesque casts down all the gods from their pedestals . I saw once a very large and elaborately-carved set of chess-men which a mischievous boy had taken apart and screwed together with the black pieces on the white standards , and the white on the black , the bodieg and heads of the pieces being misplaced in a like manner . That was a sort of burlesque . This trait of burlesque reached its fullest development in the mingling of the ancient and the modern , the heroic and the common-place , in " La Belle Hel*ne , " and in " The Forty Thieves , " in which the forty robbers were represented by forty young women , who , as a part of their daily drill , at the command of their captain , . pulled out forty matches and lit forty cigarettes ; in which a donkey danced a break-down , and Morgiana , pouring the poison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed , " They do die beautiful . " Now , in such performances as this , there is plainly no dramatic interest . They have not even the coherence of farce , which is a dramatic caricature of nature . But a caricature must have a certain conformity to nature , or it can not be caricature , which exaggerates or over-charges the characteristics of nature , whence it receives its name . In burlesque there is caricature ; but it is without the relations of parts to a whole , without design , without coherence . It would &amp;eem as if a composition or performance of which these remarks are true could not be recognized in any sense as a work of art , as if in such work there could never be any scope for genius . And yet there are burlesques which are works of art , and immortal productions of genius . " The Birds " and " The Frogs " of Aristophanes are burlesques of the most preposterous kind ; and so are " Hudibras " and " Gulliver 's Travels . " It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put upon the stage , so monstrous a violation of the natural and the conventional , or such gross outrages of decorum , either in the language used or the images presented , as those which form the woof and web of Swift 's immortal allegory . The motive of burlesque is always satire . If this did not pervade it there would not be life enough in it to keep it sweet and make it hold together . The pleasure , the instruction , and the comfort that we all derive from seeing the vices and the follies of others held up to ridicule are so great that we do // not scru*nize too closely the manner in which they are conveyed . And in these days ridicule is , more than ever before , the sieve through which all men and things are sifted . There is a great deal of earnest thinking done ; but even earnestness must not be too obtrusive , if it would escape ridicule , caricature , burlesque . Caricature has become a social and political power in all civilized communities . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretensions , not only pretensions to place , and power , and social distinction , but to virtue , to knowledge , to sentiment , and even to genuine feeling . At such pretensions we are inclined to scoff . The greatest literary power among English-speaking men , the " Saturday Review , " with mockery in its tones and a sardonic smile upon its lips , is the type of the critical temper of the present day . Nothing is so sure to provoke the shafts of that pitiless paper as high-s trung speech or writing , except , perhaps , the exhibition of any emotion . And into this attitude toward each other , and even toward ourselves , we fall every day more and more . Men used even to profess sentiment , and it was thought a fine thing to give way to emotion . Now we repress , as much as we are able , all such manifestations in ourselves , and we look with dislike , and even with suspicion , on them in others . We seem not to be equal to a grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we cower under a tempest of feelincr ; and seek refuge in scorn and ridicule . When we are threatened with a flood of feeling we take the tone and the language of the antediluvian , and declare that there is not going to be much of a shower . This marked trait in the spirit of our time is no where more strongly manifested than in the theatre . For years we have heard the wail of the critics and the old actors over the decline of the drama . And they were right . There was cause for their tears . But they began to weep too late . Dramatic composition , regarded as literature , saw its first decline two hundred and fifty years ago ; and it descended rapidly until the close of the last century . The literary value of the plays produced by the dramatists of the Restoration is very small . Dryden himself left little of this kind that is worth reading ; and the so-called " sterling old English comedies " of the last century , although they are amusing when played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditions of the English stage , are dull and unprofitable in the reading . As to the tragedies of the same period , it is hardly conceivable that mortal men and women sat and , of their own free will , heard such stilted nonsense poured out upon them , in the grand style of declamation , through five acts . But now , to take , for example , the best of these tragedies , it would be impossible to gather audiences , save at the point of the bayonet , to hear " Cato " or " Zara " played , each personage by a Kemble ; and no part of the public would be more reluctant to " assist , " after a single visit of curiosity , than the cultivated , and even the literary classes . The tingling wit of Sheridan gave life to two plays , which are rather elegant farces in five acts than comedies ; for " The School for Scandal " and " The Rivals " are neither a real nor an ideal presentation of life at any period , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a play has been produced in the English language which combines in a high degree literary merit with capacity of stage effect . Plays have been written which had one or the other quality in a great measure , and others which had both in moderation . But Byron , Sheridan Knowles , Browning and Bulwer , like the physician immortalized on the tombstone , read by David Copperfleld , were in vain . The value to a manager of what they wrote was in inverse proportion to its literary merit ; so much so // that the most successful playwright among them was the one whose plays no one would now think of reading sooner than last year 's almanac . Boucicault , wise in his generation , whatever he may be able to do , attempts nothing but stage effect , and an easy-flowing dialogue roughened by little ripples of repartee . Even Boucicault has written no drama more successful than " Rosedale , " which pleased audiences composed in a large measure of the most cultivated people in the principal cities of the country , and one great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any person who saw " Rosedale " played at its best , at Mr. Wallack 's own theatre , by a company of comedians , the like of which will probably never again be found together in this country , recollect the performance , compare it with real life , or with the ideal life of a great comedy , and he will see that was an elegant burlesque . The fighting was burlesque , the love-making , the dancing , the intrigue , and the villainy were all burlesque : Mr. Holland 's adventure in the pantry and his preparation for the dance not more so than Mr. Wallack 's love-making and his adventures with the Gypsies . It owed the great and long-continued favor it enjoyed to its burlesque effects and its scenery ; the plot and the few serious passages were of value as the mere coupling that kept those together . And " Rosedale " is the model of the drama-of the highest style of drama-that is endurable by modern taste . Does any one tell me of the hundred nights of Mr. Booth 's " Hamlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Merchant of Venice , " " Romeo and Juliet , " and " Othello ? " Let any manager bring out these plays with only such scenery and dresses as will suffice to remove the action out of the present , and he will soon find out , if he does not already know , the secret of Mr. Booth 's success . He produced splendid spectacles , and great pictorial stage combinations . Mr. Booth , a good Hamlet , is a poor Romeo ; but if he and Miss McVickar had been able to play the Veronese lovers as they have not been played since Shakespeare 's day , the drama could have produced no effect while the actors were reeling through such an orgie of silks and scenery . And the audiences of our day are more than content to take silk and scenery , as a substitut , e for acting , at least in tragedy . We can bear careful acting , and even applaud careful study of character , if it is presented to us in such extravagant . plays as " Solon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fanchon . " But the tracic , the emotional , even the tender , we can hardly bear to look upon . Our grandmothers vaunted their sensibility , and even our grandfathers prided themselves on their sentiment . But the very words sensibility and sentiment convey to us some sense of the ridiculous . We carry this pretence of insensibility so far that , among the more cultivated classes , it is a mark of breeding to cover the profoundest emotion with a jest , and to speak of a matter of life and death as if it were one of a day 's pleasure . Fortinbras ' soldiers went to their graves like beds ; but we may be sure the rank and file did not so speak of them . The delicate prince himself , though , " made mouths at the invisible event ; " and we are like him , for we affect the princely style in all things . We have schooled ourselves in imperturbability , and have so anatomized our *own consciousness that we have come to regard our souls as machines , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man begins to flame with passion , or a woman flow with tears , we say , in our hearts , at least , Why do you go through that performance before me ? I know how all that sort of thing is done , as well as if it were fireworks or fountains . IVien of old , the very heroes of the heroic ages , cried out when they were wounded in soul or in body . With us it is the height of heroism to suffer in silence . // jl'his being the temper of the time , we can not endure tragedy , or even the ideal presentation of life in high comedy , when tragedy and comedy assume a concrete form on the stage . We can bear it if we are not obliged to see it bodi-. ly . We can read of it in novels ; but even these not aloud . Let any reading circle undertake a sentimental passage in a book of the last century ; for instance , Sterne 's stories of " Lefevre , " or of " Maria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own day , and they will either feel like hiding under the tables and behind the doors , or they will disperse amid peals of laughter . Solvuntur tabule risu . I do not belive that our repression of the manifestation of feeling has really deadened our sensibilities ; for at no period of the world 's history was there more active sympathy with real suffering , or so candid an appreciation of the claims of individual prejudice to consideration , or of the genuineness of a sentimental grievance . There is , even in Great Britain , a large class of men , effectively represented in the press and in Parliament , who recognize , and who would give weight to the sentimental grievances which the Hindoos , the Irish , and even the " Americans , " have suffered at the hands of the British governing classes . This is a new force in politics . Observation of men around us seems to support us in our assumption that sensitiveness of soul is in inverse proportion to manifestation of feeling . Certainly it is so in the relations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy or of sentimental comedy , which , in the last generation , would have pleased what was called genteel society , is now acceptable only to the coarsest and most sluggish natures-those which are immovable except by hard blows oft repeated . The French , who , in their daily life are the most practical of civilized peoples , are in their literature and art the most sentimental . But even they are hardly an exception to these remarks ; and their prolific drama at the present day produces plays in which emotion is expressed by acting of the realistic school , and , according to the habit of the time , the most deeply-stirred soul endeavors to preserve the calmest surface. , or in which feeling like everything else in earth or in heaven , in the past or in the present , is the mere occasion of ridicule and caricature . Of such a condition of the public mind in regard to the drama and the dramatic part of life , burlesque is the legitimate and the inevitable outcome . Join to this the craving for the enjoyment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " The Black Crook , " " La Grande Duchesse de Gerolstein , " La Belle Hel*ne , " " The Forty Thieves , " and " Sinbad the Sailor . " The next step to the repression of manifestations of real feeling , is the caricature of such manifestations in art . And then , as mere caricature in acting is insufficient in its interest , the element of beauty is added , and in a monstrous form-that of women playing men 's parts , and dressed , for incongruity 's sake , as well as for a display of their beauty , in the costume of men centuries ago ; while many of the personages are in the dress of the present day , and in some cases both costumes are mingled . Extravagance in all these respects could not go farther than it has gone in some of the burlesques recently produced in Europe and in this country . But it was observed that , at the plays for which Offenbach *vrote his feeble semblance of opera buffa , the audiences contained not only the students of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or should have been , their mentors ; not only the Jeunesse and the viellesse , but the men whose business it was to carry on the world 's affairs . Let me say that these performances are so little to my own taste , that I found // AUGUST ) one sitting of " La Grande Duchesse " and one dose of " Mile . Tost6e " somewhat more than I could bear ; and that it was not until " The Forty Thieves " were about sinking into their unsavory oil-jars for the last time that I saw Miss Lydia Thompson and her company , at Niblo 's . But going there at a morning 's performance , in search of a needed laugh , which I confess I did not get , I was surprised , not only with the merit of the lady herself ; and of some of her companions , but with the character of the audience . The latter I expected to find made up of coarse and flashy people ; but , on the contrary , it was notable in the main , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women from the suburbs , and from the remoter country , their daughters , groups of children , a few professional men , bearing their quality in their faces , some sober , farmer-looking folk , a clergyman or two , apparently , the usual proportion of nondescripts , among which were not many very young men , composed an audience less fashionable than that I had seen in Fourteenth street , but at least as respectable . And the Lydia Thompson , in whom I had expected to find a coarse , Anglo-Saxon exaggeration of Mlle. Tost6e , I found one of the most charming comic actresses it had b.een my good fortune to see . She played burlesque with a daintiness with which few actresses of note are able to flavor their acting , even in high comedy . She was doing hard work , no doubt , but her heart must have been in it , for she was the embodiment of mirth , and moved others to hilarity by being moved herself . It was as if Venus , in her quality of the goddess of laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a likeness to Venus in the costume , as well as in manner , I must confess that I saw in it no chance of harm to myself or to any of my fellow spectators , old or young , male or female . Indeed , it seems rather to be desired that the points of a fine woman should be somewhat better known , and more thought of among us than they have been . They seem to me quite as important , and I think they are quite as interesting , as those of a fine horse ; and I should be sorry to believe that they are more harmful , either to taste or to morals . Some of the outcry that we hear against the costume of which the burlesque actresses wear , in the way of their profession , has in it such a tone of personal injury , that it might come from mammas and papas who , having a very poor article of young woman lying heavy on their hands , are indignant that there should be so good and so easy an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As to any impropriety in this costume , in its place , that is , seriously speaking , a matter of individual opinion ; but if there is any , it is far less , both in degree and in kind , than that of the ordinary ballet dancer , with her flying petticoat , alternately concealing and revealing the attractions of her figure , which we have looked at ever since we were children , even in this dear old Niblo 's Garden , without a thought of shamefacedness , and very much less than that of the tilting hoops , which lent such peculiar attractions to the " German ' * in fashionable society only two years ago . This gayety of heart and overrunning glee , Miss Thompson shows even to a greater degree in " Sinbad " than in its predecessor . What an overflow of mirth and humor breaks from her when she takes the auctioneer 's stand , at the wifemarket , to set forth her own qualifications as a " Girl of the Period ! " With what a radiant outbreak of fun does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " and how thoroughly she seems to enjoy that queer word " thunk , " which the author has given her for I/iou gut / I must confess , with proper contrition , that I liked her performance in this part better than much high tragedy that I have seen-better , for instance , than Mr. Forrest in Hamlet . As to tliu , zk , I venture to say that her author probably took that word from a passage in an ar // tide on " Words and their Uses , " where I used it some months ago , whimsically , of course . But probably neither he nor one or two of the prim purists who scoffed at me for it , knew how old a word it is , and how good authority there is for its use . Here it is , in the famous old satirical poem of " The Owl and the Nightingale , " written six hundred years ago , about A. D. 1250 : Me lAunch that the for-leost that game Thu yulpest of thire oye schame ; Me lAunch that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schonde And this reminds me of one striking excellence in this company of actresses  --  the beautiful manner in which they speak English . It is noticeable in all , but particularly in two , one of whom is Miss Thompson herself ; the other is the second lady of the company , Miss Pauline Markham , she who has found the long lost arms of the " Venus of Milo , " and whose speech is vocal velvet . It is with a recollection of all the public elocution and private conversation that ever impressed me , that I say that Miss Markham , whose voice and style are not of the heroic or high-tragedy order , speaks the most beautiful colloquial English that I ever heard . More reserved in manner , and less sprightly by nature , I should say , than Miss Thompson ( whose part , nevertheless , she took with very great success ) , her voice and her smile give to her presence a rare attraction , that calls to mind the allurements which Horace immortalized in the closing lines of his most famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ u . This was apparent in the " School for Scandal , " in which . she played " Maria , " a part that gives an actress only the opportunity to be quiet , and simple , and lady-like , as she was ; but in which her speech was so lovely in manner and in tone , that she made that of all the other women on the stage seem sharp , and rough , and forbidding . If the ladies of our most cultivated society need an excuse for attending the performances at Niblo 's , the lack of which they do not seem to feel , they may find it in the benefit which they might derive from listening to Miss Thompson , Miss Markham , and their companions ( with one exception , now , however , no longer a member of the company ) , as they utter the puns and doggerel of their parts , which are almost as significant and as silly as the words of Italian opera . On one point these burlesques have transgressed , gravely and without excuse-their dances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for voluptuous effect or immodesty , with G6rome 's superb picture , " L'Alm*e , " which hung unrehuked and admired for months in one of the most fashionable resorts in the city , are vulgar and gross-being made so by the lack of any element of beauty in form or spirit . " La Grande Duchesse , " " Genevieve de I3rahant , " and " The Forty Thieves , " sinned gravely in this regard , in which " Sinbad " is without reproach . And I will say in passing , that in the last-named play , the dancing of the member of the Clodoche troupe who wears the Normandy head dress , is really grand . He steps as if he could take in half the earth at a bound , . and as if he rose from the ground by volition , rather than by exertion . In this respect he far surpasses any dancer whose performance I remember . The styl&amp; of his companions is always grotesque and clownish ; his is rarely other than severe and simple . The dancing is the most vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of condemr*ation even more for its silliness than its . indecorum . But what can we expect in a day when the Princess Metternich kickr* 17 // the Emperor 's hat off at the Tuileries , and when a Yankee girl I have heard of , who , and whose friends , would he surprised if told that she , or the society in which she moved , was not perfectly respectable , has boasted of her ability to remove papa 's hat in the same manner ? Were either of these ladies an actress who went through this performance in public , she would be subjected to disparaging remark of a kind as well as of a degree which she now , in a great measure , escapes . And with some reason ; although it must be confessed that , if such an act admits at all of comparison , when done openly and as business , it is less objectionable than when it is private , and must be accepted as an example of the manners of the lay . I have known very few actresses . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my acquaintances among the ladies of the stage almost on the fingers of one hand . It has merely happened so  --  to my great loss , I do not doubt-although my limited observation has confirmed what is said by those who have known many actresses , and known them well , that there is no peculiar charm in their society except a certain freedom from restraint that makes intercourse with them easier than it is with purely domestic women . A clever and successful actress is generally a charmiPg woman , with her womanhood slightly dashed with the open-hearted freedom of a good fellow , and the ease and repose of a man of the world ; the womanly weaknesses and graces being , as a counterpoise , a little more pronounced in her than they usually are . But beyond wearing the rue of their sex with this slight difference , actresses are just like other women ; as fond of admiration , but no fonder ; no more eager to be loved , or covetous of the attentions and the gifts that are tributes to their charms ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living-for which , indeed , they very rarely have the means at their command ; no less gifted with all the peculiar virtues-nay , the very domestic virtues of their sex ; as true in their friendships as other women are , and as pungent in their hatred ; as selfish and as unselfish ; and as ready to sacrifice themselves to their love or their duty . They are somewhat more frank and simple in their manner than the women of society , and generally , I believe , more generous ; readier , as a rule , to give to others and to work for others who have no claim on them but need and their common profession . The services done to each other by actresses , out of pure kindness and good nature , and the help that the successful ones give to the unsuccessful , more than atone for the professional jealousy and envy for which they are noted , but in which they are n* peculiar . Mere women as they are , with a slight excess of the more womanly traits of character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other class of people . They excite the envy , and not infrequently provoko the jealousy of other women , who resent and wonder at the admiration they receive from " all the men , " an admiration often accompanied by a lively interest on the part of men who have and who seek no personal acquaintance with them . But the reason of this interest is merely that they are devoted to giving pleasure . It is their daily occupation to enliven , to stimulate , to delight . They do this in the eyes of the world . They spread their nets in the sight of many birds , and not in vain . With one glance they wound hundreds , and with the self-same smile they captivate tens of hundreds . The domestic woman practises as with a rifle , or at most , with a double-barrelled fowling-piece , bringing down her man here and there ; but an actress scatters her charms into a crowd , out of a blunderbuss . Her fire is rarely so fatal as that of her more concealed , sharp-shooting sister ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more noise about it ; and once in a // while she , as well as the other , gives wounds that last a life time . Some man , not of her class , is more than a passing admirer , feels more than a transient flame , and then she either shares a great happiness or grieves over a great sorrow of her making ; or else she exults in her conquest , and utilizes it , and makes all she can of it in reputation and in tribute , just as if she had been brought up in the conventual atmosphere , and under the self-denying precepts and examples of the best society . In either of these cases she is sure to be denounced as a harpy , a man-trap , a whited sepulchre ; and very virtuous women , who are laying , or who have lain snares to catch rich men , and get such a legal hold upon them that they may drain their purses all their lives , sneer at the mercenary views of a hard-working actress who accepts the eagerly-proffered pleasure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirer is glad to lighten and decorate the burden of her laborious life . If only the women who are without sin in this respect were to cast stones , how many actresses would be stoned to death ? The freedom with which the private conduct and the character of actresses are spoken of by those who have no knowledge of them , is one of the tolerated outrages of society . In the first place , their conduct in private is no proper subject of public criticism . If they ask to be received into any circle of society , the members of that society have the right to pass judgment upon their morals and their manners ; but not otherwise . Theirpilvate relations are matters to be determined by their own sense of propriety ; and they , no less than other women , have the right to demand , not only that nothing shall be said of them which is untrue , but that no man shall say that of them that he does not know to be true . Yet , I have been made an involuntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when every assertion of my professed informant was directly at variance with the fact , as I knew , of my own knowledge . And I have not unfrequently heard that told , with reckless indifference , of these ministers to the world 's pleasure , for telling which , even if it were true , the teller deserved to be struck dumb . Among the half-dozen actresses whom I have known , two , who are no longer living-Sontag and Rachel-left impressior*s upon me , as women , that I am sure will never be obscured by time 's attrition . I3oth were of humble birth , and both were remarkable for the distinguished elegance of their manners ; but with this difference : that Sontag , charming and elegant on the stage , was more charming and more elegant in private ; while Rachel , who behind the footlights was the ideal of a queen or a great lady of the old school , in private , although courteous and well mannered , showed the stamp of her origin and her profession-how , I can not tell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been born Countess de Rossi , or , for that matter , de Montmorenci , could not have shown in her personal bearing nobility of a higher , simpler type ; but on the stage she was surpassed in this respect by the Jewess , who , as unable in private to conceal her breeding as her race , showed yet upon the stage the command and the graciousness of those who are born in the purple . Saying this , one day , to the late eccentric Count Gurowski , I was pleased , and not surprised , to have the curt reply , " Ouf ! Rachel is the one-ly gra ; idc dame on the tay-ahtre . " Sontag , when I knew her , was a mature woman , and my senior by many years ; and yet , notwithstanding this , and a knowledge of the world besides , that showed itself in all she did and said , and which rivalled that of her gambling husband , she seemed to me to diffuse around her all the influences of youth . A freshness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers , an unaffected softness of manner , that had the gratefulness of balm , and its virtue . She had the tenderness and crispness // of youth , without its greenness . I have rarely met a girl of seventeen so young as Sontag was at forty-five . I have said nothing of her beauty ; for that was well known to all men . And when I saw it still preserved , I then first recollected that I had heard of it before I was old enough to know what woman 's beauty was ; but I had not heard of her hand , which was beai4tiful enough to worship , as we may worship all perfection . And this woman , so beautiful , so winning in her ways , so charming as a singer and an actress , was also clever in the most attractive form of female cleverness . She talked well , without sententiousness and without learning ; and she had humor , as much as becomes a truly femiijine woman . I shall never forget her description of the pompous dulness of the dinners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen to which she was invited , after her marriage with Count Rossi and her retirement from the stage . The essays in gallantry of men who had been foxhunting or shooting all day , and who came home tired and hungry to get themselves up in festive apparel , and to eat a heavy dinner and drink heavy wine , were not much to her taste ; although , if she were half as lively under their infliction as she was in describing it , she must have been a priceless creature amid all that dulness . Only one indication of her humble origin and of self-consciousness escaped her . I happened to mention that I had followed a procession , in a large city , for the purpose of observing the people called out by its passage , and that I had found the prettiest women among those in the lower conditions of life " Ah , " she said , slightly dropping her eyelids , " it is always so . " Her sudden death in Mexico was generally attributed to poison , her husband , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tenor singer who was in their company . I have never believed this story . Count Rossi may not have been too good a man thus to relieve himself of a woman who , by her own exertions , had restored him , in a great measure at least , the fortune he had wasted ; but she loved the unworthy husband for whom she labored . Rachel talked more of the stage and of literature than Sontag did . She made an admission to me one evening that was surprising . She had been playing Ph*edre , with grandeur , and great power over the emotions of her audience ; but she spoke to me , with a naturalness that she never surpassed on the stage , of her weariness of French tragedy , of its sentimentality , its prosiness and its stilted verse . " Oh that I had learned English , that I might play Shakespeare ! but now it is too late . " " What , are you not satisfied with Racine , or even with Corneille " " No ; Corneille has moments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of the best parts . " I complimented her upon her Ph*edre , which , although an unpleasant character , seemed to me one that gave scope for fine acting . " Yes , I have an opportunity of doing something ; but that boy , " waving her hand as if Hippolytus were present , " what does he do but spout nonsense ! And that old man with his monster " ( referring to Theramene 's description of the death of Hippolyte ) , " and all the rest-how stupid ( b*'te ) it is ! Give me Shakespeare . " If this was a delicate compliment to a man of Shakespeare 's race , and a student of his works , it was a very elaborate and superfluous one . I am inclined to think that it was not so ; but a genuine expression of opinion and feeling which she might not have been willing to avow to a Frenchman . She was right as to her capacity . To see her play Cleopatra or Lady Macbeth would have l ) een worth a voyage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be-Lady Macbeth ; and , except her black hair , to look the wife of Cawdor , who , I do not doubt , was just sech a lithe , spiritual , alluring female fiend as she ; // 26S or perhaps bright , and sunny , and sweet , and surely yellow-haired , like Lydia Thompson , who herself has capacities for tragedy in the fine lines of her face . As for those big , black , bony Lad** Macbeths , that stalk about the stage and stare out of pictures , they might drive a soldier to seek death upon the field ; but they could tempt him neither to marriage or to murder . The last time I saw Rachel to speak with her was on the occasion of her last appearance in the full possession of her powers . I was in Boston , and she played Adrienne Le Couvreur . Of course I did not miss that performance , and it was unusually firm and finished , even for her . It seemed to me as if she were playing it for her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impersonation of the unhappy actress with such abandonment of self that she really suffered the pangs she simulated , and inflicted them upon her own soul with a fierce joy . Walking in the lobby , between two acts , I met the manager , Mr. Barry , who soon ask*d me if I was acquainted with Mlle. Rachel , and then kindly proposed that I should go behind the scenes and send my name to her dressing-room . I did so . My card found her ready dressed for the next act , and she came immediately out . I stood by the front , and she came on at the back . The stage was deep , and down the long and dimly-lighted aisle between the side scenes and the wall she came with swift steps , the golden sequins of her Venetian head-dress glittering in the glossy darkness of her hair , and her black eyes burning so brightly that when she first appeared , I saw them gleaming through the gloom before I saw the sequins . She put out both hands for a greeting that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after a few inquiries about people in New York , we fell into general talk , and I told her how very much I had enjoyed the performance that evening . A slight tinge of color Caine into her pale . face ( which the coining scene required not to be touched with rouge ) not , I believe , at my compliment , but at her own consciousness , as she replied : " Ab ! Yes ? I am delighted ; for this evening I am playing with my whole heart . " After a conversation of a few minutes , in which she was full of life and spirit , she asked me to call on her the next day , when , as she did not play that evening , she would be entirely at liberty , and to come about eleven o'clock . I turned my head an instant toward Mr. Barry , who stood a little behind me ; and , although my movement was as slight and as quick as possible , when I looked again she was vanished out of sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * , own , or even the clink of two sequins . I saw no trace or sign of the woman with whom I had been speaking the twinkling of an eye before . It was as if she had been swallowed by the earth , or to speak in keeping with the place where we were , as if she had gone down at my feet through a noiseless trap . I turned , with a look of amazement , to the manager , who said : " Just like her . Now she will stand by herself and take no notice of anything till it 's time for her to go on . Will you go to your box ? " For , with all his polite atention , Mr. Barry , like a sensible manager , was not inclined to have loungers on the stage while the business of the scene was going on . But I needed no invitation to hasten to see that performance from the front . The next morning I called at the appointed hour ; and after waiting rather longer than I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the door opened , and there appeared , not Rachel , but her sister Mlle. Sarah , who brought Rachel 's regrets . She was not well enough to see any one . She was feverish , had a cough , and must nurse herself for to-morrow evening . I took this for a woman 's and , if the ladies of the stage will pardon me for saying // so , an actress 's put-off . I remembered her high condition the evening before , and did not believe that she was ill at all ; but that being lazy , or bored , or indifferent , or occupied more to her taste , she had sent me this excuse . I should have felt certain of it if she had sent me also a certificate of her condition from her physician . But I wronged her . She had received her death-warrant , and was never well again . She played afterward , but her performances were unequal in quality , and were frequently interrupted by her inability to bear the fatigue of acting ; and ere long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my misjudgment was-one of a kind that a man runs the risk of at least twelve times a year-I never looked again into her fading eyes , or heard her short , sharp cough without a guilty feeling . And still I have it , mingled with my pleasure at the thought that I saw , under such circumstances , and with such stimulating condiment of personal intercourse , the last really complete performance of her whom I believe to have been the greatest actress the world ever saw . Will the world see another Rachel ? I think not . Nature is not exhausted hut her riches are taken from her bosom only when they supply a need ; and the need of great actors , or even of acting of a high grade , seems to be no longer felt . The drama , as an intellectual diversion of the mind from one channel of thought into another , has passed away , I think , forever . The public , even the cultivated public , in all countries , prefers that kind of theatrical entertainment at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not diversion , a turning of the mind from one object to another , hut the pleasure of the senses while the mind lies dormant . It seeks only to be amused . Of this mood , burlesque or " spectacular extravaganza " is the natural and inevitable product . We , of Anglo-Saxon race at least , have probably seen the last of our legitimate drama .
