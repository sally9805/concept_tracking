txt ART . IV . - Principles of Geology ; or the Modern Changes of the Earth and its Inhabitants , considered as illustrative of Geology . By SIR CHARLES LYELL , Bart . Tenth Edition . London : John Murr , ay . 2 vols . Svo . " NuNU naturalem causam qua ? rimus , et assiduam , non raram et fortuitarn. - In the economy of the world , I can see no traces of a beginning , no prospect of an end . " Dr. Hutton used this language in announcing his famous theory of the earth eighty years ago . The choice of words was unfortunate , and theological wrath burst upon him with true Scotch energy in consequence . Even now a reader may not at once understand how the earth 's economy is separable from the earth // Oct. itself , nor how a student who is unable to discover the process can escape denying the result which yet is before his eyes . Dr. Hutton maintained only that geology had nothing to do with first causes , or with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of science ; but though he would not even discuss the world 's beginning , the world 's economy was a different thing . He had been unable to detect any sign that the natural influences now at work had not always been in action or would ever cease to be active ; nor would he consent to imagine extraordinary agents in order to account for geological phenomena , until it could be proved that ordinary agents were unequal to the task . These rules , apparently so simple as to be commonplace , have become the foundation of geological science , fixing limits beyond which it has no right to pass , connecting all phenomena in an unbroken series , and applying to them only the known laws of the existing world . A careful study of such changes as are now taking place in the condition of the earth 's crust is recognized as the single necessary means to an understanding of changes in past ages . There seems to be nothing unreasonable or extravagant in these views , unless it be their very bald and prosaic stamp ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most in fashion , and they were peculiarly obnoxious to religious prejudices . Against a combination of scientific and religious intolerance no power on earth could prevail . Dr. Hutton was suppressed . His theory was dropped . No school of geologists ventured for forty years to build on the foundation he had raised . While in Germany men slowly created the science of mineralogy , while in France the tertiary strata yielded brilliant discoveries , and in England the museums were filled to overflowing with huge fossils from the sedondary formations , no one attempted a comprehensive system , so weary had science become of theory . The calm lasted until 1830 , when Mr. Lyell published his " Principles of Geology , " and reopened the old controversy by asserting and developing Hutton 's theory . The work exercised a great influence , since that which in 1788 had been a premature hypothesis , incapable of proof , had become in 1830 the natural result of long and careful observation , and appeared , if not perfectly satisfactory , at least the nearest // approach yet made to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for , as every year advanced the range of knowledge . It was reprinted and widely read in America , where its views were commonly accepted . The ninth London edition appeared in 1853 , and after fifteen years ' interval Sir Charles has now published a tenth edition , which has been as eagerly received as any of its predecessors . The " Principles " deal , as we have said , with the theory of geology , the process by which the earth 's crust has taken the form we see . Readers who care to learn what this form is , who want a statement , not of the forces which have been at work , but of the minerals and fossils which have been the result , may seek their information in Sir Charles 's " Elements of Geology , " a part of the subject included in the first edition of the *Principles , " but afterwards found to require separate treatment . We shall undertake only to deal with the theory , dismissing the co-ordinate branch as beyond the power of compression . Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science ; nor are our countrymen likely to be unduly forgetful of this circumstance , even though they remember that he has been among the warmest and most disinterested friends that America and Americans have ever had in England . Dealing , as he has to do , with a topic which lends itself more readily than almost any other to the exercise of the imagination , so that few students can resist the fascination of building geological castles-in-the-air , he seems to feel a certain amount of pleasure in lopping away fanciful excrescences which other men foster , and in treating the earth 's marvellous history in that coldly scientific spirit which admits only what is enough , and no more than enough , to produce the result observed . We can not say that the " Principles , " still less the " Elements , " would amuse persons who look for a vivid series of pictures reproducing the mysterious and poetical outlines of a dead world . Sir Charles wanders among the monotonous and fiowerless forests of the coal-measures without saddening our spirits , and describes the enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensational as though ichthyosauri were still gambolling in shoals along the banks of the Thames . // Following his steps , we can not but feel , that , however varied and curious , beautiful or hideous , may have been the forms of past existence , there is still a rigid and obstinate barrier of law which confines them within limits not essentially different from those we are familiar with *n common life . Sir Charles is essentially a conservative philosopher , at least so far as concerns a rigorous adherence to a strictly defined method . At the outset of his career he seized upon one great principle , bold enough , it is true , but scarcely to be called fanciful or paradoxical , and to its proof and development he has devoted a long and active life , advancing so cautiously as often to lean , in his friends ' opinion , somewhat too strongly towards negation . Like Hutton , he has always maintained that geology has nothing to do with the origin of things . There is no original world , he says . Search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth 's surface which we can prove to be older than organic life . The theory of the earth 's igneous origin is especially his aversion . Why found anything upon it , he asks , when we know , that , whether the globe was originally fluid or solid , in either case it must inevitably have assumed , sooner or later , the same form as now , from the mere action of atmospheric and astronomical causes . Nor will he even admit the necessity that below the earth 's solid crust there should be a fluid nucleus or core . There are arguments for and against such a nucleus ; but Sir Charles is obviously of the opinion that below the earth 's crust there may be many things of which we can have as yet no idea . When Agassiz and his friends introduced into the science the glacial theory , certainly the most brilliant geological discovery of the last half-century , Sir Charles was slow to accept it until the accumulation of evidence overpowered all possibility of resistance . In his last edition he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no evidence to justify the common assumption that earlier forms of existence were necessarily simpler than later forms , the more complex making their appearance in an ascending scale till the arrival of man at last . And at the same time he met Lamarek 's argument in favor of the transmutation of species by a distinct assertion of his belief that " species have a real existence in // Nature , and each was endowed at the time of its creation with the attributes and organization by which it is now distinguished . " Owing to this scientific spirit of caution , or to this national characteristic of hostility to theories , Sir Charles 's books , if they have not the charm of a lively imagination , have at all events a certain solidity which gives them high authority . Readers will not come to them in the expectation of finding many startling theories , or many brilliant generalizations , which have not the distinct purpose of supplying a " causam naturalem et assiduam " for one that is " raram etfortuitam " ; but they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the science has made , and what new fields of investigation have been opened . The plan of the " Principles " is simple and easily followed . According to the iluttonian theory , all past conditions of the earth , so far as they are visible to the geologist , were brought about by the slow agency of causes still existing , and , since the first appearance of organic life , there has been no violent , universal interruption of development . Perhaps only the most sanguine geologists feel even now any strong confidence that the truth of this theory can ever be proved to demonstration . The diversity is so enormous between fossils of so-called successive strata , and the quiet of our earth since historical times contrasts so strongly with the evidence of wide and laborious convulsion offered by mountain ranges like the Alps , that one may well be pardoned for hesitating to generalize too bold ly . Mont Blanc is but a young mountain , which owes at least two thirds of its upheavals to periods later than the older tertiary . The strata about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the oldest above the newest , until the whole country seems to have been ground in a mortar ; yet we are required to believe that this process may be , and most probably is , actually going on at some spot in the world , under our very eyes , without our perceiving it . On the other hand , the rival hypothesis asserts a series of grand catastrophes , by which all life was extinguished only to be incorporated again in new forms , - and of prodigious , but apparently rare , convulsions of Nature , which have transformed by sudden paroxysms the appearance of the // world . Of the two theories , Hutton 's was certainly the most reasonable . That all life has ever been extinguished on the earth at any one moment since it was called into being is too violent an hypothesis to be accepted without irrefragable proof . There are species which to all appearance have lived undisturbed through some of the worst of these catastrophes , as , for example , the Terebratula striata , a small marine shell common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terebrotula caput serpentis in our own . And so far as mere physical convulsions are concerned , the disturbances have been limited both in violence and range . We find in so old a deposit as the o6lite the delicate stamp of the dragon-fly undisturbed , though mountains have been raised near it , and every form of animal and vegetable life has been repeatedly changed since its entombment ; while from the miocene strata we are shown so strangely evanescent a memorial as the tender pattern of a butterfly 's wing on which are still to be traced colors that may well be twenty million years old . Assuming , therefore , that the iluttonian theory is to serve as the basis of geology , all past changes in the earth 's crust may be referred to causes now at work . These changes affect the organic and the inorganic world , and the agencies at work to produce them were formerly considered to be heat and moisture , but of late years more and more attention has been called to the influence of climate as a true and independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " l ? rinciples " is now devoted to the subject of climate , the remainder being divided under the two heads of organic and inorganic phenomena , which are accounted for according to the laws known to us from experience . Climatic geology , inorganic and organic geology , are therefore dealt with independently in turn , according to a strictly logical method . We shall not go back to discuss opinions now familiar to every one from the earlier editions of the work , but we shall attempt to point out some of the most striking changes of view , which make the tenth edition almost a new book . Following Sir Charles 's arrangement , we have to deal first with the subject of climate . We have already mentioned the // unwillingness shown by him to accept the doctrine of great climatic changes , when Professor Agassiz , stepping so boldly out of his own strict sphere of science , forced upon geology his celebrated glacial theory . The introduction of this new geological agent seemed at first sight inconsistent with Sir Charles 's argument , obliging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth capable of producing more violent geological changes than would be possible in our own day . But the proof offered by Agassiz soon bore down all resistance , until the question is now no longer whether very astonishing revolutions in climate have taken place , but rather why they have taken place , and how often . So slender are the means of deciding precisely what may have been the pala3ozoic climate as compared with our own , that a difference of temperature between one period of a million years and another might well escape our attention in that early age , even where any record was still preserved . That there were such differences has been shown to be very probable , but it is wiser to postpone problems about the primary period until the nearer history of tertiary and recent times has been worked out . Whatever can be proved to have happened once on the earth will probably be found to have happened frequently , since we have no right to assume that any triie cause has acted only in a single instance . We understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untenable the favorite theory , that the radiation of internal heat , while the earth was still cooling from a liquid state , raised the temperature on its surface throughout the primary period to a higher point than would now be possible . Some other agency had therefore to be discovered , capable of explaining phenomena so mysterious as the apparently high average warmth of paheozoic times . Thus far , however , little progress has been made in these climatic studies , except as concerns the tertiary and recent age . Within the last few years the darkness which had hitherto covered this region of geology has been partly dissipated , and partly , as it seems to us , made only more visible by the light thrown upon it by Professor Heer . This Swiss geologist , collecting the rich harvest of fossils buried almost at his own door in the miocene deposits of Oeningen , selected from them // such species as were most closely allied to species now in existence , and , arguing from the known characteristics of the latter , has , by a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miocene Swiss climate . A marvellous wealth of vegetation is shown to have existed on the shores of this Geningen lake . But we venture to think the *iost significant fact pointed out by Professor ileer is , that , of the genera which then predominated in Europe , a very small proportion still exists there , as compared with the numbers that flourish elsewhere . The miocene age has bequeathed by far the largest portion of its riches , not to Europe , not to Asia , nor even to Africa , but to the country of all others least likely , under the present geographical division , to share them , - to North America . After proving by means of the Oeningen fossils that Central Europe enjoyed a miocene climate much resembling that of Madeira or the Canaries at present , a climate whose average temperature was higher by 90 Cent . ( 160 Fahr. ) than now , the Professor tested his theories by an experiment so bold that the imagination can not fail to be impressed by it . He turned to the region about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times geological collections more or less extensive have been brought by explorers to the various museums of Europe . These collections , coming from North Greenland , from Melville Island , Banksland , the Mackenzie River , Spitzbergen , and Iceland , were submitted to Professor fleer 's examination by consent of the societies or governments to whom they belonged , and from the portion which was of miocene age he has drawn proof of a rich vegetation once existing over the whole region now covered by ice or snow . Here , under the seventieth parallel of north latitude , were found masses of fossil leaves perfectly preserved , even to delicate seed-vessels which almost a breath of air would have burst . Oaks , with leaves half a foot long , flourished in North Greenland forests among a far greater variety of trees than could now be found in any forest of Central Europe . The poplar , the beech , and the oak , the plane-tree , the Wellingtonia , and the lime , once grew luxuriantly within twelve degrees of the pole , - and , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that the more hardy pines , willows , and alders were then to be found at the pole itself . // 473 Here , again , as in the case of the contemporary Swiss forests , it is remarkable that several of these miocene species , then common to Europe and to America as well as to the whole arctic region , have now their closest representatives , - shall we dare say their descendants ? - not in the Old World , but in California and Louisiana . There could be no more decisive proof of the theory which Heer had deduced from the Oeniiigen deposits than this strange evidence drawn from beneath arctic ice . The elevation of temperature argued from the miocene flora of Switzerland was more than confirmed . While the climate of Central Europe was only 160 Fahr. warmer than now , and while this temperature gradually fell , as now , according to the latitude , it seems as though from the thirtieth parallel northward to the pole the loss of heat had been less rapid than in our own time . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 160 Falir. ) warmer than ours ; but at the pole the apparent temperature was 16*0 Cent . ( 300 Fahr. ) higher than now . Whether this variation from what we should naturally expect was real or only apparent is a point not yet decided . Since the temperature is calculated from the vegetation , it is possible that there may be an error in this attempt to deal with a state of things unknown to our experience , and that the miocene warmth of a long arctic summer may have more than counterbalanced the effect of winter 's cold , thus bringing vegetation farther northward than might be expected . However this may be , the fact is now considered established that the miocene climate was 160 Fahr. warmer than our own , and that the isothermal line , which represents a mean annual temperature of 320 Fahr. , the freezing point of water , and which is now on or near the fifty-eighth parallel of north latitude , was then thrust back to the pole itself . We do not yet know how long this state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied the subsequent history of miocene and pliocene times . But in the marine formations of the later pliocene period it is observed that species of shells peculiar to the warmer seas began slowly to disappear , supplanted by northern forms . Arctic mollusks drove the legitimate inhabitants of temperate // 474 The Principles of Geology . seas far toward the south , and usurped their place . The process was probably slow , but its action and results are more apparent than the sequence of its steps . We suddenly find ourselves in the midst of a perpetual winter so severe that cautious geologists like Sir Charles Lyell hesitate to accept the evidence before their eyes . Glaciers poured down the mountains , eroding , polishing , scouring with long grooves the hardest rocks , and carrying boulders and drift over hill and valley . New England would seem to have been buried under a solid mass of ice , or under a sea always packed with ice . The miocene flora and fauna of Europe were appar.ently forced back to the Mediterranean and annihilated , while in America they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other now vanished path to the tropics , or from some local cause now not perfectly obvious . Geologists are still vainly attempting to come to an agreement among themselves as to the limits which should be allowed for this march of polar ice and arctic species . The track of the glacier is visible to a certain point , and erratic boulders are found within certain parallels of latitude , but Professor Agassiz asserts that under the equator itself the whole valley of the Amazons was filled with one huge glacier which built up its gigantic moraines across the river 's mouth . Without adopting extreme views , it may be considered as proved that an arctic flora and fauna occupied Europe and America , and when at last returning warmth drove the ice backward , here and there little patches of northern vegetation , cut off from their families , took refuge among the mountains , where they still remain , on the Alps and the Apennines , among the Grampians and the Alleghanies , like blockaded towns waiting their friends ' return . Careful observers believe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercalated between other periods of recurring cold . Although it is improbable that the earth 's present temperature is a precise mean between miocene warmth and glacial frost , yet , since such an assumption would rather fall short of explaining the glacial phenomena than explain too much , we need be under no fear of exaggerating the oscillations of climate by arguing , that , as the miocene temperature was 160 warmer than our own , the glacial must have been at least 160 // 475 colder ; and since any cause which increased the warmth of the pole in miocene times might also have increased the cold afterwards in the same region , we might infer an oscillation of no less than 600 Fahr. within the arctic circle . But there seems to be no reason for insisting upon this last point . Enough was proved , when it was shown to be probable that the isothermal mean of 320 , which was once at the pole and is now on the fifty-eighth parallel , at an intermediate time fell as far south as the fortieth parallel , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present climate of Iceland . The discovery of this climatic element in geology was one of more importance than can yet be fairly estimated . We can not measure the force of the new agent , nor have geologists yet the means of calculating what share it may have had in the destruction , the creation , and the confusion of organic even more than of inorganic forms . But the glacial theory is not complete , it lacks indeed its most essential side , if science content itself with recording the phenomenon without comprehending its cause . What was this extraordinary influence which brought alpine glaciers straight over the Jura , and swept the forms of miocene life out of Europe ? Sir Charles Lyell and other men of science , who can preserve their good sense under temptation , can not prevent the mass of imaginative human beings from wild speculations . Nine in every ten will certainly jump to the conclusion that this apparition which we call the glacial epoch is but the world 's great ever-recurring winter , as the warmer age that preceded it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited in our existence , that , flourishing in April , our experience does not even extend back to March , nor teach us to predict May . If this theory were less obvious , its truth would perhaps be somewhat more probable . Even as it stands , there is much to be said in its favor , as we shall presently show . But Nature does not necessarily revolve in cycles . Sir Charles Lyell , always unwilling to call in a doubtful and unfamiliar agent where anything simpler can be made to supply its place , adheres to his old opinion that these climatic variations may be sufficiently explained by assuming corresponding changes in physical geography . A globe on which all the dry land were // massed about the poles would have a climate far cooler than one on which all the dry land were massed under the equator . Laud at the poles is a storehouse for ice and snow , while land within the tropics is a furnace for the distribution of heat . Water about the poles checks the accumulation of ice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderates heat . Calculations have been made to prove that a comparatively small amount of geographical change would be sufficient to produce climatic variations fully as great as those we have stated . If we venture to doubt whether Sir Charles 's explanation is satisfactory , we do so only under the cover of Sir Charles 's own philosophical maxims . Naturalern causam et assiduam qua*rimus , non rararn et fortuitam . Nevertheless , although the geographical theory does not seem to have quite so large and liberal a character as one might wish , there is no fair reason to reject it , if it conforms to the phenomena observed . Unfortunately , the more geology is studied , the more its incompleteness becomes obvious ; it can not make progress without theorizing , yet very few of its theories have the proper number of legs to run upon ; the facts , if not contradictory , are wanting . The geographical doctrine of climatic variations applied to the case we are discussing requires that in warm periods , as the miocene , for example , there should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land within the tropics . As time passed on , the land about the pole is supposed to have risen from under the sea , and ice to have accumulated upon it , while land within the tropics sank , and the glacial age begall . In proportion to these oscillations of land and sea was the greater or less degree of cold ; but increased warmth was always the sign of more sea about the pole , or fewer mountains there , or of less sea within the tropics ; while increased cold was always preceded by an elevation of polar land , or an extension of tropical ocean . We will not now discuss the amount of geographical change required by this theory , for it seems as though the next step were properly to inquire whether anything is known of the facts . Theoretically , there is nothing whatever to prevent our assuming in geology very much what we please in regard to the // relative position of land and water , so long as the assumption is carefully confined to the three fourths of the globe now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no such liberty can fairly be taken with the north pole ; and if we are required to believe that in tertiary times there was less land within the arctic circle than now , we have a right to ask that science should go to the arctic circle and prove the fact . We already know something of that region as it appeared in the warm miocene days , when , theoretically , we should suppose it to have been under water . In Greenland , on the Mackenzie , in Spitzbergen , on all sides of the pole , wherever land exists now , land existed then , covered with forests which indicate a wide extent of firm dry ground . These forests were filled with a vegetation common to Europe and America , indicating as clearly as anything in geology can indicate that a close connection by land then existed between the two continents . Where was this lost bridge between Europe and America ? Professor fleer , resting upon the fact that Icelandic fossils do not show the same homogeneity with those of Greenland which those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land connection must have run to the north , or , in other words , that Greenland extended over to Finland , and that a continent existed precisely where according to theory there could not have been any land at all . We need not give absolute faith to fleer 's theory , though it was framed on fair premises , with no reference whatever to the point we are now discussing ; but , apart from this , there is strong reason to suppose that the islands which now exist between the American continent and the pole were in the tertiary age closely connected with each other , with Greenland , with America , and with Spitzbergen and Europe . It may perhaps be argued that there was more land than now north of the equator , within the fortieth parallel , which might account for the increase of heat ; and as it is impossible to deny with certainty any assumption in regard to the bottom of the sea , this explanation is more reasonable than the other . But Sir Charles Lyell has pointed out that this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the very unusual proportion of land , as compared with water , which it // now contains . To assume that it contained still more land in the tertiary period is contrary to the geographical theory itself . Let us carry the argument a little farther . According to theory , it is clear , that , whether there was a polar continent in the tertiary period.or not , there must have been a considerable additional elevation of land within the arctic circle as the glacial age approached , and a corresponding depression within the tropics . So far as the tropics are concerned , we may safely leave the matter to decide itself according to further observation ; but in regard to northern countries , this theory brings us face to face with one of the most inexplicable coincidences that ever perplexed geology . So far from there having been a considerable elevation of land in high latitudes during the glacial period , the plainest proof exists of a remarkable depression beneath the water , not only in the arctic region , where the tertiary deposits are everywhere covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern hemisphere . There is something so strange and contrary to theory in this simultaneous accumulation of ice and water , that an attempt has been made to explain it by inferring the existence of an enormous ice-cap at the pole , which actually disturbed the earth 's equilibrium and made the ocean gravitate towards the frozen mass . Unfortunately , no possible accumulation of ice could alone explain a submergence of fourteen hundred feet , proved by upraised marine shells , in the latitude of Wales . Sir Charles argues in reply , that these cases of depression may have been local and more than counterbalanced by great local elevations , which would raise mountain ranges covered with vast depths of ice and snow . But we can not discover a particle of evidence to justify the assumption that the submergence was local . So far as it is possible to ascertain the geographical conditions o1*a period so obscure , we seem compelled to admit that both the Old World and the New were affected equally and simultaneously by water as well as by ice during the glacial age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the climates of Europe and America then as now , for the range of erratics corresponded in curve with the present isothermal lines . In America , as in Europe , marine shells of the glacial period are commonly confined to // elevations of from one to seven hundred feet above the sea , while erratic blocks and grooved and polished rocks extend to elevations of several thousand , feet . If the isothermal curve was constant , we have a right to infer that the cause which thrust it southward or drew it northward was a general , not a local cause ; and if the phenomena accompanying the submergence of land were identical in Europe and America , the inference that this submergence was local seems to be unwarranted . We will not say that the geographical theory in regard to climatic variations may not be the best solution yet offered of a very difficult problem , but we should be glad to know how it can be made to harmonize with the facts . So far as there is any evidence at hand , both the depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , not local , and took place in an order directly the reverse of that which the theory requires . Although Sir Charles Lyell maintains energetically his own view of the case , supporting it by arguments whose force we do not question , he is far too liberal a writer to reject absolutely any other theory which is based upon probable grounds . For this reason he has devoted a long chapter to the explanation of an agency as yet little understood . We shall not undertake to follow him through the difficult reasoning and calculations of this thirteenth chapter , in which , pursuing suggestions first thrown out by Sir John Herschel , and afterwards elaborated by Mr. James Croll , he shows that astronomical influences may have considerably affected the earth 's climate . Starting from the fact that the earth 's orbit is not constant , but is so acted upon by the planets that during long periods the earth may be drawn no less than 14,500,000 miles farther from the sun than at other periods , Mr. Croll has shown , that , although this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat received each year from the sun , the average quantity varying very slightly at any time , yet it may very seriously affect the distribution of heat . For five thousand years together , the hemisphere which happens to have its winter at the time when the globe is farthest from the sun will lose one-fifth part of the whole amount of winter 's heat , which will be transferred to summer . No one can pretend to say what would be the effect // of making winter one fifth colder and summer one fifth hotter ; but Mr. Croll has suggested that the intense heat of the summer sun , acting upon vast accumulations of winter snow , would create long seasons of fog , clouds , and rain , which might probably reduce the whole average temperature of the year , and check the melting of the ice . Sir Charles furnishes a table , calculated by Messrs . Stone and Oroll , showing the variations in eccentricity of the earth 's orbit for the last million years . During that time there have been four periods when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable of which occurred 850,000 years ago , with an effect calculated as equivalent to the addilion of thirty-six days to the winter of the hemisphere which wintered in aphelion . The mean temperature of the coldest month in the latitude of London was *70 Fahr. ; that of the hottest month was 1260 . Making a deduction from the summer heat on account of clouds and fog , we may easily obtain a climate that would cover England with glaciers . This theory is certainly attractive and perfectly philosophical . Perhaps it may contain the germ of a new geological system , and , when further elaborated , may be found to throw new light upon many difficult points ; but , as it stands , we are obliged to bring against it the same objection we have urged against the geographical theory , that it does not accord with the facts . The present eccentricity of the earth 's orbit is very slight , so that , after admitting the glacial period to have been brought about in the manner described , a still greater difficulty arises in attempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an average degree of heat higher than can be obtained by calculation .. We do not understand how this objection can be met ; but if ever it should be satisfactorily overcome , the glacial theory may be considered as almost complete . Only the recurrence and the effects of these revolutions in the earth 's economy would then remain to be studied , and we venture to think that not a long time could elapse before every geologist would find the basis for a new science in the history of climatic variations . In concluding his chapters upon climate , Sir Charles has used the theory of eccentricity as the foundation for a curious // attempt to calculate the age of organic life . About five per cent of marine shells peculiar to the northern hemisphere have disappeared since the beginning of the glacial period . Assuming the time elapsed as one million years , a complete change in the existing testacea would require twenty million years . The range of our modern shells extends back to early miocene times , and there are twelve such complete cycles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we obtain a rough estimate of 240,000,000 years as the limit of life on the earth ; yet even before this the foraminifer called the Eozo*n Ganadense , a sort of coral-builder , during an indefinite series of ages , built its home and its tomb in the Laurentian limestone of Canada . Sir Charles does not , however , mean his estimate to be taken strictly . He would probably be fully as willing to assume a thousand million of years for the development of organic life as a quarter of that time . Nevertheless we may hope that scientific data for a closer calculation may possibly be discovered , and , were this once effected , that another step would enable science to fix the limits within which species have flourished , and the race of man among the rest may expect to carry on its development . The second great division of Sir Charles 's work embraces the causes which have brought the inorganic world into its present condition . Much that is new in the way of illustration has been added to this portion of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of opinion . We find here still the old division into aqueous and igneous causes of change , with the familiar arguments drawn from the Falls of Niagara , the deltas of the Nile , the Ganges , and the Mississippi , from the slow wearing away of sea-cliffs by waves and tides , from the steady denudation caused by rain , from the local action of glaciers , and from the curious phenomena of springs . Time has not weakened , nor has it , we think , greatly strengthened , the evidence that volcanic activity , apparently fitful and accidental , is really persistent and uniform ; that continents are now rising and falling as they rose and fell in the earth 's earliest period , and that time is the only element needed to explain the operation of igneous forces in past // ages . Nearly one half of the whole work , and certainly its best known and most firmly established half , is devoted to the elaboration of these views in regard to inorganic geology ; but although they excited great interest thirty years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions relate to a subject which is now of only secondary importance . Geology is bearing the fruits predicted by Hutton 's religiou* opponents . It is dealing , for good or evil , with subjects more and more delicate . The attention of science , and of intelligent men , is now no longer concentrated on inorganic forms , on rocks and the arrangement of strata , but on organisms , on life and its manife*stations . We prefer to leave unnoticed all that Sir Charles has added to his chapters on the causes of inorganic change , in order to examine at greater length his opinions on the history of organic life . The same reform which Hutton had attempted to introduce into geology was , at the beginning of the century , attempted for ontology by . Lamarck . As Hutton maintained that there had been no break of continuity in the earth 's economy , but that causes still existing had made the world what we see it , so Lamarck affirmed that there had been no want of continuity in organic existence , but that every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of reproduction from shapes previously existing . The service which Sir Charles Lyell rendered to Dr. Hutton has been rendered to Lamarck by Mr. Darwin . But in referring to the theories of Lamarck and Darwin as one , we speak merely of their common starting-point , transmutation , not of the development which each writer has given to the principle . Mr. Darwin has gained more supporters than Lamarck , because he has pointed out and argued with extraordinary ability an explanation of the phenomena more reasonable than Lamarck 's ; but we doubt whether even Sir Charles Lyell would believe that Lamarck 's decried and ridiculed theory had so closely anticipated Mr. Darwin , had not his own chapter in the " Principles , " written in 1830 , to explain and oppose Lamarck , been still before his eyes . Viewed merely as a question of applying certain realistic // laws of criticism , the two hypotheses of Hutton and Lamarek , of Lyell and Darwin , seem to have an irresistible tendency to march hand in hand , one through the inorganic , the other through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave life to the theory was , that Nature never moved by leaps , but that all her steps would , if properly studied , show a logically rigid sequence . In each case it was insisted that a close study of the existing world was alone necessary to explain the process of its formation . There would have been no reason for surprise , therefore , if Sir Charles Lyell had begun his career by associating the two theories as inseparably connected , the fall of one being fatal to the success of the other . But Sir Charles was not a man to place himself in a position which was then at least untenable , nor to pledge himself to one theoretical opinion merely because it harmonized with another theoretical opinion of his own . Cautious as he always has been in his scientific progress , when , in the earlier editions of the " Principles " he was obliged to meet the question of transmutation , he expressly and even formally avowed his belief that Lamarck was wrong . He repeated this conviction in 1853 . Mr. Darwin* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a new shape . When Sir Charles 's " Antiquity of Man " was published , in 1863 , it was obvious that he no longer adhered to his views of ten years before , and now , in his last publication , he recants his former opinion as formally as he then announced it , and declares his belief that Lamarck was right . When the leading authority in any branch of science announces that the basis upon which one half , and that the most important half , of his science rested , is insecure , and must be removed in order to substitute another , constructed on an opposite principle , the public can not be too cautious in avoiding to take sides in the dispute , nor can it be too rigorous in exacting an explanation of the reasons which have caused such a revolution in opinion . Sir Charles has made no secret of his reasons , which are elaborately explained in the work before us , and we , in our turn , without pretending either to justify or to condemn him , shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusions . // Every one knows , or should know , that all organic forms , whether extinct or existing , are divided , for purposes of classification , into two groups , the one comprising all plants , the other all animals hitherto discovered , - and that these groups in their turn are subdivided , according to established principles , into smaller groups , which again resolve themselves into groups smaller still , until at the bottom of the scale we arrive at the last possible point of systematic distinction . These lowest possible groups are called species , but below these again the physiologist is often able to recognize marked varieties which fade imperceptibly into identity . The starting-point of classification is therefore the species , and every geologist , every physiologist , every individual who reads a page of any scientific work dealing even remotely with theories of organic life , must inevitably be met sooner or later by the inquiry , What is a species ? Few scientific men would to-day venture to risk their reputation by defining absolutely th' meaning of this , the commonest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole question in dispute between the two schools of physiologists depends . The common reader must satisfy himself by considering species to be collections of individuals which reproduce their like by generation , and are averse to sexual union in proportion as they are remote from each other in structure . We are compelled to add , however , that this definition would probably satisfy no scientific physiologist . Excluding microscopic beings , we may assume that there are between one and two millions of species in existence . Yet we are far from suggesting that this estimate , vague though it be , even approaches exactness , or that science is at all more absolute on this point than we have found it to be in dealing with other essential matters . Every physiologist has enjoyed a delicate sense of his own omnipotence over forms which have had the misfortune to be discovered for the first time . He is at liberty to class them as varieties , or to invent for them a new species , according to his individual views of their - and of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly discovered forms that this liberty may e exercised . Man does  --  not know and can not learn whether he is himself one species or // 1868 . The Principles of Geology . a dozen . All the varieties of human beings have usually been classed in one species ; but so great a zo6logist as Professor Agassiz , following out an accepted principle to its strictly logical result , recognizes in the different races of mankind , such as the negro , the Indian , and the European white , the distinctive characteristics of as many true species . In estimating , therefore , the number of known species as between one and two millions , we have no intention of implying that there may not be millions more . Somewhere , however , classification must begin ; and so far as the real difficulty is concerned , if the term species were laid aside , the public would feel a considerable relief . The essential point is to account for distinction at all ; nor is it worth the while of any party to attack or to defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties would , we suppose , be glad to establish , merely in the interests of science , any arbitrary rules of classification by which to recognize species , without prejudice to the true point in dispute ; but the public has no direct concern in so purely scientific an arrangement ; it asks only to know what are the causes of varieties in form , whether specific or generic , or neither the one nor the other . On this subject the difference of opinion has now become irreconcilable ; for , while all the highest authorities in physiology , with but few exceptions , maintain , that , notwithstanding the existence of a limited faculty for self-adaptation in the organism , every separate form has yet its own precise and unvarying boundaries , and had its origin in a distinct , physical , external act of creation , the followers of Lamarck and Darwin affirm no less positively that no such absolute boundaries exist , but that every form of organic life owes its peculiarities of structure to an innate capacity for change . Science has only these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far that it becomes every day more and more difficult for any scientific man to escape committing himself either to the one theory or to the other . When Sir Charles Lyell , in former editions of the " Principles , " rejected the hypothesis of Lamarck , and , following Cuvier and Linn*us , declared his belief that there were limits of variation from original types , beyond which no true species // could pass , he rested mainly upon the assumed fact , that , although experiment proves undeniably the considerable modifications which a short period of domestication may produce in animals or plants , it proves no less clearly that the rate of change is not permanent , and that beyond a certain line there ceases to be any change at all . When man first establishes himself in a wild country , he may find animals which are fearless and incapable of self-protection ; when he has persecuted them for a few generations , they may become cautious , watchful , even cunning ; new instincts may be developed , and pass by inheritance from parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the habits of the species are capable of no further alteration , and it will sooner allow itself to be exterminated than develop new faculties . In the same manner breeders may succeed in obtaining an animal or a plant which differs strikingly from other varieties of its species , but there is a limit to this process . We have succeeded in breeding the race-horse to a high point of speed , but we should probably go on breeding indefinitely without obtaining any proportional increase of speed . The oldest records confirm this view of the limited power of variation in species . Mummies preserved in Egyptian tombs prove that the bull , the dog , the cat , the crocodile , even the wheat which grew on the banks of the Nile more than three thousand years ago , did not merely resemble , but were identical with the species which still exist on the same spot . Assuming , therefore , that species have a real existence in Nature , and that each was endowed at the time of its creation with permanent attributes and organization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of final causes . Since the individuals composing species are averse to sexual union in proportion as they are remote from each other in structure , this aversion must be one of the peculiarities with which species were endowed at the beginning for the purpose of maintaining their distinctness . A hybrid , therefore , the offspring of individuals belonging to separate species , could not be fertile , and accordingly one principal test of species should be hybridity . Finally , Sir Charles was obliged to meet the difficulty which // of all others is most embarrassing to a geologist , and which appears ultimately to have proved the turning-point of his opinions . Even though Lamarck 's transmutation theory be rejected , there remains the curious phenomenon of progressive development to account for , - that successive appearance of organic beings on the earth , in the order of their relative perfection , which is popularly supposed to be one of the most curious discoveries in geological science . Sir Charles boldly denied the fact . He asserted that there existed no argument of much weight to prove that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic forms ; certainly geology furnished no argument whatever in favor of the fancied evolution of one species out of another . Nevertheless it was impossible to doubt that the highest of all beings , man , was of very modern origin , and the antiquity of man was precisely the question with which Sir Charles now undertook to deal . He found all the geological evidence pointing , not to the original creation of man in his highest type , but to the gradual evolution of that type from one less perfect ; man , as Sir Charles found him in caves and gravel-pits , was a step downwards , not a step upwards . Thus he was led back to the theory of progressive development ; and , if determined to preserve his consistency , he must have accepted the doctrine peculiarly disagreeable to his special cast of mind , that the creative energy which shaped the world had not yet ceased to act , and that when active it moved still by leaps , creating new forms at will . In the ninth chapter of the present edition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons on which his opposition to the theory of progressive development was founded ; and although he still thinks that the subject is not altogether clear , and that the fossil testacea , for example , show no such progressive advance in organization as might have been expected , he agrees that there is fair ground for believing the invertebrate animals to have flourished before the vertebrata , and , in the latter class , fish , reptiles , birds , and mammalia to have made their appearance in a chronological order analogous to that in which they would be arranged according to an advancing scale of perfection in their organization . To accept the fact of progressive development was with Sir // Charles only the first step towards Lamarck 's doctrine of transmutation ; but geology , as he had said , furnished no argument in favor of the evolution of one species out of another . It is true that there was nothing in geology to forbid such a belief , and Sir Charles ultimately found in the study of insular floras and faunas a very ingenious line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as positive evidence of transmutation was concerned , geology had nothing to offer . Sir Charles had no choice but to depend upon Mr. Darwin . Having stated , in 1853 , his reasons for rejecting Lamarck 's theory , Sir Charles gives in his present edition the reasons which have led him to change his opinion . Later investiga .. tions , he says , have convinced him that the facts are not what he supposed them to be . He was mistaken in supposing that the limits of variability had ever been reached , or that any peculiarities which actually exist in Nature might not be produced by the process of selection , as the race-horse 's speed was produced , even though there must of course be an ultimate barrier to further progress in any particular direction . The problem to solve was merely whether animals and plants owe their actual forms to slow development , - not whether they can be made to assume peculiarities unknown in fact . Furthermore , it was immaterial to prove that any one shape has been permanent for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for remaining unchanged that is in question , but the capacity for change . In his thirty-sixth chapter Sir Charles offers the evidence which seems to his mind decisive , that the limits of variability in species have never yet been reached . As he quotes the cases from Mr. Darwin 's work , we shall imitate his example to a certain extent , even at the risk of repeating what has become very familiar to persons who feel enough interest in their origin and destiny to give their attention to this question . Every zo*ilogist who attempts to prove the faculty which organisms possess for self-adaptation feels in the depths of his mind a conviction that some particular group of animals or plants is better adapted than any other to furnish the facts required . Mr. Bates , in his delightful book on the natural history of the // Amazons , avows that hi* special weakness is butterflies . Nature , he says , has written on their delicate wings the history and genealogy of the species . Mr. Darwin is perhaps most devoted to pigeons , because the pigeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varieties breed as truly as any true species . Nothing can be more ingenious and pleasing than the train of argument by which he shows the probability that all the one hundred and fifty named races of domestic pigeons are true descendants from one original type , the rock-pigeon ; and we shall sum it up here , since the whole theory of transmutation seems bound in the validity of its results . The rock-pigeon is a bird of a slaty-blue color ; its tail has a terminal dark bar , the bases of the outer feathers being externally edged with white ; its wings have two black bars . Of its supposed descendants , some are white , some black , some spotted with color , some mottled ; the pouter has a longer body , a greater number of sacral and c*udal vertebrae , broader ribs , and larger breast-bone ; the fantail has thirty or forty tailfeathers , instead of twelve or fourteen ; and in some breeds the whole skull differs in outline and proportions . All these one hundred and fifty domestic breeds may be crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object being to prove that all these breeds , with their extraordinary diversities of structure and habits , were only natural varieties from a common stock , he adopted the following process . By a cross between a white fantail and a black barb he obtained a mongrel , in color either black , brown , or mottled . A second mongrel , also mottled or dusky , he obtained by a cross between another black barb and a spot , - a white bird having a red spot on the forehead and a red tail . Coupling these two mongrels , the barb-fantail and the barb-spot , he got a third variety , which proved a bird of as beautiful a blue color , with the white croup , double black wingbar , and barred and white-edged tail-feathers , as any wild rockpigeon . This test of the origin of pigeons was also to a certain extent a test of the well-known principle thus applied , according to which characters which have been in abeyance for many generations in both of the parent stocks may be reproduced . Mr. Darwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the most distinct varieties of our common fowl , and suggests a // wider and more difficult application * the case of the horse . It appears that asses , and especially their foals , have occasionally distinct transverse bars , like those of the zebra , on the leg , and sometimes have the shoulder-stripe also . There is in India a breed of horses always striped in the same way , and examples of this peculiarity have been collected by Mr. Darwin from many breeds of horses all over the world . The mule , or cross between the horse and the ass , is frequently marked like the zebra . The hybrid between a chestnut mare and a male quagga was much more plainly marked than his sire . And , finally , the hybrid between the ass and hemionus , neither parent being striped , had legs , shoulders , and face marked according to the same rule . Hence Mr. Darwin concludes that the horse , ass , hemionus , quagga , and zebra may have a common descent from some animal striped like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Charles of his mistake in assuming , as he had done , that the limits of variability in species had ever been practically reached . The result in regard to hybridity as a natural protection to species was equally little calculated to check the revolution in Sir Charles 's opinions . Although no one disputed the general principle , that , in proportion as animals or plants are remote from each other in structure , they are averse to union , and their offspring tend to sterility , yet in practice it was found that the gradations were so delicate , the greater or less degree of fertility in a hybrid so extremely difficult to ascertain , as compared with the greater or less degree of fertility in a mongrel , in other words , the boundary between species and varieties was on this side so vague and shifting , as not to warrant the establishment of any absolute law . As sterility faded into hybridity , and hybrids faded into mongrels , so the distinctions between genera and species , and between species and varieties , faded into each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of division . Just as the animal and vegetable kingdoms meet at a point which belongs strictly to neither or to both , so there are groups of species too closely allied to admit of any intermediate variety being classed with one rather than with its neighbor . To these arguments in regard to the variability of species // Sir Charles has added another , and we believe that the high English authorities of Mr. Darwin 's school consider this chapter on Insular Floras and Faunas to be the best and most original in the new edition in its bearing on the creation of species by variation . Assuming that the distribution of organic forms on islands remote from continents affords as severe a test as possible for practical application of the theory of natural selection , Sir Charles lays down the principle , that , if this theory be correct , we may depend upon finding , in every island , merely offshoots , more or less varied , from the nearest continental families of plants and animals . If , on the other hand , the theory of special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that islands which enjoy the richest soil , the most varied conditions of height and exposure , and a complete separation from all other land , would be each the field for a large and generous exercise of the highest powers of creation . Either there is something more than an intellectual kinship between the forms of life , - either there is a physical , material bond , without which life is impossible , - or we may expect to find the proof of such material independence on these spots where Nature has been prodigal of her resources . Sir Charles has selected for his purpose the islands with which he is be4 acquainted , the Madeiras and the Canaries . Geologically he believes these groups to have been always in the same insulation as now . Thrown up by volcanic action in the miocene age from the bottom of a deep sea , and surrounded by a zone of ocean nowhere less than a thousand feet deep , they have pursued , during many millions of years , a course of sunny and peaceful development , interrupted at most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems not to have been felt here , for the miocene flora has survived the shock which proved elsewhere so fatal , and no flowering plants of arctic species are found upon the mountains . A few doubtful erratics alone indicate the passage of icebergs . No more favorable spot could be found fom the independent development of organic life . Nevertheless , these islands are no exception to a rule which has been found applicable to all islands , that an affinity can everywhere be traced between insular forms , considered as a // whole , and those of the nearest continent , - a relationship closer than that which connects them with the fauna and flora of remoter regions . Sometimes this affinity becomes identity , as in the British isles , and shows , that , at a period not far remote , the whole area must have been a part of the continent itself . Even now a rise of only five hundred feet would extend the main-land over this whole region . But in proportion as the channels which separate land from land become deeper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in the case of an island like Madagascar , all the species of quadrupeds differ from those on the continent , though nearly all the genei*a are the same , while among the other members of the animal and vegetable kingdoms there is a greater or less degree of resemblance to continental forms , according to the class to which they belong . Beginning with the higher forms of organic life , we learn that there is not a single quadruped of any description , not even a squirrel or a field mouse , peculiar to the Madeiras and the Canaries . With a single exception , there is an entire absence of all indigenous mammalia throughout these islands , which seem so marvellously adapted for their support , and this exception is itself quite as significant as the rule . There is an indigenous bat . We are left , therefore , to assume either that the creative power has acted arbitrarily , refusing to plant the higher forms of life , excepting the bat , on these islands , or that the presence of the bat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in migrating from some neighboring land . In the latter case we are led to a general law in regard to insular floras and faunas , that the extent to which species of mammalia , birds , insects , land-shells , and plants agree with those of other lands will be proportionate to the facilities enjoyed by each class in crossing the ocean . This is , however , one of Mr. Darwin 's laws , with which the theory of special creation can scarcely be made to accord , ' without taking from the latter a great part of its distinctive character , and leaving little more than a mere question of words between the two principles . But if Mr. Darwin 's a priori reasoning would lead us to infer the probable absence of mammalia in such a situation , it // would , on the other hand , require a very great similarity between insular and continental species of birds . In this case , also , the argument appears to hold good . Almost all the birds of Madeira , the Canaries , and the Azores are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As regards insects , however , which enjoy no such wide and independent range of movement , the diversity in species is very great , and not only do many of them , which are wholly unknown to the continent , flourish on the islands , but each group of islands has , in this respect , a fauna of its own , although , with occasional exceptions , the genera still remain common to all . Sir Charles is disposed to suspect many of these peculiar forms of a descent from miocene and pliocene progenitors , and the probability of such a connection is strengthened by the undeniable affinity which the vegetation of these Atlantic islands shows to that of the miocene age . Without the discoveries at Oeningen , and elsewhere , which proved the extraordinary range of the miocene flora throughout the northern hemisphere , one would have inferred from the presence in Madeira of what are now American plants the existence of some recent direct connection between the Atlantic islands and the North American continent . Birds are able to reach remote islands by flight ; insects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by floating wood , possibly , in particular cases , even by gales of wind or ocean currents ; but the climax of difficulty in crossing wide expanses of water falls to the share of land-shells . Yet , if we turn to the land-shells of Great Britain , it will be found that all the British islands , more than two hundred in number , including the Orkneys , the Shetlands , the Hebrides , the Scillies , contain species absolutely the same , and not differing from those of the continent . In Madeira , on the contrary , not only do the shells differ from those found elsewhere , but the different groups of islands are independent of each other to such a degree that Porto Santo and Madeira , only thirty miles apart , have but about twelve per cent of their land-shells in common , and in this small fraction are contained some distinct varieties . Nor is this isolation peculiar to modern times . Fossils prove that the same discordance existed in the pliocene age , only // about eight per cent of the shells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is a difficulty which has not yet been explained , though he does not despair of finding an explanation . Obviously , on his theory , the progenitors of these mollusks must have been brought from some continent , and he may easily assume that such was the case , although he can not prove the mode of transit ; but , granting that the wide channel of more than three hundred miles between Africa and Madeira was no barrier to the passage of shells , it seems impossible to explain why a channel of only thirty miles between Madeira and Porto Santo should have proved a barrier so effectual . On the other hand , it may be maintained that here is evidence in favor of the theory of special creation not a jot less striking than the contrary proof furnished by the absence of mammalia ; although , if this line of reasoning is assumed , it will be necessary to accept the extreme doctrine of an absolute creation from nothing , not merely the intervention of creative power to alter or adapt an existing embryonic shape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the while of any party to maintain the local origin of these common forms of life . Difficult as it may be to explain how the shells were brought from a distant continent without being brought from a neighboring island , it would be still more difficult , in fact it would verge very closely on the ridiculous , to argue that the omnipotent and beneficent creative power was exercised on behalf of certain species of Helix , Bulimus , Pupa , and on their behalf alone . We have endeavored to state as clearly as possible the process of reasoning by which so conservative and so eminent a writer as Sir Charles Lyell has been led to adopt opinions which many excellent men consider revolting . A more tangible objection than this repulsiveness , and one more likely to influence scientific men , is , that Mr. Darwin has , after all , announced only a theory , supported , it is true , by the greatest ingenuity of reasoning and fertility of experiment , but in its nature incapable of proof . We can not but think that Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course has been influenced , not merely by the strength of Mr. Darwin 's argument , // but by the character of the hypothesis opposed to it . There was little in the old system calculated to attract scientific support , so long as zoblogists continued to invoke an apparently arbitrary and supernatural interference , in explanation , not of all variations from established law , but only of such as each individual zo6logist deemed to require explanation ; nor was the development which the theory received in the hands of its great and brilliant supporters of a sort to win the sympathy of a mind so practical as Sir Charles Lyell 's . As we understand the hypothesis of special creation , Sir Charles , in accepting its logical consequences , would have argued , that , if species are each distinct entities , permanent in their nature , precise and unvarying in their boundaries , then each species must have its own type , not merely physical , but ideal , not approximate , but absolute , with which all its varieties and all its functions must harmonize . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a preconceived plan as it exists in the mind of its creator . The organism which is in the act of development moves from step to step ; the acorn becomes the oak , and the embryo the man , through many intermediate stages , each of which makes possible the one that follows ; but the accomplished result is not merely the sum of these intermediate conditions ; its form is regulated by more general and higher relations ; it is perfect only when it has assumed the shape which harmonizes with its type . The crystal is not a mere collection of molecules , nor is its form regulated by the mere evaporation of water . Or , to use a more simple analogy , the watch is not a mere combination of materials ; it is complete only when it has realized the conception of its maker . Organisms in Nature have within themselves a vital force which always strives to realize this conception ; and this vital force is the idea , the type already mentioned , incorporated in the material elements of the organism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its authors rightly , is a logical result of the necessity of explaining the process by which an immaterial creative will impresses itself upon inert matter . We have no intention of questioning the merits of this hypothesis ; but we can easily imagine that to Sir Charles Lyell it must have appeared inadmissible , since // Sir Charles 's whole strength lies in the direction of Realism , While this is essentially an idealistic conception , such as few English minds could grasp at all . To fancy Sir Charles Lyell , of all Englishmen , in the act of grappling the notion of a type controlling an organism , would be an association of ideas so incongruous as to approach annoyingly near the laughable . But there would be no possibility of inducing him to meet the discussion . He would put it aside at once by some such alternative as this : Either the type exists as an external agency , as an entity independent of the organism , or it has no such existence . In the latter case it is superfluous , and I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me impossible , and I do not care to discuss it . If it be true that the physiologist has no choice but to accept either the one or the other of these principles , either the doctrine of Lamarck and Darwin , or that of Von Baer and Agassiz , at all events the same can not be said of the public at large , which is in no way called upon to accept either . While the controversy is still raging , we are bound to consider both theories as in a greater or less degree partial , liable on each side to further development or to absolute refutation . Extremely little is as yet known with certainty on the subject , too little to warrant any unscientific person in becoming a partisan of either opinion , and far too little to justify one party in announcing dogmatic conclusions , or in excommunicating its opponent . Precisely the same phenomena are used on both sides as the basis for arguments diametrically opposed to each other , and considered in each case decisive . Embryology , for example , teaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , that can be called an origin which itself originates in something still more remote . The egg passes into an organ*-ism , the organism becomes more and more complex , and , after a period of longer or shorter duration , the individual is perfected . But in the process of development the embryo passes through the lower forms before assuming the higher . The embryos of mammals can not be distinguished at a certain period of their growth from those of birds , lizards , or snakes , except , perhaps , by their size . All vertebrates have in the embryo fissures on the side of the neck , the rudiments of gills , // though only the lower ones develop these rudiments into functional organs . The frog first develops gills , then the gills are suppressed , and he breathes through lungs . These are the commonest examples of a fundamental rule in embryology , that the special type is always evolved from a more general type . Probably no fact has had more weight than this in support of Lamarck 's doctrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings of birds , and the hands of man , rise from the same fundamental form ? Why must the frog first exist as a fish ? Why must a crustacean , as we are told by Professor Agassiz , pass through an earlier stage of life as a worm , and be transformed into an insect at last ? Why has the human embryo rudimentary gills and a tail ? Why is the special type always evolved from a more general type ? Lamarck replies , that the reason is as self-evident as the fact ; the later form is only a modification of the earlier form ; there is a bond which unites all animals , and this bond is the material connection of descent , extending through hundreds of millions of years , and affected by an infinite variety of conditions , but never interrupted , never arbitrarily interfered with , never losing its material character . While Lamarck and Darwin triumphantly point to this conclusion as the only reasonable and philosophical inference from the premises , their opponents no less energetically and triumphantly call attention to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be , so that the microscope itself can discover no basis for distinction , yet not one animal misses its proper development or grows to be anything other than what it was intended to become . The line of demarcation , apparently so slight as not to be detected by human skill , and , according to Lamarck , so variable as to be the sport of the will , in fact is one more rigid than steel . A bond unites all animals , it is true , in a graduated series , and the special type always am pears to be evolved from the more general type ; but the bond is one of the intellect , not of matter . " It exists in the Mind which made them . As the works of a human intellect are bound together by mental kinship , so are the thoughts of the Creator spiritually united . " // So long as the high authorities of science agree no better than this in regard to the meaning of their own discoveries , the public at . large must be contented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and perhaps patience will be less difficult , though exercised in regard to a subject which involves the fate of all mankind , if it is considered that neither of the two parties which are in such eager dispute has as yet fairly met the problem which is at the bottom of every one 's thought . How is it that the rock-pigeon has bequeathed to one hundred and fifty distinct true races of descendants as many qualities which it did not possess itself ? Here is no special creation , unless special creation and natural or artificial selection are practically the same thing , and the whole dispute a mere question of words . Here Mr. Darwin 's theory explains nothing ; it merely records a fact . We here step beyond the range of science , and begin a hopeless attempt to struggle with first causes . We understand Sir Charles Lyell to guard himself most carefully on this question , as on similar questions in pure geology , from the charge of attempting to deal with theories of a first cause . Mr. Darwin has perhaps given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an actual originating force ; but Sir Charles , as a geologist , deals only with the facts before him . If any one proposed , as any one easily may propose , to him the argument , that , in throwing the qualities of each species back into the organism of a predecessor , he only postpones the evil day , and at the end of all there must at any rate be one act of special creation to account for the lowest possible form of life ,  --  and if one , why not an indefinite number ? - he would reply , that , for his own part , it was personally a matter of indifference to him whether he assumed that the first cause had acted once or ten million times , or was acting without repose . The one hypothesis was no more inconsistent with religion , nor perhaps even with pure reason , than the other . But with him it was the first principle of philosophy to economize forced suppositions . He sought a permanent and natural , not a rare and fortuitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to relieve him from the necessity of invoking special agencies , he would be acting a part not only contrary // to his life-long habits , but thoroughly nuphilosophical , if he persisted in their employment . And if still further pressed as to the first cause of all , he would refuse a categorical answer . If I wished to prove - he would say - that the Italian language grew out of the Latin , and the modern Greek out of classical Greek , would my opponent be thought to have common sense , if he pressed upon me the question how language began , and was there one original tongue or many ? The subject does not belong to my science . To adopt a theory is , however , only a preliminary step , and it only creates surprise in Sir Charles 's case , because men at his age rarely have the intellectual activity to quit the paths in which their minds have so long moved . Now that he has given a formal adherence to Lamarck and Darwin , we have a right to expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such a practical application of their new instrument as , forty years since , he made , with so much success , of the iluttonian theory of the earth ; and should the new doctrine prove itself , we will not say absolutely true , but sufficiently near the truth to be useful , geology ought to profit by it , at least as much as it did by Hutton . From this point of view Sir Charles 's work on the " Antiquity of Man , " though only four years old , is already incomplete , - not so much because of any new discoveries as because its author would probably now deal with his material more boldly , having no longer to prove that man was not of very recent creation , but at once assuming this point , on the theory of transmutation , as a foregone conclusion , and going beyond it . We can not but think that there should be here an admirable opportunity for American geologists and physiologists of the same school to throw a great deal of light upon the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its origin ; for evidently , according to Mr. Darwin , the race has had a development in America not unlike those insular species of plants and animals which Sir Charles describes on the Atlantic islands . On the theory of selection , man was not indigenous in America ; he was not a development of the lower quadrumanous forms peculiar to our country ; and this for several reasons . Our American monkeys are far more widely sepaw // Oct. rated physiologically from Old World monkeys than the Amencan Indian or any other American type of man is separated from the European or Asiatic . If the American Indian were descended from the American monkey , he should have not only nostrils widely separated , but also thirty-six teeth and a prehensile tail . This last peculiarity , which is unknown to the less gifted monkeys of the Old World , is of special importance , because the prehensile tail is more useful than a leg or an arm ; and it is obvious , that , on Mr. Darwin 's principles , a race of men with so useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had enormous advantages over their tailless neighbors . Since no such race exists , we are obliged to grant to the ordinary tailless American a foreign origin . Perhaps as yet no perfectly authenticated evidence of man 's existence in America previous to the glacial period has been discovered , but such evidence is scarcely needed to make the fact highly probable ; for human bones and implements have already been found in caves and glacial drift which leave little doubt of man 's contemporary presence , and it is against all probability that he could have migrated from Asia or Europe over thousands of miles of barren ice and sea during the glacial period itself . A far more reasonable hypothesis is , that man , like the plants and lower animals , flourished during the latter part of the warm tertiary age about the pole , and , like the plants again , was driven southward , and his family divided , by the coming of the glacial winter . Since the day when the last connection was cut by the advancing wilderness of polar ice , man has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest form of which was seen in Mexico and Peru ; and there seems to be nothing violent in supposing that most of the slight differences in shape and color which characterize many North American varieties of Old World species may have been a result of the same process and of the same amount of time . The glacial American ought , therefore , if ever accurately identified , to give us the nearest type of a pliocene , circumpolar race , and beyond this America can throw no light upon the development of mankind . The origin of man will then be placed far back in pliocene times , in order to allow for his extension from a single centre , which , under the Darwinian system , is a // necessity . On the same basis , we must allow at least a miocene emigration to the platyrhine monkey which first came to America with his thirty-six teeth and his prehensile tail , while we must be prepared to find the origin of the monkey tribe itself disappear in the enormous gap which divides the eocene from the cretaceous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our present vague geological knowledge ; for , although no pliocene man has yet been identified , few geologists would care to deny the possibility of his existence , while an eocene monkey not unlike an American type is known to have lived in Switzerland . All that we have assumed is the truth of Lamarck 's hypothesis , a purely scientific matter , about which we shall certainly not venture to express an opinion .
