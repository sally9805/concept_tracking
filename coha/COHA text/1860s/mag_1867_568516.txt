ARTICLE 11. - DIVORCE . PART 11. - DOCTRINE OF DIVORCE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT . NOTHING places in a more striking light the sway of Christ over the mind of the Christian world than the fact that a few hints of his have been enough to turn the opinions and the practice of men into a new channel . This is illustrated by what he says of divorce ; in giving commands concerning which he passes outside of his ordinary line of teaching , and enters into the region of positive external morality , instead of confining his precepts to the regulation of the thoughts and the affections . What he says on this subject is small in compass , it is a moral rule , *nd not a law for a state , it leaves more than one problem to be solved , and yet it has to a great extent controlled Christian law in an important branch of private relations , it has directed the discipline of the Church , it has helped to purify the family , and thus has aided the spread of the Gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when it was made known . We hope to have shown , in our former Article , that the great looseness and corruption , in the marriage relations , of the three nations to whom the world owes most of its progress , called for a reform , that there was need that a higher idea of marriage , a deeper sense of its sanctity should be placed among men , and a community be formed where the practice should be consonant with the idea . This has been done by Christ through his church ; and they who receive him as the Lord from heaven , when they reflect that he is abstinent and reserved on most points of external morality , will admire the wisdom which led him to be outspoken on this . We propose in our present Article to examine his words relating to divorce which are on record , and then to proceed to a consideration of the Apostle Paul 's precepts on the same subject . The passages in the Gospels which bear on the subject of divorce are contained in Matthew v. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2-12 , and Luke xvi. , 18 . The second and third of these // passages were evidently uttered on the same occasion in reply to tempting questions put by Pharisees , and with some differences of importance they have the same strain of thought . The passage in Luke is found in company with verses between which the connexion of thought is hard to be traced , and in an address or reply to the sneers of covetous Pharisees . When we compare this passage with that in the sermon on the mount , the disjointed thoughts in Luke have a light thrown upon them , and appear to be fragments of the same discourse . Without the place in Matthew we could find no law of association in Luke , or at most could only guess at one . But with the help of the first gospel , v. 17 , of Luke , " and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of the law to fail , " occurring as it does in Matthew chap . v. , and being an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a vital union with v. 18 , which treats of divorce . We conclude that they must be brought into hai*rnony , or that Christ repeated his instructions in similar forms on different occasions , in the one case delivering them to the people , in the other to the Pharisees . Which of these harmonizing theories is to be chosen it is not our business here to decide . We assume that our Lord expressed himself at least twice on the subject of divorce , and not once only , for we assume that there was a connected discourse on the mount , and that the words in Matthew v. , 31 , 32 , fit too well into that discourse not to have belonged to it from the first . The principal differences between these places of the gospels are the following : -1 . Matthew in both his passages adds a condition under which divorce is permissible ,  --  " except on the ground of fornication , " " but for fornication , " - while Mark and Luke express a prohibition of divorce which is altogether absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition , being understood of course , did not require to be expressed . But we ought to notice that St. Paul also , when he refers to our Lord 's teaching , inserts no condition whatever . We have then three witnesses to the absence of the condition against one for it , and the conjecture is not altogether improbable that iI* was added for the sake of greater clearness in Matthew , rather than omitted out of brevity by the others as being understood of // itself . Upon the meaning of n*opveic* , and the condition itself , we shall speak hereafter . 2 . Mark has the important addition , " if a woman shall put away her husband and be married to another she committeth adultery . " Now as by Jewish law a woman had no power whatever to put away her husband , this certainly looks like an addition to the original words of Christ , intended for the relations of believers in the heathen countries , where wives could procure divorce as well as husbands . But here again Paul supports Mark in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married I command , yet not I but the Lord , let not the wife be separated from her husband . " What if by the law of Moses the wife could not be active in a case of divorce , we know that this occurred in the family of Herod , and it is likely that Greek or Roman custom may already have begun to creep into Palestine ; at least the license of divorce allowed by the rulers of the world could not have escaped the knowledge of our Lord . Why is it incredible then that he should have contemplated the case of a woman putting away her husband ? 3 . In Matthew xix. our Lord says everything in the presence of the Pharisees . In Mark x. he gives out the principle of the indissolubility of marriage , and then in the hohse expounds the matter further to his disciples . Sonic critics see a mistake or inaccuracy here . If there were any , it must be laid at Matthew 's door , for the words of Mark , " and in the house the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof of fresh clear recollection . But is there anything forced here in the supposition that our Lord went over again to his disciples with what he had said just before , so that there was no need on the part of either evangelist to give an account of the whole conversation . In Matthew the disciples felt perplexed by what he had said , and put him further questions . They would not readily do this before the carping Pharisees and so Mark 's statement that the subject was continued in the house is justifled , and his account of what was said in the house rendered at least probable . having thus discussed the form in which our Lord 's words appear , let us now look at their purpose and their import . here the fir8t thing to be noticed is that our Lord acts the part // not of a civil legislator , but of a supreme moral teacher . He does not establish a law concerning divorce , but declares that the existing code permits certain things which must be condemned as wrong , as violating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral teacher , not to say every moral man , must take the same position in regard to the laws of his country . These may , in fact they must , fail to forbid , even when they do not allow , many things which sound morality condemns . The law is an external , general , coarse , imperfect rule , commanding often what the ethical code requires , and as frequently permitting what that code prohibits . If there were any permissions of the Jewish law which ran counter to true righteousness , if it afforded any facilities for transgression which ought to be cut off , it was the business of Christ to notice them and to animadvert against them . Herein he differs in no respect from any other moral teacher . Nor are these verses touching divorce peculiar in this respect . When he cites the lex talioni8 of the Old Testament , " an eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth , " he tells his hearers that justice as expressed in the law might permit this to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist not evil " was a better law of life , a law necessary for anyone who would be his disciple . Now it might happen , as it has happened , that some of these rules propounded by our Lord would reform and transform legislation . Such , owing to the fact that marriage has most important civil , moral , and religious relations would inevitably be the result of the utterances concerning divorce . Still they are not properly legislation , but they are principles which in lands under a Christian faith must leaven all legislation . Secondly , the tone our Lord uses , and the ground on which he puts his restrictions of divorce , show at once a remarkable depth of thought and the consciousness of an authority such as pertains to a divine messenger . The man who beyond all others was nourished by the scriptures and reverenced the scriptures , criticises a provision of the Mosaic law , and taxes it with imperfection . In so doing he boldly lays down a principle of the utmost importance and of far reaching consequences ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // was rudimentary , transitory , and accomodated to the state of a nation not yet capable of the highest kind of civil polity . There is in his words even the germ of an abolition of the old economy , the beginning of a judgment pronounced against the old rites , in short against the old religion in its external forms ; for if divorce was permitted on account of the hardness of the people 's hearts , why might not the forms of the ceremonial law be accomodated to an early stage of their progress and be unsuitable for a more advanced stage . Thus our Lord without seeming to do so , drove that entering wedge into the law which Paul and his school drove further , until all men saw that it was done away in Christ . Nor is the reason which our Lord gives for his new morality , in the matter of divorce , less remarkable . The freedom allowed by the law , he says , was inconsistent with the true primeval conception of marriage . Law , a patch-work of expedients , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations ,  --  that is to say , there are times , there is a state of feeling , a " hardness of hearts , " which stand in the way of perfect legislation , although the nearer the law approaches to that standard , the greater the proof and the greater the security of the genuine culture of the people . But morality must conform to the true idea , and it is the highest merit of a moral teacher , if he has the idea bright in his own mind and is able to set it forth to his fellow-meut . Christ had this idea . The man who never drew from experience any judgments concerning the human relations of which he here speaks , whose vocation was too high for the entanglements of family life ,  --  he corrects the judgments of men by a reference to the essential nature of marriage ; it is the state of life in which two have become one flesh , it is a state founded by God at the first creation of man , it is therefore a union made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeding to the special rules which our Lord lays down , we remark that he does not side with either of the two schools which then divided opinion among the Jews on the subject of divorce . The doctrines of llillel* of course he utterly discards , but he does not give his adhesion to those of // Shammai any more than in the conversation with the Samaritan woman he pronounces altogether for the Jews against her nation . In fact it is altogether probable that his rule is far stricter than that of the school of Shanimai , and he shows no interest in the explanation of Dent . xxiv. , 1-s , about which the rabbis wrangled . His interest is moral , his views are general and human , not Jewish and Mosaical , while his line of thought must have surprised the tithers of mint , anise , and cummin . What then does he lay down ? His rules may be all coinprised in the following propositions : First , that the man who in conformity with the permission or sufferance of the law puts away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving for the cause of fornication " - and marries another , commits adultery , or as Mark has it , commits adultery " against her , " or to her injury . Second , that the man who thus puts away his wife causes her to commit adultery , that is , by placing it within her power to marry whom she pleases leads her to form an adulterous connexion , inasmuch as she is still his wife in the eye of God . Matthew alone preserves this declaration . Third , that the man who marries her who has thus been put away commits adultery . This rule is contained in both places of Matthew , and in Luke , but not in Mark . Fourth , that the woman who puts away her husband and is married to another commits adultery . As we have already had occasion to say , Mark alone has recorded this declaration , but is sustained by the Apostle Paul . The general principle , serving as the ground-work of all these declarations , is , that legal divorce does not in the view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorize either husband or wife thus separated to marry again , with the single exception that when the divorce occurs on account of a sexual crime the innocent party may without guilt contract a second marriage . In the application of these precepts for the guidance of the church of Christ , it will not be doubted that whatever is said only of the husband may be said ceteri.9 parilnts of the wife also . Had the case of a woman divorcing herself from her // husband never been put on record by Mark , the reason of the rule would have applied equally to her , and the fact that Jewish law never gave the woman the power to commence proceedings in a divorce would have sufficiently accounted for all silence respecting cases of that description . This case is plain enough , but there are questions of some importance and of some difficulty growing out of our Saviour 's words which need to be considered . We notice in the first place the fact that nothing is said o* the remarriage of a party  --  a woman for instance-divorced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued in our country and our time , that inasmuch as the married pair are no longer one flesh after crime , the guilty one is free to marry again , yes , even to marry the tempter or seducer , and that this is no violation of the law of Christ . We admit that Christ observes silence on this point . He could not say that such a guilty author of a divorce committed adultery by marrying again , for she is now free from her husband . But it would have been idle to refer to such a case , for in the first place it had nothing to do with the immediate point on which Christ expresses an opinion , and in the second place such a person would have been punishable by Jewish law with death . To claim for an adulterer and an adulteress the protection of law in a Christian state , so that , when free through their crime from former obligations , they may legally perpetuate a union begun in sin , is truly to put a premium on adultery . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wife , would need only to wait for legal separation to convert incest into legitimate wedlock . Another question of importance relates to the meaning of mopvss'c* in the two passages of Matthew . Is it synonymous with *J*osx* or does it embrace unchaste acts not going to that length ? Can it include acts committed before marriage , or must it be confined to sins which violate the marriage covenant ? Interpreters might be named who have given latitude to the word in one or the other of these respects . In regard to the question of time , it is enough to say that our Saviour 's whole strain of remark assumes that the parties have become one flesh , and that one of them by the violence of crime has // been torn away from the other . lie does not go back of the commencement of marriage to enquire what previous crimes , frauds , deficiencies or closeness of relationship made the union illegitimate ab initio . That he leaves to the civil law . He is not giving a lecture on marriage or making canons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to the termination of a marriage already existing . How then can we conceive him to have referred in his precepts to an antenuptial condition of things . To this which is entirely conclusive , we might add a consideration which is only corroborative and has no independent force of its own , that in corrupt states of society a most alarming license would be given to divorce by making such a precept embrace a whole lifetime , especially if the rule were applied alike to both sexes . The word then relates to what has transpired since marriage . We add that it must refer to some outward act . It can not in its proper sense denote a mere quality , and , if ever used with a breadth of meaniiig to embrace sensual lust , it must be in the company of words which made its sense clear , like " in his heart , " Matthew v. , 28 . It must intend a positive outward act which all would understand to be a violation of the obligations of marriage , a departure in essentials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the omission of the condition in Mark , Luke , and St. Paul 's writings , and its appearance in Matthew alone . It must point to crime wrought by one of the married pair with a third person , not to wanton conduct in which the married pair unite , which might be called impurity , or lewdness , but never *ropvmio* in any proper sense . We have then , in assigning it a meaning , to choose between the narrowest sense in which it is strictly synonymous with adultery , or a broader sense , inclndim*g as well crimes more grave and bestial than adultery , as acts of attempted but interrupted crime . It seems hardly worth our while to decide whether the narrower or wider sense ought to prevail . Many of the best interpreters regard the word as equivalent to the more specific *os*S ( * , and we are willing to accede to their opinion. * * Origen seems to understand it thus , Tom . 14 of his comment on Matthew ( iii. , 322 , 823 , ed . Lommatsch ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) , that Christ allows separation only from the rdpvi* , because she VOOEti*L ra yivor . Basil in his 21st canon // But why should an exception like that in the two passages of Matthew be made , if . iropvsia in the name an adultery , when the latter crime was punishable with death and thus divorce would seem to be superfluous . A conjectural answer might be drawn from the altered circumstances of the Jews in their later times , when intercourse with the more polished heathen , 4 in whose eyes sexual crimes were not very heinous , tended to relax the strictness with which the law was enforced , and when the right of capital punishment was taken away from their courts by the iRomans . But a better solution of the difficulty lies in this , that the husband was not bound , so far as appears , to denounce his guilty wife , but that it was the business of the local police to bring crimes before the local courts  --  the elders or presbytery of the commune-for their adjudicature . Thus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary bill of divorcement , leaving it to common fame to bring the matter before the police *magistrates. * This view of Jewish usage gives a better explanation of Jer. iii. , 8 , than we gave in the last number of the New Englander . God is there spoken of as putting adulterous Israel away , and as giving her a bill of divorce , and if our present explanation is the right one there was no deviation in this from the usage in actual cases of adultery . The husband put away his wife , and on the magistrates devolved the duty of bringing her to justice . With this agrees what is said of Joseph in Matthew i. , 19. lie was a just man , and therefore unwilling that the supposed crime of his be trothed should go unrebuked , and yet being reluctant to expose her , he made up his mind to put her away so as not to attract public notice . Justice was satisfied in his view , so far cited by Suicer , voce w6pvo* , used that word in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a *6pvos . Euthymius in his commentary on Matthew v. , 32 , explains the one word by the other . All the most recent commentators of highest credit do the same . For opinions allowing a wider sense to the word , Tholuck ( Bergpred. ed. 3 , p. 229 ) who himself adheres to the sense which is here defended , and Alford in his note on Matthew v. , 32 , may be consulted . We may add that in Hosea ii. , 3 , where it is said of the wife whom he bought in symbol , " thou shalt not play the harlot , " there is the same substitution of the more general for the more specific term . * Comp . Saalschiitz , chapters 4 and 6 on the judges and the Shoterim. // as lie was concerned , when he abrogated the contract by a private separation. * But there are frightful crimes against nature , odious even to the heathen : supposing these not to be included in the term e*opvncL , will they furnish no ground for divorce ? All that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the penalty for such crimes by Jewish and most other laws , so that the separation would be inevitable ; that our Lord had no occasion to speak of gross crimes of very rare occurrence about which there could be no difference of opinion ; and that if both he and the Pharisees admitted these crimes to be more than adultery , his exception by right reason would include them . There ought to be , however , some reason why *ropva/* , the generic word , is here used instead of the more specific *oiX6fc* . That reason can hardly be the rhetorical one of avoiding the repetition of the same word . Nor can it well be what Tholuck suggests , in his commentary on the sermon on the mount , that the generic word gives more indication of the moral category of the offense . Still less is DeWette 's solution satisfactory " that *oIxei'c. is avoided because the verb * is afterwards used in a wider sense . " Perhaps the explanation may be found in the consideration that as the same offense could be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the other in relation to the paramour , the word was naturally suggested . The one exception made by our Saviour excludes all others , unless it can be shown that they are embraced under the same reason to an equal or greater extent . Meyer and Tholuck therefore justly rebuke DeWette for his loose assertion that in allowing one actual ground of divorce our Lord allowed more than one . The exception , when the indissoluble nature of marriage is the starting point , is of strict interpretation , or else such as all , at the time when it was made , would admit without its being mentioned . And this iemark brings us to the passages in the two other evangelists , and in Paul where no exceptional case is stated . The reason for these unqualified * The notion at one time pretty common that iCKGLOC here means mild , clement , is now nearly exploded. - The betrothed was treated as a wife by the law . Deut. xxii. , 23. // statements of the sacred writers is not-as Meyer well observes - that Christ conceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was established , * but that the two Evangelists and the Apostle regard the exception as a matter of course , and pass it over in silence . This they might well do , if the exception related to so great a crime as adultery , which of itself actually caused the married pair to be no longer one flesh , which violated the idea of marriage . There is nothing in these passages , nor in our Saviour 's principle in regard to marriage , nor in other passages of the New Testament , that can fairly be regarded as forbidding the innocent party , against whom the crime of adultery has been committed , to contract a second marriage . This severe opinion arose in the early church . Augustin advocated it in his treatise de conjuqiis adnUerinis , although in his retractations t this nobly honest man doubts whether he has cleared up the matter in that work . The opinion became current and passed into canonical law . The Council of Trent , in the seventh canon on matrimony , pronounces a curse on him who taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adultery who puts away an adulterous wife and marries another woman , and that the woman commits die same crime who puts away an adulterous husband and marries another man . " But this canon , which rests on a view of marriage not entirely scriptural* receives no sanction from the New Testament . It is most clear that the words " except it be for fornication " ( Matt. xix. , 9 ) allow divor*e in that particular case , and that in the divorce spoken of liberty of remarriage is implied . The question is what must the parties to the conversation have understood by putting away , as our Lord here uses the word . how could they have guessed that he meant separation quoad thorum only , which was not known to the law ? Is it not evident that they were compelled to give that sense to his words which divorce had in the law of Moses * A worthy Catholic scholar , Hug , throws this out , and it would help the absolute indissolubility of marriage according to the view of that church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be for fornication , " in Matt. xix. , is an interpolation . Of this however , although the reading varies , there is no good evidence . f Lib. ii. , chap . 57. // about which they were talking . The permission then to put away a wife in this one case involves a permission of remarriage to the innocent party . After the same analogy the parallel crime of the husband separates the married pair to the same extent , and involves permission of remarriage to the innocent wife . This is generally conceded by those who do not hold with the Catholics that marriage can not in the absolute sense be dissolved by crime . But a difficulty here arises . What sense shall we attach to the word adultery  --  the narrower Jewish sense , or the broader one , which the word now generally carries with it ? Among the Jews the wife and the husband were not on an equality ; the husband might commit whoredom with an unmarried woman without being an adulterer ; the wife was an adulteress when she fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant , had he uttered the words used by Mark ( x. , 12 ) , " and if a woman put away her husband , " with the qualification found in Matthew , " saving for the cause of fornication ? " If *opvricz could mean any lewd conduct inconsistent with being one flesh the case might be clear , but this is , to say the least , doubtful , and we have not been able to admit it . As far then as the use of words is concerned we could not infer that our Lord gave the same liberty of remarriage to the wife thus injured as to the husband similarly wronged . But when we consider that he must have viewed the husband 's crime with an unmarried woman as a great one , as an equal violation of the marriage covenant with the wife 's , as an equa*l breach of the original law or declaration that " they twain shall be one flesh , " which excludes all sexual impurity of both alike with anyone else , we believe that he would have placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of remarriage in that one case to the wronged woman . And yet , in the absence of any words from our Lord , we do not hold this opinion with the same confidence as we hold that the liberty of remarriage for the man , when the woman is the offender , is clearly to be gathered from our Lord 's precepts . But may it not be said with Augustin * that the precept of * De adul. con. , near the beginning . // Paul , " if she depart , let her remain unmarried , " can only be reconciled with the words of our Lord on the supposition that this departure had taken place on the ground of the adultery of her husband . She could then put him away or depart from him , but according to Christian law had no liberty of remarriage ; and she might be reconciled to him so as to live with him again . The same would be true mutatie mutandis of the husband , and thus forgiveness for the highest matrimonial crime would be in accordance with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its genius and its positive rules . Or , to express the argument in a word , Christ allows putting away only on account of adultery . But Paul conceives of a separation of one member of the church from another who is a husband or wife . Therefore this separation muust be on the ground of adultery . But the party leaving the other must remain unmarried . Therefore the man or woman separated from a guilty partner mm*st remain unmarried . The only way of meeting this argument is to deny that separation is understood by Christ and Paul in the same sense and to take the ground that the case of adultery was not before the Apostle 's mind . Christ was arguing with the Pharisees on such divorces as were attended with a licence of marrying again , and denies that any such could take place except in one specific instance . Did Paul draw the rule tighter , and deny that remarriage was lawful even in that specific instance ? Or did he contemplate such separations of an informal sort , begun without even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian Church ? To us it appears that he meant such separations by his word x*r ' *% and he says in effect , if separated let her not commit adultery by marrying again , which she would do if she had left her husband for a cause falling short of adultery . We now pass on to that important passage in the first of Corinthians , where the Apostle Paul handles the subject of divorce . Two cases are here noticed , one for which the Lord had given commandment , where both the parties were Christian believers , and another which had not been provided for by the Saviour 's authority , where one of the parties was an unbeliever . In regard to the first case , the Apostle must refer to the cornmaudment // contained in the extant words of Christ , or to some other of similar import . We have already observed that he coincides with Mark in speaking of a wife divorcing herself from her husband , and with both Mark and Luke in omitting the exception which Matthew twice inserts in his Gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to explain , and the explanation will derive additional weight from a similar omission in iRom. vii. , 2 , where , when it broadly said that the wife is bound by the law to her hnsband as long as he liveth , the Apostle puts out of sight the husband 's freedom of divorcing the wife which the law itself concedes to him . The commandment of Christ is limited , as we conceive , by the Apostle to the case where both partners in the marriage are believers , because only in such a case could it be regarded as the practical law of the household , whatever might be the law of the land , and in such a case its infraction would always fall under the jurisdiction of the church . In the other case one of the parties would profess submission to a commandment to which the other attached no bindincr force . It may be that the b Apostle regarded marriage to be as indissoluble in itself for partners of diverse faith , or even for two heathen , as for two Christian believers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he may have fully received as applicable to marriage in general , and yet there was need of discussing a second case , not because the principle here was different , but because it contained difficulties which needed to be considered by themselves . We must not impute to the Apostle the opinion that Christ 's precept was not as broad as the reasons on which it was based , but the gospel in its spread met persons whose subjective state could not be controlled by the precept : there was need therefore of advice for those whom such persons affected by their conduct . The Apostle 's repetition of the Gospel precept , besides the prohibition there found , contains the decision of a case that may have existed at the very time in the Corinthian Church . Let not the wife separate herself from her husband . But should she even have separated herself-which seems to imply that instances of this kind had occurred and were known to the Apostle ,  --  let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her // husband . Here the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime on the husband 's part , but to dissensions between the married pair . And the Apostle allows the wife who has gone so far-such is the sense of xcd-as even to withdraw from her husband and to live apart , the choice between remaining unmarried and returning , after an amicable settlement of the difficulties , to the former condition . Here the verb denoting separation is somewhat indefinite in its sense . It can denote simple withdrawal from the husband 's house and society without any formal act by which remarriage would be legalized , or it can include the declaration of a purpose of divorce besides . We question whether it means so much as this , although it is used as the equivalent of &amp;p*s . For the Apostle says , " let her be reconciled , " which seems to imply that mere peace between the parties and return to the husband was all that she needed to do , as not having already taken the step of*a legal separation . Yet , on the other hand , the expression , " let her remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracting a legal marriage with another man . But whatever may be thought of this , it is obvious that the Apostle conceives of a state of things in which a woman separated from her husband , and that , it may be , permanently . shall have no right , according to the Lord 's commandment , of marriage with another man . In other words , we have here an actual separation a mensa et tlwro without a separation a vinculo matrimonji . This third state between absolute divorce and the full marriage union has then the sanction of the Apostle ,  --  not of course as something desirable , but probably as a kind of barricade against divorce and a defense of the Saviour ' s commandment . It may be introduced therefore into the law of Christian lands . From cases where both parties were Christian believers the Apostle passes on to'a new kind of cases , doubtless frequent enough , for which Christ had not provided ,  --  those in which one of the parties had received the Gospel , while the other still continued a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's words involve , without expressing fully , the principle that the believing party is not to initiate any steps which will terrninate the marriage union , but must remain passive , while all // active proceedings are expected to emanate from the other side . Thus should the unbelieving husband or wife be content to dwell with the Christian partner , the latter may not put the other away . This is the first case that is noticed and it was doubtless of frequent occurrence . Here Paul meets a feeling to which the new faith itself might give rise . So great was the transition from the foul worship of impure divinities to the faith in Christ and in a God of holiness , that close connexion with a heathen , however ignorantly or innocently begun , might seem unclean and unhallowed . To this he replies , without mentioning the feeling itself , that the heathen partner is hallowed by the believing one , that marriage and the marriage bed preserve their sanctity because one of the parties is a consecrated person . Otherwise the children would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without stopping to discuss the Apostle 's meaning here , it is enough if we say that he draws *a broad line between a family where both parents are heathen and another where one is a Christian . But the heathen , whose husband or wife had become a Christian convert , might be soured or alienated for that very reason , and might insist on terminating the union . The decision in this second case is expressed in these words : " But if the unbelieving depart let him depart . " That is , if he separates himself from his Christian partner ( or is in the act of separating himself , as some explain the tense ) , let him take his course unhindered . A believer has not ( by his profession ) been brought into slavery , is not under bondage in such cases , is not subjected to the obligation of keeping up the marriage relation and of preventing the disruption by active measures of his own . Such bondage would subject the believer to a state of warfare , but God 's call to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the form of peace . And moreover let not the believing party think that he ought to take on him this painful obligation in order to convert the heathen partner . For it is wholly uncertain whether by living with such a partner , when he is bent on separation , any such result will be attained. * * The clause " but God has called US to peace " is difficult . We have given the antithesis , represented by *i , as pointing to a state of strife which Paul only // This is an important passage , as furnishing the authority , if there be any in the scripture , for divorce with remarriage on the ground of desertion . In rendering its meaning , as we have done , we have unavoidably shown a certain amount of bias on that question , because otherwise the connexion of thought could not easily be presented . We will now return on our steps , glancing as briefly as possible at the leadiiig interpretations of ver . 15-16 , then looking again at the connexion , and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be brought into harmony with those of the Lord . The greater part of the commentators , although by no means all , understand o* 6 o6Xto'r*i , " is not under bondage , " to deny the necessity of remaining unmarried , and infer from it the lawfulness of taking another husband or wife under the conditions specified by the Apostle . The Catholic Church , so strict in the matter of divorce , allows , and that in good part on the authority of this passage , both divorce and second marriage to a Christian separated from a heathen by the agency of the latter. * The prevailing view among the Protestants also has drawn a justification of divorce in cases of malicious desertion , hints at , for it seems to us to be implied in the word X***pi*TaL . The expression " in peace , " as the original is literally rendered , many make equivalent with into peace . Winer teaches us that Paul never uses b as equivalent to sir , an ( l explains it " so as to be in peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows him . Harless and Meyer give the solution adopted in our paraphrase . - " God has called us in peace , " i. e . God 's call has come to us in the ethical form of peace . The words " for what knowest thou-whether " were taken by nearly all the older commentators as implying the possibility that by living together with the heathen the Christian might save him or her . It would then be a dissuasive against separation . But logic will not bend to this rendering . WG ought to have for it a different context . It would require TC dle ' instead of ri ycip , and the words scarcely admit of the version " what do you know but that , " or " how do you know that you will not . " For an attempt of Tholuck to defend this way of understanding the interrogation , see his Bergpred. fourth edition , p. 252 . Billroth , Rilekert , Olshausen take it in the same way . It would strengthen our side to follow them , but this seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 7 weigh in opposition . The condition in which the believer actually is , is one of desertion , not one of cohabitation with a husband or wife . Let him or her then remain in this state of desertion . The case is like that mentioned in v. * We may have to revert to this again ; at present it is enough to say that in passages of the Canon Law relating to this subject ( Decret . Grat. ii , Caus. xxviii. , Qu. 2 , C. 2 , and Decretals , iv. , 19 , de divortiis , Cap . 7 ) , this text is cited as the authority . It should be added , however , that the opinion entertained in // whether the guilty party be a heathen or not , from this coniinaudment of the Apostle . To some the bondage which the Apostle speaks of is that of remaining unmarried , or the alternative obligation of either remaining unmarried or being reconciled , so that the duty , where one of the parties is a heathen , is just the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of remarriage as an inference from the scope of the passage , rather than rest it upon any particular expression . And the question may be asked with some force , why , if remarriage is not allowed , does the Apostle consider his commandment to be a new one . Is all the difference between the case in v. 11 , and that in v. 15 , that in the former the separated party must , and in the latter need not be reconciled to the other ? We will first look at the meaning of oO h*o6Xc. *ou . The verb has been compared by some with * which in several places is made use of by the Apostle to denote the marriage bond ( vv. 27 , 39 , iRom. vii. , 2 ) . But in truth there is no connexion between the two words . The one denotes an obligation merely , and the other a severe or painful obligation , an unfree subjection resembling that of slavery . It might without question be used on the proper occasion by an author who wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense would lie not in the word , but in the context . What then is the bondage which the context here points out ? Meyer correctly answers that ob 6r o6Xc. *r*i does not deny the obligation to remain unmarried , as Grotius and others assert , but the necessity of continuing the married state ; and so he remarks that the place gives no express answer to the question whether Paul concedes remarriage to the Christian party . Stanley on the passage remarks in the same strain , " that this is not so much a permission of separation as an assertion that , if on other grounds a separation has taken place , there is no obligation on the Christian partner to insist on a union . " So too DeWette says that " the positive side of this notion i. e. of the notion of separation , viz. : r&amp;marriage is certainly not the ancient church concerning heathen marriage facilitated this allowance of re . marriage , where the parties had been heathen . // brought forward by the Apostle , although it may be supplied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passage from Neander 's commentary on Corinth. vii. , for which our readers , we are sure , will thank us . " Protestant exegesis , " he says , " has understood the Apostle to the effect that in such a case the Christian party would be authorized to enter into a new marriage . But this is not at all contained in the words . The Apostle simply means that in things pertaining to religious conviction no one ought to be the slave of another , that the Christian partner can not be forced to stay with the heathen , if the latter will not allow to the other the exercise of his religions convictions . In such circumstances a separation can be allowed , but of an allowance to contract another marriage there is not a word here said . " And we close our citation of authorities with an extract from Tholuck 's exposition of the Sermon on the Mount . ( p. 233 , 3d ed . ) " The words is not in bondage in such cases , ' " say he , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in verses 10 , 11 , xwPi**Oo* is so used that with it reconciliation is thought of as still possible . " And in the greatly altered 4th edition ( p. 253 ) , he expresses his opinion that " we can not find in the case of malicious desertion so called , which the Apostle adduces , a justification of remarriage . " With this view the Apostle 's reasons agree , and show most clearly that whether he regarded remarriage in such cases as lawful or not , he can here have had no thought of it in his mind . The first of these reasons is that a compulsory cohabitation with an unbeliever who disturbs his partner 's peace is not in accordance with the call of the Gospel . Here then reluctant living with a quarrelsome heathen , not any ultimate step such as remarriage , was in the Apostle 's mind . The other reason is that the probability of converting such a heathen partner , so bent on separation , is not so great as to make remaining with him against his will a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations with the heathen husband or wife is thought of . The Apostle 's mind goes no further than that point , if we have fairly represented his train of thought , and this we have done in harmony with the opinions of the best modern interpreters . The Apostle // then says simply this : if the heathen is fixed on separation , let him take his course . You are permitted to suffer this in order to preserve your peace . You are not bound to stay with him to secure his conversion for this thing . is an uncertain But , it may be asked , why did the Apostle think it worth his while to give a decision in such cases , if the decision amounts only to a license of non-cohabitation , without granting the power of remarriage ? And does not the contrast of the cases in verses 11 and 1* , show that the obligation required in the former verse-either to remain unmarried or to be reconciledhad no existence in the case of which the latter verse treats ; that here , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be reconciled to the infidel partner . To the first of these fair objections we answer that a new case of duty , unknown among the members of a believing community gathered out of the Jews , came up where a church was gathered in gentile lands . Some there were who in their abhorrence of false gods and of idolatrous worship regarded a yet unconverted husband or wife as unclean ; the contamnina. tion spread over the family relations , and a wife , for instance , looked with inward horror on a husband who sacrificed to Zeus or to Aphrodite , although he had been kind to her , and had no thought of separation . Others there were , whose heathen liusbands , after interfering with their dearest rights and hopes , determined to separate from them , but who were morbidly conscientious lest by consenting to such separatiomi they should hinder the conversion of the unbeliever . Was it not well worth the Apostle 's while to tell persons so situated how they ought to act ? To the other objection we answer that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleventh verse can be applied to the fifteenth , unless it can be shown , as we seem to ourselves to have shown , that the context proves the Apostle to have had no thought of remarriage in his mind . To this we may add that there is a certain improbability , inherent in the case itself , that the Apostle would have given such a permission . The word xwPi*s*c* denotes any separation , whether attended with a foi'mual statement of a purpose of // divorce or not , in other words , it includes divorce and desertion . And the exemption from " bondage " began to exist as soon as the separation commenced . Now would the Apostle have given a license greatei* than any law of the loosest Christian State gives , when he must have been cognizant of instances in which husbands or wives , who had thus deserted their partners , had become converts within a few months , and were thus ready to be reconciled and to live in Christian wedlock ? Would he not have added some qualification or advised some delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord and that of the Apostle into harmony , or at least shows that there is no necessary contradiction between them . The Christian wife or husband must accept as a fact what the unbelieving partner has done , but the marriage , so far as the Apostle lets his opinion be known , may still have been indissoluble , and the injured believer must remain in a state of desertion . All other ways of reconciliation , which proceed on the assumption that Paul permitted remarriage , are failures . Will any one say with iDeWette in his Commentary , that both Christ and Paul permit remarriage , when the parties are separated in fact ? But Christ , at the most , only allows it in cases of adultery , and if Paul allows it in other cases he enlarges the rule . To say that Christ , when he said " except on account of fornication , " only gave a sample of several exceptions which he regarded as valid , is to trifle with his words , and to leave the door open for any degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Christ did not have mixed marriages in his mind , but only marriages within his church ? We reply that he laid down a universal rule , and gave a reason of general application for his rule . If those Pharisees whom he addressed in Matthew , chap . xix. , admitted the force of what he said , they would he bound to take it as the rule of their life , even if they could not admit his claims to be the Messiah . Why should the Christian partner in. a marriage be released from obeying a command of his Lord , because the heathen would not submit to it ? Or will it be said that Paul , and perhaps Christ , did not regard heathen marriage as marriage in the pr6per sense , // but only as a kind of contubernium , to which the laws that govern Christian marriage were inapplicable . But the Apostle nowhere indicates that he holds any such opinion . Marriage with a heathen was , indeed , in his view a violation of Christian duty for one who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but marriage contracted in a state of heathenism was a condition in which the heathen was called the husband or wife of the converted partner , in which the Christian was to remain if the heathen did not dissolve the union , in which the unbeliever himself partook of a kind of sanctity and the children were holy . To apply the rules of Ezra 's time to the times of the kingdom of God , to require that the idolater must be separated from the believer in the nearer relations of life was not in a*-cordance with Paul 's strain of thinking . Marriage among the heathen , it is true , was far from conforming to the ideal presented to us in the earlier scriptures , where the man is conceived of as cleaving to his wife so closely as to bring her nearer to him than father or mother , and as becoming one flesh with her . But there was some purity left , there were examples of illustrious conjugal fidelity , and there were vices against marriage that " were not so much as named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell far short of the ideal , so too in a heathen family the parental relation failed to come up to the ideal , and yet the Apostle , without doubt , regarded that as the source of important and permanent obligations ; and if he bade bond servants to treat unbelieving masters with all honor ( 1 Tim . vi. , 1 ) , much more would he have recognized the duties of the natural relation of parent and child . The result then to which this exposition has brought us is that Paul advances beyond our Lord 's position in a single particular ,  --  in conceiving of , and , to a certain degree , authorizing separation without license of remarriage . That he goes so far is clearly shown by v. 11 ; that this leads him into any departure from our Lord 's principles can not , we think , be made to appear . We had hoped to bring into connexion with this exhibition of the scripture doctrine of divorce several other important topics , without consideration of which our essay must remain // incomplete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was null ab initio , the office of the church in divorce , and cases , sometimes of a perplexing nature , which can arise where state law is laxer than the morality of the Bible . But we must defer all this for some future Article , and we hope also to be able to give a brief sketch of the state of opinion and of law in the principal Christian countries touching this important subject .
