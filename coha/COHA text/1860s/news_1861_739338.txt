txt It was supposed by every person connected with this gigantic naval and military expedition to the Southern coast , that to-day would have found us well past Cape Henry , and the prows of the gallant vessels all pointing in the direction of our - destination . The Fates , however , and Gen. Snsauss , have decided that it should be otherwise . I have already informed you of the delay attending the final preparations for departure . The sea ran high the day succeeding our arrival here , and it was impossible to distribute coat and stores . Even after ? the weather favored , and Capt . SAXTON , the Division ** his able assistants , Capts . Hauls. and MILLER , had put their forces energetically to the work , there was , as there always has been , and ever will be where great labor has to be performed , vexatious occurrences which no prudence could have prevented , and annoying contingencies for which none could be prepared ; and not until last evening was everything in readiness . The officers and men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of speedy relief from the state of tedious inaction which always exists on board a crowded ship , when Gen. SHERMAN unexpectedly dampened their gladness by an order directing the disembarkation of the entire force . This order , couched in terse military terms , requiring the men to land in the line of battle , with ammunition and complete equipments , afforded great latitude for conjecture as to its object , and all manner of ridiculous surmises were current . The one most generally received was , that a demonstration would be made upon Sewell 's Point , where a saucy battery belonging to the rebels is erected . The minds of many were prepared to accept this solution of the vexed question , because it had not been altogether unanticipated that the iron-clad Merrimac might at any moment round the sandy promontory , and escape to sea . The battery at the Point commands the channel , and with these guns in possession of our forces the chances of running the blockade in that direction would he materially lessened . I have heard grave fears expressed for the . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Should the rebels be desperate enough for the undertaking . there is no doubt that a vessel such as the Merrimac is said to be could do immense injury to these unprotected transports . What could prevent her coming down some moonlight night and pouring a few broadsides of shells into our midst 1 The vessels are so numerous and close together that the havoc in such a case would be enormous . Of course , the rebel vessel would be speedily overpowered by the sheer weight of numbers , but desperate seep fighting for a desperate cause , might , in the opinion of experienced persons , do much mischief in this way . However , they have seen fit not to trouble us , and their opportunity will have passed away ere this reaches you . These , calculations of the object of the debarkation have all been dispelled by the developments of this morning . Instead of attacking Sewell 's Point , the soldiers are landing among friends on the beach beneath the frowning battlements of Fortress Monroe . Gen. SHERMAN determined upon this step in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy 's shore . The facilities for disembarking are thus made manifest , and the men have the great advantage of practicing the parts they will be called upon to perform upon a more important and vastly more trying occasion . The landing is now in progress , and surf boats , manned by the crews of the ships-of-war and of the transports , each capable of carrying from fifty to one hundred soldiers a trip , are used . The whole day is likely to be consumed by the undertaking , and I doubt whether I can give the result in this letter . I am glad to inform you of the safety of the steamer Ericsson , about which much anxiety was felt . She did not leave Annapolis until 24 hours after the departure of the rest of the fleet , in consequence of a difficulty in getting the li arses pertaining to HAMILTON 'S Battery on board , and on her passage down the Chesapeake her pilot ran her aground on the bar off the mouth of the Potomac . His excuse for the mishap is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed by the rebels , and in this instance the buoy had been removed to a point where there w ere but ten feet of water . The explanation is not received with entire satisfaction by the Captains of the fleet , who say a Chesapeake pilot should know his business better than to be put astray by a change in the position of a channel buoy . The steamer struck when the tide was falling , and had to wait foe high water before she got off , causing a detention of over twelve hours . She reached very near Hampton Roads on Wednesday night , but it was too dark to come by the Horseshoe Shoals , and it was not until yesterday morning that we were rejoiced by the sight of her . I have just learned that Gen. SHERMAN this after noon will transfer his headquarters to the frigate Wabash . He will not take any of his staff with him excepting Capt . PELOUZE , Assistant Adjutant-General ? The Wabash , you know , is flag-ship of the Squadron ' and Commodore DUPONT was anxious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consult upon the weighty affairs which are entrusted to their guidance . An incident , which speaks well for the patriotism and good feeling of the troops stationed at this post , ( Fortress Monroe , ) has been brought to my attention , When this expedition was organized it was believed that fifteen days ' rations would be amply sufficient for the men during their stay upon the transports , and after that quantity had been apportioned , the remainder of the commissariat stores was stowed away in the holds of the vessels , beyond immediate reach . The long detention of the troops on shipboard made it necessary to look to the Commissary of this department for subsistence stores , and he has responded with a willing hand . YesterdayEthe troops of the expedition were all supplied with fresh beef from the Fortress , and the garrison there in conse quence were deprived of it . The circumstance did not excite a murrmir ,  --  the men cheerfully giving the beef , and three cheers with it , to their brother-soldiers , who appreciated the luxury and the instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this among troops are as rare as refreshing . I believe the expedition will certainly leave to-morrow , and , therefore , will be far beyond the reach of harm resulting from the publication of any information I may disclose . Such being the case , I send herewith the order of debarking the forces . The expedition will be under convoy of the naval squadron . The transports will form in three columns in the rear of the naval ships . The first column , composed of the Third Brigade , ( Gen. WRIOLIT 'S , ) will form in line on the right . The sec. and column , consisting of the Second Brigade , ( Gen. STEVEN 'S , ) to which the Third Rhode Island Regiment ( embarked here ) is joined , takes the centre position , and the Third Brigade ( Gen. Vine 's ) is assigned to the post on the left . These three columns will move in parallel lines . Sailing vessels and other craft , unable to keep up with the larger steamships , will be towed by such vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to be made to the enemy 's coast , probably under circumstances requiring the utmost coolness and intrepidity on the part of every officer and man of the command . ( Our correspondent adds the orders that have been issued in regard to the manner of landing on reaching their destination . As these , however , might possibly , if the expedition should be delayed , furnish informa. tion of importance to the enemy , we suppress that portion of his letter. ? Es . TIMES . It was believed by the War Department that there were at least 1,000 slaves , or " contrabands , " at Fortress Monroe , able to perform a certain sort of labor necessary to the accomplishment of the purpose of the expedition  --  such work as throwing up intrenchments and adding to the comfort of the officers . Six hundred of these negroes were to have accompanied us , but there is scarcely that number at the Fortress , and Gen. Woot has plenty of employment for all of them there . We therefore do not take any . I learn that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly successful .
