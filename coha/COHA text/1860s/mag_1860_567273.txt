ARTICLE V.-PROFESSOR LEWIS 'S NEW WORK , " THE DI VINE HUMAN IN THE SCRIPTURES . " like Divine Human in the Scriptures . By TAYLER LEWIS , Union College . New York : Robert Carter &amp; Brothers . Tuis volume , which we are informed in the preface is introductory to a more complete and full discussion of the figurative language of the Bible , is designed to present the views of Prof. Lewis upon the inspiration and authority of the Divine Word . The author is widely known among the scholars of our country for his familiar and profound acquaintance with the languages and the philosophy of classical antiquity , and for the deep interest and the unusual success with which he has prosecuted his inquiries into the habits of thought , and the religious convictions of those early ages . His publication of " Plato against the Atheists " disclosed the depth and extent of his researches into the religious ideas of antiquity , as well as the ability with which he applied the philosophical conceptions of that era to the subsequent forms of skepticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully he had entered into the vague but real beliefs of that remote period in regard to death and a future life . More especially , however , should we refer to his " Six Days of Creation , " as elucidating the breadth of his investigations into the early conceptions of the Hebrew mind in regard to the creation , and the important ideas which in the Bible cluster round the narratix*e of that great event . That work , in consequence of some sharp allusions to modern science and some of its advocates , provoked opposition , and drew upon itself a severity of criticism that prevented its reaching in public estimation the position which , in our opinion , it unquestionably deserves , as a profound , useful , and satisfactory discussion of that great subject . It affords us real pleasure to welcome him again into substantially the same field of thought and argument ; and to introduce // to the notice of our readers his suggestive and valuable work upon the inspiration of the Scriptures . The aim of Professor Lewis to vindicate the claims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , of the nature of inspiration , and next , of some evidences which may be offered for the inspired character of the sacred volume . In respect to the nature of inspiration he maintains a position which is substantially identical with that which prevails throughout New England . The whole Bible he believes to be inspired  --  to possess a character of absolute truth in all that it really afflrms ,  --  through a ceaseless supervision and impulse of the iDivine Spirit , guiding the writers of the Biblical books . The title of the work-The Divine human-indicates the idea which he wishes to present-God speaking through the conceptions , emotions , and language of men ; a true and real union of the mind of God with the human mind in the Scriptures . This conception is strongly distinguished from both of the two theories which are current among the different classes of religious thinkers . One of these , holding a theory of plenary inspiration , seems to deny all true action of the human agents of God 's revelation , and holds all their language to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute truth . The peculiarities of individual writers are ignored and denied the habits of thought of each individual pass for nothing ; expressions and conceptions are not selected by the free working of the inspired mind in its own accustomed ways , as most natural and appropriate to it , but are suggested by the Infinite Wisdom as absolutely conveying the truth . All the language of the Scripture is inspired in precisely the same sense and way ; and all individual peculiarities are lost in the mechanical utterance by the writer , of conceptions not his own . The other class holds up to view the human element , and regards inspiration as the quickening and elevating of a devout soul to high views of truth , and to ennobling conceptions of duty , which it is then left to express in its own way , by its own accustomed imagery and machinery of thought . These two views seem to possess between them the elements of a more comprehensive and complete inspiration than either // of them exclusively maintains ; and this combination of the two opposite schemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former as defective in some important respects . It is no true inspiration of the man . The words he utters are not his own ; the figures of speech which he employs do not express the analogies and images under which he is led to view the truth . He is no otherwise inspired than a bird might be , which should be impelled to utter , without understanding , the articulate sounds of human speech . Though defective in this respect , however , it saves the great and fundamental conception which lies at the bottom of all inspiration ; it authenticates the message as a real communication of truth from God to men . The latter view , on the other hand , while it maintains a real inspiration of the man , is no inspiration of his work ; and leaves his message to his fellow men without any attestation of its accuracy . His description of the vision in which heaven stood open before him , and even his record of observed facts , are prejudiced by all the inaccuracies of his own defective understanding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as embodying a concurrent agency of God and man , in the preparation of that record of truth which should be given to the world as the guide of its faith . The inspired writer is indeed lifted up to behold realities and conceive truths , to which human power could never attain ; but he is not left to his own multiplied errors in the utterance of them . A Divine supervision secures the truthfulness of all his utterances , and makes his communication to mankind a reliable and authentic transcript of the Divine wisdom and the Divine will . Up to this point the conception of inspiration which we have described will probably receive the approval of all discrimninating and devout readers . But our author carries it to even a higher point , to which all may not be quite ready to follow him . He regards the Divine agency as not terminating in such a supervision as shall secure the real accuracy of the message of God , but as itself actively selecting and guiding the expression of it . Not only are the figures of speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divine suggestion , but the language in all its particulars is equally // selected and adjusted with Divine aid and care . All , therefore , carries with it the authority of a Divine sanction . Every mode of representing God through the analogy of human passions and conceptions , is itself sanctioned as embodying the very wisdom of heaven , and as conveying the truth in the highest mode in which the Infinite can express itself by finite forms , or the human mind receive intimation of the Divine . This view Prof. Lewis defends with great vigor and beauty through several chapters of his work , maintaining that we need not fear to admit the anthropopathism of the scheme , since every manifestation of the Infinite in the finite must of necessity possess this character , and the objection , if carried out , would render a revelation impossible . While we should feel some hesitation in adopting the strong language in which he clothes his doctrine , we can not be insensible to the vigor of his defense of it . lie fearlessly carries lip the argument to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of a revelation of the Infinite to man , however such a revelation must take place through finite forms of thought and speech . The discussion is exceedingly suggestive , and brings up many points which will greatly stimulate and expand the views of his readers , impart new confidence to their faith in inspiration , aud increased conviction of the radical weakness of the skeptical theory which rejects it . From this portion of the treatise , which is presented at some length , Prof. Lewis passes to an argument in behalf of the authentic and inspired character of the Scriptures . The transition is made through several chapters of great beauty and power upon the enduring vitality of the Word of God in all ages and against all forms of assault  --  and upon its universal character as adapted for all nations and races of men . This he regards as the great problem of which it is necessary for every skeptical theory to give an account . It is easy to assign the origin of the Bible to fraud or to fanaticism ; but this only brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transient impulses of this kind could have given birth to a system so marvelously enduring , so wondrously adapted to mankind , and so lofty in its moral inculcations as to satisfy all the demands , and surpass all the achievements , // of man 's moral nature under the most favorable circumstances . This course of argument leads to a formal consideration of the theories which have been offered to account for the origin of the Bible ; and here the author enters upon what we regard as the most valuable portion of his work , a discussion of the various hypotheses of the skeptical world to account for that wondrous fact , the Bible . These are all reducible , he observes , to three suppositions , one of which must express the truth . The sacred books must be either : I. Wholly true , an authentic and reliable history written upon adequate data ; or , II . Wholly false , and consciously fraudulent ; or , III . Honestly mistaken  --  a compilation from legend and tradition having a certain basis of truth , but destitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppositions does not clearly distinguish the two forms of skepticism which have played the greatest part in its modern development  --  the rationalistic and the mythical . It is , indeed , difficult for any one to do this completely ; for the theory of mythus , which makes the biblical fact to be wholly a birth of fancy , itself implies a nucleus of fact round which the myths are to crystallize . In order for the Hebrew fancy to shape its myths and legends , there must have been a man whose character and history awoke the conviction that he must be the Messiah diem , around him , it is possible that many of the supposed attributes of the Messiah might cluster . TIme fancy of his Jewish followers might attribute to him such works and such experience as became the predicted Pmince of Israel . Hence the theory which assigns a late origin , and a mythical character , to the Gospels , proceeds on the same basis of fact as that which maintains an origin contemporaneous with the events , and regards those events , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses . Both these theories are in fact discussed , and the falsity of their funda // mental postulates most ably shown , in the argument which Prof. Lewis presents . Between the first and second of the three theories above described , it is now generally conceded that there can be no question . There is no such thing as willful fraud in the Bible . The hypothesis that these books were written with any selfish or sinister aim , is no longer even pretended . This was long a favorite theory of infidelity ; and its advocates wasted much labor in vain attempts to show that the Gospels were devised for the purpose of elevating the authors to power , and accomplishing thus the ambitious and covetous ends of most unscrupulous and wicked men . The impossibility of sustaining this view has long been felt and acknowledged . That out of such low and base aims should come such wealth and profusion of the finest and most dignified forms of character which the earth ever saw-that the very authors of this hypocrisy should have borne themselves more bravely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deepest poverty , than the noblest of other men-that they should have so surpassed in their instructions the highest conceptions which philosophy could reach , insomuch that both theoretically and in practice the science of morals should have taken in their hands a form of holiness which has invested it with a loftiness and glory otherwise unknown among men-all this were inexplicable and incredible . That mere vulgar and sordid fraud should give a new impulse more powerful than any-nay , than allthat had preceded it , to the moral and spiritual life of the world , infidelity itself has not the hardihood to *naintain this . The theory has , therefore , been frankly given up , and the advocates of unbelief have had recourse to one which seems at first sight far more plausible , as it is far less offensive . In this more recent view , it is contended that the evangelical authors were not the fraudulent knaves which infidelity has reproachfully suggested . No ; they were earnest and honest men who really intended to preserve a truthful record of a great and precious history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christ ; there was really such a person . A man of extraordinary dignity of character-of singular force // of will-of high and earnest enthusiasm-of rare moral discernment ,  --  did really appear in their day . His exalted characteristics impressed themselves most powerfully on the public mind of his age . his striking sayings were observed and recorded . The remarkable incidents of his career were written and perpetuated by enthusiastic disciples , whose admiration and attachment exaggerated , multiplied , and transformed all . He saw a pretended case of lameness , a ling mendicant whose pretence of suffering and weakness he at once discerned , and with a kick of honest indignation and contempt bade him " get up and walk . " The detected impostor obeyed and shrunk away ; and the astonished disciples accounted it a very miracle . Here this theory of exaggeration and credulity seems to blend into another . The effort to explain the miracles of the Bible by such influences as supposed all the writers to be mere idiots  --  the shepherds to have mistaken a man with a lantern for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have written the account of the changing of water into wine under the influence of a somewhat free use of time latter fluidthe serious aim to do this became labored , and at length ridiculous . Then a fresh aspect of credibility was given to unbelief by the hypothesis of a late origin of the Gospels ; and the miracles were attributed to the glowing fancy of the Hebrew mind , excited by the appearance of what seemed the long expected Messiah . The early origin of the Gospels was denied ; they were supposed to have originated in a poetic disposition to attribute to Jesus all that the national conception demanded that the Messiah should he . In the course of one or two generations which elapsed before the Bible was written , this ardent imagination had done its work , obscured the simple beauty of the life of Jesus , and converted a warm appreciation of his greatness and worth into a degrading superstition . This theory , a diligent and learned criticism has recently endeavored to substitute , both for the more gross and offensive one which accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defensible one which considers it a stupidity . The more re // fined and scholarly unbelief , which shrank from these coarse imputations , found , in the reckless criticism of the Tubingen School , an effectual and satisfactory substitute . Rationalists , and skeptics , of all diverse classes , sent up their gratulations over Strauss 's life of Christ , in which infidelity , divested of much of its grossness , and clothed in the garb of philosophical and critical science , was enabled to assail on new grounds the faith which had proved so impregnable upon the old . The theory which accounts the Gospels and the Bible a late and fortuitous aggregate of legends , instead of a collection of original and authentic narratives , has been the subject of much recent debate . Even before it had formally been proposed as a complete theory , it had been in effect defeated in advance . Much of the argument which , like that of the Hor* Paulin* , had elucidated the astonishing consistency of the biblical writings , bore with great directness and force upon the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age in which the New Testament appeared , was soon shown to be as hostile as that of our own could be , to such an undiscriminating aggregation of myths and legends . It was an age of high cultivation , with models of elegance that delighted the learned , and with orderly histories and biographies which were familiar even to the common mind . The historical testimony , too , so carefully collected and digested by the great scholars of a century or two ago , to the existence of the books of the New Testament at a very early date-evidence which all our research into antiquity increasingly confirms-renders the later unbelief as indefensible as the former . On all grounds , then , of argument , the theory is fatally assailed ; and nowhere is it able to maintain itself as anything more than a daring and plausible speculation . Several , however , of these methods of argument are , by the recondite character of the inquiries involved in them , almost confined to the learned , and little likely to be appreciated by the mass of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is desirable that the discussion should be carried into ether departments of thought than those of scholastic learning , and elaborate criticism of authorities . Some vigorous // appeal is requisite to the common sense of thoughtful men  --  to the calm and clear judgment of mankind , upon the nature of the theory itself , and the essential character of the books thus criticised . Especially does the public need argument which shall bring to view the spiritual worth of the Bible ; and test this skeptical scheme by the light which the moral elevation and practical power of the Word of God cast upon it . This want Prof. Lewis has endeavored to supply . He has constructed an argument which makes its appeal to the intelligence and the judgment of every one who is willing to think on this great subject ; and has set forth one aspect of the evidence which possesses great power . The theory of which we first spoke , which considers the Bible an imposture , he dismisses as unworthy of serious notice . No earnest and candid mind can find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopting that . The other view remains to be examined-that which holds the Bible to be a collection of legends and mythical fancies , which the wondering credulity of later days has honestly taken for truth , and with pious reverence wrought into their present shape . This hypothesis admits not only the general honesty of the biblical writers , but their integrity of purpose in this particular work . They were indeed more than simply homiest-they were devout believers in all the marvels which they recorded ; and the record itself is the decisive expression and evidence of the state of mind in which it was written . They wrote , in so far as their writings involve any assertions of facts-not only with no intention of falsehood but with extreme simplicity of mindin devout adoration of God 's own presence and immediate power-with a subdued spirit of awe and wonder which magnified and exaggerated ordinary events , but which would not for the world have falsified them  --  and with a devotion to the spiritual interests *f men unsurpassed and unequaled in any other body of men that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The prophcts and evangelists who have left us these volumes , believed , with the utmost sincerity of faith , all that they have here recorded . The very fact that they saw // the hand of God in all around them , and felt the impulse of his spirit within them-in their own conception of the matterassures us of the simple hearted truthfulness in all that they wrote . Now , out of this concession of the honesty of the biblical writers , Prof. Lewis draws an argument for the reality of those supernatural facts which they record . In their own view such phenomena , it is conceded , took place ; subjectively , the supernatural was real ; but if so , then the very nature of their writings shows that there must have been an objective supernatural also . The one is impossible without the other . The proof of this position he finds in the remarkably exact and specific character of the language in which all these phenomena of the supernatural are habitually described in the Bible . They are detailed with the utmost minuteness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctly marked . The attending circumstances are fully described . Now in the legendary style , to which the Bible is by this hypothesis of its late origin assigned , all this detail of events is impossible . The very nature of the theory supposes that the specific character of the events has been lost in the course of years . The legend has been floating about in the oral communications of admiring disciples till , in the frequent transmission of it from one to another , the minute features of the event have been lost . This isdndeed the real and indisputable character of all the legends with which the Bible is cornpared . The Scandinavian legends do not give day and date for the visit of Thor to the land of the Jdtuns ; nor do the adventures of Heracles or Prometheus come within the definite and settled chronology of Greece . The very nature of such mythic narratives repels every attempt at historic accuracy of narrative . They are due only to the imaginations of men . They are , in all the circumstances which make them remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly , facts which were not otherwise astonishing . It is essential to the honest belief of the marvel that its accompanymg details of reality should be left out of view . The Argonautic expedition has none of that minute accuracy which the // chronicle of an eye witness would have possessed . It took place in no definite relation with ascertained historical events . The siege of Troy has no chronological era , nor any definite characteristics of reality in its detail . Some basis of fact there probably was for each of these legends ; but the imagination which has given them their drapery , makes no pretence of clothing them with the characteristics of authentic and precise history . We see at a glance that it were impossible that it should be otherwise . No such historical accuracy of detail is consistent with the wonder-making and imaginative fancy which e imagination , in order has given shape to these leo'ends Th to invest them with this aspect of the marvelous and supernatural , must have scope , must not be confined within the exact limits of fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise verity than a poet could carry on his poem if he had to describe the process , and prove the possibility , of making his hero invisible , by scientific methods . Hence in all such legendary efforts there is an entire forgetfulness , if not a deliberate avoidance , of the historical style . Such events did not take place in any precise year of a well known reign . The moment you come down to such details , the marvel , the wonder out of which the myth grows , is at an end . Now the events of the biblical narratives are given to us in an unparalleled combination of astonishing and supernatural occurrences , with minute accuracy of detail ; and in the fullest chronological sequence with ascertained histoyical events . Errors in chronological reckoning of time there may be , though even these do not greatly mislead us ; but the whole detail of history is there . Instead of the dim and misty aspect which is characteristic of the mythical and legendary style , we have precise announcements of the period of each great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix it to the most deter minate period which the then existing methods of computation would allow . The visions which the prophet saw were in the reigns of such and such kings of Israel and of Judah . Habitnally these writers refer not incidentally alone , but deliberately , and of distinct purpose , to the epochs by which their writings may be identified ; and give the full detail , in historical and // chronological form , of almost every one of the miracles which they so reverently record . These details of time and circumstance furnish to Prof. Lewis a ground of argument which has not before been suggested . He shows that they are utterly inconsistent with the theory of a late and legendary origin . Such details could never have been traditionally handed down . They are at variance irreconcilably , with any theory of such transmission that we can intelligibly form . The sacred books must either have been , therefore , the work of the writers whose names they bear , of authors contemporary with the events which they describe , and writing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming marks of anthenticity were deliberately forged . Such specific records of events do not belong to the mythical and legendary style . No man at a period remote from the events themselves , sitting down to gather the floating rumors which his wondering fancy invests with an awful and supernatural character , could either seek , or find , the historic details which are here so abundantly given . If the narrative were then due to a period so materially subsequent to the events themselves as to allow the requisite scope for the myth o-poietic fancy to exalt and exaggerate common events into miracles , and ordinary men into prodigies of wisdom and sanctity , their whole character would of necessity be different . Everything would be vague and indefinite , and so in some keeping with the mystery and distortion of the events themselves . Hence , the only alternative lies between the anthenticity of biblical narratives , and their forgery . Any honest and credulous exaggeration is out of the question , amid so many details which must either be absolutely true , or else a designed effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is excluded as altogether madmissible . As an illustration of the method of this argument we extract one or two paragraphs upon this statistical character of the Scriptures : " In the very beginning of Genesis , in the very frontispiece you may say of the whole Scriptures , we find this statistical character . And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years , and begat a son in his own likeness , after his image , and called // his name Seth ; and all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years and he died . " . . . " There is the same character , though carried to a still further degree of graphic minuteness , in the account of the Deluge . We have the exact year , the month , the day of the month , when the great rain commenced upon the earth , and Noah went into the Ark . Were ever the Pictorial and the Statistical combined in so life-like a description . " After quoting and commenting upon the whole narrative of this great event , and referring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood , the author continues : " And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year , in the first month , the first day of the month , the waters were dried up from off the earth : and Noah removed the covering of the ark , and looked , and behold , the face of the ground was dry ; and on the second month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , was the earth dried . " " How can any serious soul fail to be struck with this strange combination of the minutely familiar and the inexpressibly sublime ? To think of a man 's delib. erately sitting down thus consciously to forge all this numerical exactness , and yet preserving that other awful feature , so inconsistent with the meanness and littleness of known and intended lying ! For such , if it be not strictly true , must have been the character of this account when first written , unless thus filled in by our supposed compilers . A willful forger , earlier or later , could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untruthfulness of his position . A mere wonder-making traditionist could not have given us the story in a manner so different from that of the early Greek logographer , or Hindoo mythopceist ; the legendary would have manifested itself ; for that art of fictitious writing , which alone could have kept back its untruthful aspect , was not invented until ages after , and has only in the latest times arrived at perfection . Yet nothing in the most modern times , whether fictitious or real , could surpass it in this air of simple verity . We can not avoid being struck with the unpretending calmness , the simple majesty , the utter absence of the swelling , the pretentious , the wondershowing , in a narrative that relates such marvels . " This careful and acute examination of the supernatural events of sacred history , Prof. Lewis carries through a great portion of the Bible , appealing with conclusive force to the candid student of the word of God . He shows that these writings bear , unmistakably , an aspect of entire opposition to the demands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wonder , dwells upon and exaggerates the extraordinary fact , the biblical writers seem almost oblivious of the marvel , in their anxiety to impress the moral lesson of which it was the vehicle to them . They write to give all the prominence possible riot to the grotesque workings of an unrestrained fancy , nor to the impulses of a merely superstitions // awe , but to lessons of truth , of wisdom , and of duty , of which the most astonishing miracles were but the subordinate circumstances . For this end they give all those precise details of the remarkable history which may serve to authenticate it , and thus to secure its acceptance among men ; but they avoid all idle declamation upon the physical wonders which they recount . There is no effort at labored description . Simple , natural touches there are , which are full of life , but no pomp of narration . On the contrary , it is evident that the writers of the Scriptures regarded the miracles which they narrate as of wholly inferior moment , and spend but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description , upon the most signal prodigies which it ever fell to the lot of men to record . Even the intensest sentiment of nationality , the strongest impulses of patriotic pride , are checked and rebuked into utter silence , in recounting such wonders as the plagues of Egypt , the Exodus , the journey through the wilderness , guided by that pillar of cloud and lire which was the token of God 's peculiar presence , the capture of Jericho , the conquest of Canaan , and the whole series of astonishing events which have been in every subsequent age the study and the wonder of mankind . In all these narratives , the character of the description is ever the same , simple , brief , and subdued ; while all the real interest and effort of the writer are bestoxved upon the spiritual truths which he has to disclose , the duties which he is to enforce , and , above all , the God of holiness and majesty , whom it is his grandest privilege and obligation to reveal to men . The rationalistic view derives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the whole of its credibilityfrom its denial , or at least , its oversight , of this important characteristic . Reckless and superficial writers have chosen to confound the evangelists and prophets with those poets and fabulists of antiquity from whom they were separated by the widest distinctions . The superstitious imagination and the poetic fancy of the latter class , have been confounded with the profound wisdom and the literal fact of the former . Worse than this ,  --  though this seems a difference which naught but willful blindness could overlook ,  --  the moral purity and spiritual elevation of God 's messengers have been placed on a level // with the idolatries and impurities of the most degrading superstitions . When a writei ' of this class has succeeded in ignoring all the characteristic and important facts of the biblical history , it is no wonder that he feels prepared to account for the production of the Bible by the ordinary agencies of superstition . Overlooking the authentic character of the biblical style , disregarding the caution , simplicity , and love of truth , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to maintain that they were fond of seeing miracles , and expected to see them ; that miracles , when an anticipated Messiah appeared , were a thing of course . See with what easy confidence a writer of this class can approach the subject , and in all the assurance which self-esteem can entertain of the profoundness of its own insight , dispose , without investigation , of the grandest subject of human concern , and settle , by his mere dictum , a question which the noblest intellects have pondered and discussed with anxious concern . We quote from ilarwood , one of the English followers and expounders of Strauss " Miracles in the life and work of the Messiah ! it was a thing of course . It was all settled long before nny Messiah was born to them . Any Hebrew man could have sketched a life of the Christ , so far as making it miraculous went . It was all in type before ever Jesus of Nazareth came into the world . They knew he was to be a prophet  --  a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the course of nature ,  --  pre-announced by messengers from the sky , or otherwise , miraculously before birth , like other prophets and other children of promise ,  --  Isaac , and Samson , and Samuel . He was to be the Son of David ; that meant that he would come out of the town of Bethlehem , where David was . Like Moses , he would feed his people miraculously in a desert , and walk dryshod through the sea , or on the sea . Like Elisha , he would cleanse the lepers and raise the dead : Like Elisha 's master , he would ascend visibly to heaven . All these things , and many more like them , were settled points before ever Christ came . " * Now , every devout reader of the Scriptures must feel that this flippant assumption that the evangelical writers were a set of superstitious bigots , gaping after the miraculous , and finding it , of course , as a servant girl does ghosts , because she was looking for them , is at variance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The state of mind which // could offer such an explanation of the miracles of the Gospels , can be none other than the very profound of ignorance . Compare with it the simple and honest caution with which miracles were judged by the devout minds of that age . If ever there was a man in whom mere expectation and wonder could breed the easy faith of his own miraculous power , or in whose behalf such power would be likely to be claimed by admiring disciples , it was John the Baptist . Himself the object of a promise which had come down through the ages , and had incorporated itself into the life of his nation ,  --  the child of celestial vision and divine announcement ,  --  the very name he bore given him by an angel of God ,  --  reared in obscurity , " in the deserts , " and nurtured upon these marvels from his youth ,  --  of a fervid and enthusiastic disposition for such things to work upon ,  --  irupelled to declare himself to Israel as the forerunner of the Messiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the multitudes who crowded to his baptism ,  --  if ever there was a man among the chosen messengers of heaven , in whom the preparation of great antecedents , and the expectation of mighty things to come , could beget the conviction of a divine authority , this were he . Yet with what a cautious exactness of fact does the Evangelist record of him the general report of the Jews who came to Jesus ,  --  " John did no miracle , but all things that John spake of this man were true . And many believed on him there . " Prof. Lewis 's application of this method of reasoning is developed through a series of comments , upon the miraculous phenomena of the New Testament which possess very great beauty . The clearness with which lie conceives the rationalistic theory , and the vividness of imagination with which he portrays it , give a charm to many of his passages . Nowhere is that theory presented with greater distinctness or with superior force , in the writings even of its advocates ; while its essential inadequacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes only the more obvious and hopeless with every new illustration of it . Take , for instance , the following argumnent upon the miraculous announcement of the Saviour 's birth . // 1860 . P*i'ofessor i'ayler ' Lewis . " There were Shepherds watching their flocks by night , and discoursing with each other about certain strange rumors that then filled the whole hill country of Judea . ' They had heard the story of Zachariali . They knew the universal expectation in regard to the Son of David , and the universal feeling that his advent was near at hand . Their views of him may have been very erroneous , but their hearts were full of the expected glory . It is strange that they saw a light in the heavens ? Call it fancy if you will , an excited imagination ; we are only arguing here for the subjective truthfulness of the narrative . Is it strange that they heard voices in the air around and above them ? Say if you will that their awed feelings , and their wondrously elated hopes , shaped those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the great , the real wonder . It is the spiritual marvel that throws in the background the physical strangeness . We believe in the miracle , on the ground of the doctrine conveyed ; we find it easy to give credence to an outward supernatural as attested by the sublimity of such a message . It is nothing so strange that shepherds should see lights in the heaven , that they should hear voices in the air ; but such voices , such words , arranged in such a sentence that has not yet ceased , and never will cease , to vibrate on the heart of humanity- ' Behold , I bring you tidings of great joy which shall be to all peoplc ,  --  Glory to God in the highest , on earth peace and good ill toward men . ' . . . . What was there in the common thought of those shepherds , in their culture , in their associations , that should have so shaped the vision , and brought out upon the airy undulations the sublimest collocation of words the world had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond what philosophy had ever conceived , or poetry had ever dreamed ? It drives us to the outward supernatural as the easier explanation of the mystery . Why should there not have been a light from heaven , and a voice from heaven , when such a truth was uttered . " The appeal which this passage makes must be felt to be powerful by every thoughtful mind . Whether we regard this event as the exaggeration of a fact , as having some basis of reality more or less remarkable , or as a purely mythical and poetical conception , the same difficulty presents itself . here was a company of shepherds watching their flocks-or it may be , only the idea of such a thing in the fancy of credulous and superstitious disciples-they heard a heavenly voice and received celestial communications-an announcement of the birth of a Prince and Saviour was made to them-they saw heaven opened , and caught a glimpse of its glories ; nay , they heard its sublime worship , and caught the strain in which a multitude of the heavenly host were pouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was the song which in fancy they heard , or in this conception of men as ignorant as themselves , were supposed to hear ? Was it an utterance of // some one of the narrow superstitions which such minds would be sure to deem appropriate to such an event ? Was it some tribute to their national pride ? Some sanction of their narrow and fanatical forms of thought ? To such things as these their fancy , either then or later , might indeed have prompted ; but anything like this it was not . On the contrary we have here a sentiment which angels might well utter , and God himself might stoop to hear ; a hymn of . praise and joy before which all after ages have stood in reverent wonder and awe , deeming that they too almost caught glimpses of celestial glory , and heard the very music of heaven , in the strain of unequaled loftiness and sweetness which sounds in those simple words ; a strain not only above all fanaticism , but above all philosophy . And what is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Heaven could surpass , ushers into our world ? Some trivial event exalted by the excited expectation of unreflecting minds into an unreal importance soon to pass away ? Nay , it was , indeed , the very life of the world that then and there was born ; that without which human history in every age since is a mere delusion , and which alone gives dignity this day to anything in human society , or the human soul . It will be long before the world can imagine that such fancies as these can give adequate account of the fact that it has now in its bosom so much of heaven . It would afford us pleasure , did our limits allow , to present more ample illustration of the reasoning of Prof. Lewis , but these specimens must suffice . We must refer our readers to the work itself for the full presentation of his views . They will find it rich in suggestions which bear with great force upon the argument in behalf of the authentic and reliable character of the Christian Scriptures . His deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its immeasurable value to mankind , renders him keenly alive to the insufficiency of every attempt to account for its origin by the common agencies of delusion and error in our world . These convictions seem to be strengthened in him by his familiarity with those moral and metaphysical systems of antiquity , which , in even // their highest and noblest forms display so much of the weakness and impotence of the mind , when endeavoring by its own penetration to enter " into that within the vail . " He has seized with great clearness and force that which is the only vindication of the miracles of the Bible . They do in very deed herald a communication from God to man ; they authenticate the very voice of our eternal Creator and Judge . They present a moral system infinitely superior to any conception of man 's highest wisdom . They import into our poor humanity the very life and power of God . The whole argument for the supernatural in the Gospels has its foundation here . If there is indeed in these writings of apostles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory , so much more than man could have imagined of Divine compassion and love ,  --  if their fundamental conception of the Gospel-God in the flesh , to suffer and sympathize with man , to restore him to blessedness by restoring him to holiness , to reconcile his pardon with the demands of a glorious and holy law ,  --  is in sober truth at an infinite remove from man 's loftiest conceptions of duty and l ) lessedness without the Bible , and is known and felt to be so the more , with every accession to the world 's intelligence and refinement ,  --  if these things are real , then indeed there may well have been miracles . No sublime aecompaniments which might authenticate such a communication could well be wanting . Our senses may indeed affirm the orderly progress of natural events on all the common occasions of life ; but if heaven has indeed so stooped to earth as to impart something of its own dignity , and blessedness , and purity to man , then every argument against the credibility of miracles is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of events in such a case ; such as reason would expect to find , and such as philosophy must rejoice to accept . There can be no real contradiction of our knowledge , even though the senses should be confounded by a departure from all the commonly observed sequences of events . Nor need we be anxious when we are remninded of the fact that alleged miracles of similar kinds have attended the birth of all the world 's systems of superstition . It is indeed so ; but the analogy fails in its grandest // point ,  --  in a point so great as to be decisive of the whole controversy . Other systems have been attended with pretended miracles , but all that those systems taught was a pretense also . They were false , gross , impure , superstitions ; and we know , with the most assured certainty , that no voice of God could have revealed those delusions , no interposing hand of the Almighty could have given attestation of their truth . But the miracles of Christianity authenticate to man a system of profoundest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which no revelation that we can imagine God to make , could by any possibility surpass . Here we reach up to the Infinite , and find even that awful glory brought into fellowship with ourselves . If we find that which these miracles attest , to be the very life of God in the soul of man , they shall not be incredible to the child which learns in them to see the hand , and hear the voice , of the Eternal Father . There are , of course , some portions of Prof. Lewis 's work by which we are less favorably impressed . Such , for example , is that in which he suggests that our Lord 's walking upon the sea may have been a habitual thing ,  --  the outward and harmonious expression of an inward state of spiritual exaltation . We love , on the contrary , to view the miracles of our Saviour as definite attestations to men of His Divine authority , and as never exerted save for purposes of the highest benevolence and wisdom . But these passages are unimportant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructive character of this work will secure for the author the thanks of many , and will lead them to expect with high interest his subsequent discussions of the Bible
