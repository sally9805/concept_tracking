A large Glade.  --  On the left and in the background , the Forest .  --  Groups of the Work-people of the Plantation , in holiday dress , are gathered here and there , some chatting , some dancing , others engaged in athletic games . Parties of people are still entering from the right .  --  In the foreground , towards the left , is a group of men , among whom are Melas , Boaz and Pyrrhus . Milo lies on the grass near them . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Two days ! two holidays ! MELAS . Melas Two happy days ! PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus To dance and sing ! BOAZ . Boaz To exhort and pray ! MILO . Milo To sleep in ! PYRRHUS .

Pyrrhus What is the time ? BOAZ . Boaz Not six yet . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Almost six ! We lose our day . MILO . Milo We lose our night , you mean . We might have stayed another hour asleep . To-day ' s our own ! PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus To-day and all to-morrow ! MILO . Milo But ' t is good napping here upon the grass , In the mild morning sunshine ,  --  even better Than under cover . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus But our songs and laughter , Our merry dances , Father ' Zekiel 's preaching , How will these suit with sleep ? MILO . Milo Oh , bravely , friend ! My ears stand open , though my eyes be shut . My soul shall dance and sing and shout with you , While the contented body takes its rest . MELAS . Melas Be happy your own way . To-day is free . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus To-day and all to-morrow . MILO . Milo But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'll meet it when it comes , And live through it as through so many others . BOAZ . Boaz You 'll live through it ! Ungrateful that you are ! With such a master , a true gentleman , That lives and lets live ! This is all the thanks You give for two whole days of idleness : Only to grumble that they have an end ! Shame ! Shame ! PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Yes , shame , to spend our time in prosing ! What shall we do ? How shall our mirth begin ? Women enter ; among them , Flora , Chloe , Bella , and Roxana , who is followed by Daffy . They place themselves in the centre of the foreground . The men suspend their conversation to observe them . Philip enters , approaches the foreground , and looks on with an air of superiority . BELLA , Bella to Flora . How gay you are ! Where did these roses come from ? I thought mine pretty ; but they 're only real ones . FLORA . Flora Where all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first ball-dress she had was trimmed with them . I dressed her ; and how beautiful she looked ! Poor dress ! it was so fresh that night ! so lovely ! And last year , when we took it from the drawer , It was all changed and flimsy with the damp . BOAZ , Boaz who has been gradually drawing near them . Yes , thus it is , my friends , with earthly pleasures : A moment fresh and bright , then dull and faded . CHLOE . Chloe You , Boaz ? Ah , how true ! These idle girls , With their gay talk of balls and dress and ribbons , Turn off the thoughts from death and sacred things . How is it , Boaz ? When I hear the preacher Discourse and pray , my soul belongs to heaven ; I feel myself already fit to fly . But afterwards , when I have left the meeting , Though I would hold me in a state of grace , The banjo 's twang or a rose-colored ribbon Calls down my heart and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the nature of the female heart , That lightly sways to this or that attraction . CHLOE . Chloe What shall we do , then ? If it is our nature  --  BOAZ . Boaz Be not cast down ; for it will be considered . Wisdom and strength have not been made your portion . But therefore should each feeble female mind Choose for itself a wise and strong director . Those prone to temporal follies should choose one That has the gift of preaching and expounding ; So that by words both in and out of season Their souls may still be lifted and sustained . CHLOE . Chloe How well he talks ! what precious words of wisdom ! How did you come by so much learning , Boaz ? ROXANA , Roxana looking at Flora 's dress . It 's well ; it 's well . You 're right to love Miss Helen . But my Miss Emma had a bigger fortune . FLORA . Flora You love the mistress as I love Miss Helen . ROXANA . Roxana Love her ? and who should love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when , a little frightened child , She stood alone there in her father 's house . The nurse that brought her must not stay with her , For fear the thought of home should stay there too , The home that she was sick for , the old home . And was n't it to me she used to tell How much her sister was more like a mother Than her own father was a father to her ? When did Miss Helen do as much by you ? Then , when her sister and her sister 's all Went down at sea , who was it fretted with her , And sat up nights , and told her all the wrong Sure to be done to poor unmothered girls ? When did you ever that much for Miss Helen ? And now , who is it that she listens to  --  FLORA , Flora smiling . Hecate ? ROXANA , Roxana disdainfully . You do n't know what you 're saying . Hecate ! How much some people see ! FLORA . Flora Who 's that ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wood ?  --  Theresa enters by a path through the wood on the left . It is  --  it must be  --  yes , it is Theresa ! CHLOE . Chloe On holidays she has n't shown herself E'er since her son became a runaway . FLORA . Flora She gathers flowers . What should she do with flowers ? DAFFY . Daffy A runaway ? What did he run away for ? ROXANA . Roxana Oh , nonsense ! nothing !  --  To Flora and Chloe . Talk of something else . ' T is ill to say such things before the children . Bad acts are catching . Who knows what might happen ? FLORA . Flora Do you think he 'd never hear it but from her ? PHILIP , Philip coming forward . What are you talking of ? Theresa 's son ? I know the most about it . I was there . DAFFY . Daffy How was it ? Tell ! Melas , Pyrrhus , and Milo join the group in the centre of the foreground . PHILIP . Philip Well , you all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and proudest Of all that walked the earth : proud of her beauty , Proud of her manners , prouder of her voice , Proudest of all of her one child , her boy . Well , I 'll not say but that she had some reason : Now that he 's dead and gone , I think she had .  --  Our master 's youngest sister , when she married , Took that boy off with her to her plantation : ' T was great promotion for him , that it was ! He was to be her coachman . He was dressed Like any gentleman , and hardly had A thing to do but go out on the carriage . He was n't old enough , they thought , to drive : He was but sixteen , though he looked like twenty . Well , whether ' t was the Devil tempted him , Or whether ' t was the pride his mother gave him ,  --  At any rate , one morning he was missing . At first no one believed ' t was so ; but soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! " So went the word . It was not long in doing .  --  Our master was there then , and I was with him .  --  They came up with him in an open space Between two woods , just as it might be here . He would not yield till they had fired three times ; Nor then . But when he fell all faint with bleeding , They tied him on a horse to take him home . He did n't get there ,  --  died upon the way . We scooped a hole out for him in the swamp And laid him in . DAFFY . Daffy In his fine clothes ? PHILIP . Philip No , no ! The boy left all his handsome things behind him , He wore the dress of a field-hand . He bought it , No doubt , with money got from visitors . He was a handy lad , and his good manners And cleverness brought him in many presents . That helped to turn his head . MELAS . Melas Yes , that and reading . BOAZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . There are heads , As you must know , are strong enough to bear it . But he was young and light . PHILIP . Philip Well , there he lies , Theresa 's pride and darling ! FLORA . Flora Hush ! she comes ! No ,  --  she has stopped . She does not seem to know Where she is going . CHLOE . Chloe She ca n't know , indeed ! ' T is the last place where I should think to see her . FLORA . Flora Ah , but to-day ! She always loved Miss Helen . CHLOE . Chloe Well , then , she 'd better show her love to her , And keep within to-day . That face of hers Would change a wedding to a funeral . ROXANA . Roxana Ah , poor Theresa ! ' T was another story In times that I remember ! Once we thought It was no holiday , if she were wanting . PHILIP . Philip Nor only we . For even when the mistress Had company , Theresa sang to them . ROXANA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languages . She had been by and heard the music-lessons The foreign master gave to Miss Lucretia ; And such a gift she had , that girl , from Nature , That all she heard she could at once repeat , Only more perfect and more beautiful . PHILIP . Philip The mistress said that she had never heard At any theatre or opera-house A voice like hers . FLORA . Flora I can remember it . When quite a child , I used to hear her sing . It seemed to me as if the heavens opened And her song bore me upward on its wings . What would I give to hear that voice once more ! DAFFY . Daffy But I have never heard it . How long is it Since she gave up her singing ? ROXANA . Roxana Since the day She heard that news . ' T is now about twelve years . MELAS . Melas Twelve years ? So long ? How did the mistress take it ? ROXANA . Roxana Hard at the first . To hear Theresa sing Had been her greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , when one song ended , Would quickly say , " Again !  --  again !  --  another ! " CHLOE . Chloe Oh , my poor mistress ! what a loss it was ! ROXANA . Roxana Her time hung heavy . I have seen her shed Tears , speaking of that girl 's ingratitude . They tried all means to move her stubbornness . Nothing would do , and she was let alone . She does her work as she was used to do ,  --  Knits and embroiders ; sing she ca n't , or will not . FLORA . Flora See her , poor thing ! see how she ties up nosegays , And lets them drop , and then begins again ! Now she stands wondering at herself .  --  Theresa !  --  She comes towards us ! She is really coming ! If she would sing ! Perhaps , if we should ask her  --  This day , this happy day  --  ROXANA . Roxana What ! do for you What even the mistress could not win from her ? FLORA . Flora Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear us . We have no power to order ; we but beg . Theresa comes near . Her face is wan , but has the remains of great beauty ; her look is vague and abstracted , but at moments has in it something tender and beseeching . ROXANA . Roxana Good-morning ! We are glad  --  FLORA . Flora To see you here . Theresa dear , we were just speaking of you . THERESA . Theresa You might have chosen better . FLORA . Flora We were saying What pleasure it would give us on this day To hear the voice we used to love so much . THERESA . Theresa That voice ! Ah , when you hear it , dread its tones ! When the dumb speak , it is a time of danger . FLORA . Flora Those heavenly tones can only promise good . THERESA . Theresa You know not what you ask . You will not hear them . FLORA . Flora Oh , dear Theresa , why , then , are you here ? THERESA . Theresa Ah , why , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fitting time for me . Something has happened ,  --  some calamity . Is there a corpse for me to help lay out ? FLORA . Flora Wake up , Theresa ! No ,  --  you dream . Wake up ! This is the happiest day in all the year . Your dreams are black , but they are morning dreams , And go by contraries . Miss Helen comes ! She comes to us for the first time to-day Since she was married ! Think , then , what a pleasure ! Here we shall see her , and shall see the child , Our little master that will be one day ! Come , then , one song , Theresa ! just one song ! Do n't look so frozen and so straight before you ! Wake up ! look at us ! Dear Theresa , once ! All , All pressing round Theresa . Yes , dear Theresa , only once ! one song ! THERESA . Theresa Thanks ! thanks ! But leave me where I am , good friends ! She looks round upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her voice is at first low and tremulous , but comes out at last clear and full , with a touch of wildness . Seek not in me what I have been ! The days are vanished long When my soul drew the sunshine in , And breathed it back in song . Then was no need to ask my lay , I poured it like the bird ; My heart within kept holiday , And sang , though no man heard . The form that led your dance and mirth Is gathered to the past : That step no longer treads the earth , Those lips have smiled their last . The sleepers underneath the ground In their still bed are blest : There are , who , with the living found , Know death without its rest . I do not ask God 's curse on those Who wrought this utter woe ; I grudge them not the heart 's repose They could not let me know . But ask me not to share again Their sorrow or their weal ! These bring me neither joy nor pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in its despair , My mind unfaded keeps : That burial without a prayer ! That grave where no one weeps ! Theresa goes . The others remain a few moments silent , watching her until she disappears in the forest . CHLOE , Chloe to Flora . What have you done , unlucky girl ! That song ! And that must be the first we hear to-day ! ' T will bring no blessing on the baby 's cradle . I must go off . The day is spoiled for me . It seems as if a cloud had hid the sun . FLORA . Flora No ,  --  stay ! See there ! it shines as bright as ever . I , too , felt chilled and stunned ; but now ' t is past . CHLOE . Chloe Well , take your mirth out . I will go and pray . FLORA . Flora Oh , what a pity ! What did bring her here ? And what could make me urge her so to sing ?  --  To Chloe , who is going slowly away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come back ! CHLOE , Chloe returning . Only to please you , then . My heart 's not here . FLORA . Flora Oh , here comes Sordel !  --  To Sordel , who enters . Have you something new ? You look as if you had a song to sing us . ' T will not be gay , I know ,  --  it never is ,  --  But only gently sad : that does no harm . Your mournful lays I can support ;  --  but hers ! SORDEL . Sordel Whose , then ? FLORA . Flora Oh , do not ask ! Begin and sing . We had expected you . We all are met On purpose here . We like your songs the best . ALL . All A song ! a song ! FLORA . Flora Soft , sweet , and not too sad ! SORDEL Sordel sings , accompanying himself on a kind of rude guitar . She went , my life 's one treasure ; She will not come again ! She went to ease and pleasure : I stayed to toil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dark , sullen , rude ,  --  and she ! No , they could not have let her Belong to one like me ! And yet not to me only Love this delusion brought . Oh , how my life were lonely , If not for that one thought ! In vain the wealth and splendor ! Those soft eyes watch and pine . I feel their long gaze render The love , the grief in mine . In vain the proud caressing She dares not quite gainsay Her hand returns the pressing Of a hand that 's far away ! They applaud . Sordel withdraws , and , seating himself under a tree , tunes his instrument . VOICES , Voices in another part of the glade , shout . He comes ! he comes ! Ezekiel the preacher ! Ezekiel enters by a path through the forest , on the left . PHILIP . Philip Ezekiel here ? How will that please the master ? Preacher Ezekiel is n't too well looked on . Who bade him here ? PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus He was n't bidden ; he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How else could he Have known that we had holiday to-day ? Had you the master 's leave ? PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus He did n't forbid it . He knows on holidays we must have preaching . PHILIP . Philip Yes , but Ezekiel ! MELAS . Melas Oh , he 'll overlook it . PHILIP . Philip I do n't know that ! PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Why , he 's too good a master To be hard on us only for a sermon . ROXANA Roxana He 's not of those that go against religion . PHILIP . Philip He does n't object to it in moderation . BOAZ . Boaz Ah , but Ezekiel is not orthodox . I will myself expound a little later : I have not been moved yet . PYRRHUS , Pyrrhus laughing . We 're not impatient . MELAS , Melas to Pyrrhus . No , as you say , he is too good a master To grudge us the salvation of our souls . MILO . Milo He knows , when we are working out salvation , We only do our other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a better world in prospect Is the more easily content in this . BOAZ . Boaz Yes , he 's a good man and a wise , our master . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus He chooses the best way to keep us faithful . He has no need to make himself uneasy As to our hearing this or that . He knows What we dread most is being sent away . MILO . Milo Our dreading it may n't hinder it from coming To some of us , some day ! PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Well , leave that now . What will come will come . We 'll not borrow trouble . Ezekiel advances slowly , frequently stopped by persons who go out from the different groups to speak to him . He is a tall , well-proportioned man , very black , with finely formed head and regular features . He is distinctly seen , for he towers above the others . A little behind him comes Turpin , a man of middle height , slender , of pale complexion , with black beard and curling black hair . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defiance , displaced now by one of reckless jollity , now of cynical disdain , as he exchanges jests and sarcasms with the gay groups among whom he passes . MELAS . Melas Here is the preacher ! Listen , he is speaking ! ROXANA . Roxana Ah , we lost that ! But he is coming nearer . MILO . Milo He comes too soon . We have not had our fun out . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Oh , he will let us dance . He is not Michael . MILO . Milo No , but he is another of the same . CHLOE . Chloe He will not let us murder our own souls : That were poor kindness , Father Michael tells us . MELAS . Melas But Michael speaks in anger ,  --  he in love . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus If he forbid us to enjoy ourselves , I sha n't know what to think . He looks so mild , Perhaps he will not . As they speak , they go a little way to meet Ezekiel . He returns their salutations with dignity and kindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gather round to listen to him . He speaks without effort , but in a voice so clear and full that he is heard by all . EZEKIEL . Ezekiel I forbid you nothing . The grant or the denial of your hearts Must be your guide . If these speak not for God , Vain to perform , and vainer to abstain ! MELAS . Melas Do you condemn us ? EZEKIEL . Ezekiel God forbid , my brother ! My mission is to win you back to Eden , Not to repel you with a flaming sword . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus We want to come to heaven , if we can ; But here we have one day of pleasure sure . If we lose this , and yet get nothing for it ! MILO . Milo How can we know , that , even if we get there , It wo n't be there the same almost as here ? We are poor ignorant and simple creatures , And , as we die , so we wake up again . Will not the great , the learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than we ? What pleasure shall we have to sit in heaven , And be forever there , as here , the lowest ? Dorcas enters : a small , meagre , brown woman , with wrinkled skin , and large black eyes , whose common expression is that of craft and restless suspicion , but which at times kindle with a wild gleam . She stands listening somewhat apart from the rest , who do not notice her . MELAS . Melas Preacher Ezekiel , I have had that thought More times than once . How , if we must wake up The same we fell asleep , shall we be able To hold our heads up , when we get to heaven , Among so many great and learned people ? I think much on the other world ; I long To have my portion there among the good . But will it , can it , be a heaven to me , Where there 's a higher and lower , as there is here ? EZEKIEL . Ezekiel There is a higher and lower ; yet not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know not The last shall there be first , the first be last ? Those who have suffered most shall know most joy , Who have borne most reproach be most exalted . You never heard that tale in Scripture told , How ' t was with Dives in the other world ,  --  The proud rich man , who in his earthly life Had never known what hunger was nor thirst ? MILO . Milo I do n't know that I recollect that story . BOAZ . Boaz Not know that story ? Oh , what ignorance ! EZEKIEL . Ezekiel You never heard of Dives , the rich man ,  --  How splendidly he lived , how high he feasted ? VOICES . Voices We 've heard of him . But tell ! tell all about him ! EZEKIEL . Ezekiel His spacious halls , even in summer heats , Were cool and fresh , with their white marble floors , Their dripping fountains of sweet-perfumed water , And spreading fans , that , hung on golden cords , And gently moved by hands of unseen slaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soft and silk-hung bed received him . Sweet music cheated to the light repose That was a pleasure only , not a want . How rich his table was I need not tell you ,  --  What meats , what sugared dishes , and what wines ,  --  Wines cooled with ice brilliant and hard as diamonds ! When he had guests ,  --  and that was every day , And once a week at least a splendid banquet ,  --  They never ate off anything but gold ; And each guest had a servant to himself , That stood behind his chair and helped but him . Dives , be sure , had troops on troops of servants . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Oh , but what luck to have had such a master ! EZEKIEL . Ezekiel Well , the time came that he must leave all this . He went to sleep one night in his cool room , Slaves fanned him , music lulled him , all as usual . He had not said his prayers : of that be certain . What should be pray for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I said ; but suddenly He finds himself out of his costly bed , Out of his splendid room , and through the air Whirling away . " Oh , what a dream ! " he thinks ; " If I could only wake ! " But on he whirls Swift as a musket-ball , until , at last , Giddy and breathless , he brings up in hell . He did n't know ' t was hell at first : or rather , He did n't know ' t by name ; he felt what ' t was . A glare , as of ten thousand thousand torches , Struck on his eyes ; in vain he held them shut ; The glare was there within as ' t was without . He saw no sun nor blaze the light could come from ; It seemed the air itself was all aglow . Then came the little creeping , unseen flames , Wound themselves round him , twining up and up , Till the whole surface of his naked soul Was wreathed with fire , that like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but without consuming . VOICES Voices interrupt , chanting . Oh , dreadful land ! ' T is easier here to bear The hottest torments of the noontide glare ! OTHER VOICES . Other Voices Oh , let us suffer here , so that we come not there ! EZEKIEL . Ezekiel When he could see about him in that blaze , He looked from side to side to seek for help ; And presently , one after one , appeared Friends he had seen , with splendid funerals , Borne to lie down to rest in marble tombs . They looked at him , but did not say him welcome . Then he remembered all that had been told him Of death and of the reckoning after death . He knew that he was dead and was in hell . Lifting his eyes up then in his despair , He saw far off , lying in cool , blue space , The happy habitations of the chosen . To the soul 's senses distance is no hindrance . It was so far that in a thousand years A bird could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed to hear the waving trees , The gentle murmur of the silver waters , The music toning from the heavenly harps . He saw the blessed walking in white raiment ; He saw how kind they smiled upon each other , Like loving brothers in their father 's house . VOICES Voices break in . When shall we come to thee , O land of bliss ? OTHER VOICES . Other Voices To win that lovely world , well may we pine in this ! EZEKIEL . Ezekiel But all the faces there were strange to him : In vain he sought some old friend or relation , That might be brought to speak a word for him ; Until , at last , searching with desperate eyes , He found a face to which memory answered , " Yes ! "  --  But where beheld , at first it could not tell him . Slowly the where , the when , came back to him . That face , so beautiful , so still , so noble , Was it the face of the despisd beggar , Whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he passed out his gate In his carriage , mornings ? It was Lazarus ! This was a poor old man who 'd been a servant ; But whether ' t was with Dives or another , I did not rightly hear , and can not tell you . BOAZ , Boaz aside . He can not read ! He 's only heard ! I thought so ! A pretty fellow he to be a preacher ! EZEKIEL . Ezekiel But he had been a servant , and a good one . If he could but have kept off growing old , He would have done so , for his master 's sake . But the strong limbs grew feeble , the quick hands Awkward and slow ; and so a younger man Must do his work ; there was no place for him . His master then gave him his liberty . VOICES . Voices Gave him his liberty ? Ah , that was hard ! EZEKIEL . Ezekiel A year or two he just got work enough To keep along ; but soon no one would hire him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeble ; He got more blows than coppers or than food . When strength was none and work was none , he sat him Down on a stone not far from Dives ' gate , And waited that the scornful passers-by Should throw him now and then a bit of money . There all day long he sat ; sometimes he got one , And some days none ; but never a kind word Nor a kind look was his , by any chance : Only the dogs sometimes made friends with him . He was translated on the very night That Dives left his soft and curtained bed For the last time . The old man had that day Received no alms . He stretched his feeble body , When the night fell , upon the cold , hard stone , But his soul raised itself to God in prayer . Grateful he prayed , with heart o'erflowed with love . He thanked his Maker for the inward light That overpowered the outward gloom ,  --  for strength Divinely sent , which made the body 's weakness Appear no evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more his soul strove up to God , Sudden it seemed to disengage itself : It rose , it soared , it found itself in heaven !  --  This was the face that Dives knew again : " Lazarus himself ! " he said ; and then he wished That the last time he passed the beggar by He ' d happened to have given him a cent . Too late for that ! But still , when he considered What honor it would be for Lazarus To do a favor to a man like him , He thought he ' d risk the making a request . So , for the first time , he sent up a prayer : He begged that Lazarus might come to him And bring him down only a drop of water To cool his tongue . Oh , but his thirst was fearful ! Soon as the wish was thought , ' t was heard in heaven , And back the answer came as swift again : " Thou hadst thy good things in the earthly life , And Lazarus his evil . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Thou canst not come to him , nor he to thee ! " FLORA . Flora Ah , me ! I almost fear we are too happy ! DORCAS , Dorcas chuckling to herself . He that when here would not have looked at water !  --  That 's what Ezekiel 's preaching is ! It suits me ! MILO . Milo We shall be first there ! ' T do n't seem possible ! ROXANA . Roxana Ah , that 's a comfortable Scripture doctrine ! TURPIN . Turpin What fun it must have been to that old fellow ! If I could but look down from Paradise , And hear my master bawling up from Tophet , " A glass of water , boy ! " I 'd give up dancing And drinking , and I 'd just stick close to praying Through my whole life , if it could come to that . To see him shake his fists and rage and tear , While I sit solemn there and look at him , Safe out of reach ! Ah , that would pay him off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of our people , But you have been let come to share our pleasure ; And this is all your gratitude ! For shame ! TURPIN . Turpin I was n't let come ; I 've got to pay for it . I was sent on errand to another place , But made off here instead . The punishment , I dare say , would have caught me all the same For something else that was n't better worth it . DORCAS , Dorcas still standing apart . And those who take their vengeance in this world , Will they enjoy it in the next again ? If not , I 've overreached myself . No , no ! A bird in the hand ! Dorcas , when you saw her Set up for sale on the same block with you , You had your heaven , if you ne'er have another ! FLORA . Flora I ca n't but think ' t was hard on Lazarus , Though that old master had been no good man , Not to be able just to comfort him With one poor drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely , though , they did n't let Lazarus hear him . If it were possible  --  of course it is not  --  But just suppose that I could be in heaven , And poor Miss Helen pining down  --  below there ; If she signed to me for a glass of water , I 'd give it her , though I lost heaven for it . MELAS . Melas The Scripture saith that hardly shall a rich man Enter the kingdom . What rich men will be there ? EZEKIEL . Ezekiel There will be those that have been poor in spirit , Remaining God 's true children , not disowning Their brotherhood with any He hath made . There will be those that in this life have borne An aching heart beneath the costly dress . For there are found , even in stately houses , Those that are brought to God through suffering : I 've seen such near , and looked upon their lives .

But wisdom ? learning ? that is something else . BOAZ , Boaz consequentially . Wisdom and learning ,  --  yes , that 's different . MELAS . Melas We are so ignorant , alas , and simple ! EZEKIEL . Ezekiel Simple indeed ! Why , wisdom , earthly wisdom , Is the last wealth a man can take to heaven : More cumbersome it is than bags of gold . Has not Christ said , " Become as little children , Or else you can not enter " ? Said not Paul , " He who is wise with earthly wisdom must Become a fool , if he would be a Christian ? " I tell you , children , if you miss of heaven , ' T is not your ignorance will keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefers , And what respect He has for human learning ? Inquire where Christ was born , and what his breeding . Who were his learned tutors ? In what college Got he the wisdom that redeemed the world ? He might have had his choice ; he might have come As the most rich and learned of the earth , And so have had the great men and the wise men All following him , proud to be his disciples . That might have tempted one of us , not him . He chose to come and be a carpenter ,  --  A carpenter ,  --  why , just as I 'm a blacksmith ! A carpenter , just like your Pyrrhus there ! And when the time came to go out and preach , Whom did he choose to aid him in his work ? Who were they whom they call the Twelve Apostles ? There was n't a gentleman among them all !

I like genteeler preaching . Goes . CHLOE . Chloe Really , I 'd rather they 'd been gentlemen ! EZEKIEL , Ezekiel after a pause . Let us not ask about the fate of others . To their own master let them stand or fall . We have our own salvation to work out .  --  Pauses again , then proceeds . Yes , let the rich and mighty have their kingdom , The kingdom of this earth .

But we , whose way tends through the weary waste , Beyond whose sands lies our appointed home , Shall we stay dallying with the shining pebbles That haply here and there may strew our path , And lose from sight the sunlit mountain-tops , From thought the happy , cool , embosomed valleys , The shadowing trees , the springs of living water ?

From that blest land Celestial eyes are watching your approach . Follow with resolute step your dreary path . With steadfast courage meet the demon hosts That bar your passage to your promised home . Unmarked on earth these mean defeats and triumphs ; But there , with each reverse a shadow falls Over the brightness of angelic faces , Each victory wakes in heaven one joy the more !

And there you all are to receive your portions , Which you may either carry to your cabins , Or else bring here and have a general feast . To each man will be given a double portion ; Women will have a portion and a half ; The men to have a share of spirits beside . The people gather round Ezekiel . MILO .

Melas To all temptation you are deaf and blind . EZEKIEL . Ezekiel I was not once ; but , by God 's grace , I 've conquered . They go slowly , Flora stooping from time to time to gather flowers . Dorcas remains standing in her former position , her eyes fixed on Ezekiel , who continues speaking to himself . And yet not wholly . I have still my combats ,  --  No longer of the flesh , but of the spirit . Oh , if warm prayers and resolute self-denial Were all God asked for in return for heaven , Then were it easy ; but the lowly mind , The soft forgiving spirit , how win these ? Love to my God , love to the good I feel ; But the unjust , the cruel , and the base , Before I recollect that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brain . No outward act , no outward word betrays it ; But God has seen it . Did I wrong , just now , To grant a half-permission to the people To cheat themselves awhile with these false pleasures ? I fear I erred in this . Alas ! my heart Is weaker to these children than myself . But if I erred , so is not theirs the error , Not theirs the atonement . Let a double fast , Let work continued through the hours of rest , Atone my fault . So will my master gain . I can not love him , but can toil for him As if I did . But , O deceitful heart , Thou dost betray thyself ! The heaviest penance I give myself is to do him a pleasure ?  --  Dorcas approaches slowly . It is that wandering-witted woman , Dorcas ! What can she want with me ? DORCAS , Dorcas aside . He does not know me , Or thinks that I 've forgotten . And I had .

What if I told him all ? Vengeance at least we might enjoy together .  --  To Ezekiel . Ezekiel , you 're a powerful man in speech . ' T is the first time I 've heard you give a sermon . These foolish people all bepraised you so , I thought ' t was something else . If I had known Page 46 What people meant by comfort in religion , I would have sought it sooner . EZEKIEL . Ezekiel Not too late At the eleventh hour to come to God . DORCAS . Dorcas That 's not the tone I want to hear . Just now I saw a keen light flashing from your eye That had more warmth in it than these prim words . And when you told us about that old beggar , How his heart crowed when he looked down from heaven , And saw his master getting his deserts ! EZEKIEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you speak . DORCAS . Dorcas Either you said so , or you let us feel so . My memory is not great for holding words ; I only take the spirit . I do n't know The sense of half I hear , but what I feel I ca n't mistake in . EZEKIEL , Ezekiel aside . What a sharp reproach This woman brings me ! God ! and is it so ? Can , then , the hidden , the unconscious feelings Impart themselves ? Can our words take from these A meaning that we had not thought to give them ? Oh , wretched man , the curse still cleaves to thee !  --  To Dorcas . Is it not rather thy unwholesome heart That changed the words of health to words of poison ? DORCAS . Dorcas It might have been so ,  --  it might well have been so ; But it was not . Thou bear'st in thee unslaked A thirst that I have known , that I have quenched ,  --  Yet not entirely . Have I read thee well ? Know'st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madness give such power To read in the heart what the owner does not see there ? God ! what a hell wakes in me at her words ! Is it a fiend sent from the abyss to tempt me ? A moment since I almost triumphed . Never Stood I so near the victory , so near heaven . And now !  --  To Dorcas . What brings you here to me , strange woman ? DORCAS . Dorcas I came for what I see you will not give me : I came for comfort , hope . I 've reached my ends . But life is short , and mine draws near its close . I 've but one thing to lose , in losing it ,  --  The joy of looking on a sated vengeance . For thirty years I 've feasted on this joy ,  --  And now to die ! To give up breathing , moving , Oh , that were nothing ! But to give up hating ! Hating with a secure , triumphant hate ! That thought weighs on me , when I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell me ,  --  you are a preacher and must know ,  --  Can we beyond the grave enjoy our vengeance ? What must we do to earn the right to this ? EZEKIEL , Ezekiel with effort . Woman , this dreadful hope I can not give you . With thoughts of vengeance we come not to heaven . Oh , strive to gain another heart ! DORCAS . Dorcas Be silent ! Tell what I ask , or do not speak at all ! I do not want another heart . My own Is good enough for all I ask of it . What use to me a heart that knew to love ? I 've nothing left to love ! This stuff to me ! EZEKIEL , Ezekiel aside . Nothing to love ! I will have patience with her .  --  Aloud . How ! hast thou nothing left to love ? No children ? No brothers ? sisters ? But perhaps thou art Not of this country ? DORCAS . Dorcas No ,  --  I am from Cuba . EZEKIEL , Ezekiel aside . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  To Dorcas . You know the Spanish tongue ? DORCAS . Dorcas I knew it once , But have forgotten it . For thirty years And more I have not heard the Spanish spoken . EZEKIEL . Ezekiel For forty years I have not heard it spoken ,  --  Aside . Or only in my dreams . DORCAS . Dorcas You have forgot it ? EZEKIEL , Ezekiel aside . Forgot the tongue in which she spoke , we spoke ?  --  To Dorcas . This is but idle talk . Unhappy woman , How gladly would I do thee good ! but not As thou hadst hoped . DORCAS . Dorcas No other way ! To take Away from me the only good I have Is not to do me good . If in your heaven There is no place for hate , there 's none for me ! I 'll take my chance and go without religion . I thought you might have taught one I could learn . As pay , I would have shared my wealth with you . But since ' t is so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EZEKIEL . Ezekiel Poor crazd thing , how gladly would I save her ! Alas , I am more like to lose myself ! The work of forty years undone at once !  --  What form flits by ? what tones are in my ears ? Oh , what a spell there was in that word , Cuba ! She moves before me , that wild , graceful creature , With her fantastic gayety , sweet sadness , Her bursts of passion ravishing and fearful ! For she , like me , was nearer Africa Than are the most . Our mothers saw the light First underneath those glowing skies . Our blood Is tempered only by a single mixture . But while I bore upon my bronzd face The signs that marked me of my mother country , She wore the impress only on her soul : Her features , skin , were of her father 's race .  --  Oh , vanish , beautiful and fearful vision ! Back to the grave where thou hast slept till now ! Moulder where moulder youth and joy and hope ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  O God ! thou know'st how I have wished to serve thee ! How striven to come to thee by prayer and penance ! Cast me not off ! deny me not thy grace ! Help me to battle these invading demons !  --  The help comes not . The tempest is not laid . I feel that heaven is shut against my prayer . That prayer itself , perhaps , is a transgression , Coming from this perturbed , disallowed heart . O heart , that didst believe thyself His temple , How art thou desolate , thou God-abandoned ! SCENE II . A large room , with windows opening on a long portico , whose columns are wreathed with vines . Stanley and Hermann are seated near one of the windows , engaged in conversation . Emma reclines on a sofa . Near her stands a table , on which is a large vase of white flowers . The room is profusely decorated with flowers . A little slave-girl stands near Emma , employed in fanning her . The child lets the fan sink , and turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ! A storm is coming on ! Where is your fan ? The thing is half asleep ; Or else her wits are out upon the green . There , lay it down , and go and join the rest .  --  The child goes . ' T is strange how fond these people are of dancing ! They really have more pleasures far than we . HERMANN , Hermann to Emma . They have less thought . Thought is the foe of pleasure . STANLEY , Stanley aside . If Emma 's pleasure had no other foe ! EMMA , Emma looking at her watch . Not nine o'clock yet ! Where is Bella ? Gone Off with the rest , no doubt . Give them but dancing , They forget everything . The only person That can amuse me now is little Bella . ' T is true she never will know how to sing Like  --  Was not that the sound of distant thunder ? She starts up . STANLEY , Stanley going to the window . Not yet ,  --  not yet . The clouds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it will only wait a few hours more , It may come on and welcome . EMMA . Emma Do not say it ! STANLEY . Stanley When we have once our Helen safely housed , The storm may burst . In fact , we need the rain . EMMA . Emma Then let us have the rain without the storm . HERMANN . Hermann It is not often that our wish is granted In the same measure or in the same manner As our mind imaged its fulfilment . STANLEY . Stanley I Have but one wish in life and one in death : That I might have my Helen 's blessed presence While my term holds , and that her loving accents May be the latest tones that reach my ear ! EMMA , Emma aside . I never saw my husband look so pious ! ' T was almost like a prayer ! HERMANN , Hermann aside . In this connection This solemn wish ! The Gods avert the omen !  --  To Stanley . Upon a prayer so pure and so restricted Heaven could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better To let the eternal circles hold their way , Nor make them swerve by vow or prayer of ours . STANLEY , Stanley in his ordinary tone . For me , I think I shall not claim much merit For my forbearance . HERMANN . Hermann Ah , the human will , Borne upward on the wings of faith and longing , Has mighty power . But the audacious effort Is often punished by its own success . The compelled Destinies avenge constraint .  --  checking himself . These are not topics for this happy day . I am to blame . I know not what came on me . STANLEY . Stanley Your serious mood gained me . How is it , Doctor ? You are more grave to-day and more sententious Than even your wont . And yet you , too , love Helen . You , too , look forward to her coming back  --  HERMANN , Hermann warmly . As to the coming back of spring . ' T is true . Whate'er my heart has left of soft and loving Belongs to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to converse in dumb show . EMMA , Emma aside . But to her father ? And her mother , then ? The mother has a right to love the best ! ' T is strange ,  --  they make no more account of me Than if I were not ! Am I , then , a cipher ?  --  With a more animated expression . I love her ! She is beautiful , my child ! And yet  --  and yet  --  how is it ? In my heart There is a sore place somewhere . Oh , what is it ? Why can not I feel all the joy that they do ? Where is the glow , the longing of a mother That listens for the footstep of her child ? My husband 's eye has an unusual brightness ; His voice is lower , and his tones more feeling Than commonly . And even the old Doctor Has something tender on his rugged features . How cold my heart is to my only child ! What damps it so ? ' T is this depressing climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North be ? My feelings once gushed out so warm , so lively ! My sister-mother , and my real sister , My darling Agatha ! I had no need To chide myself for want of love to you ! When little Agatha and I were playmates , How soft my heart was ! with what tenderness Did it give back the love that all things offered ! Now , dull and weak , it has no quickened throb Even at the coming of my own , own daughter ! Could I but love ! could I but love as once ! HERMANN , Hermann to Stanley . ' T was in this room that I first made acquaintance With my young pupil . With dejected heart I came to you that morning ,  --  broken in hope As well as fortune , brought by force to lay All my aspirings down and toil for bread . I thought it shame ,  --  I , not without a name Among the learned of the elder world ,  --  I , who once thought my brain should influence The interests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girl her A , B , C. STANLEY . Stanley It was a waste of power . I felt it was . HERMANN . Hermann I have long ceased to think it such . The man Who in this world of error and delusion Has found one unwarped mind , one candid heart , Has not been luckless . His life is not wasted , If he have had this mind , this heart to train . And if his conscience tell him he has left it In its first candor , has but aided it In its expansion , not controlled or moulded , Content to furnish fitting nourishment And watch unfold the perfect human flower ,  --  He may forgive himself for many errors , Forgive the world for many disappointments . STANLEY . Stanley Doctor , the obligations we are under To you , for all that you have done for Helen , Are not to be expressed . You know we feel them . HERMANN . Hermann The obligations ! Do not use that word ,  --  Else I , too , must begin acknowledgments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition  --  not the least of these  --  Of the poor exile 's claims upon respect ; The confidence ; the full appreciation Of my endeavors , of my system ; the  --  Perhaps you will permit me to say  --  friendship Which for so many years has honored me . STANLEY , courteously , but with a slight shade of condescension , not , however , perceived by the Doctor , who is occupied with his own thoughts . The friendship of a man like you is honor . With genuine warmth . And one who is what you are to my Helen Claims not regard alone , but gratitude . HERMANN . Hermann In my new office I did have some merit ,  --  I 'll not deny it . A laborious pedant ,  --  Professor in a University , A German University ,  --  encased In triple armor of scholastic learning , I laid the cumbrous load at Nature 's feet , Confessed myself her subject , humbled me To be companion of a little child ,  --  Learning of her more , daily , than I taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laud me More for this modesty , this power to value My life 's toil at t is worth , than for the works That gave me fame once , or those other writings That set a state on fire  --  phosphoric fire , That glowed and startled , and then faded out  --  And won for me the questionable glories Of obscure martyrdom . The hardest chains To break are those of prejudice and custom ; And when our pride has interest to maintain them , We seldom even try their strength : we wear them As if they simply were restraints of duty , And it were sacrilege to find them heavy . Here is the great support of useless learning : That man the best years of whose life were given To arid studies , whose impulsive youth , Whose vigorous manhood , has restrained its soarings , Compressed its energies , to gain one end , Will loathly own that end not worth attaining , Even to himself ,  --  above all , when he sees Less favored crowds with envying admiration Revere his inappreciable merits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dr. Hermann continue to talk in dumb show . EMMA , Emma aside . How sky and trees and flowers looked kindly on me ! The winds , the birds , even the humming insects , Had something for me loving in their tones . I live in a changed world : the glow , the beauty , The friendliness have passed away and left it Drear and unfeeling . It is not in me , This change ; else why this thirst to love , This craving for the ample interchange Of gushing , warm , unforced , unbound affection ? STANLEY , Stanley to Hermann . ' T is safe for you to scoff at scholarship . A less learned man could not presume to do it . HERMANN . Hermann Men covet what they can not estimate . The unknown good , the unconceived , has charms Beyond the tried . The untaught look on learning As a philosopher's-stone , a talisman , That gives the wearer power and consequence , Invests him with mysterious distinction , With attributes whose realness can be scanned But by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they uphold The common cause against outside assailants ,  --  Let no profane hand touch their ark . Believe me , ' T is not so much the intrinsic worth of learning , As its contingencies , inspires the crowd Of votaries real or seeming . Fashion some , Others ambition leads , or vanity . The patient seekers after truth are few ; Rare the enthusiasts for ancient lore . These seldom men , when found , deserve respect Proportioned to their genius or their merit . Think not that I would undervalue learning , Real learning ; ' t is the spurious I question . To read the history of the human mind , Writ as we find it in the master works The long departed ages have bequeathed us , This is no futile labor . To unfetter The lore else sealed up in a silent language , And give it forth living once more and fruitful , This is no arid , no unthankful task .  --  What in the hands of genius is arid ?  --  But this asks something more than scholarship . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproduce the sage 's work . We are not poets all , alas ! nor sages . It is not given to all of us to wield The wizard wand of re-creative power . Smiling . I almost think it was not given to me . STANLEY . Stanley You rate yourself lower than others do . HERMANN . Hermann No , no ! I know my powers . They did not lead In that direction . On some other path I might have come to good . I 've toiled and moiled , Year after year , on learned commentaries ,  --  First those of others , then upon my own . No classic work but I have analyzed , Have scanned as with a microscope . I spent My strength on doubtful passages , proposing Here a new reading , there suggesting changes In the till then accepted punctuation . I changed the initial letters of two words In the neid ,  --  and with great advantage ; ' T is true indeed ; two passages made clear Which had before greatly perplexed the critics . When I showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new reading , she perceived The importance , instantly , of my correction . STANLEY , Stanley politely . Your labors were not , then , without result ? HERMANN , Hermann laughing . You see the pedant is not dead in me !  --  Seriously . Not quite without result . No , I may say it : I had successes better worth than these You have just heard me boast . I 've had my share Of fame in the learned world , and I enjoyed it ,  --  Yes , I enjoyed it in a certain measure . But when that moment of awakening came ! When the electric spark that coursed the earth Reached me in my calm study , when the world , The actual living world revealed itself , When first I waked to feeling for my kind , When human hopes and human interests Made claim on me , with what another beat Moved my strong pulse ! Yes , for one month I lived ! I am a broken and disheartened man , My dreams are faded , my hopes laid in dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than realities ; even now I hold My disappointments dearer than my triumphs .  --  Checking himself . Whither have I been led ? What matters now My pedant life , or my political ? The one has been as fruitful as the other . EMMA , aside , extending her hand to the flowers upon the table . The others continue to converse . Only the flowers have kept their faith with me . They still are kind . But they are touched with sadness . They speak of soothing now ,  --  no more of joy . If it be true , as I have heard it said , That spirits gone from here have leave to work Upon the earth they 've left ,  --  the good and lovely Busied with objects beautiful and useful , The wicked with the hurtful and unsightly ,  --  If this be true , perhaps ' t is Agatha 's To paint the chalice of the opening flowers ; Her angel hand , perhaps , prepared the tints Of these soft field-flowers or of those pure roses : She knew them destined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in glory there , And see me in my tedious earthly home , Nor strive to send me solace . HERMANN , Hermann to Stanley . Ah , your daughter ! Her scholarship is of another sort ,  --  If truly we may call that scholarship Which is yet more of nature than of toil . Not by slow work , not by a mole-like digging , Does she unearth the treasures of the past ; With an enchanter 's wand she summons them , And they disclose themselves . STANLEY . Stanley Precisely so . HERMANN . Hermann Often a passage held as difficult She has at once , without a word of comment From me , expounded like the ablest scholar , Hitting the meaning with unerring instinct . STANLEY . Stanley Ah , yes ! HERMANN . Hermann Her fine , idealizing sense Enables her to recompose the scene The poet pictured ,  --  to reclothe his heroes With their own form , reanimate their voice : For her they live and feel and act again ; For her once more put on their grace and freshness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who in early youth was set to drudge Over these works , construing word by word , Till they had lost life and significance ,  --  Who in my manhood merely looked on them As offering themes for learned commentation , On which to found my fame , had not conceived A mind so free that it could simply take These works as other works , as other novels ,  --  Delighted , pained , admiring , or condemning , As it found cause , without pedantic carping Or superstitious reverence ,  --  reading them In the same spirit they were written in , Or that in which they first were listened to . ' T was in your Helen I first found this marvel . Themes in scholastic hands grown dry and sterile Took a new bloom for her ; her genial nature Infused them with its life . STANLEY . Stanley Her father feels Your praise not more than just . Her intellect Is truly of a most uncommon order : The powers of acquisition and of judgment Are found in happy equipoise . HERMANN . Hermann Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What we , for want of better name , call heart Has a large share in genius ,  --  in hers . Her soul perceives the latent harmonies That ruder senses miss . She feels the accord Between the genius of a race , its language , Its history : thus each reveals the other . Through some mysterious power of sympathy , The acts , the thoughts of distant times and lands , To her are as the present and the near . All that is human is akin to her . STANLEY . Stanley Doctor , how well you understand my daughter ! I 've seen all this , but could not have expressed it . Thank you for helping me.  --  I have some fears That marriage with its cares and occupations May be to her , at least in some degree , What ' t is to women commonly , the grave Of talents and accomplishments . HERMANN . Hermann This fear Was the sole drawback to the satisfaction I found in teaching her . Could I have had A youth as pupil with such gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! As ' t was , I felt That these fair blossoms might all drop untimely And never come to fruit . Yet possibly , In a young man 's case , hindrances yet graver Had intervened to rob me of my harvest . The charms of the world , its snares , its mean ambitions , Prepare for men sometimes a heavier downfall Than women find in that still gulf of marriage . And truth to say , this singleness of heart , This love of beauty for pure beauty 's sake , This sense of absolute truth , of absolute duty , When found in men , is chiefly found in those Whose course is early closed . I might have stood , A useless , lone old man , beside the grave Where my last cares and hopes lay mouldering . ' T is better as it is ; and who shall say , Although no present and apparent fruit Come of my work , that it has all been lost ? Helen may pass through life obscure and silent ; But , in her tranquil course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wisdom , And they may give forth , widely fertilizing , The treasures drawn from these invisible springs . STANLEY . Stanley She wrote me she should teach her boy herself . HERMANN . Hermann Yes , there it is ! A mother will not let Her child be ignorant of what she knows , If she can help it ; and so true is this , The Icelanders , a wise and primitive people , Ordain by law women may not be married Till they know how to read ; secure of this : That what the mother knows the child will know . Thus they provide for popular instruction . Ah , what you tell me gives me pleasure . Yet The best intents are thwarted . I know not Whether her husband shares  --  STANLEY . Stanley My son-in-law Is a good fellow ,  --  a good fellow , Doctor ! No better heart . I ' m sure you think so , too . Somewhat exacting . But we all are so , When we love truly . And he worships Helen . You know he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between him and me  --  Rather , his father settled it with me  --  Before she dreamed of marriage . And in truth , Fancy 's vagaries were forestalled by me . I taught her to regard her fate as fixed . Thus I preserved her from the wretched error Women of genius and heart are prone to : The dressing up some hollow effigy With gifts and graces not its own ; the making For this poor puppet fatal sacrifices , Deplored too late when time has dissipated Forever the illusion . I at least Secured my daughter wealth , position , leisure : Three real goods , which , if the unsubstantial Are added , only will enhance their value ; And if these fail , will help to compensate Their loss . HERMANN . Hermann I trust these will not fail ; for man Lives not by bread alone , and still less woman . STANLEY . Stanley Helen is happy , if a woman can be . Her husband , handsome , rich , and well brought up , Has elegant tastes , unusual cultivation . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages . Yes , she is happy . Besides , she loves him ,  --  I am sure of it ,  --  And better since her marriage than before . HERMANN . Hermann Before , I own it , I had some misgivings . That constant putting off  --  STANLEY . Stanley Oh , girlishness ! And then ' t was natural she should make no haste To quit a home of which she was the centre , The light , the life . She could not find herself Of more importance or more independent In her own house . But , since she must be married , I thought myself most fortunate to find A match so safe ,  --  in most respects , so equal . If I have sometimes said within myself , " He does n't deserve her , " ' t is that no man could , And that I ask a happiness for her Of which I think no other woman worthy . But , if you thought she was not fond of him , You were deceived . She did not show it boldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , indeed , Her love was not that trivial , flighty sort , Made up of tears and smiles and fond caprices , But a kind sister 's tenderness ,  --  the best Foundation for a happy married life . HERMANN . Hermann Perhaps so ,  --  yes ,  --  no doubt . But yet sometimes It seemed to me  --  you 'll think I am conceited  --  She liked my company as well as his . She often seemed more bright and gay with me Than with her lover . STANLEY . Stanley She was more at ease , It may have been ; and then perhaps she wished To make the most of those last days with you . I saw with pleasure , that , instead of idling , As most girls do , the time of her engagement , She was collected and industrious , Then as before ,  --  perhaps a shade more quiet , As well became a woman entering on A change so grave . If I had ever doubted She loved him as a wife should love her husband , These doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . I thought I knew my daughter ,  --  Knew all her loveliness , her grace , her beauty ; But , until I had seen her in her home , I only knew her half . I ca n't describe it , This change ,  --  it was so slight , yet so essential . When you have seen her , you will understand . Such perfect patience ! such sweet deference !  --  You know the best of men are sometimes captious.  --  Yes , truly , love works miracles with women ! Smiling . It almost moves my jealousy to see Myself supplanted thus . EMMA , Emma starting up . Ah , that was lightning ! STANLEY . Stanley But very distant . EMMA . Emma It will soon come nearer . STANLEY . Stanley Not very soon . We shall have some time yet . We shall see Helen safe at home before The storm comes on us . Do not be afraid . Going near her . Do calm yourself . You have seen storms before . EMMA . Emma Only too many ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanley ' T is your imagination lends them terrors . EMMA . Emma Imagination ? Yes , and memory ! STANLEY , Stanley kindly . You have , indeed , most sad associations With thunder-storms ; but recollect , my Emma , You have no loved ones now upon the sea ; And if you had , this storm which moves towards us Would not endanger them . In general , These tempests move but in a narrow circuit . Soothingly . And then this storm will not be violent , Like that you 're thinking of . EMMA . Emma Do you believe not ? Perhaps it will not . But it seems so like it ! STANLEY . Stanley You think the same of every storm that rises . EMMA . Emma That storm was hours and hours in coming on . Oh , how distinctly I remember it ! I sat and watched the long , pale , silent flashes , Held to my place by a mysterious dread . At last my strained ear caught a distant roll , And then a fuller peal . In funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slow . And yet the sky above me was serene ; The air was still . But , as I marked this stillness , Sudden a frightened fluttering of the leaves ! Then , all at once , a tumult overhead ! The massy cloud-rocks crashing on each other ! The mad winds clutching at the struggling tree-tops ! I knew not then above what trembling victims Those clouds had frowned before they burst on us . I knew not then what sails those winds had rent Before they spent their fury on our pines . And yet , perhaps , that thrill of nameless dread , Unknown to me , a daughter of the tropics , Up to that hour , even in the wildest storm , Was my heart 's answer to a dying groan , Borne to me on the swift , unpitying blast ! STANLEY , Stanley aside . The only subject that can rouse emotion In Emma is the shipwreck of her sister And little cousin . HERMANN , Hermann aside . What tenacity The affections have sometimes in feeble natures ! STANLEY . Stanley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are flushed and feverish . Going close to her and speaking low . ' T is natural you should recollect with kindness The sister who was as a mother to you , And the young playmate of your early childhood , Held rather as a sister than a cousin . I do not blame the strength of your attachments : But recollect how many years have passed ; Remember all you have to make you happy . Can not the husband , then , replace the friend ? The little girl whose early death you mourn , Is she not more than given back in Helen ? EMMA , Emma aside . She is not given back , my little sister !  --  Aloud . Yes , I am calm . I did not mean to vex you . STANLEY . Stanley It is not often that you vex me , Emma ,  --  Aside . Or , for that matter , move me any way .  --  To Emma . You are tranquillity itself , in general . Come , cheer up ! These sad looks would grieve our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feebleness ; For is she not the mother of my Helen ?  --  Aloud , looking at the flowers in the vase . What pretty flowers ! how tastefully arranged ! You always have a fairy world about you ! EMMA , Emma smiling . Yes , they are beautiful ! Who gathered them ? I found them here when I came down this morning . I thought at first that Helen had arrived , And had prepared me this surprise . I looked To see her come out from behind the curtain , As formerly .  --  Aside . She is a dear , good child ! STANLEY . Stanley What ! all these flowers you found here ? EMMA . Emma No ,  --  this vase full . The others Bella brought . I always send her Out every morning to bring in the flowers , And then I see them all arranged myself . STANLEY . Stanley The Doctor smiles . To the Doctor . Is this your mystery ? HERMANN . Hermann No , no ,  --  not mine ! But I perhaps can solve it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not to be wanting at the first reception , I saw that wan-faced , silent girl , Theresa , Stealing along the garden-walk before me , Her apron filled with flowers . As her whole air Betokened secrecy , I stopped discreetly , Studying the plants that grew beside the walk , And then went sauntering on the longest way Towards the house . As I approached the window  --  This one  --  and stooped to raise the sash and enter , I heard the sliding of another sash In the same room , and , turning , saw Theresa In the act of issuing forth . She did not greet me , But glided off in silence . EMMA . Emma That Theresa ! Why does the strange thing , by her wayward silence , Take from me the enjoyment of my life ? I never had a girl I cared so much for , Nor one that seemed to be so faithful to me . I really thought it was a true attachment .  --  Aside . But for me disappointment everywhere ! STANLEY . Stanley You 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no ,  --  I do n't distress myself . STANLEY . Stanley I hope not .  --  Doctor , what say you ? See , the sky looks clear . It will not rain yet . Shall we take a stroll Along the avenue to meet the carriage ? The people have been drawn up there an hour Or more , to greet their mistress when she enters . ' T will be a pretty scene , and we shall have A smile from Helen 's eyes some half-hour sooner . HERMANN . Hermann Thanks , many thanks ! That hope were bribe enough For a less pleasant walk ; but this needs none . STANLEY . Stanley Emma , in passing , I send Bella to you ; When we return , we bring you something precious . Stanley and Hermann go out . EMMA . Emma They leave me here to meet the storm alone ! What 's Bella ? What can she do for me ? Oh , I shall die here of fear and loneliness !  --  She goes to the window , looks out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My Helen comes ! My lovely , graceful Helen ! And with her  --  Hecate comes ! Ah , there it is ! Hecate comes back to freeze , to petrify me ! And everybody thinks she 's so devoted ! They wonder I could give her up to Helen .  --  How I remember when she first came near me ! I felt her fix her basilisk eyes on me , And a cold shiver ran through all my veins . Was it a warning sent to me , perhaps ?  --  Every one envied me my handsome slave . I had not enough courage to refuse her . Why did I not ? O Hecate ! my life 's vampire !  --  Yet I have nothing to reproach her with ,  --  Or only with too constant a devotion .  --  How high she held herself , the silent creature ! Dumb out of pride ,  --  not out of ignorance , As we supposed at first .  --  When first I heard The accents of her voice , how strange a thrill Shot through my heart ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she broke her silence . Yes , yes , she came between me and my child ! And this is why I can not love my daughter As other mothers do . O Helen , Helen , Could my heart once gush out for you in fondness ! Clasping her hands passionately , and rising . Could I but once enjoy a mother 's rapture , In full , full , overflowing , deluging measure , And yield my soul in that o'erwhelming bliss ! That moment , that death moment , should repay me My torpid life !  --  Sinking down again . No , it is not for me !  --  After a pause , tenderly . How did I long for you , my pretty darling , Before you came ! how did I press my lips On that dreamed cheek ! how did I twine my fingers In airy ringlets of imagined gold ! O precious one ! O little unseen daughter ! Dearer even now than is my living child ! Yes , when you came , you should restore me all : My Agatha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured on me I should return to you in seven-fold measure , And that which my fond heart had felt for her Should throb for me in my sweet daughter 's bosom ! Oh , all those tedious years of lonely life Passed with that hard , dry , selfish hypocrite , That governess of mine , and my stern father , How did they disappear and melt in nothing ! My coming life appeared to link itself To the far past : these made my whole existence . I almost thought I always had been happy . And when the time came that I was to press you Real and substantial in these waiting arms , Oh , it was Hecate held you up to me ! Oh , it was Hecate laid you on my bosom !  --  How came she there ? I did not send for her ,  --  I did not want her .  --  When I felt the touch Of my own child , it was not what I looked for . My heart stood still , instead of bounding up . Something came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That creature dared to love it ! She dared to vie in tenderness with me For my own infant !  --  I am very weak ! I know I 'm weak . I 'm sure that Stanley thinks so . ' T is so , or I had never let her nurse it . Yes , I am weak ,  --  or only strong to suffer !  --  What was she to my child , that she should love it ? My happiness was poisoned at its source . In vain my baby bloomed in health and beauty ; I could not love with fulness of enjoyment . I saw her little arms thrown fondly round That neck , her head reposing on that bosom ! Yet could I sooner have forgiven the love The unreasoning child bestowed upon its nurse Than that strange chill that sat on my own heart . Did I not love her ? Did I not admire her ? Had I not pride in her ? Yes , all of this ! Yet , even as she sat upon my lap , And I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I looked round And saw that stranger woman standing near , Ready to take my not unwilling darling , I felt the impotence of my dull heart . Her silent look said more than my caressings . I sank back baffled , weary , inly owning The nurse 's tenderness was more than mine . It was a spell that woman cast on me . These Africans are skilled in dreadful arts , Which they transmit , the mothers to their daughters , And they to theirs . Hecate might well be one To share this fearful legacy . Her look  --  And , above all , when it is fixed on me  --  Has something in it of undying pain , Mixed with exulting triumph , that might suit A priestess of those temples that they tell of Where men pay worship to the fallen spirit . It holds me still , this chilling , cramping spell ! I wait my child , not as the mother waits Whose fond protecting love requires an object To foster and support .  --  I foster Helen ! I guide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor , little , feeble woman , I , guardian of that vigorous , noble creature ! She is less mine than ever ! For my infant I could in part fulfil the mother 's office , Could minister at times to little wants , Could aid to conquer petty obstacles , Could soothe in childish troubles , fancied dangers ,  --  Could at least feel myself the wiser , stronger . But , ah , how soon she passed beyond my reach ! I am the earthbound bird that sees the swanlet Its wings have brooded soaring high in space .  --  It is my birthday ! No one thinks of it , Except that poor half-crazy girl , Theresa ! These were her gift , these flowers I thought so kind . Why did she bring them ? Not to do me pleasure .  --  They are all white , as for a bride  --  or corpse . In her mind had they some significance ?  --  Perhaps they are a sign of penitence . Her heart may have been touched by Helen 's coming .  --  Perhaps she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means innocence .  --  Perhaps she meant A type of the pure joy of this reunion . I 'll take it so . She goes to the table , leans over the vase , and touches the flowers . And yet I do not feel it . Since I have known these flowers were brought by her , It seems to me their leaves are touched with blight . They look at me as in reproach or warning . What would they say to me ? What pain awaits me ?  --  No , nothing new ! The present is sufficient ! These pallid flowers , plucked by unloving hands , Alone remind of my neglected birthday .  --  And yet perhaps Helen did not forget it .  --  With joy . She thought of me , when she arranged this journey ! My Helen thought of me ! I hear her say ,  --  " That day shall give my mother back her daughter . " And shall I be the last to welcome her ? Why do I stay ? The clouds are passing off . The storm but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is over . All my idle fears Pass off as easily ! My heart feels light , As suits the day that gives me back my child . My child ! Sweet words ! And this day brings her back ! She goes to the window . The flowers repeat it , the birds warble it ! All Nature seems to sing in happy chorus : " This day shall give the mother back her child ! " She goes out . SCENE III . Stanley and Hermann are walking together in a wide avenue . On one side are trees ; on the other an open lawn . They stop at a spot where a large tree has been left standing in the middle of the avenue , which widens out on either side of it . The slaves in holiday attire are ranged along the avenue , or form groups on the lawn , or are looking out from behind the trees . HERMANN . Hermann A cheerful scene , and full of poetry , To me , a European ! These dark faces , These vivid hues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the youthful race Has a keen charm in it to one like me , Who live in thought , in whom emotion , impulse , So long held down , almost forget their rights . When first I landed on your shores , I found Not what I had imagined . Everywhere I saw another Europe : busier , More energetic , and more self-reliant , But the same world , engrossed by the same cares , Pursuing the same ends , with more success , Because with greater freedom , and , alas That I must say , devotion more exclusive . The freshness , the exuberance , the slighting Of the cold actual for the warm ideal , All those rash virtues , those endearing faults , That I had thought must mark the youthful race , Existed only in my foolish hope . It seemed this people had been born mature : I found an age of reason permanent . STANLEY . Stanley And you object to this ? HERMANN . Hermann Oh , I approve it ! That is to say , one half of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , And sad .  --  The very child encountered me With such a thoughtful , penetrative glance , I felt myself the boy , and him the world-wise . Youth I found not . Hardly I caught its trace Upon the hollow cheek of a gaunt stripling , Or in the patient eyes of some poor woman : Its mirth , its lightness , its enthusiasms Held down and choked , the forms it should have graced Bearing the impress only of its struggles . STANLEY . Stanley You saw the North . HERMANN . Hermann I saw at first the North . But even here I found again my Europe . STANLEY . Stanley Yes , there you found its factories , its workshops ; And here you meet its culture , its refinements . HERMANN , Hermann aside . I will not flatter him , and must not wound . What shall I say ? STANLEY . Stanley It 's very praiseworthy , Hard-handed labor ,  --  most respectable . The sturdy farmer , the expert mechanic Are valuable members of the state . The country that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth . But the refinements , The true delights of life , the higher tastes , Find their development but where two races Inhabit the same soil : one being destined To furnish the material wants of life , And one to cultivate the finer graces . HERMANN . Hermann One made for work , the other for enjoyment . STANLEY . Stanley If you prefer . I only state a fact : I do not justify its being one . But toil and taste , producing and consuming , Are not in this world cast in one man 's lot . Coarse food contents the clown whose labor yields The spicy fruits , fine grains , and delicate wines That court the Sybarite 's exacting palate . The artisan scarce values his own work : He paints , he carves but for another 's eyes ; And he that weaves seldom knows how to wear . No ,  --  these two separate classes need each other . The lower from the surplus of the higher Draws its subsistence ; while those finer wants Which it knows not , but which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Happy when , as in Europe once , as here , Fixed barriers divide the working classes From those whose office is to think and rule . That restless striving , that uneasy envy , Which , at the North , and in those states called free Of the Old World , disturb the poor man 's peace , Are here unknown : his birth has fixed his station . The high , the low , take from the hand of Fate , Unquestioning , their lot . And no injustice . To those the manual toil ,  --  to these the mental . To us belong the joys of aspiration ; To them the calmer pleasures of contentment . HERMANN , Hermann aside . I had been prompt once to take up the gauntlet . But now ,  --  no , no , let the world wag ; I 'm old . STANLEY . Stanley And so you found us all too European : There too much industry , here too much case ? HERMANN . Hermann Why , something so . STANLEY , Stanley complacently . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your thrifty middle classes ; We represent your aristocracy . HERMANN , Hermann with sudden energy . Ah , if you knew the noble race as I do , You would less willingly find this resemblance ! I 've seen them near : I know their vain ambitions , Their empty cares , false pride , and splendid meanness : Spending a fortune on a feast , and bating In the same day the wage of some poor mother ! STANLEY , Stanley with a little hauteur . ' T is natural that you should hold your views , And I my own . We see from different stand-points . HERMANN , Hermann not perceiving Stanley 's pique . ' T is somewhat strange here in America Our old noblesse possesses the prestige That has died out in Europe . You imagine That nobleness goes with nobility . We know , we others . But this Scotch Magician , This Great Unknown , as people like to call him , Is the chief source of your illusions . He Has given to rank , which man 's caprice created , That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand has signed for honor . STANLEY . Stanley The stamp of chivalry , of high-souled courage , Of loyalty , of generous self-devotion , Are not these marks divine ? HERMANN . Hermann And these you lend To the noblesse of Europe ! Mere illusion ! They won their place by brutal violence ; Have kept it by tenacious selfishness . Look from the bosom of old Father Rhine ! Behold on every cliff the robber 's nest , Whence in old time their vulture eyes peered down To mark where , borne on his benevolent tide , The laden bark advanced , their destined prey ! Look round in Switzerland , in Italy ! See , on the heights , their crumbling fastnesses , Joy of the dilettante traveller , Traditional object of the peasant 's hate ! Here were the cradles of our old noblesse . Rapine and murder watched its infancy ; Its riper years more organized wrong protected . And now , in its decrepitude , you see it Grasping with trembling hand its worn insignia , Alternating a doting insolence With palsied fear , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event . I 've heard Americans regretting blandly Their land had none of these romantic ruins That crown our heights and overlook our rivers . " Our Hudson were as lovely as your Rhine , " I 've heard them say , " had we but your old castles . " STANLEY . Stanley ' T is true , though . I have thought the same , myself . HERMANN . Hermann Ah , if your land consents to envy Europe , Let it be rather for the wealth of art Laid up for it by humble , patient hands ; Or be it for the victories won in science By silent toil of calm , secluded men : Not for these monuments of crime and vengeance . Happy the land whose sons have piled no stones But those laid up by bloodless hands ; whose fabrics Dread no attacks but those of time ! Grudge not The older world the mournful poetry That wreathes itself about those blackening ruins ! STANLEY . Stanley You find , then , something in our land to praise ? HERMANN . Hermann Much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  Even in the bustling , striving North ; and here My heart and fancy can both find their food .  --  Interrupting himself , as he sees a gratified expression steal over Stanley 's face . I do not speak now of your social circles ; Choice as they are , they offer nothing new : They , like the rest , are a transplanted Europe . Nor was I even thinking of our Helen : She is herself ; no land lays claim to her ; That is apart ; there is my life of lives . But for my idle studies , for refreshing Of my warped , dried-up faculties , I stroll Before the cabins of this primitive people , Or sit me down amid a scene like this . STANLEY . Stanley Among the blacks ? They are sometimes amusing : They have quick senses , and some native fun . HERMANN . Hermann But you yourself , though born and bred among them , Have scarcely known so much of them as I. You can not view them in the light that I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their wits are sharpened by desire to please , Or blunted by the dread of blame . They wait Upon your look . They smile or draw long faces , Whine dolefully or speak in chirping tones , To keep in tune with your imagined humor . But me , the dreaming , silent foreigner , They mind me not more than the waving branches , Or innocent winds , that bear away their words , But not report them . Thus their cares , their joys , Their loves and hates express themselves before me In their own natural language : word , look , gesture , Unstudied , unrestrained . Stretched on the turf , Or propped against some pine-tree trunk , I bathe My world-worn soul in this fresh gushing Nature , As in the fabled youth-restoring spring . STANLEY , Stanley smiling . What a true German ! Doctor , give me leave To smile a little at your poet ardor . HERMANN , Hermann laughing cordially . Free leave ! free leave ! I knew you could not see What I can see . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me enjoy my feast , And you your laugh . You have a brilliant world To lead your life in : wealth , power , influence . I only have my studies and my dreams . STANLEY . Stanley Under which head are classed your present  --  HERMANN . Hermann Ravings ? Under both heads , perhaps . Man is my study ,  --  This poor maligned and deified human nature , Its lights and shades , its strengths and weaknesses . But , as I am a simple amateur , And my researches have no aim of profit , Whether for me or for the world , I hardly May call my studies more than reveries . But be that as it will , I can pursue them With interest untired among a people Still in the golden age of faith and fancy , Not risen up to that of doubt and reason . Then it is touching to my heart , the fate Of this poor orphaned race , whose opening youth Is trained by no too tender stepdame . Yet To Cinderella in her dismal corner Came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world of fancy infinite comforts That elder , happier races hardly know . Not easy to repress the joy of youth In races any more than single children .  --  I will say something strange : In this New World , What I have found of youth and poetry I have found here . STANLEY . Stanley You have found poetry ? HERMANN . Hermann Lived , looked . Nor only lived and looked , but sung : All except written . Not a circumstance Checkers their life or yours but has its minstrels . Each joy , each sorrow passes into song That mates itself with a congenial music ,  --  Now deeply mournful , now so wildly glad , As if the pining spirit , cramped and baffled Within its crouching frame , had found an outlet And soared to sudden freedom . On your shelves I see the Scottish minstrelsy , I see Servian anthology , Icelandic ballads ; In fine , you have a choice herbarium Of the wild-flowers of other lands , and leave Those that spring up about your feet to wither , Unculled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take place beside their sisters . I once heard A slow lament , sung by a gray old man Whose little granddaughter was sold away , That seemed to me for melody and pathos To have few rivals in the primitive verse Of infant peoples . ' T was not on your place ; ' T was on your neighbor 's there . STANLEY . Stanley Ah , yes ,  --  I know . Shabby of him . I do n't approve his course . If his affairs compelled him to adopt it , ' T would be another thing ; but he is rich . Only some grave offence , or their own choice  --  Through some caprice , or marriage off the place , Or so  --  can make me send my people off . HERMANN . Hermann I know it . They have not that cause of grief To exalt their souls to poetry . But sorrow Has many inlets to the human soul ; And the slave 's life , be lenient as you will , Is liable to some vicissitudes . STANLEY . Stanley Less , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear ,  --  Speaking of music ,  --  did you ever hear The girl Theresa , when she sang her best ? HERMANN . Hermann When I came here she was already silent . STANLEY . Stanley The fault of that ungrateful dog , her son .  --  You find them poets , then ? I 've sometimes heard Their songs from far , but did not catch the words . The airs I have found pleasing . Yes , for music Some of them have a real gift , I grant you . HERMANN . Hermann I marvel no appreciative hand Has yet caught up these wandering melodies . The time will come when these neglected strains Will charm in hall and drawing-room . You smile . Who knows ? What if the earliest contribution Truly original , that this New World Makes to the gentler arts , should be the product Of this poor foundling ? I have sometimes thought This unformed race , scarce issued from its childhood , Has been brought hither from its ardent birthplace That its warm blood may give a fuller pulse To veins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe 's passionate , fervid South Was once sent down the cool Transalpine flood . STANLEY . Stanley That thought could come but from a European , But from a German . HERMANN . Hermann Yes , we Germans have Few prejudices on the score of race . We live beneighbored by not kindred peoples . Some of them hate us . But we hate them not ; Content to absorb them ,  --  having for allies Time and our own superiority . You Anglo-Saxons hold your sacred blood Too precious to be mixed with other streams . You frown upon the Celt , your cousin-german ; Frenchmen , Italians , not their Roman lineage Makes them your equals ; and the lofty Spaniard Encounters pride more steadfast than his own ; Your brother German finds a mild disfavor . As for the humbler and more distant branches Of the human family , you hardly deign To count them kindred . That it could bring profit To your high race to blend its stream with theirs , What blasphemy ! STANLEY . Stanley But little less , indeed ! Your satire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns the higher races , Who stand with us on the same grade of culture ; But as regards a union with the lower ,  --  Or , if you like it better , undeveloped ,  --  We can not guard the purity of blood Too carefully . HERMANN . Hermann Yet scorn them not too far : Their turn may come , perhaps . Remember , men Do not take seed of a perfected fruit , When they would raise new sorts , but rather choose Some ruder kind , half-way to excellence . And thus it is with races : a fresh people Must in its nature have rough elements , That , when toned down by social contact , trained By formal culture , it may still be racy , Not weakened into mediocrity . The world is for the young .  --  Your nation 's youth Is , after all , a pseudo youth . Behold , It is a scion from an ancient tree , Not a new seedling ! Whether is it destined , As I have heard old farmers say of grafts , To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit on failing limbs , While yet its separate life is new ? This question Time only can decide . STANLEY . Stanley I am not sanguine . But , if we fail , I find the cause of failure Not in the race , but in the institutions That offer no restraint to innovation . A government that follows the direction In which the passions of the mob impel it , What pledge for permanence ? what pledge for safety ? HERMANN . Hermann You will not fail ! I did but theorize ,  --  An idle pastime . No , you will not fail . I find my hope there whence you draw your fears . With freedom , Nature finds her own defence Against the causes of decline . In vain Will prejudice propose its poor specifics . The sturdy health that is the gift of freedom Discards all nostrums . Not by stern exclusion , But generous welcome , will your favored nation Guard its preminence . Your friendly shores , Offering a second home to those whose boldness Has earned proscription , or whose enterprise Desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race upon the human scene : Not new in name , but young in hope and vigor . That energetic land from which you draw Your love of sway and love of liberty Thus kept its manhood green . Its tide of life , Still freshened by infusion of new blood , Rolled full and strong while lands whose narrow rule Attracted no recruits declined and dwindled . Yet there was but a type , a prophecy Of what shall find fulfilment here ,  --  the germ Of the fair blossoms and the generous fruits That here shall teem . Your nation is not born . The spirit is but shaping now the form For a new incarnation . Lands and races The most remote , the most estranged , contribute The elements of this fresh life . Destruction Will work for it , as will creative power ; Discord as harmony ; regret and pain Must have their part , as well as hope and joy . But in the fitting time the God-informed Will stand forth fair and strong , and take upon him His office in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . STANLEY . Stanley Hark ! was not that  --  No  --  HERMANN . Hermann Yes ! The carriage stops . She is alighting . She has divined that we await her here . This was a favorite spot with her . This tree , Sole lingerer of the primeval forest , Had for her eyes the charm that desolate sternness Has for the kind and happy . Here they are ! HELEN enters , followed by HECATE , who carries the child . STANLEY . Stanley Helen ! HELEN , springing forward to meet him . My father ! Helen embraces her father , then turns and gives her hand to Hermann . My best Doctor ! EMMA enters . Helen hastens to meet her , and embraces her warmly . EMMA , returning Helen 's embrace . Darling ! HERMANN , Hermann aside . The same ,  --  and yet her countenance is other . She has passed through another phase , I see . EMMA , Emma whispers . You love me , Helen ? HELEN . Helen Dearest mother ! EMMA . Emma Truly ? Darling ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Aside . She is not now so far from me as once . Has she known sorrow , then ? ' T is probable . HELEN , holding her mother 's hand in both hers , and speaking low and tenderly . I did not love her half enough before . I never knew how mothers loved their children , Till I had one to love . You felt for me All that I feel for him ? EMMA . Emma All ? All , and more ! You have so many gifts , have so much knowledge ! I knew but how to love , to love my child ! HELEN . Helen Your children now . What happy days , my mother , We will all have together !  --  Looking round for her child . Where 's my darling ? FLORA , Flora coming forward . Hecate has carried him the shortest way Towards the house . EMMA , Emma aside . Hecate ! She comes between me And all I love . Even this happy moment Her name embitters.  --  To Helen . What ! without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . She might have waited Till you had given him a first caress .  --  But you have not to learn what Hecate is . You know her waywardness and faithfulness ,  --  Both due , perhaps , to your indulgence . EMMA . Emma Yes ,  --  My false indulgence . I am very weak . HELEN , Helen caressingly . Not so ! but kind , and win more love than fear . EMMA . Emma She does not love me , Helen ; do not think so .

Out of spite to me , I know She has withdrawn the child from my embrace . She knew how full my heart must be , how eager , And made herself a joy of thwarting me . HELEN .

How could I ever think she did not love me , And even doubt if I loved her ? At last I 'm happy ! Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of that weird Hecate flit Across me , as the shadowy , noiseless bat In summer evenings through our darkening hall ! They disappear among the trees . NOON . Scene Scene .  --  A large , low room in the upper story . Book-cases and other furniture of carved black wood . Helen is seated near a table . Alice enters , loaded with flowers , which she throws down on the table as she speaks . ALICE . Alice In your old haunt ! I knew it ! Here are flowers To deck it with : not those bold garden-flowers That stand to be admired ,  --  but such sweet shy ones , That I would not have forced them from their shade , But for a bower secluded as their own . They droop already . Ah , these savage flowers Are not so patient as the tame !  --  To Flora , who enters . Some vases .  --  Flora goes . Oh , I have walked so far ! HELEN . Helen But not alone ? ALICE . Alice No , not alone . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not guess ! HELEN . Helen Hecate ? ALICE . Alice No less a person . I do n't know how I came by such an honor . She never used to think it worth her while To give herself much trouble for my sake . Perhaps with her clear sight she has read through me , And knows how dearly I love you , my Helen ! Whatever loves you has a claim on her . Did you observe how she caressed the spaniel That yelped out such delight at seeing you ? But , whether for your merits or my own , Hecate to-day was all devotion to me . She knows the forest as I know my garden : The very guardian fairy of the flowers Finds not more surely their sweet hiding-places . ' T was a strange pleasure that I found in wandering Through the dim paths with that mysterious creature . Sometimes I really almost felt afraid , As I walked on and heard her step behind : I seemed to feel her gleaming gaze fixed on me . But when I turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a gentle glance I wondered at my fears ; yet soon again Would the same awe creep over me . I must Still look and look , and still convince myself , That , when I looked before , I saw aright . I never knew her as she is to-day : To-day I hardly wonder that you love her . She has been always such a riddle to me , Such an unreal , mysterious apparition , That your confiding love for her appeared Like those spell-bound affections that we read of . I hardly even dared to ask about her , Fearing to draw her anger on my head , And feel the influence of some hurtful charm . The awe I felt before her in my childhood Has never quite worn off . Until to-day , She 's been to me a half-unearthly creature : But now I shall begin to think her human . Is it the joy of the return has changed her ? HELEN . Helen That can not be ; for she has seemed less sad , This year that she has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  My poor Hecate ! I have a heavy grief in store for her . Flora enters with vases , and places them on the table . At a sign from Alice , she goes . Alice arranges the flowers ; from time to time leaving them , as she becomes interested in the conversation , and then returning to them again . ALICE . Alice A grief for Hecate , Helen ? HELEN . Helen She must leave me . When we go home , she must remain behind . ALICE . Alice How can you think of it ? ' T will kill her ! HELEN . Helen Herbert  --  ALICE . Alice Oh , yes ! I understand ! He is not used To such a queenly bearing in a slave . Really , it is no wonder . ' T is like having Zenobia in chains to wait on you . Poor Hecate ! ' t is a grief for her , indeed ! HELEN . Helen I shall do all I can to lighten it . To me this parting will be no slight pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , You can not know ,  --  and Herbert does not know What she has been and what she is to me . ALICE . Alice Oh , yes ! I see ! Never was such devotion . HELEN . Helen Nor is it only the unreasoning fondness Nurses so often lavish on their darlings That I have had from her ; but more , much more . Eccentric as she is , undisciplined As seem her feelings , she can be to me , When I have need of it , friend , counsellor , The truest , wisest . In my infancy My mother left me wholly in her charge : Yet did she never try , by false indulgence , To win my love ; never used artifice ; Never taught me to use it ; but maintained Firmness and truth : hard virtues for a slave ! ALICE . Alice Truth a hard virtue for a slave ? Say , rather , Impossible . I have seen every virtue In servants but that one . HELEN . Helen This power to speak The truth and act the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first years Govern the after-life . ALICE . Alice How came she here ? HELEN . Helen No one knows what she is , nor whence she came . My father bought her at a public sale , Shortly before his marriage , and presented Her to my mother as a bridal gift . ALICE . Alice How did she come by this strange name of Hecate ? HELEN . Helen She answered loathly to the name they gave her : She had another of her own . I once , Trying to call her as she called herself , In my imperfect speech , found this by chance , And ever since she has been known by it : For this strange name , so innocently given , Fits her wild , brilliant , almost fearful beauty . ALICE . Alice You well may call it fearful ! Till to-day I always shunned her . When she has proposed To do me any service , I refused it . It seemed she offered it in mockery , And knew I should not dare receive it of her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HELEN . Helen From the first hour that she came here to this , No menial service has been asked of her . When she first came , her youth , her splendid beauty , Her constant silence ,  --  for she knew no language Spoken by any here ,  --  and her proud sadness , Woke in my mother such a blended feeling Of awe and pity , that she suffered her To follow her own course in everything : To come and go , to sit by her and work , Or wander through the woods , as pleased her best . She never showed her gratitude in words , Or even in look , but held towards my mother The same stern , lofty bearing as to others . Yet such was her attachment to her mistress , That , though her own child was not two hours old , Hecate was with my mother at my birth ; And , as she since has often told me , hers Were the first lips that pressed a kiss on mine . ALICE . Alice Ah , to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Hecate , when she speaks to you . HELEN . Helen She was my nurse . She has for me the feeling That these poor women have towards their nurslings : A love so strong that it sometimes supplants The love they ought to have for their own children . It often makes me sorrowful to think That I , who have so much to make me happy , Take from poor Perdita the highest good Her lot could let her know ,  --  a mother 's love . I can not hide it from myself , that Hecate , In all else so unlike a slave , has this In common with the meanest : she is wanting In love and sense of duty to her child . ALICE . Alice To you so fond ! Helen , how beautiful She is , when her dark eyes rain down on you Their tenderness ! Had she not been a slave , What might she not have been ! HELEN . Helen Ah , what indeed !  --  Helen remains silent for a few moments . At least since she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or injustice . I might say That in this house she rather rules than serves . The other servants stand in awe of her Far more than of their mistress or my father . Even he allows in her the lofty bearing He would not suffer in another slave . And over me , I own it , she has gained An influence almost equal to a mother 's . No mother could have been more kind , more patient . How would she watch by me , when I was ill ! The cold , stern Hecate was the gentlest nurse ! The first words that she spoke were said to me . For two whole years after her coming here , She uttered not a word in any language ; When suddenly , as if by inspiration , She could speak English with a purity Seldom attained by people of her class ,  --  Even by those who are brought up among us , And never hear another language spoken . ALICE . Alice Her native language is not English , then ? What is it ? French ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That she speaks English with a Spanish accent . Yet this , perhaps , may be accounted for : She may have caught this accent from my mother , Whose native language , as you know , was Spanish . Hecate herself maintains a resolute silence Upon this point , as upon all that could Help us to find out her true origin . French she can understand , but can not speak ; Spanish she does not speak nor understand ; English she speaks ,  --  how well you know , how purely . ALICE . Alice What trace there is of foreign idiom Seems but to give originality And a peculiar grace to all she says . She speaks as one might who has learned by reading , Not by the ear . HELEN . Helen Yet , when she came , they say , She could not read . ALICE . Alice And now she reads so well ! How did she learn ? HELEN . Helen She may have learned with me : She was by always , when I had my lessons . I well remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say them over in my playtime . When I was eight years old , she read at least : She used to read aloud to me for hours . Since , it has been one of my greatest pleasures To hear her read , recite , or improvise . ALICE . Alice Oh , I remember well her charming tales ! When I was here , if she began to tell one , I could not keep away , although I feared her . She had about her a strange fascination ! I felt it , though with as much dread as pleasure . HELEN . Helen And I with pleasure only . I would sit And look on her as on a picture , listen To her rich voice as to delightful music , While she recounted stories , half invention And half remembered fragments , or caressed me With such a lavish wealth of loving words ! Thus have I known her .  --  She has other moods . ALICE . Alice She only shows to you her lovely side . But I have seen her under all her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut ;  --  That strange old creature has attraction for me ;  --  There I 've seen Hecate with her own poor daughter ; She is an altered being ! HELEN . Helen There combined She sees the guilt and shame of the two races : Hates her white blood as that of her oppressors , Loathes the dark blood that makes her child a slave . But , Alice , oh , how cruel the condition That could pervert a nature such as hers ! ALICE . Alice Poor Perdita ! the quiet , patient creature ! But for your kindness , I should pity her . She seems to have no thought but of her duty . HELEN . Helen Yes , Perdita at least was born a slave , And has no wish or hope above her lot . Hecate asserts her life began in freedom , And that the man who sold her as a slave Did so against all right . Her father 's death , Which happened on a journey , suddenly , Left her , her infant brother , and their mother , Dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from their distant home , Where he had been their steward . Her poor mother , Feeble alike with illness and with grief , In a strange land , speaking a foreign language , Trusted this man to act for her . He offered To be their escort to the city whither Their journey lay , and where they had near friends . She left to him the arrangements . They arrived , After a tedious fortnight , late one night , In a large town . The steward carried them To a low , dismal tavern in the suburbs ; They were conducted to an upper room ; The door was locked , the key withdrawn . They passed A sleepless night , divided between fears And smiling at their fears . They watched with longing To hear the steward come . It was not day When the steep staircase creaked with cautious footsteps . The door was opened , and a woman entered , Holding a little lamp ; four others followed . Without a word , but with imperious gestures , They forced poor Hecate and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A covered wagon took them , thus disguised , To a large building . After some hours ' waiting In a bare cell whose door was firmly barred , They were led out into a wide , low hall Crowded with men , resounding with loud voices . Here Hecate 's hand was wrested from her mother 's . Confused , amazed , she understood no more What passed before her . It was only later She knew she had been sold ,  --  she was a slave ! ALICE . Alice What a strange story ! Oh , if it were true ! HELEN . Helen Her mother 's and her little brother 's fate She never learned . All that remained to her Of her old life was her black waiting-woman , Who clung to her , and , by a happy chance , Was bought by the same man ,  --  a needy planter . His small , remote plantation was shut in By hills on one side , little naked hills , And on the other bounded by pine-barrens . Her life was here as dreary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight Bears on the slave . But not alone the food Scanty and coarse , the insufficient clothing , The harsh refusals and the sharp revilings , Not these alone made Hecate 's misery ; The want of all that nourishes the fancy , The absence of all beauty , of all change , Awoke within her a more cruel craving Than bodily wants can cause . The master 's house Itself was mean and low and poorly furnished . No trailing vines , no rich o'ershadowing trees With outward beauty screened the inward bareness . The wretched negro huts were all alike , Set in straight rows , and not a shrub or flower Redeemed their squalor . To that lonely region No traveller came . Either there were no neighbors , Or intercourse with them was interdicted : For no strange face was seen on the plantation , Unless it were when a new laborer Came to replace one that was dead or sold . Hecate has often told me of those years : Only the pictures that came back to her Out of her early childhood , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . ALICE . Alice How came she here ? HELEN . Helen Upon this planter 's death , The people were sent off and sold . A dealer Bought Hecate and the girl who came with her From her first home . He brought her to this State And offered her for sale . My father saw her By accident , and bought her for my mother . The other woman begged so earnestly Not to be parted from her , that my father Bought her , too ,  --  that same Dorcas whom you spoke of . ALICE . Alice What can we think of this strange tale ? HELEN . Helen My father Says Hecate 's pride makes her desire to think Herself free-born : slaves often have this fancy . Yet he made earnest efforts , for my sake , To learn the truth ; but all without avail . Hecate herself would give us no assistance . Her father 's name has never passed her lips ; She says she has forgotten it ; but , when I press her , such a fearful agitation Shakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woful , That I must think she has some hidden motive To keep it from us , and I cease to urge . My mother thinks this is sufficient proof That the whole story is a fabrication , Or , at the least , a fanciful delusion , On Hecate 's part . She thinks it could not be A child should thus forget a father 's name , Or , knowing it , in such a case conceal it . ALICE . Alice And yet the exiles in Siberia Sometimes forget their names , though they were sent there After they were grown men . Why not a child , Taken so suddenly from all she loved , Placed in new scenes , new-named in a strange language ? HELEN . Helen Perhaps , if all be as she says and thinks ,  --  If she has borne an honorable name ,  --  She dreads , after so many years ' abasement , To claim her rank and family once more . What grief , what shame for her , in the return To her lost home of innocence ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she once were free or born in bondage , She has in her a sense of dignity That we do not attribute to the slave . How my heart bleeds for her , poor , injured creature , When I think over all she must have suffered ! Here is , no doubt , the secret of her strangeness , Her varying moods , her coldness to her child . ALICE . Alice And is not this susceptibility Itself a proof that she was born in freedom ? She may be free ! She may be even white ! Oh , what a horror , if the case were so ! Such things have happened . I have heard a story Of a poor boy , light-haired , blue-eyed , they said , Who was for seven years believed a slave . He proved to be the child of foreign parents Who had died suddenly . It was decided The little fellow was to have his freedom .  --  And Hecate has no trace of negro blood ; Nor has her daughter . HELEN . Helen But among our servants Whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alice Yes ,  --  Roxy 's grandson , Daffy . Then there 's Chloe ; And there was Minta , and her pretty boy . Pity they died , poor things ! But Dorcas ,  --  What did she tell you ? Did you question her ? Her mind is weak and wandering ,  --  but she might , Perhaps , remember what passed long ago , Though she forgets what happened yesterday . HELEN . Helen She never could be brought to give an answer In a straightforward way on any subject . When questioned about Hecate , she becomes More vague and wayward even than usual . ALICE . Alice The man whose slave she was , you know his name ? HELEN . Helen It was a common one . The dealer knew it ,  --  But nothing else about him . Hecate says His place was in a newly settled State . She went to it from where she first was sold By a rough road that seemed interminable : She could not tell what time the journey took , It was so full of pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she travelled far To reach the place where she was sold again . The dealer bought her in the far Southwest , And she had come there from still farther South . Vague indications to direct our search ! Then years had passed before she told her story . She told it , too , not fully and at once , But first in hints . Then slowly , piece by piece , Came out the history I have given you . How much of it is true , and how much fancy , Or others ' story mingled with her own , It is not easy to decide . At first I listened to these tales as to the rest , Finding in them only the hour 's amusement ; But later , seeing with how deep a feeling , What minute details , what consistency The story was repeated , I began To see more in it than a woven dream . I may be wrong ,  --  her strong imagination Gives such a lifelike color to her pictures . But I have notes of all that she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first master , And of the man who sold her to himself . With these , if time and accident  --  no , if The overruling hand of Providence Should offer us one day the guiding clue , We may explore this mystery . Till now My efforts have been fruitless . ALICE . Alice But , if Hecate Dreads the discovery , why should you seek To give her back what she would not regain ? HELEN . Helen Ah , there is something in us which impels To work for justice , to defend a right , Without respect to the first consequences . And then , though Hecate might not wish for freedom , She has no right to keep it from her child And her child 's children . But my hope has failed As years pass on and nothing comes to aid it . All I can do is to entreat my father To give her her own freedom and her daughter 's . ALICE . Alice And he will not consent ? HELEN . Helen He says it is Impossible ; he could not free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to live All unprotected in a land of strangers ; She has no means of earning her own bread ; She would be wholly helpless ; and her daughter , Even if the choice were given her , would rather Remain with us , and die where she was born , Than venture out in the great world alone . I know not what to answer to these reasons Urged by my father ; but if  --  ALICE . Alice He is right . You can do nothing more than you have done .  --  Alice rises and places the vases of flowers in different parts of the room . Look , is it well ? Changing the position of a vase . No ,  --  this is better here . Now where is Flora ? She can take the rest . The door opens . Ah , she is coming . With surprise . Hecate ! HECATE , Hecate entering . It is I. HELEN , Helen to Hecate , who stands looking at her with an anxious , inquiring expression . What is it ? HECATE . Hecate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tell me Some pleasant tales , such as your fancy weaves them ,  --  Half real , half fantastic . HECATE . Hecate And thou canst Still listen to my idle tales ? Dear treasure ! Rose of my desert ! Sunbeam to my night ! God has o'erpaid me in bestowing thee ! Yes , I will find for thee the sunniest tales Of brighter lands than these . No , thou art sad . To the sad heart the glad tale is unwelcome . I 'll tell thee , then , of sorrow ,  --  but of such As can not come near thee . To my own world , The world of dreams , I 'll lead thee . Dost thou know  --  Thou canst not know what paradise is opened , When sleep withdraws the veil from that fair land , For him whose day-life knows nor joy nor rest . To the o'erblest are given ominous dreams , Prefiguring change and loss . The troubled sleeper Struggles to wake , and , having waked , counts over His blessings , one by one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved : Yet scarce he banished the haunting shadows . But on his eyes whom toil and sorrow lead , Fainting and wan , to pitying sleep 's protection , Rise joy-fraught visions ; sweet , consoling tones Bear to his ear promise of future rest ; All that his life has lost or never known Comes to enrich it then . Ah , ' mid its bliss , Already does his heart forebode the waking ! He clings to sleep , but feels her kind embrace Slowly relax , till , half-incredulous , He knows himself again , and drearily Takes up once more the burden of his woes . Thou happy heart , and Looking at Alice . Thou gay bird , perhaps Your silk-embowered rest has sometimes known Dark , threatening forms that would not be shut out By bolts or bars , that were not to be daunted By all your state ? ALICE . Alice Oh , often , Hecate ,  --  often ! HELEN . Helen Ah , you have found , perhaps , the hidden source Of this day 's sadness . A dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , passed before me . ' T was like the shadow of approaching evil , And rested , as it seemed , upon my child . I thank thee for reminding me how slight The cause that waked this tremor . ' T will soon pass . Thou hast well said , such dreams assail the happy . HECATE . Hecate And wilt thou know what dreams the wretched have ? Wilt thou look through the slumbers of the slave And see the world that opens on his night ?  --  To Alice . Draw not back , proud one ! I 'll not ask of thee To stoop the snowy pinions of thy soul To the earth-burrowed nest , to soil their lustre By contact with ignoble griefs and hopes . I know too well the placid scorn that dwells In your high hearts , to ask their sympathy For the emotions of a sooty breast . But slavery 's yoke has not in all time rested Only on those predestined to its thrall By a divine decree . That favored isle From whose brave sons Freedom elects its champions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These vigorous young republics ,  --  that blest isle Has seen her fair-cheeked children borne away To serve dark masters under tropic skies . Of one of these you will not scorn to hear How , spent with toil , on the unfriendly earth He sank at eve , and saw , with sickening eye , The blazing sun of Africa go down . See where he lies , with straight , gold-dusted hair , Eyes that still wear the hue of Northern streams , Cheek that the foreign skies have reddened , not bronzed ! He is a slave . Yet look on him and hear !  --  " Sink at last , cruel splendor ! fade , pitiless light ! Leave the outcast to sue for the mercy of night ! In the world the day shines on the slave has no part ; Its desires , its affections are strange to his heart . All around , happy cares that I know not I see ; Bright hopes open near me ,  --  they bloom not for me . Where I pass , cheerful greetings on kind faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . Of life and of love all things else have their fill ; But my heart must ache on in its loneliness still . Every low-bending grass-blade , each tremulous spray Had its own humble share in thy brightness , O Day ! No valley so sunken , no hill-peak so bare , But awoke to a hope while thy smile rested there ! In all this large bounty no portion for me , Who could once claim a child 's ? I am orphaned of thee ! " " Thou art here , pale protectress ! Before thy cold sway Must die out the bright tints , the clear voices of day ; Must recede all the mocking enchantments of light ! Oh , how thou art welcome , thou stern , silent Night ! Not thus did I greet thee in earlier days , When thy dark mantle hid the bright world from my gaze ! How I watched then the sunlight 's last lingering gleam , As it lovingly loitered on woodland and stream ! And , oh , the glad waking ! Forth , forth on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hymn to the dawn , And the gentle flowers , lifting their heads , one by one , Softly whisper each other their joy in the sun ! The woods put off their slumber ; the light morning breeze , Springing up from its trance , is astir in the trees . And see how the waves of the willow-watched lake At the first thrilling touch of the sunbeam awake ! O home once my own ! Is the old gladness there ? To thy unestranged children is morning still fair ? Do thy birds carol ever ? Thy airs , roving free , Still bear the sweet errands of meadow and tree ? On thy lake , with the breeze are the billows at play , As when I last watched them , all careless as they ? Hear me , dear , happy waters ! Let one freshening wave Steal hither and bless the parched lips of the slave ! Lend once more , friendly willows , your sheltering boughs ! Oh , might yet your cool leaflets sweep over my brows ! " " Am I heard ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do the birds of my land bid me welcome again ? What sky arches o'er me ? Does this perfumed air From the flowers that once knew me a kind greeting bear ? Lo , the willow-trees yonder ! The bright lake is near ! The plash of its waters comes soft to mine ear ! My home , and unchanged ! Yet an alien I stand ' Mid the birds and the trees and the flowers of my land ; And the dull , heavy tread of the slave prints the sod Which the bold , rapid step of my free boyhood trod . Ah , my own cabin home , with its vine-curtained door ! All the old household faces crowd round me once more ! ' T is thy voice , my own sister ! how welcome , how dear , Falls the music of kindness again on mine ear ! And these dear circling arms , and this welcoming face !

Can it reach me when pressed to my own mother 's heart ? Ah , so long have I trembled , this unquiet fear Will cease not from troubling my soul even here ! My mother , the son whose proud right it should be To shield thee from danger asks safety of thee ! No more mayst thou call me thy noble , thy brave ; For the heart of thy child is the heart of a slave ! Yet do not thou scorn me ! all free as thou art , Deny not the fallen his home in thy heart !

As my soul longed for thee , so thy love called on mine ; All my heart 's eager yearnings found answer in thine . Strong is love ; strong is grief ; the soul 's fetters gave way : On the fond mother 's bosom the long orphaned lay . Yes , thou hast been with me ! On this blighted brow Thy sorrowful eyes looked in love even now . To thy warm throbbing heart this chilled heart has been pressed , Thy dear arms have clasped me , thy kind voice has blessed .

" HECATE , Hecate to Helen , after a pause . The tears are in thine eyes , thou gentle one ! HELEN . Helen Oh , my poor Hecate ! what a depth of grief Hast thou revealed in these thy fancy 's pictures ! Does the remembrance of a happier time Still live in thee ? Dost thou still pine for freedom ? Oh , when I look upon thy heavy sorrow , Knowing its cause , I have a sense of guilt ! I almost hate myself for being happy ! HECATE . Hecate Think not I envy thee thy radiant life . Thy happiness is all is left of mine . Nay , look not sad . Do I not live in thee ? This wasted heart , famished of joy and love , Drinks in whole draughts of rapture in thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dost thou long for freedom ? HECATE . Hecate As tottering age longs back its youth ; as snows That down the mountains rush in muddy torrents Pine to take back their frozen purity ; As lightning-blasted oaks regret their foliage . It is a longing which is not of hope , But the imbecile craving of despair . No human hand can give me back my freedom : That is a gift which only God bestows . Man may deface the work of the divine , But not restore its wholeness . On my soul The seal of ignominy has been set . Redemption Can come to me but from the hand of death . HELEN , Helen after a pause . Hecate , let not thy thought reproach my father . Thou know'st he saved thee from a harder bondage ; And when I urged on him thy mournful story , He left no means untried to learn the truth . Even now  --  if there were any room to hope  --  Search well thy memory . Tell me all thou know'st . Hecate . Hecate All it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love I offer thee Is not the service of an abject heart ; And let no doubt come near my mother 's name . HELEN . Helen Tell me of her . Hecate . Hecate She was as fair and slight As my proud father dark and manly strong . All in her harmonized : her sweet pale face , Where only the eyes were rich with light and color ; Her low-toned voice ; her softly falling tread , And the white gossamer that robed her . Flowers Were her sole jewels ; yet her caskets held The imprisoned fires of Asia 's costliest stones . They only gleamed to glad my infant eyes . HELEN . Helen Thy father ? HECATE . Hecate Stern , and honoring only her . And he was harsh sometimes : the generous oak Yields a rough hold to the soft-clinging tendrils Of the fond vine that leans her life on his . Ah , my sweet mother ! when she heard his step , She looked up with a gentle , asking smile , To disarm anger , if he came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in kindness . Thus I remember her . Alone , she wept Sometimes ,  --  yes , often ; yet I think not more Than wives are wont . They were not passionate tears ; But tranquil , slowly dropped , as if her grief Had years enough wherein to spend itself . HELEN . Helen She had griefs , then ? HECATE . Hecate What woman has them not ? Even thou , my Helen , turn'st away thine eyes Before that question ,  --  thou , young wife and mother ! Nay , have no fear that I will probe these wounds . I know them slight . God grant them never deeper ! HELEN . Helen God grant them never greater than my strength ! But not for happiness was woman born , For selfish pleasure , but for something higher . I feel it here . Hecate , thou hast not erred . I am no more the gay , all-hoping girl . Life has now called me to its serious cares . Already I forebode the sordid griefs It lays on woman ,  --  and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HECATE . Hecate Oh , my own Helen ! Yes , not for happiness ; for something higher ! I feel and know it in my degradation ! Oh , be thou all I might have been ! My soul Can only dimly now discern the noble ; As faintly , through the mists of time , we seize The shadowy outlines of a dead friend 's features . But when , on some related face , gleams out That look , that smile , so loved once , so familiar , Forth from its night starts the long faded image , And for a moment stands all living there . So when thoughts from thy noble soul breathe forth , Kindred to those of my dead nobleness , For a brief instant they charm back its phantom !  --  Faded ,  --  gone !  --  I am here , and I am Hecate ! Goes . Helen remains thoughtful . Alice observes her for a moment , then gayly : ALICE . Alice Be what you will . For me , I will be happy . I 'm not unreasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that matches mine Will do ; a husband that will let me spend Just what I please ; a very handsome house ; Statues and pictures in it ; pretty children ,  --  Although they do say , to be sure , that children Too handsome when they 're young will grow up ugly : But I must have them pretty while they 're little ; What they are afterwards is their affair . HELEN . Helen Only to me , my Alice , talk thus lightly , Who read your heart ; I know you have deep feelings . ALICE . Alice I do not know it . As I feel , I talk . There 's one good thing : I am no hypocrite . I say at once , my husband must be rich : I have n't the least taste for self-denial . To risk your life upon some great occasion Is very well ,  --  if one but come out safe ; But to go every day dressed dowdily , To wear old-fashioned caps and home-made bonnets , There 's not a man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protracted martyrdoms Like these . No , Helen ,  --  these high-sounding virtues , Self-sacrifice , and magnanimity , And strength of soul , and all the rest of them , Are very well for men . They have their part To play before the world . They take the worth Of all their sacrifices out in fame . But we  --  what do we ever get by ours ? Who 'll ever know it , if I scorch my face Stewing preserves , or if I spoil my hands In starching muslins ? If I spend my life Passing between the nursery and the kitchen , A perfect heroine in my self-devotion , Who 'll ever take the least account of it ? And there am I , after a few short years , An ugly , dowdy , ordinary woman , Without a thought beyond a stew or stocking . Who 'll thank me for my worn-out youth and beauty , My stinted intellect ? Perhaps my husband ? Oh , not a bit of it ! He 'll see me changed , And wonder how he ever thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what I am saying . I had an aunt who married in the North  --  HELEN . Helen Your mother 's sister ? ALICE . Alice Yes ,  --  my Aunt Sophia . I made a visit to her once , and then I learned what a love-match is . My poor aunt ! They say that she was lovely in her youth , And never was attachment so romantic As that between her and her husband ,  --  lover , I mean , before he had become her husband . When I first saw her , she was thin and pale , With anxious eyes shaded by heavy lids : He was still handsome rather , though too stout . Could I describe to you that woman 's life ! She rose at six o'clock ,  --  it was in winter : I do n't know what time she got up in summer ,  --  At dawn , no doubt . No sooner up than busy . First , all the pretty things about the parlor Were to be dusted by her careful hand : Servants were not abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair . Then to the work-basket before ' t was light . Shirts were to mend ,  --  when not to make ,  --  and stockings . One thing got through , there stood another ready . I said one day ,  --  " And when shall you be done ? "  --  " Done ? "  --  and she turned on me a wondering look ,  --  " Done what ? this apron ? "  --  " Done with all your work . "  --  " Never , " she said ,  --  and that so placidly ! Then she must hear the younger children 's lessons , Before they went to school , to have them perfect . She 'd heard the Latin Grammar through so often , Beginning with the oldest boys , and coming Down to the youngest ,  --  just in training then ,  --  That she could listen to the recitation And never leave her mending : coarse print , fine print , She knew it all as well as a professor . HELEN . Helen Well , then , at least , in giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could but have put it to some use ! But no , she never got beyond the grammar . When they were old enough to do without her , They went their way , and she began again The same old story with the younger ones .  --  Well , then came breakfast . Just before it came , The children were admonished to be quiet , Because papa was coming . Papa came ,  --  Despatched his breakfast ,  --  read his newspaper ,  --  Departed for his office . After breakfast , She washed the breakfast-things and set them up ,  --  And then to work again . I tried to read Aloud to her , thinking it quite humane : But her poor head was so intent on planning How to make Charley 's jackets do for Tommy , Or how to cut two mantles for the girls Out of her last-year 's cloak , or perhaps only How to have what remained from yesterday Made serviceable for another dinner , That , when I 've read some most pathetic passage , And my eyes looked for sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introverted look Which says the mind , at work within itself , Is not at home to foreign visitors . At times , indeed , in some auspicious moment , I caught her ear , and , through her ear , her heart . Once taken captive , it made no resistance , But suffered me to lead it where I would . Then fell the hateful work ; the needle stopped ; The humid eye , melting by turns and kindling , Gave back the varying passion of the page . And I read on with tremulous delight , Dreading the moment that should break the spell , Take from me my congenial companion , And leave instead the toiling , careful housewife . Too soon it came ! At once the conscious flush Springs to her cheek , and quick the guilty hands , Convicted of a moment 's idleness , Catch self-reproachful at the slighted work , While the perturbed and hurried eyes send round Sharp glances to detect what other duties That season of oblivion has betrayed . HELEN . Helen This life seems sad and wearisome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALICE . Alice I do n't know what they were . I saw her life , How it wore by . One day was like another . You think , perhaps , she found them in her children ? In the elder possibly ; they were from home . The younger were a set of little Pickles . When they came home from school , there was a time To get their hands and faces washed for dinner ! And then their lessons were to hear once more ! My uncle came again at three o'clock , But left his soul behind him at his office , Musing a law-case . His material form , Having reinforced itself , rejoined the spirit .  --  The afternoon was very like the morning : A scene of busy cutting , making , mending , Varied by short excursions to the kitchen . But then the evening was her holiday , Perhaps you think ? A heavy holiday ! About as gay as a New England Sunday ! The children sat apart to con their lessons , Each with his little lamp and little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , on tiptoe , to obtain A whispered explanation from his mother . Except this , and the ticking of the clock , The crackling of the fire , the gentle rustling Of my aunt 's dress , as flew her nimble needle , And now and then a deep sonorous hem From my portly uncle , not a sound disturbed The more than churchlike stillness ; for the children , Untamed as colts when only with their mother , Were grave as owlets when papa was there . But if , in some forgetful moment , words Above the breath , or an ill-smothered laugh , Broke out from them , the conscience-stricken mother Lifted her eyes to meet her husband 's look And intercept the blame it carried in it . Those evenings seemed to me without an end . I hailed the hour of general dispersion That brought me freedom ,  --  me , not her : she sat Till one o'clock over her mending-basket . HELEN . Helen Why did you go to stay so long a time ? ALICE . Alice To tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so thoroughly spoiled ! My mother Thought it would do me good to pass six months Under this roof of struggle and privation . It did me good . I learned a lesson there That I shall profit by . HELEN . Helen Was she depressed And sad ? ALICE . Alice My aunt ? She never seemed to know She was n't the happiest woman in the world ! I asked myself , was it stupidity ? Or was it something quite beyond my ken ? HELEN . Helen This life of self-devotion had rewards That human eye saw not . Believe it , Alice . ALICE . Alice What was unseen I can not estimate . The visible rewards were somewhat scanty . The children took it as a thing of course That she should toil and moil and watch for them . I do believe her sons had loved her better , If they had seen her pretty and well-dressed , Than as it was , with all her sacrifices . I told her so one day , in my blunt way . She answered gently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more : I should deserve it less . " She did not miss their thanks . To take her kindness Was to do her one .  --  I remember once I saw her thoughts turned back upon herself : But for a moment , though . It was one Sunday : We had all been to church : the preacher 's text was , " Her children arise up and call her blessed . " HELEN . Helen Oh , Alice , I can never hear that verse But my heart swells ! You talk of fame , of glory ! What glory ever filled the soul with rapture Like that which must o'erflow the mother 's being Whose children call her blessed ? ALICE . Alice Well , my uncle At dinner-time said to the youngest boy , " What did you hear at church ? "  --  " We heard a sermon About a mother who was very good . "  --  " Like yours , " my uncle said . These simple words Showed him less unobservant than he seemed . I never knew before he felt her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , too : A flush of glad surprise suffused her cheek ; Tears , half of pleasure , half of penitence , Pressed to her eyes . It seemed she asked herself , Had she deserved this praise ? and gleams of joy And shades of sadness , alternating , flitted Over her face , to which its youth came back For a brief moment , and then fled again , Leaving it only gentler still and humbler . Her husband , though , saw nothing of all this : He ate his dinner in the utmost calm . HELEN . Helen You must have loved your aunt : you would not else Have learned to read her feelings in her face ; You would not else have been so jealous for her , And thought she was not valued at her worth . ALICE . Alice Oh , yes , I loved her ,  --  love her memory . I thought her life preposterous , but I loved her .  --  I asked her once , how could a mind like hers Content itself amid such vulgar cares , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , and could ask anything . She said : " We have to educate our children . I have myself no means of earning money : I can but save it . If I were more lavish , If I allowed myself a life of ease , Either our boys must want advantages I would not have them want , or else their father Must doubly toil , and wear out soul and strength . This thought supports me : every cent I save Is so much care and labor spared to him . Then , if my spirit flags , I rouse it up With thinking on the future of my sons . I see them with their father 's eloquence And all his gifts , joined to my "  --  " Self-devotion , " I added , as she sought some humbler word . " My industry , to my one humble merit , My legacy to them : all other talents They will inherit from the father 's side . " She never lost faith in her husband 's genius . Success and fame did come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and never knew it . HELEN . Helen Her hopes for him were answered . And her children , Have they not well repaid her cares and efforts ? Her eldest son already has a name Honored by all whose suffrage is an honor ; The second son , young as he is , has gained A rank among our greatest poets . Few So happy as this humbly toiling woman ! She died ,  --  but died with all her ends accomplished . ALICE . Alice No , not accomplished ; or she did not know it . HELEN . Helen She had foreknown it : the religious heart Confides more in the promises of faith Than in the evidence of mortal senses . ALICE . Alice Oh , could she but have lived a little longer ! The grave had hardly closed on her , when all Turned out exactly to her wish : her husband Prosperous at last ; her children something more . HELEN . Helen Yes , she said well : they have their father 's powers And hers united . Not a generous work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And given with that heartfelt eloquence That finds the answering chords in other hearts . These noble brothers ! what a part is theirs ! One from the sacred desk gives forth with power The teachings of eternal truth ; the other , Not less a preacher of the inspired word That imposition of no human hands Devolved this office on him , gives to earth The sacred oracles in strains as lofty And spirit-stirring as the ancient prophets : Wrong shrinks before his voice , and trampled right Makes good its claims , at least in human hearts .  --  He is a benefactor of the earth Who makes two grass-blades grow where grew but one : How much more he who generous emotions Calls forth in torpid minds ! who makes the waste Of rude , uncultured hearts to blossom out In genial virtues !  --  How I thank you , Alice , For sketching me the life of this dear woman ! Well , I believe no sacrifice is lost , But each just aim , if steadfastly pursued , Is reached at last ,  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , And work the good they strive for . Yet we all Have need sometimes to fortify our faith . The example of such efforts and such triumphs Cheers and inspires . ALICE . Alice I wonder at you , Helen ! You , with your gifts , your splendid powers , your beauty ,  --  You take example , you draw strength from one Good , gentle , patient , all ways praiseworthy , But no more fit to be compared to you Than a poor rushlight to the evening star ! HELEN . Helen Alice ! God has indeed heaped blessings on me , And made my trials  --  can I call them trials ?  --  So light they hardly leave me room for merit . When I compare my life with the existence Of some poor toiling woman , the rewards My slightest effort finds with the sparse gains That pay her ceaseless labors ,  --  smiles and thanks And amplest recognition compensating The smallest sacrifice I make for others , While her sad life 's monotonous toils and pains Nor sympathy nor gratitude makes sweet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel , with a profound humility , How much her life is nobler , higher than mine . But , if there be a woman who deserves More veneration than these humble martyrs , Is it not she who , bred in luxury Mental and physical , and versed in all That makes life beautiful and rich and graceful , Can yet accept with a courageous patience The cares , devoid of dignity and charm , Of a restricted , sordid , household life ,  --  Who , with the tastes and wants that culture gives , Condemns herself to mental poverty That others may be rich ? Believe me , sister , These silent sacrifices are of those That before God have worth . These are the women Who , with their humbler sisters of the poor , Keep , in our time , uninjured the tradition , The ideal of womanhood . ALICE . Alice I grudge them not their honors ! Offer me power or glory worth the having , I 'd make , perhaps , the needed sacrifices To win it . But I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant to women Distinction in a petty sphere , through wealth Displayed in house and dress and equipage . And wherefore kick against the pricks ? I aim Only at what I see within my reach . HELEN . Helen The things which lie within our reach are often More worth than the far-sought . And are you sure There are no higher duties left for women Than to display on dress and furniture The wealth that others ' industry provides ? ALICE . Alice Oh , educate their children , scold their servants , Smile when a husband sulks ; all said in one : Domestic virtue ! I 've no taste for it . Or let me be a heroine , or be nothing ! HELEN . Helen The heroines of the past , who have bequeathed us What we possess of ease and dignity , Suffered and toiled unknown and unregarded . Their noble patience , their sublime forbearance Guarded the sacred ties of home and kindred From violent rupture , until their protection Became the common care of cultured man , And , sanctified by habit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall we rest supine ? The task of woman will not be accomplished , Until , throughout the world , the law of love Supplant the law of force ,  --  until the bonds That join a loving family together , Making their joys , griefs , aspirations one , Hold all the children of the common Father . ALICE . Alice You do not count , I fear , among your great The " illustrious women , " those who " raised themselves Above their sex , " as the historians tell us : That is to say , did almost as much mischief As if they had been men . These war-makers Are not your heroines , I suppose . HELEN . Helen As little As , in our own time , are those errant women Who think to imitate the faults of men Is to be sharers in their privileges . Not these ; but those who have the force to live Faithful to duty , duty absolute : Not asking whether men perform their part , But working out their own as unto God . What the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknowing their own work ,  --  What they began without support and singly , Following the law of God within their hearts , We must fulfil with higher consciousness , With deeper insight , and with greater concert . The incentives that men need to urge them on Are wanting , it is true , to woman : fame , Power , wide-spread influence , even the honest pleasure Found in free use of noble faculties , These are denied to her . Restrained and cramped In all her outward acts , she can not know The joys of self-possession ,  --  man 's great bliss ; She only claims those of renunciation . ALICE . Alice Claims ? I withdraw my claim , for one ! HELEN . Helen Yes , claims The glorious privilege of God 's commissioned : The right to live and work for others ' good , Requiring no return . This right the humblest May claim ; nor let the most endowed renounce it . If God bestows high gifts upon a woman , ' T is for His service , and His service only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laurels Men offer to their great , but , humbly stooping , Incline it to the crown of martyrdom . Thus did the faithful of the early time , Unseen , unpraised , and only dimly knowing Their sorrow was to work out others ' good .  --  Alice , what wastes of woe the mind runs over , As through man 's history it traces back The destiny of woman ! Think what grief Wrung those strong hearts that , generous to the selfish , To the false constant , to the brutal kind , Broke not , revenged not ! For one faithless Helen , One Clytemnestra who paid crime with crime , And earned a name with men , how many firm , Heroic hearts in stillness bore , returning Kindness for wrong , and hardly knew it wrong , So raised above the consciousness of self And self 's deserts were they ! There are who call These resolute , devoted women slaves ! ALICE . Alice And were they not ? I should have called them so . HELEN . Helen The service they gave was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Self-control , forbearance , Persistence , silent exercise of duty , Are these the attributes of servitude ? No ,  --  of free-will those generous hearts and strong Gave without stint their wealth and energy . Not servants they , but liberal benefactors ! Then first the woman sinks to the dependant , When , giving up her right to self-devotion , She seeks her ease , and strives in trifling pleasures To dissipate the energies that fret And waste her soul , supine in idleness ; Then , when , instead of giving , she asks ; then , when She puts her weakness forward as a pretext For duties unfulfilled , by flattery seeking , And feigned abasement , to usurp a power For selfish ends , which , wielded for the highest , She might possess of right ; then , when , a traitor To man , and to the Heaven-planted instinct That makes him see in her a second conscience , She gives him the reflection of his thought , And not the word God printed on her soul . The poor and lowly hold their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the others , Who , for a higher work , are left exempt From manual drudgery , how do they fulfil The task appointed them ? A fearful question , Which we shall all one day be called to answer ! ALICE . Alice If all can answer with as clear a conscience As you can , well for them ! HELEN . Helen Oh , Alice , no ! To be beloved is sweet . I would not lose Your dear affection . But what merit have I Even in the qualities you love in me ? They are a gift accorded like my wealth . What have I done , what have I borne , to earn Or what I have or what I am ? It must be , Alice , it must be God has duties for me : I even think I can discern the path He has ordained for me ; now only dimly ; But light will come . My life is in its morning . I but begin to understand myself And judge the world about me . I have passed Childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me now ; I hear its serious voice . This much is clear : in placid idleness I can not rest , while round about me lies A world of want and ignorance and pain ; My soul demands to labor in God 's vineyard . ALICE . Alice Have you not done so ? Have you not shed blessings Where'er your look has fallen ? If your power Were equal to your will , you would have made An earthly paradise of your plantation . You have done all but the impossible . Content yourself , for you have done enough . HELEN . Helen Enough to show me that I have done nothing : At best a tending of the sickly branches , While safe below a worm corrodes the root . God takes not from us superficial service : We must give all , or we have given nothing . ALICE . Alice Oh , to what heights of virtue would you soar ? I half forebode . But do you hope to drag My brother Herbert with you to the summit ? HELEN . Helen His heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ,  --  Like mine . ALICE , Alice aside . Have slept ,  --  but not like yours ! HELEN . Helen To him Will come the hour of waking , as to me . He , too , will feel the need to try his powers . His heart is generous , his spirit high . Have you forgotten with what zeal , what courage , He took the part of that poor , helpless man , Unjustly held a slave ? ALICE . Alice No ; I remember .  --  Aside . And so much penetration as she has , Yet does not see what I could see so plainly ! One half his zeal was nothing but resentment Against a man who 'd given him offence ; The other and the best half was desire To please herself ;  --  and it did more to win her Than his vows or her father 's arguments . HELEN , Helen smiling . He even overcame the indolence That my reproaches had assailed in vain . How hard he worked ! Oh , he has energy ! He only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside . You will suggest the first and give the last . Dear simpleton , how easily I read you ! But you are now his wife ,  --  not yet to win . So wise she is , so little worldly-wise ! HELEN . Helen These will not fail . Alice , what happiness , If I could labor hand in hand with Herbert For a great cause ! ALICE . Alice If ! HELEN . Helen I am not impatient . I shall not try to carry him by storm . I am content to work obscurely , slowly , Alone , if so it must be ,  --  but beginning What other hands , more strong , more free , will finish . What patience can , and what a resolute will , Tempered by meekness and by gentleness , That will I offer to the cause of right . But , oh , with him ! If I might work with him ! Then no conflicting duties in my heart Would waste my strength , no hampering doubts restrain ; My whole self I could render . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he let me dare them , And dare them with me ! ALICE . Alice Herbert ! HELEN . Helen Is not truth , When spoken by a loved and loving voice , Powerful ? And has not manly courage often Received its impulse , manly intellect Its inspiration , from a woman 's heart ? ALICE . Alice Enjoy your dreams : and yet they are but dreams , Like those your childhood and your early youth Pleased themselves with . These , in their turn , will yield With passing years to a new set of visions . Oh , woman 's dearest , truest friend is Fancy ! How could we bear our dreary lot without her ? She makes the whole world free to our cramped childhood ; She gives our youth noble , chivalric lovers ; She fills our tame , eventless lives with action , When , in our strength , the impulse to accomplish Spurs us , as men . Leave them realities ,  --  Their real toil , too real disappointments ! Give us the unreal that compensates all ! HELEN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet misleader ,  --  Have wandered through her flowery paths , have breathed The lulling airs of her enchanted realm . I , too , have soothed the longing of my soul With imaged deeds , inane activity . My soul awakes , and dreams content no more . ALICE . Alice Leave me my portion in the realm of visions !  --  O shadowy land , more true for us thy shadows , More satisfying , than the world of substance ! Oh , never shut us from thy refuge ! There Is our true home , our lost inheritance . In thee as yet the woman is unfallen : She stands erect and lifts her gaze to heaven ,  --  To a just heaven , that rewards her faith , Nor leaves to generous hopes and kindly deeds The blight of failure and ingratitude . No discord in thy regions , no frustration ! The fairy blossoms yield their fairy fruit , The imaged purpose finds ideal fulfilment ; All tends in order to its destined end . Why art thou not the true world ? Harmony And sequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and confusion , are not these negation ? It is so dear to live in truth and freedom ! Why must thy pure and heaven-lighted realm Alternate for us with a baser world ? HELEN , Helen taking her hand tenderly . Alice , these glimpses of a higher life , These transient flights to heaven , are granted us , Not that we should despise our earthly homes , And turn , reluctant , from our task-work here , But that with clearer faith and firmer courage We should confront our duty ,  --  bravely striving , Each in the measure of his strength , to make The real world conform to the ideal . ALICE . Alice You feel within yourself the force to strive Even for the unattainable . I do not . I will still dream myself to bliss , to power ,  --  Attaining in one rapid flight the goal Others may toil for through the dusty road And never come the nearer . And you , Helen , Will find this is but a more lively dream . I have had some myself that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . HELEN . Helen No dream ,  --  Nor altogether joyful and contenting , Like Fancy 's magic work . Severe it stands ,  --  An earnest purpose , but a human purpose , Subject to cross , delay , and disappointment . ALICE . Alice Be what you will , do what you will , my Helen , I only ask to love you , not to follow . Godspeed upon the path I shall not tread !  --  I go . I see you need repose . Besides , Your mother will be jealous , if I stay Longer with you . Oh , yes ! Archly . I know , I know ! Goes . HELEN , Helen alone . She , his adopted sister , doubts of him ! Turn not that way , my thoughts ! No ,  --  he is good And true and generous . He is very young , And so am I. We will grow up together : With every day shall see our duties clearer ; With every day gain greater strength for them .  --  Why is it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that should be brightest , dearest , The shadow of so deep a sadness falls ? Without my choice , unsubject to my will , Through my heart wander mournful melodies , Like the sad sighing of a wind-swept lyre . Is it foreboding ? false the prophecy That this same heart has made me until now ? Am I of those whose offered sacrifice Is not accepted ? Shall I live in vain ? Not mine the resolute effort , final triumph , But that most sorrowful of mortal dooms , Abortive toil , and pain without result ? Not this ! not this ! Oh , any fate but this !  --  After a few moments , fervently . Whether God call on me to do or bear , I only pray my hour may find me ready ! AFTERNOON . SCENE I. A part of the grounds from which the house is visible through the trees ; on the other side , a cluster of negro huts . Enter Woodford , a pale , care-worn man , with thin , gray hair . WOODFORD . Woodford This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is the mansion over there . Rich people . There 's the slaves ' quarter . Not a soul about ,  --  Not even a child . It is n't Sunday , is it ? No , the coach comes on Thursday . It is Friday . ' T was on a Friday  --  Never mind ,  --  leave that ! I 'm going to do the best I can .  --  If only I could find somebody to speak a word to !  --  What shall I ask ? Why , first for some refreshment . And , as I take it , I 'll find how the land lies . I can take time enough . I 'm not known here .  --  ' T is Friday , is it ? Have n't I always said I 'd not begin another job on Friday ?  --  Well , have the other days been luckier ? And then , that was n't luck . ' T was Satan 's tempting Brought that about .  --  Perhaps he 's at it now ! He wants his pay , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ? No , fool ! It is the fever Still flickering round my brain . All these queer fancies Are come of that .  --  But this fixed resolution To undo what I 've done , that 's not the fever . No , that is something else . Wherever ' t came from , It 's strong and steady ,  --  does not come and go Like sick-bed whims , but pricks and urges always .  --  But they were awful , though , those fever phantoms ! God , let them not come back ! I 'll keep them off , If a good life can do it . The first step In my new path I 'm taking now .  --  How many Years is it now since then ? Why , almost thirty ! Thirty ! ' T is late ! The girl was ten years old : Hard upon forty now . The babe a man . The mother  --  if I find her  --  over sixty . Well , how these thirty years have slid away ! Hard , bitter years , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look back upon , a misty dream ! And all the time I 've partly known ' t would come To this at last : but never found the day Until this day . And now it seems as if My penitence had followed straight my sin , And that , the deed scarce done , I can undo it . Not so ! not so ! The thirty years are there !  --  What 's that ? A harsh laugh is heard . Woodford turns and sees Dorcas , who comes out from behind a clump of trees . DORCAS . Dorcas Well done ! and so you 're here at last ! WOODFORD . Woodford You know me , then ? DORCAS . Dorcas Know you ? Do you know me ? WOODFORD . Woodford No.  --  Should I know you ?  --  Surely ' t is not  --  DORCAS . Dorcas Surely ! Surely as you are advertised in hell , My name is pasted up with yours . You 've had A mighty running spell of many years . But they 're upon your track ! They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! When you go home , I 'll follow . WOODFORD . Woodford Is all this real ? Mad old hag , speak plainer ! Are you , or are you not  --  DORCAS . Dorcas I am Pamela ,  --  Your slave , your tool once , as you thought . Your tempter Now know me , your employer ! ' T was through me , The Devil , our master , sent through me his order To you , his meaner servant . Was it so ? I spoke no word , I looked no look , but sent Straight from my heart the project into yours . Did you not struggle at first to keep it out ? Did it not creep , and creep , and wind itself , And make itself a home ? Ah , was it so ? And even when housed , had it not hid itself , And dwelt in the dark , torpid with shame and fear , If only your poor strength had nourished it ? Did you not feel the courage more than yours That braced you ? not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of decision , Gave the quick spur to your uncertain will ? WOODFORD , Woodford aside . Which of us is the mad one ? DORCAS . Dorcas Mine the deed . Mine the reward . What have you won by it ? Were you made richer by your stolen wealth ? Were you made happier ? Do not answer me . I know as well as you . I 've followed you . I 've seen how your tormented , anxious brain Refused to do for you its former work , Leaving the duper to become the dupe . I 've known the quailings of your feeble heart , And held you at a distance by my will . Had you not been here sooner without that ? Look at me , man ! This is not now the form That woman wore whom you thought your accomplice : Yet not unknown to you this haggard face , Nor do these wild eyes now first look in yours . Have they not watched your bed and met your waking ? Is not this shrivelled hand the same that pointed Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsealed ? Is not this voice Known the familiar haunter of your dreams ? Speak not ! I know ! When your look fell on me , It saw made real a phantom of the night . I know what purpose brings you here to-day . You have tracked out your victims . You have come To learn the issue of your crime ; to offer  --  If without too much danger  --  late atonement . WOODFORD . Woodford Oh , late indeed ! If only not too late ! DORCAS . Dorcas Of that you shall be judge . WOODFORD , Woodford aside . That hideous smile !  --  Aloud . Is death beforehand with my slow repentance ? DORCAS . Dorcas Death was beforehand even with my vengeance . The woman who had wronged me , she who called Upon her own and on her children 's head The doom of which you were the instrument , Had hardly lifted to her lips the cup My hatred offered , ere she sank away And passed beyond my reach . WOODFORD . Woodford And she had wronged you , That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basely . That is no interest of yours . Ask on Of what concerns you . WOODFORD , Woodford aside . So the mother died . Poor soul ! poor soul ! She had been dead ere this , In any case ,  --  she had such feeble health . And then my task is easier as it is . The children will not recollect .  --  Let 's see . My name appeared not . I took all precautions . I may , perhaps , repair , and not confess .  --  Aloud . And  --  and the boy ? What can you tell of him ? DORCAS . Dorcas Nothing of him . My child was not a boy . WOODFORD . Woodford Nothing ? He is not here ?  --  The most important ! DORCAS . Dorcas To you perhaps , but not to me . The girl Stood in the place of mine . I stuck to her . It was her fate I wished to live upon . WOODFORD . Woodford They were not kept together ? DORCAS . Dorcas Surely not . Why should they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I. And even if they had been , They had been parted now at all events . You did not look to find a full-grown man Tied to his sister 's apron-string or mine ? WOODFORD . Woodford Ah , to be sure ! And you can give no clue ? DORCAS . Dorcas How should I give one ? Do I read the papers ? Do I attend the auctions ? Do I deal In human flesh that never injured me ? You that are always buying and selling should tell Each other what you want to know , not bother Those that do n't mix themselves in your affairs .  --  Aside . What matter is the boy ? Why do n't he ask About things worth the knowing ? WOODFORD , Woodford aside . I must search . Without the boy how can I make a stir ?  --  Aloud . The girl ? She lives ? DORCAS . Dorcas She lives . WOODFORD . Woodford And here ? DORCAS . Dorcas And here . WOODFORD . Woodford What has her fate been ?  --  Has she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistress than she is a servant . WOODFORD . Woodford What does that mean ? DORCAS . Dorcas She is not over useful . Her free blood boils in her . WOODFORD . Woodford It is not quelled After so many years ? DORCAS . Dorcas It had been so , Perhaps , if she had stayed where you first left her . That had been well . And yet what is is better . WOODFORD . Woodford How came she here ? DORCAS . Dorcas By Satan 's work , and mine . You know what house this is ? WOODFORD . Woodford A Mr. Stanley 's . DORCAS , Dorcas aside . That 's all he knows .  --  Aloud . Right .  --  Aside . All he need to know !  --  Aloud . How did you come to find us out ? WOODFORD . Woodford I learned You had been sold to somebody named Stanley . I 've searched the country over for the Stanleys . This is the third . DORCAS . Dorcas The right one . Now ask on . I 'm here to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have told you . Ask the rest . WOODFORD . Woodford Has she  --  is she  --  has she been married ? DORCAS . Dorcas No . WOODFORD . Woodford I breathe ! At least that 's well ! DORCAS . Dorcas Well that her child Has ne'er a father ? WOODFORD . Woodford Child ? She has a child ? DORCAS . Dorcas And that child one .  --  Well , is atonement easy ? If ' t were , you 'd not been here . Is pardon easy ? WOODFORD , Woodford aside . Not even human pardon ! The divine How shall I win ? Atonement is denied ! DORCAS . Dorcas Go seek the boy , if your sin prick too sharp . Your tardy penitence may profit him . He can be cleansed . His shame will slip from him , With the slave 's name , like a snake 's cast-off skin . But as for these , though you heaped proof on proof , Their friends would never find it clear enough : They 'd sooner leave them as they are than own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . I 'll find the boy alone . I can not help these . If I save but one , It will be much . I shall have done my best . DORCAS . Dorcas Go seek the boy . You have your story ready : You are the faithful steward , who , escaping By miracle from shipwreck , mourned as dead His master 's family ,  --  until , by chance Coming years afterward to a suspicion That all had not been lost , searched out the matter , And found that the poor , foreign , orphan children Had been confounded with the straying negroes . WOODFORD , Woodford aside . Does her mind give back mine , or do my thoughts Spring from her brain , that thus she mimics me ? DORCAS . Dorcas Go seek the boy . And yet think well ! Sharp scent Will follow up the traces you point out . Not life alone , nor freedom , is in question ,  --  But house and lands ; and these wake keen debate . They will not take his birth upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch , Think you they 'll miss your part in his adventures ,  --  In his and theirs ? WOODFORD , Woodford aside . She 's right . Concealment would Be fruitless , and would take from me all merit . No !  --  total silence , or a full disclosure ! A full disclosure ,  --  that will be the shortest ! And seeing that I am not forced to this , But come of my free will to offer it , They will not be too hard on me , old man As I am now and tottering to the grave . DORCAS . Dorcas I charge you , think before the step is taken ! She 's dead , the feeble one . She might have pardoned , In pity of your suffering , and in thanks Even for her children 's late deliverance . But think you those who 're ousted for their sake And forced to own relations that disgrace them Will overflow with gratitude to you ? They 'll vent , in form of judgment on your crime , Their rage at you for trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would that judgment be ? A prison ?  --  Death ! I could have borne imprisonment ; but death  --  I can not face it ,  --  my crime half redeemed ,  --  Perhaps not that . DORCAS . Dorcas Look well before you leap ! You 'll only run your neck into the noose , And give no help to those you die for . WOODFORD , Woodford aside . Die ? I can not die ! Oh , I must have more time ! I must consider . I must look about me . I 'll search the boy out , and determine after . DORCAS . Dorcas They 'll take your guilt at your own word . Not so The rights of those you wronged . These will but find Their lot more bitter as audacious claimants Than as submissive servants . Let them be . What 's done is done . WOODFORD , Woodford aside . For me , as well as them ! No hope for them , and no return for me ! DORCAS . Dorcas For you , as well as them ! WOODFORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Was not Judas penitent ? Did he not offer back the thirty pieces ? And did that hinder Satan 's getting him ? Weak fool ! there is no safety in repentance : It is in courage and in obstinacy . I 'm safe . I know I 'm Satan 's , and obey him . He aids me here , and on the other side Has a snug corner ready waiting for me . You would call God your master and serve Satan ; And so you anger both and get but blows And curses from both sides , no pay from either .  --  But you are what you are , and can not mend it ! WOODFORD . Woodford Leave me ! I am on earth still , and the demons Have no right yet to haunt me ! DORCAS . Dorcas And no power ? WOODFORD . Woodford Must I still bear this burden ? DORCAS . Dorcas You must bear it Until I bid you lay it down . WOODFORD , Woodford with sudden anger . Till you ? DORCAS . Dorcas Smooth out your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work I gave you . You would threaten me ! What can you do to me , for whom life has No hopes , and death no fears ? ' T is you that tremble , Knowing in me the owner of your secret ! WOODFORD , Woodford aside . Has she , perhaps , intention to forestall me , And rob me of the merit of repentance ?  --  Aloud . I wronged you once , ' t is true . I broke my promise . DORCAS . Dorcas I never had expected else of you . If I had wanted what you promised me , I had found means to make you keep your word . It was not freedom I desired , but vengeance . You gave me what I sought . You 're safe from me , Unless you threaten . That I bear not . I 'm Wiser than you , have better friends and stronger . Even the good the angels ca n't protect , If I , poor Dorcas , set about their ruin . It seems that the God Christ has little power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But mine is prince of this world and the lower . You have no aid nor helper here nor yonder . Dorcas goes , waving her hand with a gesture of disdain . WOODFORD . Woodford The torturing hag ! her power is more than earthly ! When I walked hither in the pleasant morning , It almost seemed that peace awaited me Under the shade of these tall trees , that stretched Their friendly arms as if inviting me To a still sanctuary where my soul Would find itself delivered from its guilt . Oh , mockery ! This is no sacred grove , Or to avenging furies dedicated .  --  ..... O gentle mother ! who , in our still home Lying away amid New England hills , Once laid together my infant hands in prayer ! O rigid father ! who accounted crime A Sunday laugh , a truant hour from school ! O timid sister ! bold , through love of me , To win the pardon of my childish sins ! Well that the grass is growing on your graves !  --  O childhood scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift your tender images , More torturing than memories of crime , Before my sullied , shrinking soul ? Hence ! hence ! Leave me to fiends whom I give hate for hate ! But take away those cruel loving eyes That madden me with their sad tenderness !  --  Come back , accomplice of my guilt ! come back ! You I can look on !  --  Bring your maledictions , My victims ! I can bear your presence better Than solitude possessed by grieving spectres That point me to my time of innocence !  --  They have dispersed before that invocation . The gentler demons shrink before the fiercer . Remorse awakes , and keen-eyed Retribution , Watching secure , with menacing eyes , its prey . Familiar fiends ! and how exorcise you ? You flit not , frightened like the milder phantoms . There are no stronger demons left to summon . What spell has power with you , O grim companions ? Once more the oracle within my heart , Not cheeringly , but sternly now , makes answer : Atonement !  --  word of hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again , Atonement ! Is there hope still , then ? Would the hidden voice , That seems the voice of my most intimate self , Mock me with falsehood ? Yet how make atonement For guilt whose fruit admits no remedy ? If to repair stand not within thy power , Then cleanse thy soul at least by expiation . By expiation ! It must come to that !  --  Not yet ! not yet !  --  Oh , cowardice ! oh , weakness ! No ,  --  I must struggle more , must suffer more , Before my feeble , vacillating will Resolve at last to end my spirit 's torture By expiation ,  --  fruitless for my victims !  --  Will even expiation be accepted ?  --  Selfish , Perhaps , this haste to set my soul at ease . Let me think calmly . Who would make a search For the lost boy so zealously as I should ? Who with such chances of success as I ? I will put off the moment of confession Till I have found him out . His wretched sister Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , On this new quest ! I shall at least have respite While the search lasts . And now let me retreat By the same road I came .  --  ' T is fortunate I have been seen by no one but Pamela . They would not know me . No ,  --  but they might read A guilty secret written on my face . He disappears among the trees , looking about him cautiously . SCENE II . A negro cabin . Perdita seated near a bed on which lies a dead child . She chants in a subdued tone . PERDITA . Perdita There liest thou low , my own sweet , blighted flower ! No care of mine can make thee bloom again ! Passed from my life is that dear , transient joy ,  --  The sole that opened on this path of pain ! But thou , pure being ! some far , happy land Has surely won thee to its golden bowers ! While here my heavy heartbeats count the time , Lightly for thee flit by the laughing hours ! Were it but so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain , could I but know thee blest ! Alas ! alas ! I see a pallid shade Wandering through space and nowhere finding rest ! To the proud heaven of thy father 's sires Dar'st thou , poor trembling one , thy look to raise ? In vain ! in vain ! their cold blue Saxon eyes Look sternly down upon thy pleading gaze ! Stand'st thou a suppliant near the dusky land Where Africa 's swart sons their Eden hold ? No room for thee ! They read thy alien blood On thy pale cheek and locks of waving gold . Oh , everywhere repelled ! In God 's wide world Hast thou no home ? Does heaven deny its joy ? Is there no bosom pitiful and kind To fold thee till I come , my outcast boy ? Ah , there is One who trod this earthly path With bleeding feet ,  --  who knew our grief , our shame ! He was rejected and despised . Seek Him ! Full surely He will not deny thy claim ! Thou crucified and mocked ! a mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O Jesus ! by that heart that ached to Thine , Suffer my little child to come to Thee ! Dorcas enters and stands in the doorway , regarding Perdita , who remains motionless . DORCAS , Dorcas aside . A ray of sunshine almost fell on you , Poor cellar-plant ! but my dark shadow came Between you and its warmth . Pine on ! dwarf on ! Who knows where pines and dwarfs a fairer flower Than ever you had claim to , swarthy Hecate ! How she sits , still and tearless ! Is he dead ?  --  Approaching the bed ; aloud . Did your Miss Helen send the medicines ? Perdita makes a negative sign with her head . I knew she would not ! Had you been a lady , He had been living now , your boy , and playing . What care ! what thought ! how had the doctors come And stood about him , studying how to save him ! Think you now , if Miss Helen 's child were sick , They 'd let him die for want of help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born to wealth , and mine to woe . God made it so . I do not strive with Him . And then Miss Helen is so kind and good ! I would not have her feel what I am feeling , Not even to save myself !  --  Yet look at him ! Is he not fair ? Her baby is not fairer ? DORCAS , Dorcas fiercely . How dare you set yourself above your caste ? What are you better than another slave ? So , so ! your white blood gives you all this pride ! PERDITA . Perdita I am not proud ,  --  or only proud of him ; And he is not . Oh , be not harsh with me ! I am but what you made me ,  --  and the Lord . DORCAS . Dorcas I made you ?  --  Yes , child , you are what I made you ! You never spoke a truer word than that ! Angrily . But what are you , to look with scorn on color ? For all your pride and all your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look here ! Compare your arm with mine ! Is it not darker ? PERDITA , Perdita absently . Different . DORCAS , Dorcas fiercely You bussy ! dare you tell me so ?  --  Different ? And well it may be different , Our rich brown skin , from that of Europe 's outcasts ! Ours has the soft , warm tint the sun lays on , And the blood courses rich and pure beneath it : Their creeping blood , a turbid , dingy liquor , Gives their thin skin its own unwholesome hue . My mother was a princess in her land ; My father was a nobleman in his . I was not born upon this vulgar soil ! PERDITA , Perdita imploringly . Dorcas ! not now ! not now ! my heart is sore ! DORCAS , Dorcas lowering her tone . It had been sorer , had your baby lived ! Bitterly , but almost with a touch of softness . You 'll give him to the kind embracing earth , That folds her arms about the friendless outcast As tenderly as round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no tomb Divides him from her with its marble coldness ; The summer sun sends its warm rays to him ; The birds sing morning hymns above his bed ; The springing flowers bend tenderly about it . Lay him to rest , and let your heart rest too ! PERDITA . Perdita Dorcas , dear Dorcas ! you speak soothing to me ! Say on ! say on ! oh , I have need of it ! I never had another mother , Hecate Would never let me call her so . ' T was you That watched me when I was as young as this one . DORCAS . Dorcas Watched you ? and tenderly ? You 'll not say that ? PERDITA . Perdita Oh , the first taste I had of life was bitter ! You know it , Dorcas . Never look of love Or word of kindness ! ' T is not to reproach you ,  --  I am too broken for that . And your last words , Were they not almost kind ? Say on ! say on ! And only let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she who had a right to call me mother Slept deeply as this little one , I might Receive another to my heart . Till then It waits for her . PERDITA . Perdita You have a daughter ?  --  where ? DORCAS . Dorcas Where ? and you ask me where ? I hear her call me On every wind . At times I hear her laugh Ring out clear , happy ; and at times her shriek Is borne to me upon the midnight blast . Whence ? If I knew it , were I here ? What chains Could hold , what dangers keep me back ? PERDITA . Perdita Oh , none ! None even such a feeble thing as I am ! And you !  --  And you have lost her ? Not by death ? DORCAS . Dorcas She was sent from me by a woman 's whim , A woman 's spite . My daughter was too pretty ; She sang too sweetly ; was too like her own . PERDITA . Perdita Oh , Dorcas , had I known what you have suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your harshness ! DORCAS . Dorcas Keep back your love ! I will have none of it !  --  But bless your God for this calm sleep , this safety . He is beyond their reach . PERDITA . Perdita Oh , let me love you ! DORCAS . Dorcas I will not ! PERDITA . Perdita Dorcas , oh , I must love something ! It is so empty here ! putting her hand to her breast . DORCAS . Dorcas Love your own mother ! She 's beautiful , and I am old and hateful ! PERDITA . Perdita She 's beautiful . Alas , I can not love her ! She awes me back , more than you frighten me . DORCAS . Dorcas Live , then , alone , like me ! ' T is Heaven 's justice ,  --  Or Hell 's ; your God 's or mine ! Live , then , alone ! Let your youth wither and your heart grow stone ! This was a warmer heart that now is flint ! PERDITA . Perdita Dorcas , I pity you . Give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us so lonely ! DORCAS . Dorcas You hate ! You can not hate ! You have not force ! Therefore I tell you that you ought to hate me . Her blood is in your veins who was the cause That I am standing here alone and loveless . Now offer me again your love , your pity ! PERDITA . Perdita Her blood is mine ! Whom can you mean ? Not Hecate ? DORCAS . Dorcas And if not Hecate , then another . Ask not . PERDITA . Perdita And what if one akin to me have wronged you ? Why should that hinder me to pity you ? DORCAS . Dorcas I did not wait for pity , empty pity . I have had vengeance , girl ! I have had vengeance ! There is not one of all your blood and race , From her proud sister to that nameless windfall , That has not felt it ! PERDITA . Perdita Dorcas , do not tell me That you have wrought him harm ? DORCAS . Dorcas I will not tell you ! PERDITA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ? DORCAS . Dorcas No , no ! A stupid vengeance ! Could I send the life Back to his veins , I 'd do it for her sake Who made me childless with a living child ! PERDITA . Perdita Speak not so loud in presence of my dead ! DORCAS . Dorcas Even you have courage to defend your child !  --  You feared that I had power to work my threat And give him back his life ? PERDITA . Perdita No : only God Can do that , and He will not . But lay not The touch of hatred on that innocent form ! Let him at least lie in his grave in peace , Nor take a curse to sleep with him ! DORCAS . Dorcas It needs not My touch to ban him . On your race there rests A curse that will not pass . Above the earth Or under it , ' t will find them out . PERDITA . Perdita You have Great power , they say . I would not anger you . I will be humble to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always was till now . DORCAS . Dorcas Poor creeping coward ! only out of fear You speak me fair . I see your guile , you reptile ! Your baseness does but tempt the crushing foot . I would not spare you , if I could , one pang . But I have now no power to save or smite . The curse was sent forth by a frenzied heart ; And where it fell , it clings and burns , like vitriol , That the hand casts , but casts without recall .  --  If I could pity , ' t is the haughty Hecate , Who does not know what cause she has to hate me , But loathes by instinct . I can scan her heart , And read my own in her fierce agonies . I know what ' t is to have a child not mine : What ' t is to feel the bitter love turn hate Through mere foreboding ; that hate change to love Again , to passionate , wild love , when comes The black hour of fulfilment . This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel For once the clasping of a mother 's arms , For once to read a mother 's grief and love Upon the face of her who gave you birth ! PERDITA . Perdita Oh , let it come that once , whatever follow ! DORCAS . Dorcas It will , be sure ! The hour of separation Will give you , when it takes from you , a mother !  --  The sun is setting . See the lengthened shadows ! How bright it is without ! how dingy here ! There 's hardly light enough to see your child . Heed that the demons take him not away And leave a vampire in his place ! Such things Do happen , you know . I 'll go and beg two candles Up at the house , to light your watch . Thus much I 'll do for you , though you are Hecate 's child . With the first daylight we will make for him A little grave and lay a stone on it , Where you may sit at night and talk to him , While yet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The hour of parting comes ,  --  the hour of parting From all you love , the living and the dead ! Hecate must know what I have known , and you Have to live out again my daughter 's sorrows . An exile she ; an exile you must be ! PERDITA . Perdita The living and the dead ! Lost she her dead ? I must go forth and leave his grave untended ? DORCAS . Dorcas You must . ' T is writ . And by this sign I know My daughter 's child sleeps in a lonely grave . Going , she looks back . Outside your threshold , in a sheltered place , Lay privately some valued thing . The demon , Lurking to catch the spirit of your child , Will take your gift in ransom . See to it ! Goes . EVENING . Scene Scene .  --  The glade in the wood . Moonlight . Groups of slaves , as in the First Scene of Morning . In the foreground , towards the left , Sordel leans against a tree . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among whom are Melas , Flora , Roxana , Peter , Chloe , Daffy , and others . MELAS . Melas Sordel 's himself to-night .

Uncle Peter , Tell us , tell truly now , were Oscar 's rhymes Much sweeter to the ear and to the heart Than our Sordel 's ? PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Oscar , the famous singer ? MELAS . Melas That died last year . PETER . Peter That died last year indeed ! He died full twenty years ago . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Not so . MELAS , Melas to Pyrrhus . Do n't contradict him . He is old . PETER . Peter Old ? Oscar ? He was already old when I was young . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus He never came to this plantation ? PETER . Peter Never . Folks came from far and near to him , but he Never stirred foot except to seek the wood Where he wove baskets and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , he loved the pine . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Sang he so well ? PETER . Peter Boy , I will tell you this : What music is , what song is , none of you Born in these days can ever know nor will . We have had singers ; but their race is out . Sordel does well . For those who have not heard What I have heard ,  --  yes , and for those who have , He brings a pleasant hour . But , in my youth ! Nor do I now mean Oscar . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus We may have As good as he some day . PETER . Peter Speak soberly . You know not what you talk of . Never ear Nor heart will know such strains again . They say His mother was a wonder-working woman , Who , by strange arts and heathenish devices , Brought with her from the other side the world , Compelled the spirits of the air to teach him Tones never heard before from mortal lips . Men listened at the peril of their souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Oscar like ? PETER . Peter I can remember him still straight and tall . His cheek was thin ; his brow was seamed ; his eye Bright with a gleam that was not earth 's ,  --  nor heaven 's . MELAS . Melas The secret of his skill is lost ? PETER . Peter Oh , boy , You would not search for it ? Know you the price He paid for it ? The cruel Unseen Powers Took back their gifts , and took his spirit with them . Full twenty weary years the body lingered  --  Trying to die  --  after the soul had left it . DAFFY , Daffy to Chloe . Is all this true ? CHLOE . Chloe People believed so once . PETER . Peter But we had other singers in our time , Not aided by black arts , whose every song Was worth a year full of the idle piping That men delight in now . And farther back There were still greater . In my father 's day , For instance  --  MELAS . Melas Uncle Peter , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours In rhyme and music . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus There was little work , They tell us , in those times ; and ease is songful . MELAS . Melas And then they had a language of their own , Those older singers , and strains brought from far : The language and the strains their mothers taught them . For those who listened and for those who sang , Voices of home and happy childhood mingled With the sweet melody . This made it sacred . And therefore has their memory passed to us Hallowed and dear . Those precious songs are lost : Or , if of some the words remain , the sense Is hid ; there 's no one to interpret it . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Perhaps we shall be boasting to our children Of what our music was ! PETER . Peter ' T is like you may . That does n't make it better now . FLORA . Flora Oh , Pyrrhus , Do n't anger the old man ! And all agree These times are not like those . MELAS . Melas Sordel himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Yet we have those who suit us and our time . MELAS . Melas Who put our thoughts in words for us ,  --  who tell us What we have felt , but knew not how to speak . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Just so it is . When I have heard Sordel , Or sometimes Daniel , I have felt my thought Set in his verse . It moved so easily , I wondered how I missed the words he found . FLORA . Flora We have our sacred songs , which , if they speak not Of a lost home , tell of a home to find . Let us not envy other times or people . Jubal enters from the left , in a cloak . He approaches , unnoticed , the group in the foreground , and listens to their conversation with a pleased and paternal expression . CHLOE . Chloe Sordel must sing again . These old-world stories Are not so cheering as his songs . FLORA . Flora Ask , Melas . MELAS , Melas approaching Sordel . So still , Sordel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cordial of your music . My heart 's still beating time to your last song . Sordel does not answer . MELAS , Melas returning to Flora . I dare not urge . He 's tired , or else unhappy . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus He must be happy as a mortal can be ! CHLOE . Chloe He could be happier ; for he could be rich . He only has his song . MELAS . Melas Is song not riches ? JUBAL Jubal lays his hand on the shoulder of Melas and nods to him , smiling pleasantly . He then throws off his cloak and discovers a stringed instrument , of a quaint form , ornamented with rude carvings . As he tunes his instrument , he addresses Melas in a sort of recitative . Who should answer , if not I ? I read your longing in your eye . Boy , this riches they who covet , To win it , only need to love it : But bodly , strongly ; for our art Smiles never on the faint of heart . He preludes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is richer than the singer ? Though he have not lands nor gold , Yet the wealth his fancies hold Is more than miser ever told . Who is richer than the singer ? Is it , then , the foolish clinger To the treasures of the ground , With long toil and stooping found , And which , gathered , are to keep At cost of joy and cost of sleep ? Ask their owner which most hard , To earn his thousands or to guard ? Interlude . Ah , the singer 's treasures rare Come without his thought or care ! It is ordered , everything Shall to him a tribute bring . And he sits a tranquil king , With his realm about him spread , While the gentle and the dread , The uncomely and the fair , The abounding and the bare , With a smile or with a frown , Duly lay their offering down . Joyful sunshine , mournful shade , False abyss and open glade , Wasting flood and fertile shower , Blasted trunk and budding flower , Glaring sand-plain , forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister to him . Breezes on the bending grass Leave a token as they pass ; Floating islands of the sky Waft a gift as they sail by ; Silver brooklets , chiming sweet , Lay their music at his feet ; Watchers by the brooded nest Give the gladness of their breast ; Shedding rose and fading leaf Make an offering of their grief : No shape or life in earth or space But knows him there and does him grace . Interlude . Has the singer greater pain To keep his fortune than to gain ? How should he from riches part Who has his treasury in his heart ? All remain silent for a moment , then MELAS . Melas He is not poor , nor are they poor who hear him ! FLORA . Flora Blessed is song ! What were the world without it ? JUBAL , Jubal sings . Who is rich , if not the singer ? Is he not the joyful bringer Of the best things mortals know ? How should he such gifts bestow , If Heaven had not loved him best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What would you have known of Beauty , If the singer had not brought Down from heaven that pearly thought ? How learned you the name of Duty ? Did that diamond pure and fine Not lie buried in its mine , Until his divining dream Opened the secret of its gleam ? Your existence , rudely wrought Of coarse iron , being fraught With the light those jewels shed , Seemed from that hour with silver spread . Interlude . Lands and gold Make hard and cold . But the singer 's wealth makes tender . He can be a liberal spender , Nor yet see his storehouse bare . When the poor have had their share , Still he has , and has to spare . Shut out none With walls of stone ! All may rob him at their pleasure ; For when all enjoy his treasure , Still it is not less his own . Jubal throws his cloak over his shoulders and is about to go . The people , who stand for a moment , still wrapt in his song after it has ceased , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JUBAL . Jubal Let me go , children ! You have had of me All I am worth . The music , not the case , Is your affair . When you have had the grain , Let the wind sweep the husk off . My last song I leave with you . Sordel comes forward , takes the old man 's hand reverently , presses it to his heart , then to his lips , and returns to his place by the tree . VOICES . Voices But who ? But whence ? What name ? Oh , when we tell the story of this day , What is that name that we would least forget ? JUBAL . Jubal And do you know me not without my name ? I am that Jubal whom you all have heard of ,  --  Vowed , with the Christian water that washed off The Cain and fallen man in me , to service Of instruments of wind and string . These pipes He takes a set of rude pipes from his bosom . Were my first organ . While all yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , Not knowing what I did . They touched my lips ,  --  I felt the Spirit move upon my being , Composing to their place the jarring parts . And now it breathed through me and there was light ! That radiant day ! its joy can thrill me yet ! After , came to me new and new creations , Each more complete ; and last of all was born This human gift of melody in speech , Which when I won , the song that only breathed Seemed like the mute prayer of the dumber creatures For freer voice , which I put up no more . Then did the harp , to which I was baptized Not less than to the pipes , invite my hand , And offer its sweet tinklings to attend As wingd air-sprites on my mounting words . He raises the pipes to his lips , and then replaces them in his bosom . Yet do I keep my earliest consoler Nearer my heart than any newer joy . VOICES . Voices Jubal ! MELAS . Melas We should have known you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melas And yet you look much younger than you can be . JUBAL . Jubal My son , I am yet younger than appears . I never learned to count my age by years . While swift thoughts visit me , fresh fancies gladden ,  --  While hope can charm me still , and memory sadden ,  --  While still my heart to the old friends is true , And yet gives hearty welcome to the new ,  --  While praise and shame my spirit load or lighten ,  --  While every change has power to shade or brighten ,  --  May I not claim , without offence to truth , Though seventy years oppose , I hold my youth ? FLORA , Flora laughing . He is as young as any one of us . How bright his eye is ! His foot pats the ground , Timing his words now , as before his music . MELAS , Melas to Jubal . Why sing you , then , for the last time to-day ? JUBAL . Jubal If from this day I cease to pour my song , It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would lay the harp down ere my hand Forget its cunning . I would have the echo Of my last song die sweetly on the ear , And die regretted . MELAS . Melas And so it would , whenever ! ROXANA . Roxana I should have known you , Jubal . I remember , On the great wedding-day , that you came down To our plantation with your master then , Ours now . JUBAL . Jubal He was not even then my master . And I might say I never had a master . I was your master 's mother 's . When she went , She left me unto hands as weak as hers ; And they , with loving thanks for loving service , Gave me the freedom I had never missed . Now I belong only to God and music . VOICES . Voices Come back , then ! oh , come back ! Your home is here ! JUBAL . Jubal And would you have me turn her gift against her ? And who shall tend for me that ailing boy , When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long nights short for him by reading , tireless Through double love of him and of the page ? This place is dear ; I love the very ground ; For it was here that I was called and chosen . But when Miss Cora bade me hence with her , How could I let her go where all was strange , And I to stay , not knowing if she missed me ? Besides , I thought new climates and new scenes Might give me higher thoughts and richer fancies . And then , she knew one music from another . So I consented , and my choice was blest . For , after that , I made this happy harp ,  --  The third and best ,  --  I played it at her wedding , And at your master 's . Those were its great days . But no rejoicing in our neighborhood For twenty years it has not shared and heightened . It never sounded yet for your Miss Helen ; But when I heard her son , the heir , should come To the old place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine must aid the welcome . And from this day I do devote to silence Strings that have never spoken but for joy : I will not further tempt their luck , nor mine . VOICES . Voices But stay ! but stay ! FLORA . Flora We have not thanked you yet . JUBAL . Jubal I gave but what was given me for you . I should have wronged you , had I kept it from you . MELAS , Melas detaining him . Does he for whom the earth and air have gifts Wrong , if he hold them for his lonely use ? JUBAL . Jubal If the flowers wither in the selfish hand , If the song die within the stifling heart , It shall be answered for , young man ! And therefore Have these flowers thorns for those who share them not , This song afflicts the breast where it is pent . For God is oftener gracious in the pain We pray to Him may pass than in the ease We note not to give thank for . FLORA . Flora He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand to Melas . Who struggles with dumb music in his breast , Give it but way and let his soul have rest ! PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Jubal ! a pleasant name ! MANY , Voices to Roxana . Oh , tell us of him ! ROXANA . Roxana I saw him only once , before to-day , As I have told you : at my mistress ' wedding . VOICES . Voices But why , but why came he not back to us ? ROXANA . Roxana Our master 's mother left him to her sister . FLORA . Flora Our mistress would have valued him as much . ROXANA . Roxana She heard him but that once , and had Theresa . FLORA . Flora We have Sordel . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus What can we ask for more ? PETER . Peter I fear , I fear , this Jubal is too jovial ! I have known many singers in my day : They 're sad and silent when they do not sing . FLORA . Flora Sordel is so : that shows him the right sort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no other . SORDEL Sordel comes forward , preludes and sings . Would you the singer 's feeling trace ? Then take not for the true The mood that 's written on his face , But that he wakes in you . Not on his brow the sunshine lies , Not there the shadow rests ; His joys shine out from other eyes , His griefs swell other breasts . Nor trust his verse ; that , too , beguiles ; But the heart 's echo hear : For sorrow often speaks in smiles , And gladness through a tear . If , when his song pours light and free , Your hearts uncheered remain , ' T is that the careless melody Springs from a heart in pain . Or do the faintly murmured words Breathe of delight and rest , Though plaintive as the song of birds Above the guarded nest ? ' T is that the spirit 's truth destroys The fond dissembler 's art : His strain reveals the tender joys That nestle in his heart . PYRRHUS , Pyrrhus to Peter . How does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candor . Well . I do n't refuse to listen to your songs Because I have heard better . I 'm not proud . Enter Milo , chanting in a loud , sonorous voice . As he proceeds , the rest become silent , one after another , until the attention of all is turned upon him . He advances towards the foreground . MILO . Milo Great house , great barn , great coach , great trees , great lands , All his ! and then , all his these heaps of hands ! And he to leave all this and go away ? No , do n't believe it ! no , he means to stay ! VOICES . Voices What is he talking of ? Who go ? All these Are our own master 's : house , barn , land , and trees . What can it mean ? He leave and go away ? It is impossible ! MILO . Milo Why , so I say . Who knows if in the world he comes to next He 'll have first choice ? How would his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , it found It was to harrow , not to have the ground ! VOICES . Voices What can it be ? It 's terrible , this doubt ! OTHER VOICES . Other Voices Come to it , then ! Whose soul ? Whose soul ? Speak out ! MILO . Milo Such things have happened , so they say , and worse . A heavy tombstone is a heavy purse . This lifetime 's gold weighs down the dead man so , His spirit can not stretch its wings to go To the best world , but , dragged and pulled , must fall Right through the earth , to the worst place of all ! FLORA . Flora What are we going to hear ? My heart stands still ! ROXANA . Roxana Something has happened ! Is it good or ill ? MILO . Milo The shapes of all the pleasures he has known Keep by his side , although no more his own ; Their ghosts seek his , and beckoning , mocking , taunt Him who once haunted them , whom now they haunt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were they not , What , then , has heaven that he has not got ? Had he but all to gain , as you and I !  --  No , no ! be sure he does not mean to die ! VOICES . Voices Die ? BOAZ , Boaz enters . Will he die ? I heard that he was ill Only this moment , and come here to tell you . VOICES . Voices Who ill ? The master ill ? And like to die ? PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus He like to die ? So bright and well this morning ! How did it happen ? BOAZ . Boaz ' T was a sudden seizure . The doctor says there 's hope , and only hope . VOICES . Voices What will become of us ? So good a master ! ANOTHER VOICE . Voice But , if he dies , Miss Helen is our mistress . Philip enters , and joins the group in the foreground . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Our mistress . But her husband is our master . Is he good , think you ? MELAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else she had n't had him . PYRRHUS , Pyrrhus to Philip . But you know him . You 've seen him at his place . He 's a good master ? PHILIP . Philip Ah ,  --  a good master ? Yes . But not like ours . He has a rather short way with his people : A little high or so . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus That 's what I thought . I 've seen him often here as boy and man . He always had a brisk , short way with us . But when he 'd got Miss Helen 's promise safe , He came out stronger . PHILIP . Philip Well , that 's natural , Being sure , you know . But after all , he 's good . He holds no close grip on his purse ,  --  that 's one thing . MELAS . Melas No , he 's free-handed . I 've had proof of that . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus We 'll not be stinted , then ? CHLOE . Chloe No , we 'll have plenty ,  --  Meat , clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't say , No . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus If he 's free-handed , That 's all I ask . PETER . Peter You 're young and rash , my boy ! Not the free spenders are the best for us ; The close ones may be safest in the end . I 've seen the world . I 'm not much over sixty ; I 've had four changes . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Each time for the better . PETER . Peter Well , that 's true , too : each time except the first . I 've had my troubles . But I hope they 're over . If this storm blows by , as I think it will , I hope I 'll end my days in peace . The master Is young yet ,  --  much too young to die . MELAS . Melas Miss Helen Stays with him all the time ? PHILIP . Philip Miss Helen and Hecate . The mistress falls from one faint to another . ROXANA . Roxana The mistress ! I must go to her at once ! But whose will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hers , or shall we be Miss Helen 's ? PETER . Peter We shall be hers . Stick you by those you 're born with ; Do n't look to strangers . That 's the advice I give you . When changes once begin , they do n't end soon . ROXANA . Roxana Miss Helen 's husband is a stranger , then ? PETER . Peter To you he is . You were not born on 's place . Keep to your own . Do n't court the new . Stand fast . Say you 're the mistress 's , whatever happens . BOAZ . Boaz That will be my card . So , let come what will , I shall fall easy . Or they wo n't object , Or , if they do , I shall have shown attachment To my old mistress . They like that in us . I shall not fare the worse . Do you as I do . But now I must be wanted at the house . They can not do without me . And you , Philip ? PHILIP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And just came back this way . I 'm going now . BOAZ . Boaz And I must go . ROXANA , Roxana reluctantly . And I , to my poor mistress . Boaz , Philip , and Roxana go . MELAS . Melas What do we gossip here , and our poor master Lies in the struggle between death and life ? If death prevail , there wait the evil powers On the one side , the good ones on the other , Ready to take the spirit as it flits . Who is there that will think to chase the bad , And call the good ones down in greater number , By pious word or song ? Who is there near him That will take thought of this ? Then we must do it . Woe , woe to him , if the black bands prove strongest ! Shall his soul pass unhelped by hymn or prayer ? VOICES . Voices Oh , no ! oh , no ! and he so good a master ! Strike up a hymn ! Strike up a death-bed hymn ! Voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In different parts of the field a beginning is made of some favorite hymn , but the voice dies away after a few notes . A dead silence follows , suddenly broken by a clear , sweet voice . VOICE . Voice From earthly toil and sorrow The weary pass away , To find their last to-morrow , Their endless resting-day . Then let there be no grieving , Though they go forth alone ; Think they are only leaving A strange land for their own . OTHER VOICES , Other Voices reply . We grieve not for those going , Their home and ours to find ; For us our tears are flowing , For us who stay behind . Not those who 're havened yonder , Where rest and plenty bless ; But we mourn those who wander Still in the wilderness . MELAS . Melas What hymn is this ? A hymn for us the poor ! It suits not the condition of our master . Is he a wanderer in the wilderness ? Is he tired out with living ? Will he find More rest and ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardly . Look here ! Have none of you some hymns You 've heard at church ? hymns proper for our masters ? VOICE . Voice A death-bed hymn ? I can remember one . OLD MAN . Old Man But all they say themselves to one another May not be fit for us to say of them . Most of the death-bed hymns I 've heard at church Were full of heavy threatenings . MELAS . Melas Listen ! listen ! VOICE , Voice sings . Where is the tree ? To-day it stood The fairest glory of the wood , So high its top , so wide its root .  --  The Lord came by and looked for fruit ! O tree , thy haughty head is sunk ! No longer may thy hollow trunk Stretch its false branches to the sky : Where thou hast fallen thou must lie ! The early and the latter rain Shall strike thy crisping leaves in vain , Nor sun nor wind shall do thee good : It is too late to grow new wood . Thou hadst thy springtide and thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ! O soul ! thou heard'st the Master call , And thought'st it soon to give up all : There were yet time to seek His ways After a length of prosperous days . The hopes of this world 's children pass Like wayside herb or housetop grass , Wine spilled before it reach the cup , Corn blasted ere it be grown up . Now , sinner , must thy fleeting day Count with things waste and thrown away . Its course is run . Beneath the sod There is no time to work for God : No time for work , lost soul ! and yet Eternity for vain regret ! AN OLD MAN . Old Man Oh , may he but find mercy !  --  For the rich Christ has more threats than promises . For us , Only for us , the word is full of mercy ! Sobs and groans . A VOICE , Voice bursts forth . O lovely Christ ! sweet Christ ! the poor man 's brother ! How shall we show our gratitude to Thee ? ANOTHER VOICE , Voice answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shall you make known the love you have for me . " CHORUS OF VOICES . Voices Then let us love and let us help our neighbor , Since this is all the pay that Christ will ask ; And we will think it is for Him we labor , When our tired hands make out a brother 's task . MELAS . Melas You talk about yourselves and your religion , And have no thought of your poor dying master ! Shall his soul pass unhelped by sacred song ? While Melas is speaking , Ezekiel enters . He stands a little apart , and regards the people with a grace and sympathizing expression . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Can our songs aid him ? Ezekiel comes forward . The people are all silenced by his appearance . They draw back a little , and stand in an attitude of respectful attention . EZEKIEL . Ezekiel We are one in Christ , And nearer one than you may think , on earth . This soul , that shivers on the misty confines Of the two worlds , has had its part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pain ; And if it lay its burden loathly down , Hugging that care , that weariness , that pain , Has it not greater need of prayer than those Whom the deceitful ties of worldly wealth Retain not , making heaven 's bliss less dear ? Pause . Ere we uplift our souls to the All-Pure , Search we ourselves , that no unholy feeling Make void the prayer our lips address to Him . We kneel for one who goes to judgment hence . If any here , of those who call him master , Reproach him in their hearts for griefs endured Or joys withheld , let them forgive him now . Heavy upon the spirit of the dying Hangs the dependant 's accusation ! Let not Him miss through you his part of Paradise . Father , forgive him , as we have forgiven ! THERESA , Theresa who has entered while Ezekiel is speaking , and stands apart , raises her right hand to heaven , praying inwardly . Judge , as he measured , mete Thou unto him ! OLD MAN , Old Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we have forgiven ! VOICES . Voices Amen ! Amen ! What have we to forgive ? OTHER VOICES . Other Voices Amen ! Amen ! Who could reproach him now ? EZEKIEL . Ezekiel Pray with me , brothers !  --  Thou that art the Father Of rich and poor , of bond and free , look down Upon this spot , where meet Thy humblest children To ask Thy mercy for a dying man ! This man is not our equal . Before Thee Alone could we appear to plead for him . But Thou , All-Great , dost with impartial eyes Look on his wealth as on our misery . O Father , if the load of worldly cares Press down his soul that would spring up to Thee , Aid Thou its struggles , lend it of Thy strength , And let Thy heaven , opening before it , Court it with glimpses of transcendent joy !

So may his spirit , purified by pain , Ask and receive its part in Thy atonement ! VOICES . Voices Amen ! Amen ! EZEKIEL . Ezekiel Lord , let Thy blessing rest Upon these sheep soon left without a shepherd ! Be Thou their guard and guide ! Hast Thou not said , " When all forsake , the Lord will take thee up " ? Grant , Father , in Thy mercy , that they may Still look upon the faces of their own , Still tend the land that saw their children born !

Brothers , farewell ! Watch through the night with prayer ! Though God deny his life to your petitions , Yet shall your hearts be purified and chastened , And fitter to accept what He ordains . Ezekiel goes . The people remain with their heads bowed as in silent prayer . The scene closes . NIGHT . Scene Scene .  --  A large , dimly lighted room . On the right a bed , of which the curtains are drawn away on the side next the spectators . Stanley lies on it . Hecate stands near it . Storm without . The wind , at intervals , bursts in at the open window and sweeps through the room , then dies away into stillness . HECATE . Hecate The hour is come ! These signs are known to me . STANLEY , Stanley in a faint voice . Where is my daughter ? HECATE . Hecate She was summoned hence . The mistress  --  STANLEY . Stanley Call her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not long delay .  --  Aside . The time is short ! STANLEY , Stanley rousing himself . Is it thou , Hecate ? Do thy faithful hands Still tend my pillow ? Thou shalt be rewarded . More than a servant 's duty thou hast rendered : Thou shalt do service to no other master . Thou and thy child are by my will made free . HECATE . Hecate Thy will ? And has thy will the power of Fate To bind and loose ? Frail man ! know that our child A stronger will than thine has freed already . STANLEY . Stanley What means this tone ? Thy daughter is not dead ? HECATE . Hecate No : radiant with life , with hope , with beauty ! God listened to my prayer and granted her My share of happiness . Thou canst not now Withdraw from her her birthright as thy daughter , Thy eldest born . STANLEY . Stanley Hecate , I know thee not In this strange mood . HECATE . Hecate Say rather , now thou know'st me . For the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together face to face . Know'st thou who stands beside thee here ? Thy slave ,  --  The plaything of a former time ,  --  the drudge , The patient nurse of this ? Another office I fill beside thy deathbed : Heaven 's justice Makes itself heard through me . STANLEY . Stanley Hecate , what say'st thou ? Is it my troubled brain that lends thy voice These ominous tones ,  --  thy face this ghastly sternness ? Do sight and hearing fail me ? HECATE . Hecate Dying man ! They say that in the fatal hour the soul Takes retrospect of her past road ; that objects Long dim in distance start forth suddenly In vividness beyond their natural hues : Forms worn and bent retake the bloom of youth ; Kind smiles look forth from long-estrangd eyes ; Faces flit by that the green earth-sod covers ; Tones whose last echoes died long years ago Float backward on the ethery waves to thrill The torpid ear with keener consciousness . Is it thus ? STANLEY . Stanley Yes . Faces come back , and voices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perplex me not with talking . I can listen , Reply , no longer . HECATE . Hecate Thou wilt listen ! Seest thou Among those forms a slight young girl ? STANLEY . Stanley Cease , cease This idling ! These pale flitting figures Molest me , even unsummoned by thy words . I would compose myself for death . My life Has not been wholly without stain of earth , But no dishonor marks it . I have filled My place as man , as citizen , as neighbor . I have already made my peace with God . I am at peace with man . I have wronged no one . HECATE . Hecate Among those flitting figures mark'st thou one Slight , sorrow-touched , with soft , entreating eyes That seem to seek in every human face Something once known , but long pursued in vain ? Just sixteen years have formed her what she is : Ten years of summer , six of polar frost . The glow of tropic years reveals its trace In the quick mantling , quick receding blood ; The wintry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her firm , untrembling lip . She stands amid a group composed of all Earth holds most abject ; yet she feels no shame . Near her are men cold , stern , or rude , whose nod Can sign her fate ; yet neither hope nor fear Stirs in her heart . Her eyes have made their quest : What they sought was not , and their clouded gaze Sank to the earth . She marks not when the crowd Dissolves around her ; heeds not that the tumult Gives place to silence . Suddenly a voice Close by her side ! It only asked her name . But , at those tones , low , tender , musical , Her sleeping heart awoke . She raised her eyes , And met those answering eyes . Oh , what a heaven Of light and joy was opened in that glance ! The sought was found : that look of human love ! That look last read upon a mother 's face , But blent with grief , but dimmed by helplessness , Shone on her once again ; now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look Was bent on her by him whom in that hour Fortune had made her master . In that name No terrors more . To follow , toil for him ,  --  To render back by years of faithful service The debt that moment of delight imposed ,  --  This thought filled all her soul . With springing step She followed him , nor asked nor heeded whither ; Trusting in him as in her mother ,  --  in God . STANLEY . Stanley Why seek to call forth from the hazy past These idle visions ? It is as to strive To build again the fairy monuments Formed by the shifting summer clouds . To thee These recollections have , perhaps , a value : To me what are they but the irksome record Of vanities forgotten or despised ? HECATE . Hecate Bethink thee where thou art ! Earth 's vain distinctions Exist for thee no longer . Thou art standing , A feeble , naked soul , upon the brink Of the unknown . Thou art no more the master Of wide-spread lands , of other human souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings Whose fates are interlocked eternally . Thou , looking backward through the frigid course Of lagging years to thy exuberant youth , View'st its desires and acts as fleeting follies . Yet not the less in those rich hours of spring Were the first ardors of thy opening heart Poured forth upon the friendless orphaned girl ; Yet not the less was an eternal bond Then welded between thy proud soul and hers . Thou canst not cancel , even by thy scorn , Not even by thy blank forgetfulness , Those marriage-ties unowned by human laws , But set down in irrevocable record .  --  Yes , thou must hear !  --  From our united lives , Howe'er disjoined , howe'er repellent now , Has sprung a life destined to be the source Of a long line that through all future time Shall bear the traces of our blended natures ; And from that world where shall be our next meeting , The angels of the master and the slave Shall watch together o'er its shifting fortunes . Whate'er the path , through sunshine or in shade , Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent hearts will track their wandering steps . Once more those hearts must thrill in harmony . Each throb of pain that heaves those tender bosoms Through which our blended life-tide flows shall send To ours a sharper pang . To the glad beat Of happy hearts ours shall exulting answer . Together shall we stretch our viewless hands To hold the waverer on the brink of crime Back from its gulf ; we shall together suffer The double anguish of remorse that sees In the new guilt the old revived . But , oh ! May we not also in the generous thought , The noble deed , reclaim the parents ' share ? May we not , glorying in our children 's virtue , Find our own lives redeemed ? Oh , may we not Turn on each other then relenting looks , And , reconciled at last , together seek , Even in our crippled , uncompleted lives , The latent germ of the full-opened flower ? STANLEY . Stanley My ear is weary ! Rave no more ! HECATE . Hecate I rave , Because I dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most real affections , A fate not cursed , attributes not ignoble ? If , deeming thus , I rave , thou rav'st with me ! Blooms not that fair existence sprung from ours With all thy life not less than mine had brightest ? All that there was of happy in my fate , All that there was of generous in thy heart , Passed into hers , leaving us destitute , But crowning her with wealth in overplus . Is she not dowered with such munificent gifts As in old time have won the name of god-born For those whose parentage no father claimed ? What on thy dreary , colorless existence Gleamed , the sole sunbeam ? On thy stagnant life What came to thee as the fresh breeze of heaven , Lifting the clogging vapors from thy path ? When , in thy dull and objectless career , ' Mid vulgar cares , and joys more vulgar yet , When didst thou know one hour of heartfelt bliss That was not by thy daughter 's hand prepared ? Knew'st thou in all these years one pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her ? What solace has thy death-hour , what regret , That does not speak of her ? what earthward hope That does not wreathe itself round Helen 's name ? STANLEY . Stanley Helen ! Ah , in that name thou hast a spell That never fails thee ! All is overlooked : Thy frequent strangeness , thy proud looks , bold words . When I recall what thou hast been to her ! HECATE . Hecate What have I been to her ? The patient nurse That put away her baby from her bosom And dutifully took the mistress ' child ? Have I not often told thee in these veins There does not flow one drop of servile blood ? Thou wouldst think otherwise . Thou wast content To count upon a slave 's fidelity . Fidelity !  --  and I was faithful where I owed allegiance : true to God and Nature . Outlawed I stood ; unbound by human compacts ; The woman lived in me , the mother , sole ! How , then ! and thou couldst think that radiant being The fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy lands to Emma Fortescue 's ? And thou couldst think that life o'erflowed with sunshine , Exuberant with love , with joy , with hope , The offspring of your cold , reluctant union With that affectionless , idealess thing ! STANLEY . Stanley God ! whither tends this ? HECATE . Hecate Listen ! When that hour , That happy mothers wait with dread and hope Alternating and mingling , fell on me , I lay crushed under a despair so heavy That the debasements of those months of shame And all the closing tortures were as nothing . The poorest wretch , yet owning her own soul , That on her squalid couch brings forth to-day A new existence , however fallen , guilt-soiled , Knows in that hour foreboding of return ; And gentle thoughts of pious expiation Lull her regrets , as to her sheltering bosom She holds the new-born , hers , her own ! But I ! The shame , the tortures , had for me no fruit But deeper shame , but keener agonies : I knew my doom ; the sentence had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another child Waited to see the light . Around the couch Where its pale mother was to meet her hour , Already was prepared what wealth could buy Or love invent , to mitigate its pangs . The looked-for babe , the heir of lands and gold , Had yet no claim on Nature 's richest treasures : The feeble source from which its life had sprung Could never hope to nourish its expansion . A richer breast must yield the high-born foundling The food its mother 's poverty denied . I was marked out , unwilling benefactress , To foster the strange claimant in my arms , To yield my bosom to the vampire lips That through my veins should such my infant 's life . I knew it all : yet a few weeks and then My child was orphaned . Sudden from despair I rose to more than hope ,  --  to strength , to daring ; I felt in me a power to master Fate . I battled fiercely , and my strong will conquered . My soul had inwardly received assurance Of the won victory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blear-eyed crone That sat by me rose quickly from her place ; But , ere she reached the door , a young girl entered :  --  " Come to the mistress ! "  --  In her frighted look I read it all : the fated hour was come . I rose . I had no purpose in my heart . I only knew my place was by that bed ,  --  That thither my child 's future called me . Blindly I followed the mysterious impulsion . Within the house confusion reigned ; the servants Ran wildly round , not knowing what they did . The master was from home . The great event Had come untimely , and the pampered lady Found in her hour of need no other aid But the old purblind crone 's that tended me : But hers  --  and mine . I in my arms received My destined charge .  --  Upon the selfsame breast The sisters lay . Upon the head of one Propitious stars shot down their influence . The other  --  was before her birth predestined To misery and shame . Thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcomed it . The inward prophecy had found fulfilment . When the new mother , rallying from her faintness , Asked for her child , before her ravished eyes I held my rose-tinged , fairly-rounded babe , While her poor bantling sent forth feeble wails Upon the wretched pallet of the slave . STANLEY . Stanley Thou torturing fiend ! Is it in mockery Of my death-agonies thou comest hither To aid their sharpness with thy lying words ? HECATE . Hecate Thy heart , thy conscience tell thee I speak truth . STANLEY . Stanley It can not be ! Thou couldst not dare ! HECATE . Hecate Not dare ? What fear should check me ? The respectful awe , Perchance , that bows the slave 's soul to his master 's , And makes him tremble even at his own thoughts , If they suggest rebellion ? The slave-brand I wear not on my soul ! I will and dare ! STANLEY . Stanley No ! it is one of your mad brain 's delusions ! HECATE . Hecate Nor falsehood nor yet dream : reality ! Thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter thou hadst left to infamy Is crowned with wealth and honor . She whose fate Would have been dearer to thee than thy soul 's Creeps through her abject , hopeless life . STANLEY . Stanley Thou demon ! Why hast thou kept this for my dying hour ? HECATE . Hecate That thou might'st be the partner of my secret On the other side the grave ; but that on this Thou shouldst not have the power to mar my work . The curtains open on the other side of the bed from that near which Hecate stands . Helen appears , pale and agitated . At the gesture of surprise and horror which Hecate makes on seeing her , Stanley turns his head . STANLEY . Stanley Helen , thou there ? HELEN . Helen My father , I am here . STANLEY . Stanley What hast thou heard , child ? HELEN , Helen kneeling . Lay thy dying hand In blessing on thy outcast daughter 's head ! Forgive me , father , my unconscious crime , As I forgive thee for my guilty birth ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-born child has borne for Helen 's sake , In prospect of the years of toil and shame Thy slave-born daughter shall endure for hers ! For the defrauded Perdita shall find  --  Justice ?  --  Rising . Is it , then , justice that appoints Fate so diverse for children of one blood ? No ! but , alike the fruit of wrong and crime , We will divide our misery : the blight That nipped the opening shoots of her young life Shall wither mine in its full blossom . Father ! Mother ! I do now take this burden on me To bear with patience till my death ! These pains , Which I do willingly accept , may God Impute to you in ransom of your crime ! STANLEY . Stanley O God ! Thus Helen  --  HELEN . Helen No ! not thus , my father ! By all the lavish love that blessed my childhood , The patient guidance lent my riper years , Though they were granted to a name , a shadow , And the poor changeling knows them not her own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasted , I bless thee still with a full daughter 's heart ! And thou , my father , in this mortal hour , Will not the vain distinctions of this earth Release thy heart ? Am I not still thy child ? Curse not the cheat that let me call thee father ! Grudge not thy daughter the dear memories That to her future abject life shall be As the tradition of a paradise To fallen man , keeping alive her faith In an eternal principle of good ! Once more , I pray thee , father , bless thy child ! Kneeling . STANLEY . Stanley How shall I bless thee , Helen ? With weak words ? I that have cursed thee even in giving thee life , And leave thee now  --  O God , it shall not be ! There is yet time ! My brain is master still ! I will keep death at bay !  --  Go , call my brother ! To Hecate , who stands as if benumbed , her eyes fixed on Helen with a rigid stare . Hecate ! hag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' T is for your child ! Go ! bring my brother hither !  --  To Helen , tenderly . Thy hand in mine ! Oh for one hour of life ! In vain ! Death gripes me ! God , thou gav'st me years Enough to sin in , but to make amends Deniest a moment ! Helen ! child ! receive The fruitless blessing of thy guilty father ! Dies . The curtain falls .
