txt The Cincinnati West &; South , an extreme Democratic paper , Is not quite satisfied with Mr. SEYMOIM 'S letter of acceptance . It says be attacks the Republicans In and out of Congress , but that is a subject which does not satisfy the Democratic mind , which is in earnest to find a remedy for our sad state of affairs ; but it adds : " He considers himself a party to the platform . which is , in his opinion , in the nature of a contract with tho people . That platform , as our readers understand , treats all the steps of the so-called recousiruction , by tae multitudinous acts of Congress , as revolutionary , and not simply unconstitutional . Tuey are acts which the platform means to say have overthrown , without the slightest right , the very Constitution itself . They are each and all plain , palpable and dangerous breaches of that bond of our Union . These facts , in Mr. BLent 's opinion , ought to be resisted by the representatives in every branch of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEYMOUR does not announce that conclusion , but he arrives at it necessarily by joining himself to the platform , which holds each and every step of the whole process of Congressional Reconstruction as not only null and void because foroiciden by the Constitution , but revolutionary  --  in other words , an overturn of the Constitution itself , by whose warrant alone Congress can do any act . That is not any question for the courts . By the platform , it is res adjudicata , and Mr. SEYMOUR , as the Democratic candidate for the Presidency , binds himself to it as a contracting party . Of course , then , if we succeed , Mr. Sxvstoria will be obliged to draw the executive sword at once , and stop the degradation of tue States of the South from tha moment he has the power planed in his hands . He stands , in fact , where Mr. Brent stands , according to his letter previous to his nomination . For a man who is supposed to be naturally timid , this is a bold and brave commitment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself up to the future doctrine of the party . "
