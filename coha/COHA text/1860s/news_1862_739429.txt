txt The two great , National armies  --  the Army of the East and the Army of the West  --  are now in the situation promised by Oen. qzq#CLELLAN in his address to the soldiers of the Potomac fact to face with the rebels ; " and it is evident that ; it can not be long before they meet the rebellious foe " on the decisive battlefield . " In the East , the late Army of the Potomac  --  a host greater than that of either of the belligerents at Waterloo  --  and under commanders of approved loyalty , skill and courage ,  - -  is moving upon the strong places and key positions of the audacious enemy who , for over a year , has stood before the Capital defying the National power and insulting the flag of the Union . At all hour the telegraphic wire may tremble with news grander and more momentous than it has ever yet borne . since - lightning was used as an agency for transmitting thought . When it photographs before us the scenes of the great day and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be decided the fate of this Satanic revolt ? we shall see not merely legions of men , and miles of steel , and an hundred parks of artillery in collision , but principles and ideas greater and more enduring than these , contending for the supremacy . Our army is strong , not merely in numbers and equipment , but in courage , and in having a just quarrel . The enemy is inspired only by the lust of Slavery , and stimulated by desperation . We have met him this year already on twenty fields ; we have fought him , with the odds in his favor , at Newbern , and at Winchester , and at Pea Ridge ; we have conquered him behind intrenchments at Donelson and at Roanoke . In no instance has he stood the onset of our columns , or the contact of the bayonet . In every case he has given way before the invincible men of the Nerth and the great flag of the Republic . With this prestige on our side , our troops now advance to meet him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us at all on either of the lines , East or West , on which he is now showing fight , like results must inevitably , under Providence , crown our arms . There are rumors , however , and they are likely enough to be correct , that , as our various Eastern cops d'arnthe advance southward , the rebels are preparing to flee from Virginia altogether . They see , not only that their late boasts of conquering the North , are false and ? futile , but that they are unable . even with all their forces concentrated and planted behind intrenchmerits , to make a successful resistance to our army . They think that by refiring Westward and Southward , our army will be unable to follow them among the mountains of the West , and into the alligator swamps and Under the hot Summer sun of the Gulf Slates . in making this confession , and in acting upon it , they virtually give up the whole contest ; for , with our army advanced to the line of the warm States , and with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and South Carolina , Georgia , Florida , Mississippi , and Louisiana , and our river navy and our Western army acting on their lines . a residence for the rebels in the everglades and alligator swamp would be as fatal as for us . If , moreover , they really mean to leave Virginia without giving battle , it would be well for them to be in haste . In the Southwest the contest is hardly less imminent than it is in the East . The forces on either side there are equally strong as in the East ; and they are both inspired by the same purposes and resolves . Our soldiers on the Tennessee  --  though it is hardly half a year since most of them left the plow and the workshop  --  are already veterans . They have , during the bygone Winter , marched over more than a hundred and fifty miles , in latitude , of the enemy 's country , arid he has everywhere fallen or tied before them . On the new rebel Southwestern line . from Corinth to Memphis , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foul , ( beyond those DOW in Virginia , and acting as Home Guards , ) are concentrated . There are the ablest rebel Generals , and these is the strongest natural line of defence . The stake is the Mississippi Valley  --  rather it is JEFF . Davis ' throne . But there , too , is a National army stronger , in every sense , than the enemy , greater ' than either belligerent at Waterloo , . and every ' regiment equal in heroism to NAPOLEON 'S Old Guard . It is how " face to face with the rebels . " It ; simultaneously with the late Army of the Potomac , our Army of the Tennessee measures swords with the enemy , the result , we undoubtingly believe , will be in both cases a triumph that will be decisive and final for the rebellion . Foreign writers and statesmen , ignorant of . Jers2s al ; I conditions of this war , arAue that even if these rebel armies in Virginia and in the Southwest ' are defeated , we will still have to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State . . They interpret Mr. LINCOLN 'S late emancipation message to mean that we are merely fighting for boundaries  --  for the Border States  --  and that when these are settled , the " South proper " will be allowed to aet up a Government for itself . This is a misconception . The battles that decide the fate of the Border States decide also the fate of the Gulf States  - -  of all the rebel States . The fighting men , the great bulk of them , from all the seceded States , are now in these two armies , and other formidable armies can not possibly be raised in the South . The overthrow of the two rebel armies , which our two armies now confront , must virtually end the rebellion , in its military aspect . The hours now are big with vital issues . And the week is not likely to pass away without events which will rejoice the heart of the nation . her reproduction prohibited without permission .                 @ @ @ @
