txt The treaty lately negotiated between Great Britain and Honduras has been extensively noticed in the Press of this country , but it may not be generally known that , i this treaty be ratified by the London Cabinet , England will have surrendered the position she assumed in rejecting the Dallas-Clarendon Treaty , containing the amendments of the United States Senate . This last-mentioned treaty provided that Great Britain should surrender the Bay Islands to the State of Honduras , but made such conditions and restrictions as might be agreed upon in a treaty to be negotiated , between those two Powers . This provision was objectionable to the Senate , and it was accordingly stricken out . Who could venture to say what these condition 's and restrictions might be ? Who knew that they would not be seriously injurious to American interests , if not totally destructive of our Central American policy ? Indeed , a draft of the treaty to be negotiated had already been drawn up in Downing-street , which provided for the prohibition of Slavery in the Bay Islands , and securing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a separate and independent Government . Hence it was that the Senate so amended the treaty as to require au *unconditional restoration of these islands to the State to which they properly belonged . The Palmerston Ministry , under the influence of its distinguished leader , promptly rejected the treaty as amended , and returned it here unapproved . The negotiation between the two Governments on the subject was here broken off , and not again resumed , as neither party was willing to take the initiative . The signs of the times looked only to an abrogation of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty , which , according to the American view of the subject , England was violating by retaining her Bay Islands Colony . By the new treaty with Honduras , she makes an entire transfer- of these Islands . In this connection we may allude to , an interesting political fact , which may not be generally known , and which demonstrates the wisdom of our system in constituting the Senate an essential part of the treaty-making power . Although it is styled the " Dallas-Clarendon ' ' treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late Secretary MARCY , and forwarded to Mr. DALLAS with instructions to procure for it the approval of the London Cabinet . This he did , and it was not until after its return here that the Senate was called to pass upon its provisions . The Executive branch of our Government actually proposed to England the terms which the Senate afterwards rejected  --  and now England yields all that the Senate demanded . It only remains for the Mosquito treaty with Nicaragua to be completed and ratified , and Great Britain will have washed her hands of Central America , and avoided any necessity for abrogating the Clayton-Bulwer treaty by the United States . And when the Northwestern Boundary question shall have been disposed of  --  which it will doubtless be at an early day  --  there will no longer remain a single irritating question between the two nations . Great credit is due to the present representative of her Britannic Majesty near this Government for so fortunate a turn in events .                 @ @ @ @
