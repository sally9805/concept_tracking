A WIFE 'S STORY . " 1 lET me up , Katherine , " said my father , Li in the low , faint voice of extreme weakness . " I want to look out of the west window mice more . If I ever see these hills again it will be with eyes that can not be sealed by death * dimmed by old age . " I lifted him up , aided by the young pbysician who had had the care of him during his six weeks ' illness , and who seldom left him now . My father was the oldest medical practitioner in Woodstock . In fact the town contained but one other , a man of nearly the same age . Perhaps the rivalry of half a lifetime had not made them any better friends . At all events , I believe that my father , though he permitted me to send for Dr. Greene at the commencement of his severe illness , was not sorry to learn that he was temporarily out of town . In this emergency I had recourse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty , who was rusticating during the summer months at the village hotel , enjoying the kindred pleasures of retirement and trout-fishing . From the first my father had been pleased with his manners and satisfied with his skill ; though he bad asserted that he needed no physician , and that the illness which was upon him was beyond the reach of earthly aid . Dr. Bartholemew had , in fact , filled for six weeks the post of nurse rather than medical adviser . Besides mine , his was the only face that did not seem to bring confusion and disquiet into the sick-room . I was only eighteen , though my father was nearly seventy . I was the child of his old age , the last of seven , and my six brothers and sisters slept in sight of our windows , where the church spire cast its long shadow , and the light streamed lovingly over a sunny hill-side . My mother had died so long ago that I only cherished a memory of a sweet , kind face , a low , soft voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and angels . Since her death I hnd been my father 's all , as he had been mine . When he was gone I could see no love or hope for me in the world-no friend , no comfort . But my heart struggled desperately against ttdmitting for an instant the idea of his death . I read no encouragement in Dr. Bartholemew 's eyes , yet for a long time I strove to persuade myself that there were signs and possibilities of recovery which only watching as anxious as mine could discover . We piled pillows behind and around him , and placed him , as he requested , in a position where his eyes copld take in the range of the outside landscape . He looked forth long and silently . At length his gaze rested on a tall elm whose branches overshadowed nearly half the yard , and he spoke , in a dreamy , absent voice : " How large it is , Kathie ! I planted it fortyfive years ago  --  the very day I brought your mother home a bride . See how young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the sun loves its greenness . It lives , and Rachel is still and dead beside her six children in the church-yard . It will be hale and young still when I have been sleeping a hundred years by her side . What do I say ? Perhaps she and I will be young also . It is not all of us , Kathie , that you leave under the ground . There is another part that feels , and thinks , and loves . We call it soul , for want of a better name . Perhaps Rachel 's soul is waiting for mine-now-out there . " He lapsed again into silence , but his eyes were looking very far off , striving , it seemed , to pierce through clouds and sky to seek the soft beauty of a face as far away from his vision as time is from eternity . How far is that ? Sometimes I think a breath would lift the curtain between us and the invisible ones beyond . I thought so then . The truth came home to me that he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had reached the brink of that sea which flows forever toward the ocean of eternity-on this shore earth , on that-what ? No bridge spans those tideless waters , no voyager has ever returned to reveal the secrets of that land . Not even an echo floats back to us across the waves . I almost held my breath to listen ; but I heard no summons , no oar-plash from the ferryman of death . Did my father read my thoughts ? He sank back against the pillows , and turned his eyes on me fondly . As if answering my fears , he said : " The messenger has come , Kathie ; - he is waiting . I must go . It will not be long before I shall understand all the mystery . I think I shall see Rachel . Good-by , dear child , good child . There is a love beyond the earth that will not leave you desolate . " His eyes lingered with a holy , clinging tenderness upon my face . His hand fluttered softly to and fro over my hair . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the thin , shaking hands moved very feebly now . At length they grew still . I thought his eyes were losing their look of recognition . I clasped my arms about him close , close . I tried to call to him , to beseech his blessing , to implore him to stay with me , but my lips refused to move . I could not speak one word . I dared not look into those eyes , growing so frightfully dim and glassy . I buried my face in his bosom . Soon the Doctor said , gently , " God pity you , poor child ! he is dead . " My father had been buried a week when Dr. Bartholemew came to bid me good-by . He had prolonged his stay in Woodstock a month beyond his intentions-at first , because of my father 's illness ; and since his death , in order to afford me all the comfort and assistance that was in his power . I knew this , and felt something as nearly approaching to gratitude as a heart so stupefied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the time by the one great wave which had ingulfed my life . I sat alone in the room where my father and I had passed so many evenings together . It was nearly dark , and I had lighted no lamp . // A fire smouldered in the grate , for it was a chilly evening in September , but I had not enough energy to stir it into life . I sat with my head upon my hands , trying morbidly to recall every instance in which I had ever failed in duty to my dead father ; every sorrow I might have shared and did not ; every pang I had failed to assuage . I did not even look up when Dr. Bartholemew came in . More than any one I ever knew he had the habit of respecting the moods of others . He took a chair and sat down quietly at the other side of the hearth . Neither of us spoke for a while , until I had begun to feel soothed by his silent companionship , and find it rather pleasant than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had learned in my father 's sick-room to know so well , and obey so cordially and instinctively , " Kathie , this is not good for you , sitting here in the dark with the fire burning low , and thinking , as I know you are , about a past which death has sealed up forever . I shall not like you to do so when I am gone . You know I leave Woodstock to-morrow . " This roused . me . " To-morrow ! So soon ? " I said , sadly . It seemed to me as if my last friend would be gone , and I thought I could not bear it . He stirred the fire till it burned up brilliantly , lit a lamp , and placed it in the little round table in the centre of the room , and then came and sat down near me . " Yes , Kathie , to-morrow . " He looked at me searchingly , with his grave , truthful eyes . " I came to Woodstock because I had had a hard winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staid already much longer than I intended , and I should be tempted to stay longer still , but it is impossible . The friend who took my practice during my absence is imperatively called away , and I am needed at once in Philadelphia . I am sorry to leave you , Kathie , while the wound in your heart is still so fresh and sore . " He paused for me to answer him , hut my tears came instead of words . After a while I faltered , " You were so kind to him . I can not thank you , but I shall indeed feel as if I had lost all when you are gone . " Again that searching look , as if he would pierce through my words to my thought , and know my whole meaning . Then a light , a gleam of something I had never met in any man s eyes before came into his , and I heard the first words of love that had ever fallen upon my maiden ears . " I shall feel as if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean to say it to-night , Kathie , but in these past weeks of sorrow you have grown into my heart ; it is full of you . Some day I shall ask if you can give me love for love ; if you will share my home and my future-some time , but not to-night . You are lonely and sorrowful now ; you think you have reason to be grateful to me ; and these things might mislead you . I will not have your answer until , through months of absence , you have learned to know your own heart . But this winter I shall write to you-may I not ?  --  and in the spring I shall come to hear what message your soul has for mine . " I could not have answered him if I would ; he had put it out of my power . Nor do I think I was prepared to tell him then that I loved him with my lifetime 's love ; the idea was too new - too strange . So I sat silent till he spoke again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , Kathie . Have you thought of any plan ? I could wish all might be settled before I go . " " Yes , I have arranged that . You know Miss Willis ? " " What , the pattern old maid  --  the best woman in Woodstock ? Yes . " " To-day I saw her . She is boarding with strangers now . You know she has been for many years an orphan , without any near tieslike myself . I have asked her to come to me for the winter , and I think she is glad to do so . She will be here on Monday . " " This relieves me , Kathie , of much anxiety . If Miss Willis is not very original or amusing , she is good , and will take good care of you . With her and old Janet you will do very well . " We did not talk long after that . I was tired and excited , and Dr. Bartholemew saw it . Soon he rose to go . " I shall write you every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by side before the fire , " and you must tell me all about your life-all that troubles , all that pleases you ; and in any doubt or perplexity be sure I shall not fail you . I only want one promise . It is sin to rebel against God 's will  --  to give our whole hearts and lives up to despair because any human friend is taken away , even the dearest . We have always Heaven 's work to do , and it is no human being 's right to unfit himself for it . Promise me , then , that you will try to struggle against grief  --  to think of your father only as he would wish to have you think . You should keep busy : that is the sovereign antidote for undue grief ; read , and study , and keep house , and make yourself useful wherever sorrow is . " You are right , I know , " I answered , as I met the kind eyes bent upon me with a look of entreaty more controlling than a command ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And now I must go , Kathie . " He took both my hands in a strong , close pressure . He looked into my face ; I could not read through my tears the language of his eyes , but the tenderness of his voice thrilled me . " Good-by , Kathie , dear and good child ! Remember , when you are sad and lonely , that there is one heart to which you are the nearest thing on earth . " The next moment he was gone . I heard the outer door close after him while I still stood dreamily by the fire . I knew that for the pres // ent I should see him no more . He would leave from me , and I was no longer my own , but anWoodstock early on the morrow , and I should other's. qwq // A WIFE 'S STORY . though  --  and her hands trembled , but her voice : was clear and fervent as she uttered the blessing I had no one else left to bestow . The week he passed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held . It was all he could spare then from the duties which claimed him . It was enough for me to be near him ; to feel that he loved me-was mine . I did not care to frame any projects . I found sufficient happiness in the present without looking forward . He , with his man 's nature , was more practical , or less satisfied . So he made plans for me , which I was only too glad to accept . We were not to be married until fall . He wanted me now , he said . He had little patience for waiting . But he would not take me to Philadelphia till autumn should bring coolness and vigor . To me , used all my life to the fresh breezes , the pure air , the freedom of the Connecticut hills , to begin life in any city in the summer would be trying ; so far south as Philadelphia it might be fatal . So he would stay there and do his summer work ; and when September came he would come for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well content . It would give me no more time than I should require for my preparations . Of these I do not suppose he ever thought . It would not have occurred to him that I could not have been ready to be married at a day 's or a week 's notice . But I knew that I should have much to do , and none too long a time to accomplish it . In spite of the grief of parting with him , his farewell gave me strength . His eyes seemed to shed down into my heart rays of vivifying warmth and peace . His words lingered with me for weeks after like a benediction . " Good-by , Kathie , best treasure ! God keep safely my promised wife till I come myself , for she had become warmly attached to the place . She was to retain Janet , the old servant , who had been with me for ten years ; and all things would be preserved , as nearly as possible , in I their former condition . When this had been settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be  --  to myself ; when we had paid together our last visit to the grave where my father slept in peace beside his lost Rachel-where the flowers were still fresh , and the trees , their roots nourished in that soil so rich with dead humanity , waved greenly as in June , all was done , and we went home to spend our last evening before we should be made one forever . " Indulge me , Kathie , " Dr. Bartholemew had whispered , as we went into the house , while the last sunset rays kindled the there will be so much confusion-so little time . " I slipped away quietly and put on my wedding gear , and then I went down the staircase in the gathering gloom , and sought him where he sat alone in the old parlor , with its wainscotings of carven oak . The west window was open , and he leaned out of it , watching the changing clouds . I went up to him , and he turned round and opened his arms . " No , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should . Stand there a moment , and let me see the vision before it fades . I want to remember it when Kathie and I have grown old . Bright golden hair ; eyes of heaven 's own azure ; pink cheeks ; slight , girlish figure . I think I never told my bride before how fair and lovely she is in my eyes . But she does not seem real to-night . That fluttering robe makes her look white and misty , like a spirit . I fear to touch her , lest she should vanish into thin air . Her qwq fore , I was very hungry ; but though the dinner was more elegant , the viands more delicious than any that had ever before greeted my eyes or my palate , I found it impossible to eat . Something seemed to choke me . I am afraid that one or two tears dropped into the wine in which I drank my own health . After dinner was over we went back into the drawing-room . What would I not have given to steal away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband 's look that this was not to be permitted in the order of exercises , so I sat and tried to make conversation . Did I not pity the Israelites in that hour ? They were not the only ones who have been sent forth to make bricks without straw . After a while Madame Bartholemew remarked , in a pause of the talk , " Perhaps you will sing for me , my dear ? If you are not too tired , it would give me great pleasure . I am very fond of music , and I have looked forward with much anticipation to the presence of a younger lady than myselt who would make the house a little livelier . " " I do not sing . " I am afraid I answered stiffly . " Will you play for me , then ? " " I do not play . I am not musical . I have no accomplishments . Did not Dr. Bartholemew tell you that his choice was an unformed country girl ? " I saw her cast a glance . at him-partly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He came to my relief instantly : " Kathie underrates herself , dear mother . At least you will find that she is thoroughly educated , and possesses many acquirements of more value than music or dancing to the happiness of our home . " I do not think it was an agreeable evening to any of us . How different it was from my fond maiden dreamings of my home-coming ! I believe we were all glad when the tea was brought in , and my fatigue gave us a fit excuse for separating . That night the pale , proud face of Owen 's mother , with the black hair oversweeping the passionless brow , haunted my very dreams . Time went on , and where was the happiness I had pictured so fondly through months of hoping and waiting ? It was there , perhaps , anchored in Owen 's heart , sheltered by his love . But I could not realize it-my life had so many petty vexations . I did not like Madame Bartholemew . That is phrasing it too weakly . I believe in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight attempts to please her . I had suspected that she desired still to remain mistress of her son 's household ; so I had quietly given up to her the place of honor at the table , and sedulously avoided interfering with any of her former prerogatives . For this I had expected at least silent gratitude-I was not prepared to have her assume that she was doing me a favQr-relieving me from a charge for which natural incapacity , no less than youth and inexperience , rendered me unfit . I wrote now and then to Mary Ann Willis , and I know my letters must have saddened her , for I wrote of any thing rather than my own life . I was too proud to complain , too honest to feign a satisfaction and happiness which I did not feel . Sometimes I thought of her words , and wondered whether I might not be to blame for the existing state of affairs . I could not , however , bring myself to feel that I was . I said to myself that it was all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If she were but out of the way , Owen and I might be so happy . I believe my thoughts of her were almost murderous . I longed , I fear , for her to die , to remove forever the black shadow that stood betwixt me and the sunlight . If I had only told my husband it would have been better . But I shut myself up in solemn silence . I was not going to complain to him of his own mother , I said , proudly . If he could not see , if our life was happy enough , as it seemed to be , for him , then let all rest . I forgot that in giving him myself I had given him a right to every thought of my heart . What is marriage if in the inner and most sacred life the life of the soul-one is single still ? If I had been with him more constantly it might have been different ; but his practice was a large one , and that Fall a very sickly season . Fever was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parching their throats , maddening their brains , draining the springs of their lives . But the pestilence came not near our house , whence , I used to think , he would have been welcome to take one victim-her or me-I felt , in my despair , as if it mattered little which . Owen worked incessantly . He would come home , not feverish-I could not have borne to see the fever-taint on kim-but pale and worn ; needing repose too much for me to disturb him with any petty vexations of my own . Sometimes he would say , as I sat beside him while he tried to snatch a few moments of rest , " This is but a dismal honey-moon for you , poor child ! By-and-byl shall have more leisure to procure for you some of the pleasures I had planned ; but you must have patience . It is a comfort , at least , that I can see your face when I come home , and have you to sit beside me as now . " *Tith December came settled weather , clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever . Owen had more time to bestow on me ; and now , had it not been for the presence of Madame Bartholemew , I might indeed ihave enjoyed the life which opened before me . Picture galleries , concerts , lectures , and , to crown all , the opera . I remember the magical fascination of my first night . The opera was " Norma , " and the prima donna was Grisi . Will music ever again so thrill me ? Will the lights ever be so brilliant ? Will the faces ever look so fair ? For the time I forgot the black shadow that gloomed between me and my happiness ; I enjoyed with the fullness and freshness of a child . // The next day Owen came in while I was dressing for dinner . Unconsciously to myself , I was humming over , as I braided my hair , an air from the opera , which had haunted me all day . " So you can sing , Kathie ? " my husband said , with a puzzled look , as the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know a note-never took a lesson in my life . " " Still you have a fine musical ear . You . have remembered that strain perfectly . You could learn so easily . I almost wish you would ; it would please my mother so much . " I sat down on his knee , and taking his face between my hands , turned it toward me . " Are you dissatisfied with me , Owen ? " " Dissatisfied with . you , Kathie ? Surely not . I did not ask you to be my wife without knowing you well . L had seen you at your father 's bedside through weeks of wearing illness . I knew what you were as a daughter-I could trust my happiness without fear in your hands . If I had been solicitous on the question of accomplishments I should not have waited for my mother to make the discovery that you could neither sing nor play . My Kathie will never know how well I loved her from the first . " There was no more said about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dreaming over the old , beloved days of the bygone time  --  a conversation , I take it , with which the reader has little to do . The next morning , after Owen had gone away , I took the daily paper and looked over the column of advertisements carefully . I found the one which I desired . It was that of a lady , a music-teacher , whom I had often heard mentioned in society as very successful . I had my own little plan , about which I was resolved to keep silence . I put on my bonnet and went out . Soon I rang at the door of Mademoiselle Pierrot . I was fortunate enough to find her at home and disengaged . Her appearance pleased me . She was young , pretty , sweet of voice and manner . I opened my business at once . I explained that I desired no brilliant perfection-only to acquire , in the least possible time , knowledge enough of singing to be able to entertain my own home circle with simple melodies . If I succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievements . At all events , I desired to make the attempt . My husband 's birthday would be in six weeks . Did she think it possible for me to learn in that time to sing one or two simple ballads , and accompany myself ? She smiled . " It is not exactly en r*gle , Madame . We do not usually give songs until quite a course of instruction has been gone through with . But I could make you an exception . You wish to sing rather than to play . We shall try what we can do . I suppose you sing now from memorywhat you call by rote . Let me hear you chant any little melody , just to try the quality of your voice . I warbled " Auld Lang Syne . " It was the first time in my life I had ever attempted to sing to any one save myself or my father ; but my voice did not tremble-I was too full of interest in my project . She smiled again when I concluded . " Bien , tres Idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you come here and practice four hours each day , or do I ask too much time ? " " Not at all too much . I can come very well . " " Then every day for the first hour I shall be at home and give you a lesson . The rest you shall practice by yourself . From ten till two , shall it be ? " I assented . Those were the very hours my husband was sure to be absent . She could not have chosen better for my convenience . The next day I went to her punctually . During the six weeks before Owen 's birthday I did not miss a single day . After a little while I knew Madame Bartholemew 's suspicion was excited . She managed , usually , to be in the way when I went , and looked at me curiously . Once she said : " You go out a good deal of late . " " Yes , " I answered , carelessly , " I enjoy it . " Beyond this she asked me no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contented that she should regard my movements with distrust for a time . I was happier than I had been before since I came to Philadelphia . This was owing in part , doubtless , to the regularity of my occupation ; but I took , moreover , a real , girlish delight in the surprise I was preparing for my husband . I had no means of knowing whether his mother had mentioned my regular absences to him . If she had , he never questioned me on the subject , or varied in the least from his usual fond and trusting manner . I think his faith in me was of too firm a growth to be easily shaken . So affairs went on until the evening before my little plot was to reach its d*aouernent . I had practiced my songs that day , for the last time , with the full approbation of Mademoiselle Pierrot , and my heart beat high with glad anticipation of the morrow . I went down stairs with light footsteps to join my husband in the drawing-room . The door was ajar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , in a voice slightly raised by excitement : " This has gone on six weeks now , and I think it is your duty to see to it . What secret errand can she have to take four hours out of every day ? " I stood still . The impulse was irresistible to see whether my husband 's trust in me could waver . I heard his voice , clear and firm : " It is singular , mother ; but I think Kathie will explain it in her own time and her own way . I had , rather await her time . " What evil spirit possessed me that I could not wait yet one more day for the hour of triumph and vindication I had planned ? Are there mo // ments in our lives when we are not the rulers of our own spirits-when the reins are held by the invisible evil agents who forever wage secret and perilous warfare against our souls ? I had no control over the fierce rage which shook me for a moment , and then led me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I walked deliberately by Owen , and stood in front of his mother . I think I spoke with steady tones : " Madame , I thought I had borne enough from you since I entered this house . I have suffered in silence slights , contempt , surveillance ; now I find you trying to take from me all that makes life in any way tolerable-my husband 's confidence . I have borne up to this point . This ends it . You have bcen hungry for my secret-take it . Know that my husband expressed , six weeks ago , a wish that I should learn to sing . For your sake , he said . I confess I would have done little for your sake only , but to please him was worth an effort . Doubtful how I should succeed , I chose to try my experiment secretly . I went to Mademoiselle Pierrot , and for six weeks I have studied under her care . To-morro*v you were to have heard the result . I had taken a keen , sweet delight-all the stronger because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a birthday offering for my hushand . Perhaps , for you , my word needs confirmation . You shall heni the songs I had intended to sing to-morrow . " Neither of them had inteyrupted the rapid , indignant flow of my words . Neither spoke now as I went to the piano and sat down . With unfaltering voice I sang through my repertoire . I knew I was singing well-upheld by that pride and passion - far better than I should have done the next evening in the tremulous excitement of tenderer emotion . The soul of the music thrilled through the room . I sang all that I had learned . Then a wild , clanging chord burst full and resonant under my hand , and I stood up before Madame Bartholemew with stern pride , and eyes whose burning rays no tears came to quench . She was very pale . She spoke then : " In this matter , at least , I have done you injustice . Will you forgive me ? " " I never , heard , Madame , that the rich man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slain his one ewe lamb . Would not the request have been idle ? If you take away my husband 's trust in me , you take away all the glory of my life . " I went royally out of the room . I needed no support-none was offered . I went into my own chamber and sat there , I know not how long , alone with my bitter , tearless wrath . At length Owen came up . He sat down beside me ; kissed my burning cheek , and took my hot hand in his . He looked into my eyes with that gaze of tender control which had never lost its power over me till now . He spoke with quiet firmness : " Kathie , in my whole life I have never been so deeply pained as this evening . I think in many things my mother has been wrong . She acknowledges it herself . She loved me so entirely , and had so long been mistress of my home and the first object of my thoughts and affections , that perhaps it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she should heartily rejoice in my marriage , or regard with entire complacency one who was to be hereafter nearer and dearer to me thiin all others . " " Do you justify her , for that reason , in treating me with contempt ; in watching my movements as if I were a child for whose training she was responsible ; above all , in trying to alienate from me your confidence ? " " I have said , Kathie , that I thought she was wrong . She is ready to acknowledge it . At the same time I do not think you have been just to her . You have seen unkindness where none was meant , and when a few words of explanation would have set all right ; and surely if my wife was troubled , she had no right to conceal it from her husband . But we shall all understand each other better now . There will be happier days hereafter . " " Not with Madame Bartholemew and me under the same roof . " Owen looked at me for a full minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I do not understand you , Kathie . What do you mean ? " " What I say . Your mother has made herself utterly abhorrent to me . I will not degrade myself by living with her in open enmity and contention ; still less will I be such a hypocrite as to dwell with her in outward peace when heart and soul are full of bitterness . You must choose between us , Owen-choose now ! " He smoothed my hair with sad , patient tenderness . " Poor tortured , self-willed child , you know not what you say ! You wrong yourself . Nature has not made you so unforgiving . " " Owen , I mean it-mean it bitterly . Call me unforgiving , if you will-there are some things one never can forgive . I know my feelings toward her are such as neither time nor endeavor can conquer . I can not , I will not live with her . Again I demand that you choose between us .

He failed in business , and the shock so *vounded his sensitive pride that he never held up his head again . My mother was left , at twenty-four , with me to provide for , and not a dollar to help herself with except the handsome furniture of her house , on which , as it was purchased before her marriage with her own money , the creditors had no claim . All the rest even of her private property had been invested in , my father 's business , and swept away in the general wreck . Where so many women would have given up to absolute despair she did not falter . Her landlord knew her energy , and trusted in her integrity .

Yet , at least , he should know that I had repented-that I had loved him . I wrote him , from time to time , a package of letters , into which I distilled my soul . I poured out to him the anguish of my repentance . I took all the blame , where I felt it was justly due , to myself . I entreated him to cherish my memory with forgiving tenderness  --  to love , for my sake , the child I bequeathed him . The twenty-ninth of June I wrote the last one . I sealed the packet , and directcd it on the out-side , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my husband , Dr. Owen Bartholemew , 106 Blank Street , Philadelphia . " The next day my babe was born . I suffered agonies which I thought could not be less than mortal . But I lived to hear that first cry which thrills a mother 's heart as no one can ever dream until they hear it for the first time from lips which are flesh of their flesh . I heard Mrs. Allin 's gentle whisper , " It is a boy , and as nice a little fello*v as you could ask for ! " And then the silence and darkness of night closed round me . The months of feverish tumult ; the wild fears ; the unutterable , unshared anguish had done their work in unfitting me to struggle with the physical pain to which alone my youth and my naturally strong constitution would not have succumbed . I was utterly prostrated . I knew , afterward , that for three weeks from that day I was so near the valley and shadow of death that the strongest clasp of human love was hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb land of shadows . It was late in July when the first echo from the outward life penetrated my consciousness . Half dreaming , I thought I heard a voice , a well-known , well-loved voice . I tried to turn my head in the direction whence the sound seemed to proceed . I said , or breathed , Owen ! " Feeble as was the whisper , he heard it . He bent over me : " Kathie , my poor sufferer , my dear , dear wife ! " He took my hand in his , and so I went to sleep . I woke up when it was almost night , and he was still sitting beside me . When I had first heard his voice I had only realized that he was with me . Now I began dimly to remember the past . I knew that between us had been a great gulf-of separation , and silence , and anguish intolerable . How had it been bridged ? I was too feeble to more than whisper . He had to bend very near me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Owen ; how came you here ? How did you know where I was " You were not a very shrewd or secret conspirator , Kathie . After we parted I never lost sight of you until you were safely settled here . And afterward , from time to time , I took means to ascertain that you had not moved . You had chosen to leave me , and I could not intrude upon you until I knew that you either wanted or needed me , but you were never out of reach of my protection . When your life was in danger Mrs. Allin summoned me . She found my address on a package of letters in your desk . " " Did you read the letters ? " " Yes , my darling . " " Then you know how I repented . Can you forgive me ? " " My wife , I love you-better than life . " " Forgive me , Owen ! I know how wrong I was , and I can not be satisfied till I hear you say that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want that form of words ; but you have suffered enough to expiate , ten times over , far heavier faults than yours . I was silcnt for a few moments , thinking of my baby . I heard no sound of him , saw no sign . He then , not I , had been the victim . I dreaded to speak of him , and yet I must know the worst . " O*ven , " I said , " have they buried my little child ? Were you here before he died ? If I could only once have seen his face ! " " Darling , he 's not dead . You shall see him when you will . " " iNot dead ! " I uttered but this one cry , then I turned my face to the wall to thank God . They talk of the danger of excessive joy . Are there indeed temperaments to which it can be fatal ? It was like the wine of life to me . I felt the strength which it infused in every nerve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? " " Down stairs . I will bring him , if you are sure you can bear it . " " I can not bear to wait . Hurry ! " It was not a moment before he returned . Will ever any other sight so gladden my eyes as when they rested on Owen with our boy in his arms ? " Put him down beside mc , O*ven , close-in my bosom I " And so my day dawned after the night . It was not until the next day that I asked for Owen 's mother . I had thought of her , but , with the instinctive tendency of a person who is physically weak to avoid subjects which involve anything // disagreeable , I had hesitated to mention her . I summoned resolution at length to say , " Owen , do you think your mother will ever be able to receive me kindly  --  to like me a little ? " " I think she likes you a great deal already , Kathie . She has always taken the chief blame to herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Mrs. Allia 's telegram came she insisted on accompanying me to New York . I refused at first , for I feared her presence might annoy you . But she plead with me so earnestly that at last I yielded . She would never go in your sight , she said , until I thought it best , but she must be near at hand-otherwise the suspense would be intolerable . She could care hs no one else would for the baby ; and if you were going to die she must hear you say that you forgave her . She came , and while you were too ill to recognize her she proved herself the most efficient of nurses . As for the boy , she fairly idolizes him . She has a warm heart , Kathie , though her manner is cold . Whose would not be that had fought so many battles with the world-had so few helpers ? When she loves , though , it is with a tenderness strong , faithful , and cherishing . She loves you now . " " Will you ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , Kathie , do not ask her to forgive you , for she blames herself so much it would only give her pain . I think it woul 1 suit her best not to talk about the past at all . " It certainly suited me best . I had a natural antipathy to scenes ; and , save to Owen , I disliked excessively having to talk about my own feelings . There was such a look of gentle interest , of tender care , of heart-felt joy on Madame Bartholemew 's face , when she came in , as transfigured it to me . She bent over me with dim eyes , and her voice was tremulous as she whis-pered , " Thank God you are so much better , my daughter . " And I answered , " I ought to reward you by getting better ; Owen says you have taken such good care of me , dear mother . " There was no need of any other words . When I could bear the journey , I went to pass a week with Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me , and my boy . How fond her welcome was ! how bright were the long , blue days of that last week in August ! Once , when she and I were quite alone , with only my baby on my knees , I told her the history of the first year of my married life . She kissed me through her tears , and said , tenderly , " I am thankful , Kathie , that you have learned so soon what I foresaw must be your life 's hard lesson . I have no fears for you now . You will never again be in any danger of forgetting that above all poetry , all passion , all enthusiasm , all sentiment , must reign eternally Heaven s immutable law of right . The life lived for our own sakes only-with no sacrifices made for others , no hard duties done for duty 's sake-is not worth the living . " It was the anniversary of our marriage-the fourth of September-that we started again for Philadelphia . The next night I heard the same old dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went up the steps , and this time a mother greeted me in the hall ; a mother 's kiss was on my cheek ; a mother 's blessing was breathed over me . This was my true home-coming.
