txt AFFAIRS IN MEXICO. - We have this morning the tri-monthly dispatch by telegraph via San Francisco , giving the news from Mexico , and , as usual , it is a mixture of truth and error . It appears to be a fact that the Mexicans are preparing to make a desperate defence of their Capital . French residents have been obliged to leave the City of Mexico , all the available Mexican troops are being drawn to that point , and it is resolved that should it prove necessary , - the Valley of Mexico will be flooded . This is a desperate and ruinous remedy , but it may be adopted . It is stated that Gen. JUAREZ has taken command-6f the Mexican troops . JUAREZ , by virtue of his office as President , is Commander-in-Chief of all the forces of the Republic , the same as our President , but ne is no more a military chieftain , practically , than Gen. ABRAHAM LINCOLN , and it is an error to say that the Mexican President has taken the field as General . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news we received some days ago via Vera Cruz , and at that time nothing had been seen or heard of the thousands of Mexican prisoners , with their officers , said to have been captured by FOREX at the fall of Puebla . On the contrary , Judge Low , our Consul at Vera Cruz , who came by the last arrival , confirms the barren nature of the French victory at Puebla , and positively denies the French reports of extensive captures , and the easy progress.of the French toward the Mexican Capital .
