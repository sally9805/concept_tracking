ROBERT has got well and ha is all the time talking about you . He is a brisk boy and wants to know why you cant be taken prisoner and come home on parole-like . There is not a day but that some deserters pass by going name . We have plenty In our neighborhood that have come home and will not go back to the army . A great many have stone to Vicksburgh and claimed protection . The State has gone under . and the negroes have all left and gone over to the Yankees . My son , it seems , hard that you all have to stay there and fight for the rich man 's property when they will not themselves fight for it . There are some rich men who are gentlemen , and go in with them all . But where you find one who does this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a aead weight to the Confeueracy . We have got some men here robbing and doing more damage than the Yankees would have done . They are making more Union men than Liscons ever could make . It is beyond description . We can not believe all you see in the newspapers ; but what I see with my own eyes I can believe . I have made a good crop of corn and some cotton , and if they burn it I will most assuredly go to the Yankees , and claim protection . And I know I am as good a Southern Rights ' man as anybody . The rich population have run into Texas , leaving the poor people to do as best they can ? burning up their cotton , and talk of burning up all the houses . This will make war among us at home . My son , France and England will divide the United States . In Winn Parish there are 600 men that will not turn out , that is , with the deserters . Tney are doing something in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back , threatening to burn their houses ; but the Yankees are so near at hand that it keeps our army here busy to keep out of their way . The Yankees are marching on Texas at four different points . They wilt have fine picking there . Our people will return back to Louisiana , stripped of all they had . These men who have lost their property want to see peace on any terms . These are the men who are hurting the Confederacy by their influence . The Yankees expect that France and Mester ) are going to do something for the South . They are turning their guns down the river at Vicksburgh , Natchez , Ellis Cliffs , twenty-five miles below Natchez , and at Port Hudson . If France had come to our assistance when we held Vicksburgh , it would have done some good . But it is too late now . Our men are too much divided , and too many have gone back to the Union . This war was got up drunk , but they will have to settle it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the . South who are to be pitied . My . son , I must come to a close . Hoping I may see you shortly . Your affectionate . P.S. Do not forget your duty to rent God ,
