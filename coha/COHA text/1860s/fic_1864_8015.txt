Neal , John , 1793-1876 : Our Battle-flag-hourrah ! from Our Battle Flag , Hurrah ! ( 1864 ) To arms ! to arms ! the chearful days , So long foretold 's at hand ! And nearer comes the battle roar . Like tumbling oceans on the shore , With flags the rebel Angels bore , Oershadowing the land . Chorus . Our Battle-flag , hourrah , boys ! Hourrah , hourrah , hourrah , boys ! Our Battleflag , hourrah ! Fling out , fling out , our Starry host ! Set in a midnight sky ! The flag that over Sumpter flew , By night and day , until the blue Of Heavens above was filtered through , The clouds that thundered by . Chorus . Our Battle-flag &c.; The flag that oer the Cumberland , Outrode the battle-blast ! While the brave ship and gallant crew Sank thundering in the waters blue , With matches lighted , stern and true Triumphant to the last ! Chorus . Our Battle flag &c.; The vision that above the clouds , Our Silent Soldiers led , When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness took their ways , With eyes uplifted to the days , Just breaking over-head ! Chorus Portland Me . March 2/64 John Neal
