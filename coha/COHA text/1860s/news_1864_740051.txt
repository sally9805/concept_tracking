txt It will be remembered that SHERMAN crossed the Chattahoochee above or east of the railroad crossing , and moved upon Atlanta from . the northeast , striking the Augusta line of railroad . This line , was for several miles destroyed . Our possession of the ground was confirmed by the battles of the 20th and 22d , but SHERMAN , leaving GARRARD 'S cavalry to hold the country about Decatur and prevent the repair of the road , marched the Army of the Tennessee around the rear of the other armies , from our left to our right flank , and then changed the position of the Army of the Ohio in the same way . The point to make was to hold fast to his own railway communicatiort , and stretch his line , without leaving it so weak in any place as to be broken by noon , and reach the only road remaining serviceable to Atlanta , that running to Macon . The rebel works inkfront of Atlanta were too strong to be stormed , and were armed with siege artillery . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended his right , reaching for the railroad , HOOD left the Atlanta forts in charge of the.Georgia militia , and met the movement with his best troops massed on his left . On the 28th of July he made an effort to check our right , but was repulsed with loss . On the 6th of August an advance of ours , to determine the rebel strength and position on their extreme left , was pretty severely checked . On the 2d , however , we succeeded in overlapping the rebel left , and commenced rolling it back . This is a fact of much importance . It is outflanking the rebels at'Atlanta ; and makes the situation almost identical with that at Kenesaw Mountain when JOHNSTON retreated . If we continue to drive in the rebel left , we shorten our line , and presently will command the Macon Road , the possession of which will soon give us Atlanta . The operations of our army seem very simple , but it is engaged in a most difficult undertaking , and the danger has been , that while we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break through somewhere , and do great mischief , not only by the loss they would inflict , but in forcing a change of programme , and causing delay .
