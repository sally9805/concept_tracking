Hopkins , Lemuel , 1750-1801 Humphreys , David , 1752-1818 Barlow , Joel , 1754-1812 Trumbull , John , 1750-1831 : THE ANARCHIAD. from The Anarchiad ( 1861 ) PREFACE . In presenting The Anarchiad to the public , now for the first time in book form , the editor feels that he is in the performance of a duty  --  that he becomes , as it were , an instrument of justice  --  a justice delayed for more than half a century , to the genius and loyalty of its authors , who were among the noblest and most talented sons of the American Revolution . Why a work possessing the merits of The Anarchiad has not , ere this , been called up from its oblivious sleep to take its appropriate place among the honored volumes in the homes of the people  --  by what strange oversight it has not before been brought to public view , and placed within the reach of all , we will not attempt to say . In 1786 , Hartford was the residence of a number of the most celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Humphreys , Joel Barlow , John Trumbull , and Dr. Lemuel Hopkins ;  --  and the veins of satire which were given forth in many of their literary productions , gained for them the appellation of " the Hartford wits . " In The New Haven Gazette and Connecticut Magazine of October 26th , 1786 , appeared the initial paper of The Anarchiad . The projector of this work was Colonel Humphreys , to whose mind the plan was suggested from having seen , while in England , " The Rolliad , " attributed to Fox , Sheridan , and others . This series of papers , embracing twelve in number , were published complete in the Gazette , during the years 1786-7 , and in no other journal . The last number of the series was published in the issue of September 13th , of the latter year . Drs . Kettel Footnote : 1Kb and Griswold , Footnote : 1Kb as well as Mr. Everest , Footnote : 1Kb each of whom make mention of the poem , in connection with the authors above referred to , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was published in the New Haven and Hartford gazettes ; " and a writer in Appleton 's Encyclopedia , as we perceive , has also , through misapprehension of the fact , been led to make the same erroneous statement . But while The Anarchiad was published originally and complete only in the Gazette , still many numbers of it were reprinted in the Hartford , and , indeed , in most of the Massachusetts , New Hampshire , and Rhode Island papers . The Anarchiad is universally conceded to have been written in concert by Humphreys , Barlow , Trumbull , and Hopkins ; but what particular installment or number was written by either , has never been definitely ascertained . The fact that the papers were anonymously communicated to the publishers at New Haven , and that the authorship of any given portion of the work was never divulged by the members of this literary club , renders it almost impossible to fix upon any particular paper , or portion of a paper , and arrive at a certain knowledge in relation to its writer . The Anarchiad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which a member of a society of critics and antiquarians had accidentally found among some recently discovered ruins , imbedded with " utensils more curious and elegant than those of Palmyra or Herculaneum , " and whose preservation , through such a long lapse of years , and amid marks of hostility and devastation , was indeed little short of miraculous . The author assumes to have taken possession of this poem in the name and for the use of the society of which he was a component part . Being passionately fond of poetry , he immediately set about cleansing it from the extraneous concretions in which it was enveloped ; and by means of a chemic preparation made use of in restoring oil paintings , he soon succeeded in rendering it tolerably legible . It was then that he ascertained the production to be styled The Anarchiad : A Poem on the Restoration of Chaos and Substantial Night . When this fabulous announcement was first made in the print of the Gazette , it was received with a remarkable degree of credulity by many readers . The plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were narrated in a plausible manner ; and , upon the whole , it was not half as absurd as the celebrated " moon hoax " perpetrated by the New York Sun newspaper , many years afterwards , and readily believed by multitudes in all parts of the country . Besides , public attention , but a few months previous to the announcement of the exhuming of The Anarchiad , had been somewhat aroused by the discovery of several ruined Indian fortifications , with their singular relics : the story of the early emigration of a band of Britons and Welch to this country , and of an existing tribe of their descendants , in the interior of the continent , had also quite recently been revived and circulated . The Anarchiad is pre-eminently a New England Poem . Its publication , at a time when New England was convulsed by the evils growing out of the war of our Revolution , and when insurrectionary mobs had arisen in various parts of the land , and fears were entertained of their proceedings being imitated in others  --  at such a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes of the people , through the columns of the weekly press , is supposed to have exerted great and beneficial influence upon the public mind , and to have tended in no small degree to check the leaders of insubordination and infidel philosophy . But when we say that it is a New England Poem , treating mainly of affairs in that part of the Union , as they existed at the time when it was written , we say , also , that it is no less a National Poem , battling nobly for the right universal , for the majesty of law , and for the federal government . Many passages in it seem peculiarly adapted to the exigencies of the present time ; and the wholesome sentiments which everywhere pervade its pages can hardly fail of being as heartily endorsed by every lover of his country , and every loyal citizen , as they will unquestionably be regarded with feelings of the most bitter execration by every traitorous and degenerate son of this brightest and fairest of lands . But these soul-inspiring sentiments are too numerous for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenteous profusion as he reviews its pages . Explanatory and historical Notes , as will be seen , intersperse the work . The editor hopes that his efforts , in this direction , to make the poem intelligible to the reader of to-day , will meet with the approbation of an appreciative public . In the Appendix are given , in detail , and yet in as condensed a form as practicable , an account of the Disturbances in New England ; of the Paper Money period ; and some information concerning the Hon. William Williams , who occupies so prominent a position among the worthies immortalized in The Anarchiad . It has been our purpose , as far as convenient , to give , in these appendices , accounts of the various circumstances as they are recorded in the papers and correspondence of the time in which they occurred , instead of accepting modernized versions in the more elegant diction of the historians of our own day . While this feature will tend to gratify the antiquarian tastes of many readers , it can not prove objectionable to any . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMERICAN ANTIQUITIES .  --  No . I. Messrs . Meigs and Dana :  --  I have the felicity to belong to a society of critics and antiquarians , who have made it their business and delight , for some years past , to investigate the ancient as well as natural history of America . The success of their researches , in such an unlimited field , pregnant with such wonderful and inexhaustible materials , has been equal to their most sanguine expectations . One of our worthy associates has favored the public with a minute and accurate description of the monstrous new-invented animal which had , till his elaborate lucubration , escaped the notice of every zoologist . Another has regaled his readers with a most notable catfish . A third has brought them acquainted with a hermit who surpasses all other hermits in longevity , as much as his biographer does all other historians in point of veracity . Others have spared no pains to feast the public curiosity with an ample supply of great bones from the Wabash , and , at the same time , to quench the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has happily fallen to my lot to communicate , through the medium of your paper , a recent discovery still more valuable to the republic of letters . I need scarcely premise the ruins of fortifications yet visible , and other vestiges of art , in the Western country , had sufficiently demonstrated that this delightful region had once been occupied by a civilized people . Had not this hypothesis been previously established , the fact I am about to relate would have placed it beyond the possibility of doubt . For upon digging into the ruins of one of the most considerable of these fortifications , the laborers were surprised to find a casement , a magazine , and a cistern , almost entire . Pursuing their subterranean progress , near the northeast corner of the bastion , in a room that had evidently been occupied by the commandant , they found a great number of utensils , more curious and elegant than those of Palmyra of Herculaneum . But what rendered their good fortune complete , was the discovery of a great number of papers , manuscripts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , amid such marks of hostility and devastation , must be deemed marvelous indeed , perhaps little short of miraculous . This affords a reflection , that such extraordinary circumstances could scarcely have taken place to answer only vulgar purposes . Happening myself to come upon the spot immediately after this treasure had been discovered , I was permitted to take possession of it , in the name and for the use of our society . Amongst these relics of antiquity I was overjoyed to find a folio manuscript which appeared to contain an epic poem , complete ; and , as I am passionately fond of poetry , ancient as well as modern , I set myself instantly to cleanse it from the extraneous concretions with which it was in some parts enveloped , defaced and rendered illegible . By means of a chemic preparation , which is made use of for restoring oil paintings , I soon accomplished the desirable object . It was then I found it was called The Anarchiad , a Poem on the restoration of Chaos and substantial Night , in twenty-four books . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had prescribed , to give a critical analysis of this inimitable work , I must content myself with observing , that the excellency of its fable , the novelty and dignity of its characters , the sublimity of sentiments , and the harmony of numbers , give it the first rank in merit amongst the productions of human genius . I might also add , that it appears , from incontestible proofs , that this work was well known to the ancients , and that , as it is the most perfect , it has undoubtedly been the model for all subsequent epic productions . Perhaps , in a future essay , I shall attempt to prove that Homer , Virgil , and Milton , have borrowed many of their capital beauties from it . At present , to show that the matter is not fabulous , as well as to give a specimen of the author 's forcible style , and happy manner of expressing himself , I shall cite a few lines from the eighth book , which is denominated the Book of Vision . So lively are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every object placed to our view , that the reader will , I dare say , be as much astonished as I have been myself , to find that a poet who lived so many centuries ago should have described with such amazing precision events that happened in our own times . The prophetic bard seems to have taken for the point of vision one of the lofty mountains of America , and to have caused , by his magic invocations , the years of futurity to pass before him . He begins with unfolding the beautifying scenes when those plagues to society , law and justice , shall be done away ; when every one shall be independent of his neighbor ; and when every rogue shall literally do what is right in his own eyes . Let us now hear the poet speak for himself , in his own words : In visions fair the scenes of fate unroll , And Massachusetts opens on my soul ; There Chaos , Anarch old , asserts his sway , And mobs in myriads blacken all the way : See Day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Shattuck 's mob-compelling name : See the bold Hampshirites on Springfield pour , The fierce Tauntonians crowd the alewife shore . O'er Concord fields the bands of discord spread , And Wor'ster trembles at their thundering tread : See from proud Egremont the woodchuck train , Sweep their dark files , and shade with rags the plain . Lo , the Court falls ; Footnote : 1Kb th'affrighted judges run , Clerks , Lawyers , Sheriffs , every mother 's son . The stocks , the gallows lose th'expected prize , See the jails open , and the thieves arise . Thy constitution , Chaos , is restor 'd ; Law sinks before thy uncreating word ; Thy hand unbars th'unfathom 'd gulf of fate , And deep in darkness ' whelms the new-born state . I know not whether it is necessary to remark , in this place , what the critical reader will probably have already observed , that the celebrated English poet , Mr. Pope , has proven himself a noted plagiarist , by copying the preceding ideas , and even couplets almost entire , into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclude , by entreating that the public may be acquainted that several other extracts from these curious manuscripts will be published , should the preceding specimen meet with the applause which I am confident it merits . The blessings of paper money and confusion , as now experienced in Rhode Island , are predicted in the most awful and beautiful manner . The vision then extends to Connecticut , where we shall leave it , unless a future opportunity of resuming the subject should render a further disclosure expedient . I am , &c.,;  --  . New Haven , October 23 , 1786 . Footnote : 1Kb AMERICAN ANTIQUITIES .  --  No . II . Footnote : 1Kb Messrs . Meigs and Dana :  --  In a late address , I gave you an account of the recent discoveries in the Western country , and engaged to furnish some further extracts from the epic poem called The Anarchiad , if the specimen then exhibited should meet with merited applause . I am happy to find , as a proof of the good taste of the times , that it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to decipher all the lines of the Vision which evidently alluded to the beautiful scenes of paper money and confusion , now so gloriously displayed in Rhode Island ; yet I thought I ought not to delay to gratify the Connecticut readers with a fragment of the speech which the old Anarch makes to Beelzebub , for the purpose of persuading him to come over and help his faithful friends in our Macedonia , since his affairs were in so thriving a posture in Massachusetts and Rhode Island , that his zealous and indefatigable substitutes and apostles might carry them to perfection without any further assistance from him . After describing , in a very pathetic manner , the necessity of his presence and personal influence , he encourages him to hope for every reasonable countenance from his faithful adherents and allies in this State . He gives as long and significant a list of their names and characters as Homer does of the troops that went to the siege of Troy . I can only have room to select a few of the most remarkable , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , behold the flame that draws Chiefs , mobs , conventions , to support thy cause . See where the frogs ' loquacious realms extend , Instructions on their deputies attend , O'er all the east new fangled magi rise , Join croaking choirs and boast the name of wise . The north by myriads pours her mighty sons , Great nurse of mobs , of bankrupts , and of duns : There Froth , the sep'rate , glows with pop'lar rage , And G  --  n , type of dotards in old age . Where lard and brimstone gild the itch-vat shore , The soil that trays and wooden dishes bore , His full-globed paunch the brainless Bubo draws , And solid ignorance threats the feeble laws . Near Hartford stream , where groves perpetual bloom , And onion gardens breathe a glad perfume , Though sunk in dust , to his own stench a prey , Again our Laz'rus shall ascend to day ; Thy potent voice shall burst the deathful chain , And raise him active in thy toils again . Where purslain harvests charm th'extended sight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; In act to speak , his eyes a smoky fire , His face of shadow , and his shins of wire , See Copper graceful ride , and , o'er his cane , Look like a pale moon sick'ning in its wane . Why sleep'st thou , Blacklegs , child of knavery , why ? Seest thou , blest Wronghead , helpless how we lie ? And where is Wimble , earliest squib of fame ! Your tongues and pens must wake the factious flame ! And thou , poor Quack , behold thy efforts fail ; Could one address thy o'erstrain 'd wits exhale ? Wake , scribble , print ; arouse thee from thy den , And raise conventions with thy blust'ring pen ! No more the Boatman 's call alarms the shore , Old Ben , exhausted , wields the quill no more ; The Chairman 's snuff expir 'd as erst was sung , And gouts have quelled the Irish Blunderer 's tongue . Yet , can a faction cease in craft to thrive , Where such high talents , such strong brains , survive ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Fame waits the thousand yet unnam 'd behind . The poetic seer has then the address , by a happy transition , to group his principal characters in solemn conclave , and to display their abilities in high debate . I am sorry I have not been able to cleanse that part of the manuscript which contains their speeches , from filth and obscurity , so as to make it entirely legible . I do not yet despair of success ; and the courteous reader is only requested to suspend the gratification of his curiosity to a future occasion . In the interim , I have found , by that part of the manuscript which is still legible , that the poet progresses , agreeably to the rules of his art , in unfolding the catastrophe , by predicting that a majority should be persuaded , by the power of intrigues and sophistry , to refuse a compliance with the requisitions of Congress  --  that a determination should be formed , and announced to the world , that we will not pay the interest on our foreign or domestic debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal government  --  that we should withdraw ourselves from the Union  --  that all government should be prostrated in the dust  --  that mobs , conventions , and anarchy , should prevail for a limited time , and then  --  .... But I draw the curtain ; the picture is too melancholy to be viewed by a patriot eye without prompting the tear of sensibility , and forcing the sigh of sorrow , that the glorious temple of Liberty and happiness which had been erected in these ends of the earth , for an asylum to suffering humanity , should so soon be dissolved , and , " Like the baseless fabric of a vision , Leave not a wreck behind .

Meigs and Dana :  --  The readers of newspapers through the several States in which the two first numbers of American Antiquities have been published , will doubtless remember that the subject of Paper Money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful an episode in The Anarchiad , that it would be unpardonable not to make extracts from it . All the episodes ought to have some reference to the promotion of the principal action , as the underplots in a regular drama should conspire to the development of the main plot . Such is the superlative advantages of this very poetical digression . For it will scarcely be denied , in any part of the United States , that paper money , in an unfunded and depreciating condition , is happily calculated to introduce the long expected scenes of misrule , dishonesty , and perdition . Footnote : 1Kb On this point the citizens of the Union must be considered as competent judges , because they are inhabitants of the only country under heaven , where paper ( of that predicament ) is , by compulsory laws , made of equal value with gold and silver . The society of critics and antiquarians , who have spared neither expense nor trouble , in recovering those valuable remains of antiquity from oblivion , can not help flattering themselves that their disinterested labors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful public . They are conscious that the manuscripts from which they have already given specimens , as well as many others in their possession , contain performances in poetry and prose of a very different complexion from those which commonly appear in American newspapers . While they publicly disclaim all title to any merit in these productions , except that of assiduity in deciphering and preparing them for publication , they would advise the several printers on the continent to peruse them attentively , and to publish at least such pieces as may be applicable to their particular States . The society who are , will henceforward prosecute their research with redoubled diligence , only thinking it necessary to engage , on their part , that nothing shall appear sanctioned by them , unfavorable to freedom , literature , or morality . It is to be remarked that the following speech is addressed , by the old Anarch , to a council of war , consisting of his compeers , his general officers , and counselors of state : Hail ! fav'rite State , whose nursing fathers prove Their fairest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck with pop'lar votes elate , The mighty Jacktar guides the helm of state ; Nurs 'd on the waves , in blust'ring tempests bred , His heart of marble , and his brain of lead , My foes subdued while knavery wins the day , He rules the senate with inglorious sway ; Proud , for one year , my orders to perform , Sails in the whirlwind , and enjoys the storm .

Oh , roguery ! their being 's end and aim , Fraud , tendry , paper bills , whate'er thy name ; That medium still , which prompts th'eternal sigh , By which great villains flourish , small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's heat , Say in what mortal soil thou deign'st to cheat ? Fair from the Gen'ral Court 's unpardon 'd sin , Ap'st thou the gold Peruvian mines within ? Wak 'd to new life , by my creative power , The press thy mint , and dunghill rags thy ore . Where grow'st thou not ? If vain the villain 's toil , We ought to blame the culture , not the soil ; Fix 'd to that isle , it nowhere passes free , But fled from Congress , C  --  s dwells with thee . Hail ! realm of rogues , renown 'd for fraud and guile , All hail ! ye knav'ries of yon little isle . There prowls the rascal , cloth 'd with legal pow'r , To snare the orphan , and the poor devour ; The crafty knave his creditor besets , And advertising paper pays his debts ; Bankrupts their creditors with rage pursue , No stop , no mercy from the debtor crew . Arm 'd with new tests , the licens 'd villain bold , Presents his bills , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rogues and counterfeiters lose , No legal robber fears the gallows noose . Look through the State , the unhallow 'd ground appears A pen of dragons , and a cave for bears ; A nest of vipers , mix 'd with adders foul ; The screeching night-bird , and the greater owl : For now , unrighteousness , a deluge wide , Pours round the land an overwhelming tide ; And dark injustice , wrapp 'd in paper sheets , Rolls a dread torrent through the wasted streets ; While net of law th'unwary fry draw in To damning deeds , and scarce they know they sin . New paper struck , new tests , new tenders made , Insult mankind , and help the thriving trade . Each weekly print new lists of cheats proclaims , Proud to enroll their knav'ries and their names ; The wiser race , the snares of law to shun , Like lot from Sodom , from Rhode Island run .

These good people are specified individually , in proportion to the sums deposited , as proper to be captains over tens , over fifties , over hundreds , and over thousands , whenever the army shall be raised for the support of anarchy , or whenever that new state , ( whereof the rumor runs so rise on earth , ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted into the confederacy . The characters of the Judges of the Supreme Court , of the Governors , Green and Bowen , the Generals , Varnum and Miller , President Manning , Dr. Hitchcock , the Colonels Sherburne and Olney , the officers of the late army , with a long catalogue of names , ( comprising all the honest men in the State , ) are represented as the antipodes of the preceding .

EXTRACT FROM MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS FOUND IN THE SAME FORT WITH THE ANARCHIAD . Footnote : 1Kb Songs on love , conviviality , martial achievements , and imperial glory , are common to all nations . The composition of such songs as tend to excite the feelings of patriotism , has been deemed an object of no small importance . It has even been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated for and understood by the multitude , may have as much influence on their manners , as the civil institutions of legislation . Indeed , a political writer , of eminence , has gone so far as to assert that it did not matter so much who had the power of making laws , as who had that of making songs for the people . The British seem to have sung themselves into a belief that their naval prowess is invincible . And this belief has contributed not a little to establish their empire on the main . If Americans could be taught to revere themselves ; if they could be made to realize their consequence , in the scale of existence , so far from being desperate in their situation , the inhabitants of such a country , under such circumstances for happiness , might be considered as the peculiar favorites of heaven , and actors on the most conspicuous theater that ever was allotted to mankind . Such is the fact . And so the Genius of America is represented to have sung , in mystical numbers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The society of critics and antiquarians are pleased to find that this Ode is preserved , entire . They make no doubt that the wildness and grandeur of scenery , the sublimity of description , the beauty of imagery , the boldness of transition , the melody of versification , and the predictive solemnity of diction , which give sufficient demonstration of its originality , will recommend it to the amateurs of poetry and music . Should the taste of their countrymen , in general , be uncorrupted , as they flatter themselves it is , they expect this song will be introduced into most of the polite circles in the Unites States . The literati have often lamented that America could boast of but few original songs , worthy its imperial dignity . It is expected , if the success of the following should be in proportion to its merits , other compositions of a similar nature may yet be discovered .

A vast concourse of people , as is usual , attended on the melancholy occasion , in expectation of being entertained by the eloquence of so great an orator . Nor were they disappointed . In the course of his oration , after giving a beautiful narrative of his life and conversation , and offering much good advice to the spectators , he broke out into the following pathetic exclamation : " Oh !

At length my high-blown pride broke under me , and left me  --  " Here the tears flowed in torrents , and stifled sighs had well-nigh choaked articulation ; when , looking round on the crowd , he espied the Sachem of Muskingum , and Joseph Copper . This sight rekindled the lightning of his dreadful eye , and bade the big bolts of eloquence to roll : " Accursed day ! hateful sight ! What do my eyes behold ! There walk , unchained , unmanacled , unhanged , the men who have betrayed me to this shameful fate  --  the men who will , ere long , effect their country 's ruin . Yes , Copper , with bitterness of soul I have seen the error of my ways . I could not die in peace without divulging our common crimes . Oh , thou tempter of unwary innocence !

When the fair fugitive the orient chased , She fixed her feet beyond the watery waste ; Her docile sons ( enough of power resign 'd , And natural rights in social leagues combin 'd ) In virtue firm , though jealous in her cause , Gave Senates force , and energy to laws ; From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverence for one general sway ; For breach of faith , no keen compulsion feel , And find no interest in the federal weal . But know , ye favor 'd race , one potent head Must rule your States , and strike your foes with dread , The finance regulate , the trade control , Live through the empire , and accord the whole . Ere death invades , and night 's deep curtain falls , Through ruined realms the voice of Union calls ; Loud as the trump of heaven through darkness roars , When gyral gusts entomb Caribbean towers  --  When nature trembles , through the deeps convuls 'd , And ocean foams , from craggy cliffs repuls 'd ; On you she calls ! attend the warning cry : " Ye Live United , or Divided Die !

Footnote : 1Kb The critics are agreed that the intervention of gods , demons , and other supernatural agents , is absolutely necessary in epic poetry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are indebted to this machinery for their brightest ornaments . But the Pagan system has been long explored ; imitation has become trite and servile , and truth and reality , on such a subject , afford little assistance to poetic invention . Hence many eminent writers have recommended to the moderns to introduce some new kind of machinery , or to embellish their heroic poems by the agency of superior beings ; borrowing from the mythology of India , or the wilder visions of the Goths . The ideas of rude nations and enlightened ages concerning the future state and the inhabitants of another world , however erroneous in truth and theory , are replete with sublimity and horror . The hell of the Gothic bards is peopled with aerial beings , conceived by the boldest efforts of a terrified imagination ; nor is there less sublimity in the extravagant inventions of the Shastah . Pictures of this kind , drawn by the pen of genius , most forcibly awaken our curiosity , and interest our attention . The reader who slumbers over historical narration , finds himself animated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ghosts of Ossian . A poem so sublime , regular and complete , as The Anarchiad , could not be deficient in this necessary ornament : nor can anything be more curious and entertaining than the ideas of the early inhabitants of this land , concerning the wonders of the invisible world : ideas equally just , but far more elevated than all the witchcraft and possessions of our immediate ancestors . The society of critics and antiquarians have successfully deciphered the Seventeenth Book of The Anarchiad , in which the poet makes a descent into the infernal regions . It is curious to observe how closely he has been followed ( as , indeed , might naturally be expected ) by Homer , Virgil , and their successors in modern ages . The philosophical cause which has led all poets into those regions , we shall not attempt to investigate . The following extract is more excellent in its plan , and has suffered less from the hands of imitators . The Land of Annihilation , described in so picturesque a manner , is a valuable addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beings , properly the denizens of that country , who , after having mixed , undistinguished , with mankind , and performed all human functions , then returned to their primitive nihility , might pass for a burlesque , if it were not found in so serious a performance . Beyond the realms where stygian horrors dwell , And floods sulphureous whelm the vales of hell ; Where Naiad furies , yelling as they lave , In fiery eddies roll the turbid wave : Beyond the verge of chaos ' utmost clime , The dubious bounds of nature , space , and time ; A realm extends its unessential gloom , The vast creation 's universal tomb ! There no fair suns emblaze the courts on high , Nor moon , nor starry fires , the evening sky ; No matin clouds in ether hang their sails , Nor moving spirit wakes the vernal gales ; But endless twilight , with a feeble ray , Browns the dim horrors of the dusky day ; And silence , sameness , and eternal shade , Th'unbounded wild inanity pervade . In night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , Annihilation , reigns ! Eldest of fiends ! whose uncreating breath Peoples the shores of darkness and of death ; Down the deep gulf 's absorbing vortex whirl 'd , Sink the vain splendors of each upper world ; Ambition 's toils , the statesman 's gloried name , The hero 's triumph , and the poet 's fame ; Insatiate throngs , who , fired with the lust of gain , Rive the firm earth , and force the faithless main ; Here , lulled to rest , eternal stillness keep , And curtain 'd close in dead oblivion , sleep . Beneath his scepter , in imperial state , His stern commands ten thousand demons wait ; Prompt , like their prince , in elemental wars To tread out empires , and to quench the stars ; Extinguish 'd worlds in delug 'd fires to lave  --  Sweep ruin 'd systems to a common grave ; Exterminate existence , and restore The vanquish 'd vacuum to the tyrant 's power .

Of these , the least , in medicine 's garb arrayed , With deadly art pursues the healing trade  --  The lancet wield , prescribe the poisonous pill , Invent the nostrum , and , unlicensed , kill ; O'erload the stygian bark with frequent freight , And crowd with angry ghosts the realm of fate .

But chief the race allured by fleeting fame , Who seek on earth the politician 's name ; Auspicious race ! whom folly joys to bless , And wealth and honor crown with glad success ; Formed , like balloons , by emptiness to rise On pop'lar gales , to waft them through the skies , In wond'ring air the fog-born meteors stand , And shine the Wimbles of th'applauding land .

AMERICAN ANTIQUITIES .  --  No . XII . EXTRACT FROM THE ANARCHIAD , BOOK XVII . THE REGION OF PREEXISTENT SPIRITS . Footnote : 1Kb The flattering attention of the public has engaged the society of critics and antiquarians to give some further extracts from the same Book which concludes with the description of " The Land of Annihilation . " In his progress through the shades , the Bard is attended by an ancient seer , the Merlin of the West , who explains to him the nature of the country , and the character of its inhabitants . The history of their travels is very entertaining . The account of the various regions and circles into which the Subterranean World is divided , has in many parts been copied by the famous Italian poet , Dante , in his " Inferno . " The American bard seems to have been the first who entered the Region of Preexistent Spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nas , whose observations may be found in the Sixth Book of Virgil ; and notwithstanding our author made his visit at a much earlier period , his relation appears to be equally curious and authentic . That part of the Book which we shall now transcribe , contains the description of many illustrious personages who were to make their appearance on earth , both in Europe and America , in the eighteenth century from the Christian era . From the same amor patri which has animated poets in all ages , the seer and the bard have dwelt with peculiar pleasure on those great writers who were destined to spend their lives and lucubrations , and to invent so many curious theories , both in philosophy and history , for demonstrating the debility and diminution of nature in the western hemisphere , and for belittling the great objects on which they were to treat , to the level of European comprehension . He beholds , with admiration , the souls of those learned sages to whom we are since indebted for the discovery that in this part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the productions of the eastern continent ; that man has wonderfully degenerated in courage , activity , and other marks of virility ; and that " America has never produced one good Poet , one able Mathematician , or one man of Genius in one single Art , or one single Science , " Footnote : 2Kb as the sagacious Abbe Raynal has wisely observed . These he finds grouped in the same circle with those inventive historians and essayists who have lately indulged that ungovernable propensity to the marvelous , with which they seem to have been inspired from all eternity . He describes his entrance into the circle , in the following sublime and awful manner : Darkling they plied o'er many a burning heath , Down the low shores of Erebus and Death  --  When , through th'obscure they saw the glim'ring glades ' Twixt Orcus central , and th'Elysian shades : As hov'ring dreams the slumb'ring eye assail , Unnumber 'd phantoms flit among the vale ; And sounds as vague and hollow meet the ear , As startled fancy hears , or seems to hear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sees shadowy spectres issuing from the tomb : The unreal forms the bard , astonish 'd , eyed , And ask 'd the wonder from the friendly guide . Behold , the seer replies , on those dark coasts The vagrant hordes of preexistent ghosts  --  Elect for earth , and destined to be born When time 's slow course shall wake the natal morn : Approach and view , in this , their embryo home , Wits , poets , chiefs , and sages yet to come . See yonder group , that scorn the vulgar crowd , Absorb 'd in thought , of conscious learning proud , Who , rapt with foretaste of their glorious day , Now seiz 'd the pen , impatient of delay : These shades shall late in Europe 's clime arise , And scan new worlds with philosophic eyes : Immured at home , in rambling fancy brave , Explore all lands beyond th'Atlantic wave ; Of laws for unknown realms invent new codes , Write natural histories for their antipodes ; Tell how th'enfeebled powers of life decay , Where falling suns defraud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accurst by fate , Created , lost , or stolen from ocean late ; See vegetation , man , and bird , and beast , Just by the distance ' squares in size decreased ; See mountain pines to dwarfish reeds descend , Aspiring oaks in pigmy shrub oaks end ;  --  The heaven-topp 'd Andes sink a humble hill ,  --  Sea-like Potomac run a tinkling rill ;  --  Huge mammoth dwindle to a mouse 's size  --  Columbian turkeys turn European flies ;  --  Exotic birds , and foreign beasts , grow small , And man , the lordliest , shrink to least of all : While each vain whim their loaded skulls conceive Whole realms shall reverence , and all fools believe . In passing farther , the seer points out the father of this system , in the soul of the famous Abbe de Pau , who was then busied in prying into futurity , by the aid of a philosophic telescope , calculated to diminish all objects , according to the squares of the distances , as has been hinted . And thus continues the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show All nature lessening to the sage De Pau ; E'en now his head the cleric tonsures grace , And all the abbe blossoms in his face ; His peerless pen shall raise , with magic lore , The long-lost pigmies on th'Atlantic shore ; Make niggard nature 's noblest gifts decline Th'indicial marks of bodies masculine ; Nor seek the proof of those who best can tell The well-taught duchess , and Parisian belle . He then points out the Compte de Buffon , the Abbe Raynal , Dr. Robertson , and the whole train of imitators , attendant on their master , imbibing learning and wisdom from his lips , and preparing , in the future world , even , to excel their instructor . He appears to have exactly foreseen Dr. Robertson 's " History of America , " and his observation that the soil of America is prolific in nothing but reptiles and insects . The allusion to Moses , in the following lines , seems to confirm the opinion of some learned writers , that the natives of this country were descended from the Jews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in historic pride , Rush , with blind fury , o'er th'Atlantic tide ; He lifts , in wrath , his plague-compelling wand , And deadly murrain blasts the fated land : His parent call awakes the insect train  --  Gnats cloud the skies , and ants devour the plain ; Thick swarming frogs attend his magic voice  --  Rods change to serpents , and the dust to lice . Here the seer took occasion to inform the bard how remarkable some of his own countrymen would become , for being the humble copyists and echoes of these transatlantic imitators ; and particularly , that a great Morris should arise in process of time , who , never having enjoyed , the superior advantage of perusing that astonishing work of genius , The Anarchiad , or any other American poem , should dogmatically decide , in his capacity of Senator , Footnote : 2Kb that America never had produced a good poet . He designates him by the subsequent characteristics : That plodding shade , who , ere he starts from hence , By mammon taught , in shillings , pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall claim Gold for his God , and Morris for his name ; With purse-proud wit , and Senatorial rank , His critic talents glowing from the bank ; From famed Raynal 's wise labors , shall declare , That not one poet breathes Columbian air ! Yet not all wits who there to fame advance , Shall take their cue from dictatorial France ; But , like sincere allies , each needy friend Shall sometimes borrow lies , and sometimes lend . Scared at the shape of Cincinnatus ' name , The envious Burke denied that road to fame ; Stars , ribbands , mantles , crowding on his brain , " Blows the loud trump ! " Footnote : 1Kb and calls the jealous train ; Fills gaping herds with visionary fears Of landless nobles , and of penceless peers ; From social rites , and charity , debars The unpaid veterans of successful wars  --  Proscribes all worth , by ostracising doom , To death or exile , as in Greece or Rome ; While safe himself , he boasts a strong defense , Clear from the crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scribblers learn their lore , And write , like him , as man ne'er wrote before ; Grave Demeunier , with borrowed tales , and weak , Th'encyclopedias ' endless tomes shall eke  --  Assert with falsehood , and with froth disclaim , Forebode the issues , and foresee the aim ; Through time 's dark vale , the plans of fate explore , By ign'rance aided in prophetic power ; As old Tiresias , favor 'd of the skies , Gain 'd gifts oracular by the loss of eyes . From these worthies he makes an easy transition to the shade of the redoubtable Comte Mirabeau , who , having lately emerged from the Basille , has employed his tremendous pen on " the Cincinnati , " " the Navigation of the Scheldt , " " the Waterworks of Paris , " " the projected Bank of St. Charles , in Spain , " and innumerable other knotty points : in some of which he has been seconded , and in others , opposed , by his brother in scribbling and the Bastile , the perjured Linguet . It appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imfamous for unnatural vices . The father of the present comte was distinguished , in Paris , by the title of omi des hommes , ( the lover of mankind . ) The seer points out these characters , and relates the result of a council concerning their future destiny , in the following manner : When souls select , near Jordan rose to dwell , And people Sodom with the dregs of hell , Great was the doubt , and great the learn 'd debates , Through the grand conclave of th'infernal States , With that vile crew , if these should rise to earth , Or future Europe better claim 'd their birth ; The latter vote prevail 'd ; on this dark stage Each incubus awaits the destined age ; Then shall their souls to human forms advance , And spring to light the Mirabeaus of France . Yet not alone to carnal views confined ; The younger shades , for mental toils designed , Profuse of lies , and obstinate in ill , On every theme shall try his gall-dipt quill : In Burke 's proud steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demeunier 's fame . The next group of souls who pass in review , consists of those wise civilians who have generously wasted such fountains of ink in endeavoring to instruct poor America in her own history and politics . The Abby Mably is mentioned with particular respect . Nor is a just tribute of praise denied to the modest Target , who , supposing that no laws existed in the United States , and that the people were incapable of devising any system , humanely proposed to Congress to supply that deficiency , and furnish a code for the use of the empire . The seer , on beholding his shade , thus apostrophizes : Inflated pride ! all-feeling ignorance ! Ye grand inspirers of the wits of France ! On blest Target exhaust your utmost power ; Shower all your gifts , and lavish all your store ! I see him , tow'ring ' mid th'applauding throng , Pomp in his air , and bluster on his tongue ; Wave-dangling far , his wig-official curl 'd  --  A sign of sapience , to the western world . Throned ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fates , A self-made Solon for the rising States . In the next department appear the souls of those European historians and biographers who have amused their readers with many fairy tales , the scenes of which they have had the complaisance to lay in America . We are sorry the length of this number prevents our enlarging upon this part of the Book . The seer enters into a detail of their falsehoods , with great accuracy and minuteness ; and even condescends to notice the history of Connecticut , invented by Parson Peters , the fag-end man of M'Fingal . But he pays particular attention to the great genius of D'Auberteul , who has so ably displayed his creative talents in embellishing the late American revolution ; describing the manner of cutting up the crown into thirteen pieces , and sending it to the several States ; and giving the interesting novel of the amours of General Washington ; with a great variety of particulars , equally true and instructive . He concludes with the following sublime address to his shade , which has been closely copied by Pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years , and rise the expected morn ! Oh spring to light ! auspicious sage , be born ! The new-found world shall all your cares engage ; The promised lyre of the future age . No more shall glory gild the hero 's name , Nor envy sicken at the deeds of fame ; Virtue no more the generous breast shall fire , Nor radiant truth the historic page inspire ; But lost , dissolved in thy superior shade , One tide of falsehood o'er the world be spread ; In wit 's light robe shall gaudy fiction shine , And all be lies , as in a work of thine .
