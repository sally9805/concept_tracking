txt PASSAGES FROM HAWTHORNE 'S NOTE-BOOKS. x . SUNDAY , 4/wil 9 , 1843. - .... After finishing my record in the journal , I sat a long time in grandmother 's chair , thinking of many things My spirits were at a lower ebb than they ever descend to when I am not al6ne ; nevertheless , neither was I absolutely sad . Many times I wound and rewound Mr. Thoreau 's little musical box ; but certainly its peculiar sweetness had evaporated , and I am pretty sure that I should throw it out of the window were I doomed to hear it long and often . It has not an infinite soul . When it was almost as dark as the moonlight would let it be , I lighted the lamp , and went on with Tieck 's tale , slowly and painfully , often wishing for help in my difficulties . At last I determined to learn a little about pronouns and verbs before proceeding further , and so took up the phrasebook , with which I was commendably husy , when , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my study-door , and , behold , there was Molly with a letter ! How she came by it I did not ask , being content to suppose it was hrou6ht by a heavenly messenger . I had not expected a letter ; and what a comfort it was to me in my loneliness and sombreness ! I called Molly to take her note ( enclosed ) , which she received with a face of delight as broad and bright as the kitchen fire . Then I read , and reread , and re-re-read , and quadruply , quintuply , and sextuply re-read my epistle , until I had it all by heart , and then continued to re-read it for the sake of the penmanship . Then I took up the phrase-book again ; but could not study , and so bathed and retired , it being now not far from ten o'clock . I lay awake a good deal in the night , but saw no ghost . I arose about seven , and found that the upper part of my nose , and the region roundabout , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left eye there is a great spot of almost black purple , and a broad streak of the same hue semicireling beneath either eye , while green , yellow , and orange overspread the circumj*cent country . It looks not unlike a gorgeous sunset , throwing its splendor over the heaven of my countenance . It will behoove me to show myself as little as possible ; else people will think I have fou$it a pitched battle The Devil . take the stick of wood ! What had I done , that it should bemaul me so ? However , there is no pain , though , I think , a very slight affection of the eyes . This forenoon I began to write , and caught an idea by the skirts , which I intend to hold fast , though it struggles to get free .. As it was not readyto be put upon paper , however , I took up the Dial , and finished reading the article on Mr. Alcott . It is not very satisfactory , and it has not taught me much . Then I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About this time the dinner-bell rang , and I went down without much alacrity , though with a good appetite enough It was in the angle of my rzgkt eye , not my left , that the blackest purple was collected . But they both look like the very Devil . Half *czstfive o'clock . - After writing the above I again set to work on Tieck 's tale , and worried through several pages ; and then , at half past four , threw open one of the western windows of my study , and sallied forth to take the sunshine . I went down through the orchard to the river-side . The orchard-path is still deeply covered with siiow ; and so is the whole visible universe , except streaks upon the hillsides , and spots in the sunny hollows , where the brown earth peeps through . The river , which a few days ago was entirely imprisoned , has now broken its fetters ; but a tract of ice extended across from near the foot of the monument to the abutment of the old bridge , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a day or two . Large cakes and masses of ice came floating down the current , which , though not very violent , hurried along at a much swifter pace than the ordinary one of our sluggish river-god . These ice-masses , when they struck the barrier of ice above mentioned , acted upon it like a battering-ram , and were themselves forced high out of the water , or sometimes carried b*neath the main sheet of ice . At last , down the stream came an immense mass of ice , and , striking the barrier about at its centre , it gave way , and the whole was swept onward together , leaving the river entirely free , with only here and there a cake of ice floating quietly along . The great accumulation , in its downward course , hit against a tree that stood in and caused it to quiver - mid*current , like a reed ; and it swept quite over the shrubbery that bordered what , in summer-time , is the river 's bank , but which is now nearly the centre of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noble breadth . The little hillock which formed the abutment of the old bridge is now an island with its tuft of trees . Along the hither shore a row of trees stand up to their knees , and the smaller ones to their middles , in the water ; and afar off , on the surface of the stream , we see tufts of bushes emerging , thrusting up their heads , as it were , to breathe . The water comes over the stone wall , and encroaches several yards on the boundaries of our orchard . Here the supper-bell rang . If our boat were in good order , I should now set forth on voyages of discovery , and visit nooks on the borders of the meadows , which by and by will be a mile or two from the water 's edge . But she is in very bad condition , full of water , and , doubtless , as leaky as a sieve . On coming from supper , I found that little Puss had established herself in the study , probably with intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the footstool between my feet , purring most obstreperously . The day of my wife 's departure , she came to me , talking with the greatest earnestness ; but whether it was to condole with me on my loss , or to demand my redoubled care for // herself , I could not well make out . As Puss now constitutes a third part of the family , this mention of her will not appear amiss . How Molly employs herself , I know not . Once in a while , I hear a door slam like a thunder-clap ; but she never shows her face , nor speaks a word , unless to announce a visitor or deliver a letter . This day , on my part , will have been spent without exchanging a syllable with any human being , unless something unforeseen should yet call for the exercise of speech before bedtime . Monday , April io. - I sat till eight o'clock , meditating upon this world and the next and sometimes dimly shaping* out scenes of a tale . Then betook rny*e1Pto he German phrasebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp would not brighten my spirits , though it was duly filled . . . . This forenoon was spent in scribbling , by no means to my satisfaction , until past eleven , when I went to the village . Nothing in our box at the post-office . I read during the customary hour , or more , at the Athemeum , and returned without saying a word to mortal . I gathered from some conversation that I heard , that a son of Adam is to be buried this afternoon from the meeting-house ; but the name of the deceased escaped me . It is no great matter , so it be but written in the Book of Life . My variegated face looks somewhat more human to-day ; though I was unaffectedly ashamed to meet anybody 's gaze , and therefore turned my back or my shoulder as much as possible upon the world . At dinner , behold an immense joint of roast veal ! I would willingly have had some assistance in the discussion of this great piece of calf* I am ashamed to eat alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the tribute which we are compelled to pay to our grosser nature ; whereas in the company of another it is refined and moralized and spiritualized ; and over our earthly victuals ( or rather vittles , for the former is a very foolish mode of spelling ) , - over our earthly vittles is diffused a sauce of lofty and gentle thoughts , and tough meat is mollified with tender feelings . But oh ! these solitary meals are the dismallest part of my present experience . When the company rose from table , they all , in my single person , ascended to the study , and employed themselves in reading the article on Oregon in the Democratic Review . Then they plodded oRward in the rugged and bewildering depths of Tieck 's tale until five o'clock , when , with one accord , they went out to split wood . This has been a gray day , with now and then a sprinkling of snow-flakes through the air To-day no more than yesterday have I spoken a word to mortaL**. *-It * now sunset , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditated accordingly , but without any very wonderful result . Then at eight o'clock bothered myself till after nine with this eternal tale of Tieck . The forenoon was spent in scribbling ; but at eleven o'clock my thoughts ceased to flow , - indeed , their current has been wofully interrupted all along , - so I threw down my pen , and set out on the daily journey to the village . Horrible walking ! I wasted the customary hour at the Athenamm , and returned home , if home it may now be called . Till dinner-time I labored on Tieck 's tale , and resumed that agreeable employment after the banquet . Just when I was at the point of choking with a huge German word , Molly announced Mr. Thoreau . He wished to take a row in the boat , for the last time , perhaps , before he leaves Concord . So we emptied the water out of her , and set forth on our voyage . She leaks , but not more than she did in the autumn . We rowed to the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there landed , and climbed the moist and snowy hillside for the sake of the prospect . Looking down the river , it might well have been mistaken for an arm of the sea , so broad is now its swollen tide ; and I could // have fancied that , beyond one other headland , the mighty ocean would outspread itself before the eye . On our return we boarded a large cake of ice , which was floating down the river , and were borne by it directly to our own landing - place , with the boat towing behind . Parting with Mr. Thoreau I spent half an hour in chopping wood , when Molly informed me that Mr. Emerson wished to see me . He had brought a letter of Ellery Channing , written in a style of very pleasant humor . This being read and discussed , together with a few other matters , he took his leave , since which I have been attending to my journalizing duty ; and thus this record is brought down to the present moment . April 25. - Spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as is the case now , with chill , moist , sullen ones . There is an influence in the season that makes it almost impossible for me to bring my mind down to literary employment ; perhaps because several months ' pretty constant work has exhausted that species of energy , - perhaps because in spring it is more natural to labor actively than to think . But my impulse now is to be idle altogether , - to lie in the sun , or wander about and look at the revival of Nature from her deathlike slumber , or to be borne down the current of the river in my boat . If I had wings , I would gladly fly ; yet would prefer to be wafted along by a breeze , sometimes alighting on a patch of green grass , then gently whirled away to a still sunnier spot 0 , how blest should I be were there nothing to do ! Then I would watch every inch and hair 's breadth of the progress of the season ; and not a leaf should put itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without my noting it . But now , with the burden of a continual task upon me , I have not freedom c* mind to make such observations . I merely see what is going on in a very general way . The snow , which , two or three weeks ago , 453 covered hill and valley , is now diminished to one or two solitary specks in the visible landscape ; though doubtless there are still heaps of it in the shady places in the woods . There have been no violent rains to carry it off : it has diminished gradually , inch by inch , and day after day ; and I observed , along the roadside , that the green blades of grass had sometimes sprouted on the very edge of the snowdrift , the moment that the earth was uncovered . The pastures and grass-fields have not yet a general effect of green ; nor have they that cheerless brown tint which they wear in later autumn , when vegetation has entirely ceased . There is now a suspicion of verdure , - the faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes , in a happy exposure , - there is one such tract across the river , the carefully cultivated mowing-field , in front of an old red homestead , - such patches of land wear a beautiful and tender green , which no other season will equal ; because , let the grass be green as it may hereafter , it will not be so set off by surrounding barrenness . The trees in our orchard , and elsewhere , have as yet no leaves ; yet to the most careless eye they appear full of life and vegetable blood . It seems as if , by one magic touch , they might instantaneously put forth all their foliage , and the wind , which now sighs through their naked branches , might all at once find itself impeded by innumerable leaves . This sudden development would be scarcely more wonderful than the gleam of verdure which often brightens , in a moment , as it were , along the slope of a bank or roadside . It is like a gleam of sunlight . Just now it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and there is an apparition of green grass . The Spring , no doubt , comes onward with fleeter footsteps , because Winter has lingered so long that , at best , she can hardly retrieve half the allotted term of her reign . The river , this season , has encroached farther on the land than it has been Passages from Hawthorne s Note-Books. // known to do for twenty years past . It has formed along its course a succession of lakes , with a current through the midst . My boat h*us lain at the hottorn of the orchard , in very convenient proximity to the house . It has borne me over stone fences ; and , a few days ago , Ellery Channing and I passed through two rails into the great northern road , along which we paddled for some distance . The trees have a singular appearance in the midst of waters . The curtailment of their trunks quite destroys the proportions of the whole tree ; and we become conscious of a regularity and propriety in the forms of Nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now subsiding , but gradually . Islands become annexed to the mainland , and other islands emerge from the flood , and will soon , likewise , be connected with the continent . We have seen on a small scale the process of the deluge , and can now witness that of the reappearance of the earth . Crows visited us long before the snow was off . They seem mostly to have departed now , or else to have betaken themselves to remote depths of the woods , which they haunt all summer long . Ducks came in great numbers , and many sportsmen went in pursuit of them , along the river ; but they also have disappeared . Gulls come up from seaward , and soar high overhead , flapping their broad wings in the upper sunshine . They are among the most picturesque bir*ls that I am acquainted with ; indeed , quite the most so , because the manner of their flight makes them almost stationary parts of the landscape . The imagination has time to rest upon them ; they have not flitted away in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lay hold of these soaring gulls , and repose with them upon the sustaining atmosphere . The smaller birds , - the birds that build their nests in our trees , and sing for us at morning-red , - I will not describe But I must mention the great companies of blackbirds - more than the famous October , " four-and-twenty " who were baked in a pie - that congregate on the tops of contiguous trees , and vociferate with all the clamor of a turbulen*t political meeting . Politics must certainly be the subject of such a tumultuous debate ; but still there is a melody in each individual utterance , and a harmony in the general effect . Mr. Thoreau tells me that these noisy assemblages consist of three different species of blackbirds ; but I forget the other two . Robins have been long among us , and swallows have more recently arrived . Atril 26. - Here is another misty day , muffling the sun . The lilac shrubs under my study-window are almost in leaf . In two or three days more , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These lilacs appear to be very aged , and have lost the luxuriant foliage of their prime . Old age has a singular aspect in lilacs , rose-bushes , and other ornamental shrubs . It seems as if such things , as they grow only for beauty , ought to flourish in immortal youth , or at least to die before their decrepitude . They are trees of Paradise , and therefore not naturally subject to decay ; but have lost their birthright by being transplanted hither . There is a kind of ludicrous unfitness in the idea of a venerable rose-bush ; and there is something analogous to this in human life . Persons who can only be graceful and ornamental - who can give the world nothing but flow*rs - should die young , and n*ver be seen with gray hairs and wrinkles , any more than the flower-shrubs with mossy bark and scanty foliage , like the lilacs under my window . Not that beauty is not worthy of immortality . Nothing else , indeed , is worthy of it ; and thence , perhaps , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Apple-trees , on the other hand , grow old without repronch . Let them live as long as they may , and contort themselves in whatever fashion they please , they are still respectable , even if 1*hey afford us only an apple or two in a season , or 4 Pcissagcs from Hawt/*orne 's No/e-B&amp; , ks. // none at all . Human flower-shrubs , if they will grow old on earth , should , beside their lovely blossoms , bear some kind of fruit that will satisfy earthly appetites ; else men will not be satisfied that the moss should gather on them . Winter and Spring are now struggling for the mastery in my study ; and I yield somewhat to each , and wholly to neither . The window is open , and there is a fire in the stave . The day when the *vindow is first thrown open should be an epoch in the year ; but I have forgotten to record it . Seventy or ei*hty springs have visited this old house ; and sixty of them found old Dr. Ripley here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but gradually getting wrinkles and gray hairs , and looking more and more the picture of winter . But he was no flower-shrub , but one of those fruittrees or timber - trees that acquire a grace with their old age . Last Spring found this house solitary for the first time since it was built ; and now again she peeps into our open windows and finds new faces here It is remarkable how much uncleanness winter brings with it , or leaves behind it The yard , garden , and avenue , which should be my department , require a great amount of labor . The avenue is strewed with withered leaves , - the whole crop , apparently , of last year , - some of which are now raked into heaps ; and we intend to make a bonfire of them . . . . . There are quantities of decayed branches , which one tempest after another has flung down , black and rotten . In the garden are the old cabbages which we did not think worth gathering last autumn , and *e dry bean-vines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , all the wrecks of the departed year , - its mouldering relics , its dry bones . It is a pity that the world can not be made over anew every spring . Then , in the yard , there are the piles of firewood , which I ought to have sawed and thrown into the shed long since , but which will cumber the earth , I fear , till June , at loast . Quantities of chips are strewn about , and on removing them we find the yellow stalks of grass sprouting underneath . Nature does her best to beautify this disarray . The grass springs up most industriously , especially in sheltered and sunny angles of the buildings , or round the door-steps , - a locality which seems particularly favorable to its growth ; for it is already high enough to bend over and wave in the wind . I was surprised to observe that some weeds ( especially a plant that stains the fingers with its yellow juice ) had lived , and retained their freshness and sap as perfectly as in summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw them , the last green thing , in the autumn ; and here they are again , the first in the spring . Thursday , Atril 27. -I took a walk into the fields , and round our opposite hill , yesterday noon , but made no very remarkable observation . The frogs have begun their concerts , though not as yet with a full choir . I found no violets nor anemones , nor anything in the likeness of a flower , though I looked carefully along the shelter of the stone walls , and in all spots apparently propitious . I ascended the hill , and had a wide prospect of a swollen river , extending around me in a semicircle of three or four miles , and rendering the view much finer than in summer , had there only been foliage . It seemed like the formation of a new world ; fdr islands were everywhere emerging , and capes extending forth into the flood ; and these tracts , which were thus won from the watery empire , were among the greenest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserts them to be her property , by covering them with verdure ; or perhaps the grass had been growing under the water . On the hill-top where I stood , th' grass had scarcely begun to sprout ; and I observed that even those places which looked greenest in the distance were but scantily grass-covered when I actually reached them . It *s hope that painted them so bright . i866. 455 // Last evening we saw a bright light on the river , betokening that a boat 's party were engaged in spearing fish . It looked like a descended star , - like red Mars , - and , as the water was perfectly smooth , its gleam was reflected downward into the depths . It is a very picturesque sight . In the deep quiet of the night I suddenly heard the light and lively note of a bird from a neighboring tree ,  --  a real song , such as those which greet the purple dawn , or mingle with the yellow sunshine . What could the little bird mean by pouring it forth at midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dream , in which he fancied himself in Paradise with his mate ; and , suddenly awaking , he found he was on a cold , leafless bough , with a New England mist penetrating through his feathers . That was a sad exchange of imagination for reality ; but if he found his mate beside him , all was well . This is another misty morning , ungenial in aspect , but kinder than it looks ; for it paints the hills and valleys with a richer brush than the sunshine could . There is more verdure now than when I looked out of the window an hour abo . The willow-tree opposite my study-window is ready to put forth its leaves . There are some objections to willows . It is not a dry and cleanly tree ; it impresses me with an association of sliminess ; and no trees , I think , are perfectly satisfactory , which have not a firm and hard texture of trunk and branches . But the willow is almost the earliest to put forth its leaves , and the last to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter its yellow twigs give it a sunny aspect , which is not without a cheering influence in a proper point of view . Our old house would lose much were this willow to be cut down , with its golden crown over the roof in winter , and its heap of summer verdj*re . The present Mr. Ripley planted it , fifty years ago , or thereabouts . Friday , 7une 2. - Last night there came a frost , which has done great damage to my garden . The beans have suffered very much , although , luckily , not more than half that I planted have come up . The squashes , both summer and winter , appear to be almost killed . As to the other vegetables , there is litlie mischief done , the potatoes not being yet above ground , except two or three ; and the peas and corn are of a hardier nature . It is sad that Nature will so sport with us poor mortals , inviting us with sunny smiles to confide in her ; and then , when we are entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our summer commences at the latter end of June , and terminates somewhere about the first of August . There are certainly not more than six weeks of the whole year when a frost may be deemed anything remarkable . Friday , rune 23. - Summer has come at last , - the longest days , with blazing sunshine , and fervid heat . Yesterday glowed like molten brass . Last night was the most uncomfortably and unsleepably sultry that we have experie.nced since our residence in Concord ; and to-day it scorches again . I have a sort of enjoyment in these seven times heated furnaces of midsummer , even though they make me droop like a thirsty plant . The sunshine can scarcely be too burning for my taste ; but I am no enemy to summer-showers . Could I only have the freedom to be perfectly idle now ,  --  - no duty to fulfil , no mental or physical labor to perform , - I should he as happy as a squash , and much in the same mode ; but the necessity of keeping my brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do into the heart of the vines . I keep myself uneasy and produce little , and almost nothing that is worth producing . The garden looks well now : the potatoes flourish ; the early corn waves in the wind ; the squashes , both for summer and winter use , are more forward , I suspect , than those of any of my neibhbors . I am forced , however , to carry on a contintwd warfare with the // squash-bugs , who , were I to let them alone for a day , would perhaps quite destroy the prospects of the whole summer . It is impossible not to feel angry with these unconscionable insects , who scruple not to do such excessive mischief to me , with only the profit of a meal or two to themselves . For their own sakes they ought at least to wait till the squashes are better grown . Why is it , I wonder , that Nature has provided such a host of enemies for every useful esculent , while the weeds are suffered to grow unmolested , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of propagation , that the gardener must maintain a continual struggle or they will hQpelessly overwhelm him ? What hidden virtue is there in these things , that it is granted them to sow themselves with the wind , and to grapple the earth with this immitigable stubbornness , and to flourish in spite of obstacles , and never to suffer blight beneath any sun or shade , but always to mock their enemies with the same wicked luxuriance ? It is truly a mystery , and also a symbol . There is a sort of sacredness about them . Perhaps , if we could penetrate Nature 's secrets , we should find that what we call weeds are more essential to the well-being of the world than the most precious fruit or grain . This may be doubted , however , for there is an unmistakable analogy between these wicked weeds and the bad habits and sinful propensities which have overrun the moral world ; and we may as well imagine that there is good in one as in the other . Our peas are in such forwardness that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table within a week . The beans have come up ill , *and I planted a fresh supply only the day before yesterday . We have watermelons in good advancement , and muskmelons also within three or four days . I set out some tomatoes last night , also some capers . It is my purpose to plant some more corn at the end of the nionth , or sooner . There ought to be a record of the flower-garden , and 457 of the procession of the wild-flowers , as minute , at least , as of the kitchen vegetables and pot-herbs . Above all , the noting of the appearance of the first roses should not be omitted ; nor of the Arethusa , one of the delicatest , gracefullest , and in every manner sweetest of the whole race of flowers . For a fortnight past I have found it in the swampy meadows , growing up to its chin in heaps of wet moss . Its hue is a delicate pink , of various depths of shade , and somewhat in the form of a Grecian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . Also the visit of two friends , who may fitly enough be mentioned among flowers , ought to have been described . Mrs. F. Sand Miss A. S . Also I have neglected to mention the birth of a little white dove . I never observed , until the present season , how long and late the twilight lingers in these longest days . The orange hue of the western horizon remains till ten o'clock , at least , and how much later I am unable to say . The night before last , I could distinguish letters by this lingering gleam between nine and ten o'clock . The dawn , I suppose , shows itself as early as two o'clock , so that the absolute dominion of night has dwindled to almost nothing . There seems to be also a diminished necessity , or , at all events , a much less possibility , of sleep than at other periods of the year . I get scarcely any sound repose just now . It is summer , and not winter , that steals away mortal life . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Saturday , 7zdy m. - We had our first dish of green peas ( a very small one ) yesterday . Every day for the last week has been tremendously hot ; and our garden flourishes like Eden itself , only Adam could hardly have been doomed to contend with such a ferocious banditti of weeds . Suiid'ay , 7uiy 9. - I know not what to say , and yet can not be satisfied without marking with a word or tw9 Passages from Hawl/2orne s Nate-Books. // this anniversary But life now swells and heaves beneath me like a brim-full ocean ; and the endeavor to comprise any portion of it in words is like trying to dip up the ocean in a goblet God bless and keep us ! for there is something more awful in happiness than in sorrow , - the latter being earthly and finite , the former composed of the substance and texture of eternity , so that spirits still embodied may well tremble at it . 7i*y i8. - This morning I gathered our first summer-squashes . We should have had them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vines , either by a disease of the roots or by those infernal bugs . We have had turnips and carrots several times . Currants are now ripe , and we are in the full enjoyment of cherries , which turn out much more delectable than I anticipated . George Hillard and Mrs. Hillard paid us a visit on Saturday last . On Monday afternoon he left us , and Mrs. Hillard still remains here . Friday , 7uty 28. - We had green corn for dinner yesterday , and shall have some more to-day , not quite full grown , but sufficiently so to be palatable . There has been no rain , except one moderate shower , for many weeks ; and the earth appears to be wasting away in a slow fever . This weather , I think , affects the spirits very unfavorably . There is an irksomeness , a restlessness , a pervading dissatisfaction , together with an absolute incapacity to bend the mind to any serious effort . With me , as regards literary production , the summer has been unprofitable ; and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autumn and winter . For the future , I shall endeavor to be so diligent nine months of the year that I may allow myself a full and free vacation of the other three . Monday , 7z*y 31. - We had our first cucumber yesterday . There were symptoms of rain on Saturday , and the weather has since been as moist as the thirstiest soul could desire . Wednesday , Se*ternber i*. - There was a frost the night before last , according to George Prescott ; but no effects of it were visible in our garden . Last night , however , there was another , which has nipped the leaves of the winter - squashes and cucumbers , but seems to have done no other damage . This is a beautiful morning , and promises to be one of those heavenly days that render autumn , after all , the most delightful season of the year . We mean to make a voyage on the river this afternoon . Sunday , Serf ember 23. - I have gathered the two last of our summer-squashes to-day . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have numbered fifty-eight edible ones , of excellent quality . Last Wednesday , I think , I harvested our winter sqnashes , sixty-three in number , and mostly of fine size . Our last series of green corn , planted about the ist of July , was good or eating two or three days ago . We still have beans ; and our tomatoes , though backward , supply us with a dish every day or two . My potato-crop promises well ; and , on the whole , my first independent experiment of agriculture is quite a successful one . This is a glorious day , - bright , very warm , yet with an unspeakable *entleness both in its Warmth and brightne* . On such days it is impossible not to love Nature , for she evidently loves us . At other seasons she does not give me this impression , or only at very rare intervals ; but in these happy , autumnal days , when she has perfected the harvests , and accomplished every necessary thing that she had to do , she overflows with a blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Thank God for breath , - yes , for mere breath ! when it is made up of su.ch a heavenly breeze as this . It comes to the cheek with a real kiss ; it would linger fondly around us , if it might ; but , since it must be gone , it // caresses us with its whole kindly heart , and passes onward , to caress likewise the next thing that it meets . There is a pervading blessing diffused over all the world . I look out of the window and think , " 0 perfect day ! 0 beautiful worldt 0 good God ! " And such a day is the promise of a blissful eternity . Our Creator would never have made such weather , and given us the deep heart to enjoy it , above and beyond all thought , if He had not meant us to be immortal . It opens the gates of heaven , and gives us glimpses far inward . Bless me ! this flight has carried me a great way ; so now let me come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripening ; and the apples and great thumping pears strew the grass in such abundance that it becomes almost a trouble - though a pleasant one - to gather them . This happy breeze , too , shakes them down , as if it flung fruit to us out of the sky ; and often , when the air is perfectly still , I hear the quiet fall of a great apple . Well , we are rich in blessings , thougl* poor in money Friday , October 6. - Yesterday afternoon I took a solitary walk to Walden Pond . It was a cool , windy day , with heavy clouds rolling and tumbling about the sky , but still a prevalence of genial autumn sunshine . The fields are *ill green , and the great masses of the woods have not yet assumed their many-colored garments ; but here and there are solitary oaks of deep , substantial red , or maples of a more brilliant hue , or chestnuts either yellow or of a tenderer green than in summer . Some trees seem to return to their hue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autumnal tints . In some places , along the borders of low and moist land , a whole range of trees were clothed in the perfect gorgeousness of autumn , of all shades of brilliant color , looking like the palette on which Nature was arranging the tints wherewith to paint a picture . These hues appeared to be thrown together without design ; and yet there was perfect harmony among them , and a softness and a delicacy made up of a thousand different brightnesses . There is not , I think , so much contrast among these colors as might *t first appear . The more you consider them , the more they seem to have one element among them all , which is the reason that the most brilliant display of them soothes the observer , instead of exciting him . And I know not whether it be more a moral effect or a physical one , operating merely on the eye ; but it is a pen . sive gayety , which causes a sigh often , and never a smile . We never fancy , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young damsels in holiday attire , and betake themselves to dancing on the plain . If they were to undergo such a transformation , they would surely arrange themselves in funeral procession , and go sadly along , with their purple and scarlet and golden garments trailing over the withering grass . When the sunshine falls upon them , they seem to smile ; but it is as if they were heart-broken . But it is in vain for me to attempt to describe these autumnal brilliancies , or to convey the impression which they make on me . I have tried a thousand times , and always without the slightest selfsatisfaction . Fortunately there is no need of such a record , for Nature renews the picture year after year ; and even when we shall have passed away from the world , we can spiritually create these scenes , so that we may dispense with all efforts to put them into words . Walden Pond was clear and beautiful as usual . It tempted me to bathe ; and , though the water was thrillingly cold , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there such transparent water as this . I threw sticks into it , and saw them float suspended on an almost invisible medium . It seemed as if the pure air were beneath them , as well as above . It is fit for baptisms ; but one would not wish it to he polluted hy having sins washed into it . None hut angels should bathe 459 // in it ; but blessed babies might be dipped into its bosom . In a small and secluded dell that opens upon the most beautiful cove of the whole lake , there is a little hamlet of huts or shanties , inhabited by the Irish people who are at work upon the railroad . There are three or four of these habitations , the very rudest , I should imagine , that civilized men ever made for themselves , - constructed of rough boards , with the protruding ends . Against some of them the earth is heaped up to the roof , or nearly so ; and when the grass has had time to sprout upon them , they will look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - something in which Nature has a larger share than man . These huts are placed beneath the trees , oaks , walnuts , and white-pines , wherever the trunks give them space to stand ; and by thus adapting themselves to natural interstices , instead of making new ones , they do not break or disturb the solitude and seclusion of the place . Voices are heard , and the shouts and laughter of children , who play about like the sunbeams that come down through the branches . Women are washing in open spaces , and long lines of whitened clothes are extended from tree to tree , fluttering and gainboiling in the breeze . A pig , in a sty even more extemporary than the shanties , is grunting and poking his snout through the clefts of his habitation . The household pots and kettles are seen at the doors ; and a glance within shows the rough benches that serve for chairs , and the bed upon the floor . The visitor 's nose takes note of the fragrance of a pipe . And yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old wood do not seem to be destroyed or profaned . It overshadows these poor people , and assimilates them somehow or other to the character of its natural inhabitants . Their presence did not shock me any more than if I had merely discovered a squirrel 's nest in a tree . To be sure , it is a torment to see the great , high , ugly embankment of the railroad , which is here thrusting itself into the lake , or along its margin , in close vicinity to this picturesque little hamlet . I have seldom seen anything more beautiful than the cove on the border of which the huts are situated ; and the more I looked , the lovelier it grew . The trees overshadowed it deeply ; but on one side there was some brilliant shrubbery which seemed to light up the whole picture with the effect of a sweet and melancholy smile . I felt as if spirits were there , - or as if these shrubs had a spiritual life . In short , the impression was indefinable ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retraced my steps through the Irish hamlet , and plodded on along a wood-path . According to my invariable custom , I mistook my way ; and , emerging upon the road , I turned my back instead of my face towards Concord , and walked on very diligently till a guide-hoard informed me ot my mistake . I then turned about , and was shortly overtaken by an old yeoman in a chaise , who kindly offered me a drive , and soon set me down in the village .
