Prisoner , what is your plea , guilty or not guilty ? PRISONER .  --  Not guilty . CLERK .  --  How will you be tried ? PRISONER .  --  By God and my country . CLERK .  --  God send you a good deliverance . ATTORNEY GENERAL .  --  May it please the Court and Gentlemen of the Jury , the prisoner is charged with a variety of heinous crimes  --  with being a disturber of the public peace , a seducer , a robber , a murderer , both of the bodies and the souls of men . I shall not detain you with a long speech , but substantiate the truths of the indictment by good and true witnesses . I first call Mr. Easymind . Mr. Easymind do you know the prisoner ? Can you tell anything about him ? WITNESS .  --  I can , Sir ; for I have suffered much from him . He was often at my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when my wife was sick , he promised a cure , but made her a drunkard and I forbade him my house . ATT'Y GEN . Attorney General  --  Have you any sons ? WITNESS .  --  Yes , Sir , three ; but I have not much comfort in them , for they are constantly drawn away by the prisoner to scenes of drinking , horse-racing and gambling . ATT'Y GEN . Attorney General  --  How do they come home ? WITNESS .  --  Often drunk at the midnight hour . SQUIRE SELF-INTEREST .  --  You say he made your wife a drunkard . Do you know he did ? Remember , Sir , you are on your oath . WITNESS .  --  Why if he did n't , who did ? SQUIRE S. I. Squire Self-Interest  --  That is not answering the question . Do you know he made her a drunkard ? Can you swear she was not born one ? WITNESS .  --  I know that she was not one till she began to take his medicines . SQUIRE S. I. Squire Self-Interest  --  You say he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became acquainted with him ? WITNESS .  --  No , Sir ; never were better boys . ATT'Y GEN . Attorney General  --  Mr. Sobermind , do you know the prisoner at the bar ? WITNESS .  --  I once did , to my sorrow . He found me an industrious , hard-labouring young man . He took me to the tavern , the store , the saloon  --  I tremble to think what he did for me . He got all my money out of my pockets , and my clothes from my back . I became under his leadings a vile drunkard , and slept in barns and behind barrels ; but I quit him , Sir , and since then I have come up to be again what I was . ATT'Y GEN . Attorney General  --  What does he do with families ? WITNESS .  --  It would take me a year to tell the sorrow and trouble he gives . ATT'Y GEN . Attorney General  --  Did you ever know him to divide husband and wife ? WITNESS .  --  Yes , Sir , in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever cause a murder in your neighborhood ? WITNESS .  --  Yes , Sir , in many cases . But we could never get him indicted and tried because he had so many friends . SQUIRE S. I. Squire Self-Interest  --  You say you are now his enemy . WITNESS .  --  Yes , Sir . And if I could get him expelled from the country I would . SQUIRE S. I. Squire Self-Interest  --  May it please the Court , I object to this witness . He testifies under strong hostility , and he can not be expected to speak the truth . His testimony should not be received by the jury . ATT'Y GEN . Attorney General  --  Squire Coke , you have been at the bar many years ; what do you know of the prisoner ? WITNESS .  --  I know that , but for him we lawyers should soon starve . ATT'Y GEN . Attorney General  --  Please explain what you mean . WITNESS .  --  Mean ? I mean what I say ; for more than two-thirds of our criminal cases are caused by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SQUIRE S. I. Squire Self-Interest  --  Did he not keep you , by all the votes he cast , from being a Congressman ? Did not all the rum men go against you ? WITNESS .  --  Yes , Sir . And it was the proudest day of my life . SQUIRE S. I. Squire Self-Interest  --  Gentlemen of the Jury , you see under what influence he testifies . His testimony is good for nothing . ATT'Y GEN . Attorney General  --  Mr. Lovetruth , you have been a collector of taxes ; what has the prisoner had to do with the taxation of the town ? WITNESS .  --  He has caused more than one half of it . We have twenty-five paupers all charged to him , and a jail full , and many casualties by fire and wrecks are caused by him for which the town must pay . And since no restraint has been laid upon him , the taxes have been increased double . SQUIRE S. I. Squire Self-Interest  --  Do you suppose there would be no taxes among Cold Water men ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE DEFENCE . SQUIRE S. I. Squire Self-Interest  --  Mr. Animal Appetite , please state what you know of this gentleman . WITNESS .  --  He is the best friend I ever had , Sir . He always gives me good cheer and cures me of all my diseases . I could not live without him . ATT'Y GEN . Attorney General  --  Did he never kill any body ? WITNESS .  --  That is no concern of mine , Sir . Roast beef and plum pudding will kill men if they eat too much . SQUIRE S. I. Squire Self-Interest  --  I would call , may it please the Court , upon Mr. Lovegain . What is the influence of this gentleman upon the trade of the country ? WITNESS .  --  Oh , it has increased it mightily , Sir . We have made more money by this gentleman , than by any cotton speculation or anything else . His liquor draws out more money than all the cotton and tobacco together . ATT'Y GEN . Attorney General  --  And what does he give for the money he gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , Sir . ATT'Y GEN . Attorney General  --  Is he not then a thief and a robber ? May it please the Court , you have heard all the witnesses for the defence , and they amount to nothing . I shall now , without argument , submit the case . CHIEF JUSTICE CANDOR charges the Jury  --  Gentlemen of the Jury : You have heard the Indictment and the witnesses for and against him . You will render a verdict according to your consciences . I commit the fate of the prisoner to you . When the Jury came in the Clerk said  --  Foreman , what is your verdict  --  guilty or not guilty ? FOREMAN .  --  Guilty ? SENTENCE OF THE COURT . JUDGE  --  Mr. Prisoner , stand up . You are pronounced guilty of the enormous charges which have been brought against you , and you will be taken hence from the place whence you came , in rum puncheons , and there be cast into a vat of Cold Water . And may you die and be forgotten forever .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
