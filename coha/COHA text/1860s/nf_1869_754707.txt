APPEAL TO AMERICAN WOMEN . GLOSSARY OF WORDS AND REFERENCES INTRODUCTION . The authors of this volume , while they sympathize with every honest effort to relieve the disabilities and sufferings of their sex , are confident that the chief cause of these evils is the fact that the honor and duties of the family state are not duly appreciated , that women are not trained for these duties as men are trained for their trades and professions , and that , as the consequence , family labor is poorly done , poorly paid , and regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young children , a cook , or a housemaid , is regarded as the lowest and last resort of poverty , and one which no woman of culture and position can assume without loss of caste and respectability . It is the aim of this volume to elevate both the honor and the remuneration of all the employments that sustain the many difficult and sacred duties of the family state , and thus to render each department of woman 's true profession as much desired and respected as are the most honored professions of men . When the other sex are to be instructed in law , medicine , or divinity , they are favored with numerous institutions richly endowed , with teachers of the highest talents and acquirements , with extensive libraries , and abundant and costly apparatus . With such advantages they devote nearly ten of the best years of life to preparing themselves for their profession ; and to secure the public from unqualified members of these professions , none can enter them until examined by a competent body , who certify to their due preparation for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the body in the critical periods of infancy and sickness , the training of the human mind in the most impressible period of childhood , the instruction and control of servants , and most of the government and economies of the family state . These duties of woman are as sacred and important as any ordained to man ; and yet no such advantages for preparation have been accorded to her , nor is there any qualified body to certify the public that a woman is duly prepared to give proper instruction in her profession . This unfortunate want , and also the questions frequently asked concerning the domestic qualifications of both the authors of this work , who have formerly written upon such topics , make it needful to give some account of the advantages they have enjoyed in preparation for the important office assumed as teachers of woman 's domestic duties . The sister whose name is subscribed is the eldest of nine children by her own mother , and of four by her step-mother ; and having a natural love for children , she found it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of infancy and childhood . At sixteen , she was deprived of a mother , who was remarkable not only for intelligence and culture , but for a natural taste and skill in domestic handicraft . Her place was awhile filled by an aunt remarkable for her habits of neatness and order , and especially for her economy . She was , in the course of time , replaced by a stepmother , who had been accustomed to a superior style of housekeeping , and was an expert in all departments of domestic administration . Under these successive housekeepers , the writer learned not only to perform in the most approved manner all the manual employments of domestic life , but to honor and enjoy these duties . At twenty-three , she commenced the institution which ever since has flourished as " The Hartford Female Seminary , " where , at the age of twelve , the sister now united with her in the authorship of this work became her pupil , and , after a few years , her associate . The removal of the family to the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hartford Seminary , and originated a similar one in Cincinnati , of which the younger authoress of this work was associate principal till her marriage . At this time , the work on Domestic Economy , of which this volume may be called an enlarged edition , although a great portion of it is entirely new , embodying the latest results of science , was prepared by the writer as a part of the Massachusetts School Library , and has since been extensively introduced as a text-book into public schools and higher female seminaries . It was followed by its sequel , The Domestic Receipt-Book , widely circulated by the Harpers in every State of the Union . These two works have been entirely remodeled , former topics rewritten , and many new ones introduced , so as to include all that is properly embraced in a complete Encyclopedia of Domestic Economy . In addition to the opportunities mentioned , the elder sister , for many years , has been studying the causes and the remedies for the decay of constitution and loss of health so increasingly prevalent among American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which women shall be properly trained for their profession , as both housekeepers and health-keepers . What advantages have thus been received and the results thus obtained will appear in succeeding pages . During the upward progress of the age , and the advance of a more enlightened Christianity , the writers of this volume have gained more elevated views of the true mission of woman  --  of the dignity and importance of her distinctive duties , and of the true happiness which will be the reward of a right appreciation of this mission , and a proper performance of these duties . There is at the present time an increasing agitation of the public mind , evolving many theories and some crude speculations as to woman 's rights and duties . That there is a great social and moral power in her keeping , which is now seeking expression by organization , is manifest , and that resulting plans and efforts will involve some mistakes , some collisions , and some failures , all must expect . But to intelligent , reflecting , and benevolent women  --  whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  there are great principles revealed by Him , which in the end will secure the grand result which He taught and suffered to achieve . It is hoped that in the following pages these principles will be so exhibited and illustrated as to aid in securing those rights and advantages which Christ 's religion aims to provide for all , and especially for the most weak and defenseless of His children . CATHARINE E. BEECHER . Illustration CHAPTER I. THE CHRISTIAN FAMILY . It is the aim of this volume to elevate both the honor and the remuneration of all employments that sustain the many difficult and varied duties of the family state , and thus to render each department of woman 's profession as much desired and respected as are the most honored professions of men . What , then , is the end designed by the family state which Jesus Christ came into this world to secure ? It is to provide for the training of our race to the highest possible intelligence , virtue , and happiness , by means of the self-sacrificing labors of the wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future immortal existence . The distinctive feature of the family is self-sacrificing labor of the stronger and wiser members to raise the weaker and more ignorant to equal advantages . The father undergoes toil and self-denial to provide a home , and then the mother becomes a self-sacrificing laborer to train its inmates . The useless , troublesome infant is served in the humblest offices ; while both parents unite in training it to an equality with themselves in every advantage . Soon the older children become helpers to raise the younger to a level with their own . When any are sick , those who are well become self-sacrificing ministers . When the parents are old and useless , the children become their self-sacrificing servants . Thus the discipline of the family state is one of daily self-devotion of the stronger and wiser to elevate and support the weaker members . Nothing could be more contrary to its first principles than for the older and more capable children to combine to secure to themselves the highest advantages , enforcing the drudgeries on the younger , at the sacrifice of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God and consequent brotherhood of man . He came as the " first-born Son " of God and the Elder Brother of man , to teach by example the self-sacrifice by which the great family of man is to be raised to equality of advantages as children of God . For this end , he " humbled himself " from the highest to the lowest place . He chose for his birthplace the most despised village ; for his parents the lowest in rank ; for his trade , to labor with his hands as a carpenter , being " subject to his parents " thirty years . And , what is very significant , his trade was that which prepares the family home , as if he would teach that the great duty of man is labor  --  to provide for and train weak and ignorant creatures . Jesus Christ worked with his hands nearly thirty years , and preached less than three . And he taught that his kingdom is exactly opposite to that of the world , where all are striving for the highest positions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whoso will be chiefest shall be servant of all . " The family state then , is the aptest earthly illustration of the heavenly kingdom , and in it woman is its chief minister . Her great mission is self-denial , in training its members to self-sacrificing labors for the ignorant and weak : if not her own children , then the neglected children of her Father in heaven . She is to rear all under her care to lay up treasures , not on earth , but in heaven . All the pleasures of this life end here ; but those who train immortal minds are to reap the fruit of their labor through eternal ages . To man is appointed the out-door labor  --  to till the earth , dig the mines , toil in the foundries , traverse the ocean , transport merchandise , labor in manufactories , construct houses , conduct civil , municipal , and state affairs , and all the heavy work , which , most of the day , excludes him from the comforts of a home . But the great stimulus to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , is the desire for a home of his own , and the hopes of paternity . Every man who truly lives for immortality responds to the beatitude , " Children are a heritage from the Lord : blessed is the man that hath his quiver full of them ! " The more a father and mother live under the influence of that " immortality which Christ hath brought to light , " the more is the blessedness of rearing a family understood and appreciated . Every child trained aright is to dwell forever in exalted bliss with those that gave it life and trained it for heaven . The blessed privileges of the family state are not confined to those who rear children of their own . Any woman who can earn a livelihood , as every woman should be trained to do , can take a properly qualified female associate , and institute a family of her own , receiving to its heavenly influences the orphan , the sick , the homeless , and the sinful , and by motherly devotion train them to follow the self-denying example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness in this life and for his eternal home . And such is the blessedness of aiding to sustain a truly Christian home , that no one comes so near the pattern of the All-perfect One as those who might hold what men call a higher place , and yet humble themselves to the lowest in order to aid in training the young , " not as men-pleasers , but as servants to Christ , with good-will doing service as to the Lord , and not to men . " Such are preparing for high places in the kingdom of heaven . " Whosoever will be chiefest among you , let him be your servant . " It is often the case that the true humility of Christ is not understood . It was not in having a low opinion of his own character and claims , but it was in taking a low place in order to raise others to a higher . The worldling seeks to raise himself and family to an equality with others , or , if possible , a superiority to them . The true follower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The maxims and institutions of this world have ever been antagonistic to the teachings and example of Jesus Christ . Men toil for wealth , honor , and power , not as means for raising others to an equality with themselves , but mainly for earthly , selfish advantages . Although the experience of this life shows that children brought up to labor have the fairest chance for a virtuous and prosperous life , and for hope of future eternal blessedness , yet it is the aim of most parents who can do so , to lay up wealth that their children need not labor with the hands as Christ did . And although exhorted by our Lord not to lay up treasure on earth , but rather the imperishable riches which are gained in toiling to train the ignorant and reform the sinful , as yet a large portion of the professed followers of Christ , like his first disciples , are " slow of heart to believe . " Not less have the sacred ministries of the family state been undervalued and warred upon in other directions ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue , and given its highest honors to those who forsake the family state as ordained by God . Thus came great communities of monks and nuns , shut out from the love and labors of a Christian home ; thus , also , came the monkish systems of education , collecting the young in great establishments away from the watch and care of parents , and the healthful and self-sacrificing labors of a home . Thus both religion and education have conspired to degrade the family state . Still more have civil laws and social customs been opposed to the principles of Jesus Christ . It has ever been assumed that the learned , the rich , and the powerful are not to labor with the hands , as Christ did , and as Paul did when he would " not eat any man 's bread for naught , but wrought with labor , not because we have not power " to live without hand-work , " but to make ourselves an example . " ( 2 Thess. 3 . ) Instead of this , manual labor has been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor . Especially has the most important of all hand-labor , that which sustains the family , been thus disgraced ; so that to nurse young children , and provide the food of a family by labor , is deemed the lowest of all positions in honor and profit , and the last resort of poverty . And so our Lord , who himself took the form of a servant , teaches , " How hardly shall they that have riches enter the kingdom of heaven ! "  --  that kingdom in which all are toiling to raise the weak , ignorant , and sinful to such equality with themselves as the children of a loving family enjoy . One mode in which riches have led to antagonism with the true end of the family state is in the style of living , by which the hand-labor , most important to health , comfort , and beauty , is confined to the most ignorant and neglected members of society , without any effort being made to raise them to equal advantages with the wise and cultivated . And , the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel that to labor , as did Christ and Paul , is disgraceful , and to be made the portion of a degraded class . Children , of the rich grow up with the feeling that servants are to work for them , and they themselves are not to work . To the minds of most children and servants , " to be a lady , " is almost synonymous with " to be waited on , and do no work , " It is the earnest desire of the authors of this volume to make plain the falsity of this growing popular feeling , and to show how much happier and more efficient family life will become when it is strengthened , sustained , and adorned by family work . II . A CHRISTIAN HOUSE . In the Divine Word it is written , " The wise woman buildeth her house . " To be " wise , " is " to choose the best means for accomplishing the best end . " It has been shown that the best end for a woman to seek is the training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guiding them to intelligence , virtue , and true happiness . When , therefore , the wise woman seeks a home in which to exercise this ministry , she will aim to secure a house so planned that it will provide in the best manner for health , industry , and economy , those cardinal requisites of domestic enjoyment and success . To aid in this , is the object of the following drawings and descriptions , which will illustrate a style of living more conformed to the great design for which the family is instituted than that which ordinarily prevails among those classes which take the lead in forming the customs of society . The aim will be to exhibit modes of economizing labor , time , and expenses , so as to secure health , thrift , and domestic happiness to persons of limited means , in a measure rarely attained even by those who possess wealth . At the head of this chapter is a sketch of what may be properly called a Christian house ; that is , a house contrived for the express purpose of enabling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the common good , and by modes at once healthful , economical , and tasteful . Of course , much of the instruction conveyed in the following pages is chiefly applicable to the wants and habits of those living either in the country or in such suburban vicinities as give space of ground for healthful outdoor occupation in the family service , although the general principles of house-building and house-keeping are of necessity universal in their application  --  as true in the busy confines of the city as in the freer and purer quietude of the country . So far as circumstances can be made to yield the opportunity , it will be assumed that the family state demands some outdoor labor for all . The cultivation of flowers to ornament the table and house , of fruits and vegetables for food , of silk and cotton for clothing , and the care of horse , cow , and dairy , can be so divided that each and all of the family , some part of the day , can take exercise in the pure air , under the magnetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family should seek a soil and climate which will afford such opportunities . Railroads , enabling men toiling in cities to rear families in the country , are on this account a special blessing . So , also , is the opening of the South to free labor , where , in the pure and mild climate of the uplands , open-air labor can proceed most of the year , and women and children labor out of doors as well as within . In the following drawings are presented modes of economizing time , labor , and expense by the close packing of conveniences . By such methods , small and economical houses can be made to secure most of the comforts and many of the refinements of large and expensive ones . The cottage at the head of this chapter is projected on a plan which can be adapted to a warm or cold climate with little change . By adding another story , it would serve a large family . Illustration : Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 shows the ground-plan of the first floor . On the inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservatories and front and back projections . Its inside height from floor to ceiling is ten feet . The piazzas each side of the front projection have sliding-windows to the floor , and can , by glazed sashes , be made green-houses in winter . In a warm climate , piazzas can be made at the back side also . In the description and arrangement , the leading aim is to show how time , labor , and expense are saved , not only in the building but in furniture and its arrangement . With this aim , the ground-floor and its furniture will first be shown , then the second story and its furniture , and then the basement and its conveniences . The conservatories are appendages not necessary to housekeeping , but useful in many ways pointed out more at large in other chapters . Illustration : Fig. 2 The entry has arched recesses behind the front doors , ( Fig. 2 , ) furnished with hooks for over-clothes in both  --  a box for over-shoes in one , and a stand for umbrellas in the other . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or flowers . The stairs turn twice with broad steps , making a recess at the lower landing , whore a table is set with a vase of flowers , ( Fig. 3 . ) On one side of the recess is a closet , arched to correspond with the arch over the stairs . A bracket over the first broad stair , with flowers or statuettes , is visible from the entrance , and pictures can be hung as in the illustration . The large room on the left can be made to serve the purpose of several rooms by means of a movable screen . By shifting this rolling screen from one part of the room to another , two apartments are always available , of any desired size within the limits of the large room . One side of the screen fronts what may be used as the parlor or sitting-room ; the other side is arranged for bedroom conveniences . Of this , Fig. 4 shows the front side ;  --  covered first with strong canvas , stretched and nailed on . Over this is pasted panel-paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornamental cornice by fresco-paper . Pictures can be hung in the panels , or be pasted on and varnished with white varnish . To prevent the absorption of the varnish , a wash of gum isinglass ( fish-glue ) must be applied twice . Illustration : Fig. 4 . CLOSET , RECESS , STAIR LANDING . Illustration : Fig 5 . Fig. 5 shows the back or inside of the movable screen toward the part of the room used as the bedroom . On one side , and at the top and bottom , it has shelves with shelf-boxes , which are cheaper and better than drawers , and much preferred by those using them . Handles are cut in the front and back side , as seen in Fig. 6 . Half an inch space must be between the box and the shelf over it , and as much each side , so that it can be taken out and put in easily . The central part of the screen 's interior is a wardrobe . Image : Panel screens This screen must be so high as nearly to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is to fill the width of the room , except two feet on each side . A projecting cleat or strip , reaching nearly to the top of the screen , three inches wide , is to be screwed to the front sides , on which light frame doors are to be hung , covered with canvas and panel-paper like the front of the screen . The inside of these doors is furnished with hooks for clothing , for which the projection makes room . The whole screen is to be eighteen inches deep at the top and two feet deep at the base , giving a solid foundation . It is moved on four wooden rollers , one foot long and four inches in diameter . The pivots of the rollers and the parts where there is friction must be rubbed with hard soap , and then a child can move the whole easily . A curtain is to be hung across the whole interior of the screen by rings , on a strong wire . The curtain should be in three parts , with lead or large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wood-work must be put together with screws , as the screen is too large to pass through a , door . Illustration : Fig. 6 . Illustration : Fig. 7 . Illustration : Fig. 8 . At the end of the room , behind the screen , are two couches , to be run one under the other , as in Fig. 7 . The upper one is made with four posts , each three feet high and three inches square , set on casters two inches high . The frame is to be fourteen inches from the floor , seven feet long , two feet four inches wide , and three inches in thickness . At the head , and at the foot , is to be screwed a notched two-inch board , three inches wide , as in Fig. 8 . The mortises are to be one inch wide and deep , and one inch apart , to revive slats made of ash , oak , or spruce , one inch square , placed lengthwise of the couch . The slats being small , and so near together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than wire coils . If they warp , they can be turned . They must not be fastened at the ends , except by insertion in the notches . Across the posts , and of equal height with them , are to be screwed head and foot-boards . The under couch is like the upper , except these dimensions : posts , nine inches high , including castors ; frame , six feet two inches long , two feet four inches wide . The frame should be as near the floor as possible , resting on the casters . Illustration : Fig. 9 . The most healthful and comfortable mattress is made by a case , open in the centre and fastened together with buttons , as in Fig. 9 ; to be filled with oat straw , which is softer than wheat or rye . This can be adjusted to the figure , and often renewed . Fig. 10 represents the upper couch when covered , with the under couch put beneath it . The coverlid should match the curtain of the screen ; and the pillows , by day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Fig. 10 . Illustration : Fig. 11 . Fig. 11 is an ottoman , made as a box , with a lid on hinges . A cushion is fastened to this lid by strings at each corner , passing through holes in the box lid and tied inside . The cushion to be cut square , with side pieces ; stuffed with hair , and stitched through like a mattress . Side handles are made by cords fastened inside with knots . The box must be two inches larger at the bottom than at the top , and the lid and cushion the same size as the bottom , to give it a tasteful shape . This ottoman is set on casters , and is a great convenience for holding articles , while serving also as a seat . The expense of the screen , where lumber averages $4 a hundred , and carpenter labor $3 a day , would be about $30 , and the two couches about $6 . The material for covering might be cheap and yet pretty . A woman with these directions , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could thus secure much additional room , and also what amounts to two bureaus , two large trunks , one large wardrobe , and a wash-stand , for less than $20  --  the mere cost of materials . The screen and couches can be so arranged as to have one room serve first as a large and airy sleeping-room ; then , in the morning , it may be used as sitting-room one side of the screen , and breakfast-room the other ; and lastly , through the day it can be made a large parlor on the front side , and a sewing or retiring-room the other side . The needless spaces usually devoted to kitchen , entries , halls , back-stairs , pantries , store-rooms , and closets , by this method would be used in adding to the size of the large room , so variously used by day and by night . Illustration : Fig. 12 . Fig. 12 is an enlarged plan of the kitchen and stove-room . The chimney and stove-room are contrived to ventilate the whole house , by a mode exhibited in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , serve to shut out heat and smells from the kitchen . The sides of the stove-room must be lined with shelves ; those on the side by the cellar stairs , to be one foot wide , and eighteen inches apart ; on the other side , shelves may be narrower , eight inches wide and nine inches apart . Boxes with lids , to receive stove utensils , must be placed near the stove . On these shelves , and in the closet and boxes , can be placed every material used for cooking , all the table and cooking utensils , and all the articles used in house work , and yet much spare room will be left . The cook 's galley in a steamship has every article and utensil used in cooking for two hundred persons , in a space not larger than this stove-room , and so arranged that with one or two steps the cook can reach all he uses . In contrast to this , in most large houses , the table furniture , the cooking materials and utensils , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart , that half the time and strength is employed in walking back and forth to collect and return the articles used . Illustration : Fig. 13 . Fig. 13 is an enlarged plan of the sink and cooking-form . Two windows make a better circulation of air in warm weather , by having one open at top and the other at the bottom , while the light is better adjusted for working , in case of weak eyes . The flour-barrel just fills the closet , which has a door for admission , and a lid to raise when used . Beside it , is the form for cooking , with a moulding-board laid on it ; one side used for preparing vegetables and meat , and the other for moulding bread . The sink has two pumps , for well and for rain-water  --  one having a forcing power to throw water into the reservoir in the garret , which supplies the water-closet and bath-room . On the other side of the sink is the dish-drainer , with a ledge on the edge next the sink , to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drain into the sink . It has hinges , so that it can either rest on the cook-form or be turned over and cover the sink . Under the sink are shelf-boxes placed on two shelves run into grooves , with other grooves above and below , so that one may move the shelves and increase or diminish the spaces between . The shelf-boxes can be used for scouring-materials , dish-towels , and dish-cloths ; also to hold bowls for bits of butter , fats , etc . Under these two shelves is room for two pails , and a jar for soap-grease . Under the cook-form are shelves and shelf-boxes for unbolted wheat , corn-meal , rye , etc . Beneath these , for white and brown sugar , are wooden can-pails , which are the best articles in which to keep these constant necessities . Beside them is the tin molasses-can with a tight , movable cover , and a cork in the spout . This is much better than a jug for molasses , and also for vinegar and oil , being easier to clean and to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on or under the shelves at the side and front . A small cooking-tray , holding pepper , salt , dredging-box , knife and spoon , should stand close at hand by the stove , ( Fig. 14 . ) Illustration : Fig. 14 . Illustration : Fig. 15 . The articles used for setting tables are to be placed on the shelves at the front and side of the sink . Two tumbler-trays , made of pasteboard , covered with varnished fancy papers and divided by wires , ( as shown in Fig. 15 , ) save many steps in setting and clearing table . Similar trays , ( Fig. 16 , ) for knives and forks and spoons , serve the same purpose . Illustration : Fig. 16 . The sink should be three feet long and three inches deep , its width matching the cook-form . Illustration : Fig. 18 . Fig. 17 is the second or attic story . The main objection to attic rooms is their warmth in summer , owing to the heated roof . This is prevented by so enlarging the closets each side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus excluding all the roof . In the bed-chambers , corner dressing-tables , as Fig. 18 , instead of projecting bureaus , save much space for use , and give a handsome form and finish to the room . In the bath-room must be the opening to the garret , and a step-ladder to reach it . A reservoir in the garret , supplied by a forcing-pump in the cellar or at the sink , must be well supported by timbers , and the plumbing must be well done , or much annoyance will ensue . The large chambers are to be lighted by large windows or glazed sliding-doors , opening upon the balcony . A roof can be put over the balcony and its sides inclosed by windows , and the chamber extend into it , and be thus much enlarged . The water-closets must have the latest improvements for safe discharge , and there will be no trouble . They cost no more than an out-door building , and save from the most disagreeable house-labor . A great improvement , called earth-closets , will probably take the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water is the more convenient . A description of the earth-closet will be given in another chapter relating to tenement-houses for the poor in large cities . The method of ventilating all the chambers , and also the cellar , will be described in another chapter . Illustration : Fig. 19 . Fig. 19 represents a shoe-bag , that can be fastened to the side of a closet or closet-door . Illustration : Fig. 20 . Fig. 20 represents a piece-bag , and is a very great labor and space-saving invention . It is made of calico , and fastened to the side of a closet or a door , to hold all the bundles that are usually stowed in trunks and drawers . India-rubber or elastic tape drawn into hems to hold the contents of the bag is better than tape-strings . Each bag should be labeled with the name of its contents , written with indelible ink on white tape sewed on to the bag . Such systematic arrangement saves much time and annoyance . Drawers or trunks to hold these articles can not be kept so easily in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this contrivance . Illustration : Fig. 21 . Floor plan Fig. 21 is the basement . It has the floor and sides plastered , and is lighted with glazed doors . A form is raised close by the cellar stairs , for baskets , pails , and tubs . Here , also , the refrigerator can be placed , or , what is better , an ice-closet can be made , as designated in the illustration . The floor of the basement must be an inclined plane toward a drain , and be plastered with water-lime . The wash-tubs have plugs in the bottom to let off water , and cocks and pipes over them bringing cold water from the reservoir in the garret and hot water from the laundry stove . This saves much heavy labor of emptying tubs and carrying water . The laundry closet has a stove for heating irons , and also a kettle on top for heating water . Slides or clothes-frames are made to draw out to receive wet clothes , and then run into the closet to dry . This saves health as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white as when dried outdoors . The wood-work of the house , for doors , windows , etc. , should be oiled chestnut , butternut , white-wood , and pine . This is cheaper , handsomer , and more easy to keep clean than painted wood . In Fig. 21 are planned two conservatories , and few understand their value in the training of the young . They provide soil , in which children , through the winter months , can be starting seeds and plants for their gardens find raising valuable , tender plants . Every child should cultivate flowers and fruits to sell and to give away , and thus be taught to learn the value of money and to practice both economy and benevolence . According to the calculation of a house-carpenter , in a place where the average price of lumber is $4 a hundred , and carpenter work $3 a day , such a house can be built for $1600 . For those practicing the closest economy , two small families could occupy it , by dividing the kitchen , and yet have room enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be left till increase of family and means require enlargement . A strong horse and carryall , with a cow , garden , vineyard , and orchard , on a few acres , would secure all the substantial comforts found in great establishments , without the trouble of ill-qualified servants . And if the parents and children were united in the daily labors of the house , garden , and fruit culture ; such thrift , health , and happiness would be secured as is but rarely found among the rich . Let us suppose a colony of cultivated and Christian people , having abundant wealth , who now are living as the wealthy usually do , emigrating to some of the beautiful Southern uplands , where are rocks , hills , valleys , and mountains as picturesque as those of New England , where the thermometer but rarely reaches 90 degrees in summer , and in winter as rarely sinks below freezing-point , so that outdoor labor goes on all the year , where the fertile soil is easily worked , where rich tropical fruits and flowers abound , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , where the produce of vineyards and orchards finds steady markets by railroads ready made ; suppose such a colony , with a central church and school-room , library , hall for sports , and a common laundry , ( taking the most trying part of domestic labor from each house , )  --  suppose each family to train the children to labor with the hands as a healthful and honorable duty ; suppose all this , which is perfectly practicable , would not the enjoyment of this life be increased , and also abundant treasures be laid up in heaven , by using the wealth thus economized in diffusing similar enjoyments and culture among the poor , ignorant , and neglected ones in desolated sections where many now are perishing for want of such Christian example and influences ? III . A HEALTHFUL HOME . When " the wise woman buildeth her house , " the first consideration will be the health of the inmates . The first and most indispensable requisite for health is pure air , both by day and night . If the parents of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food needful to growth and health , and every night should administer to each a small dose of poison , it would be called murder of the most hideous character . But it is probable that more than one half of this nation are doing that very thing . The murderous operation is perpetrated daily and nightly , in our parlors , our bed-rooms , our kitchens , our schoolrooms ; and even our churches are no asylum from the barbarity . Nor can we escape by our railroads , for even there the same dreadful work is going on . The only palliating circumstance is the ignorance of those who commit these wholesale murders . As saith the Scripture , " The people do perish for lack of knowledge . " And it is this lack of knowledge which it is woman 's special business to supply , in first training her household to intelligence as the indispensable road to virtue and happiness . The above statements will be illustrated by some account of the manner in which the body is supplied with healthful nutriment . There are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other by air . In the stomach the food is dissolved , and the nutritious portion is absorbed by the blood , and then is earned by blood-vessels to the lungs , where it receives oxygen from the air we breathe . This oxygen is as necessary to the nourishment of the body as the food for the stomach . In a full-grown man weighing one hundred and fifty-four pounds , one hundred and eleven pounds consists of oxygen , obtained chiefly from the air we breathe . Thus the lungs feed the body with oxygen , as really as the stomach supplies the other food required . The lungs occupy the upper portion of the body from the collar-bone to the lower ribs , and between their two lobes is placed the heart . Illustration : Fig. 22 . Illustration : Fig. 23 . Illustration : Fig. 24 . Illustration : Fig. 25 . Illustration : Fig. 26 . Fig. 22 shows the position of the lungs , though not the exact shape . On the right hand is the exterior of one of the lobes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interior , through which the air we breathe passes to the exceedingly minute air-cells of which the lungs chiefly consist . Fig. 23 shows the outside of a cluster of these air-cells , and Fig. 24 is the inside view . The lining membrane of each air-cell is covered by a network of minute blood-vessels called capillaries which , magnified several hundred times , appear in the microscope as at Fig. 25 . Every air-cell has a blood-vessel that brings blood from the heart , which meanders through its capillaries till it reaches another blood-vessel that carries it back to the heart , as seen in Fig. 26 . In this passage of the blood through these capillaries , the air in the air-cell imparts its oxygen to the blood , and receives in exchange carbonic acid and watery vapor . These latter are expired at every breath into the atmosphere . By calculating the number of air cells in a small portion of the lungs , under a microscope , it is ascertained that there are no less than eighteen million of these wonderful little purifiers and feeders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person receives , each day , thirty-three hogsheads of air into the lungs to nourish and vitalize every part of the body , and also to carry off its impurities . But the heart has a most important agency in this operation . Fig. 27 is a diagram of the heart , which is placed between the two lobes of the lungs . The right side of the heart receives the dark and impure blood , which is loaded with carbonic acid . It is brought from every point of the body by branching veins that unite in the upper and the lower vena cava , which discharge into the right side of the heart . This impure blood passes to the capillaries of the air-cells in the lungs , where it gives off carbonic acid , and , taking oxygen from the air , then returns to the left side of the heart , from whence it is sent out through the aorta and its myriad branching arteries to every part of the body . When the upper portion of the heart contracts , it forces both the pure blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , through the valves marked V , V , into the lower part . When the lower portion contracts , it closes the valves and forces the impure blood into the lungs on one side , and also on the other side forces the purified blood through the aorta and arteries to all parts of the body . As before stated , the lungs consist chiefly of air-cells , the walls of which are lined with minute blood-vessels ; and we know that in every man these air-cells number eighteen millions . Now every beat of the heart sends two ounces of blood into the minute , hair-like blood-vessels , called capillaries , that line these air-cells , where the air in the air-cells gives its oxygen to the blood , and in its place receives carbonic acid . This gas is then expired by the lungs into the surrounding atmosphere . Thus , by this powerful little organ , the heart , no less than twenty-eight pounds of blood , in a common-sized man , is sent three times every hour through the lungs , giving out carbonic acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether all this blood shall convey the nourishing and invigorating oxygen to every part of the body , or return unrelieved of carbonic acid , depends entirely on the pureness of the atmosphere that is breathed . Every time we think or feel , this mental action dissolves some particles of the brain and nerves , which pass into the blood to be thrown out of the body through the lungs and skin . In like manner , whenever we move any muscle , some of its particles decay and pass away . It is in the capillaries , which are all over the body , that this change takes place . The blood-vessels that convey the pure blood from the heart , divide into myriads of little branches that terminate in capillary vessels like those lining the air-cells of the lungs . The blood meanders through these minute capillaries , depositing the oxygen taken from the lungs and the food of the stomach , and receiving in return the decayed matter , which is chiefly carbonic acid . This carbonic acid is formed by the union of oxygen with carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . Watery vapor is also formed in the capillaries by the union of oxygen with the hydrogen contained in the food and drink that nourish the body . During this process in the capillaries , the bright red blood of the arteries changes to the purple blood of the veins , which is carried back to the heart , to be sent to the lungs as before described . A portion of the oxygen received in the lungs unites with the dissolved food sent from the stomach into the blood , and no food can nourish the body till it has received a proper supply of oxygen in the lungs . At every breath a half-pint of blood receives its needed oxygen in the lungs , and at the same time gives out an equal amount of carbonic acid and water . Now , this carbonic acid , if received into the lungs , undiluted by sufficient air , is a fatal poison , causing certain death . When it is mixed with only a small portion of air , it is a slow poison , which imperceptibly undermines the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all who live in houses where the breathing of inmates has deprived the air of oxygen , and loaded it with carbonic acid , may truly be said to be poisoned and starved ; poisoned with carbonic acid , and starved for want of oxygen . Whenever oxygen unites with carbon to form carbonic acid , or with hydrogen to form water , heat is generated Thus it is that a land of combustion is constantly going on in the capillaries all over the body . It is this burning of the decaying portions of the body that causes animal heat . It is a process similar to that which takes place when lamps and candles are burning . The oil and tallows which are chiefly carbon and hydrogen , unite with the oxygen of the air and form carbonic acid and watery vapor , producing heat during the process . So in the capillaries all over the body , the carbon and hydrogen supplied to the blood by the stomach , unite with the oxygen gained in the lungs , and cause the heat which is diffused all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that of the lungs . In the skin of every adult there are no less than seven million minute perspirating tubes , each one fourth of an inch long . If all these were united in one length , they would extend twenty-eight miles . These minute tubes are lined with capillary blood-vessels , which are constantly sending out not only carbonic acid , but other gases and particles of decayed matter . The skin and lungs together , in one day and night , throw out three quarters of a pound of charcoal as carbonic acid , beside other gases and water . While the bodies of men and animals are filling the air with the poisonous carbonic acid , and using up the life-giving oxygen , the trees and plants are performing an exactly contrary process ; for they are absorbing carbonic acid and giving out oxygen . Thus , by a wonderful arrangement of the beneficent Creator , a constant equilibrium is preserved . What animals use is provided by vegetables , and what vegetables require is furnished by animals ; and all goes on , day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The human race in its infancy was placed in a mild and genial clime , where each separate family dwelt in tents , and breathed , both day and night , the pure air of heaven . And when they became scattered abroad to colder climes , the open fire-place secured a full supply of pure air . But civilization has increased economies and conveniences far ahead of the knowledge needed by the common people for their healthful use . Tight sleeping-rooms , and close , air-tight stoves , are now starving and poisoning more than one half of this nation . It seems impossible to make people know their danger . And the remedy for this is the light of knowledge and intelligence which it is woman 's special mission to bestow , as she controls and regulates the ministries of a home . The poisoning process is thus exhibited in Mrs. Stowe 's " House and Home Papers , " and can not be recalled too often : " No other gift of God , so precious , so inspiring , is treated with such utter irreverence and contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heaven . A sermon on oxygen , if we had a preacher who understood the subject , might do more to repress sin than the most orthodox discourse to show when and how and why sin came . A minister gets up in a crowded lecture-room , where the mephitic air almost makes the candles burn blue , and bewails the deadness of the church  --  the church the while , drugged by the poisoned air , growing sleepier and sleepier , though they feel dreadfully wicked for being so . " Little Jim , who , fresh from his afternoon 's ramble in the fields , last evening said his prayers dutifully , and lay down to sleep in a most Christian frame , this morning sits up in bed with his hair bristling with crossness , strikes at his nurse , and declares he wo n't say his prayers  --  that he do n't want to be good . The simple difference is , that the child , having slept in a close box of a room , his brain all night fed by poison , is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it takes them till eleven or twelve o'clock to get up their strength in the morning . Query , Do they sleep with closed windows and doors , and with heavy bed-curtains ? " The houses built by our ancestors were better ventilated in certain respects than modern ones , with all their improvements . The great central chimney , with its open fire-places in the different rooms , created a constant current which carried off foul and vitiated air . In these days , how common is it to provide rooms with only a flue for a stove ! This flue is kept shut in summer , and in winter opened only to admit a close stove , which burns away the vital portion of the air quite as fast as the occupants breathe it away . The sealing up of fire-places and introduction of air-tight stoves may , doubtless , be a saving of fuel ; it saves , too , more than that ; in thousands and thousands of cases it has saved people from all further human wants , and put an end forever to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are man 's only inalienable property . In other words , since the invention of air-tight stoves , thousands have died of slow poison . " It is a terrible thing to reflect upon , that our northern winters last from November to May , six long months , in which many families confine themselves to one room , of which every window-crack has been carefully calked to make it air-tight , where an air-tight stove keeps the atmosphere at a temperature between eighty and ninety ; and the inmates , sitting there with all their winter clothes on , become enervated both by the heat and by the poisoned air , for which there is no escape but the occasional opening of a door . " It is no wonder that the first result of all this is such a delicacy of skin and lungs that about half the inmates are obliged to give up going into the open air during the six cold months , because they invariably catch cold if they do so . It is no wonder that the cold caught about the first of December has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the opening of the spring , which ought to bring life and health , in so many cases brings death . " We hear of the lean condition in which the poor bears emerge from their six months ' wintering , during which they subsist on the fat which they have acquired the previous summer . Even so , in our long winters , multitudes of delicate people subsist on the daily waning strength which they acquired in the season when windows and doors were open , and fresh air was a constant luxury . No wonder we hear of spring fever and spring biliousness , and have thousands of nostrums for clearing the blood in the spring . All these things are the pantings and palpitations of a system run down under slow poison , unable to get a step further . " Better , far better , the old houses of the olden time , with their great roaring fires , and their bed-rooms where the snow came in and the wintry winds whistled . Then , to be sure , you froze your back while you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitcher , your breath congealed in ice-wreaths on the blankets , and you could write your name on the pretty snow-wreath that had sifted in through the window-cracks . But you woke full of life and vigor , you looked out into the whirling snow-storms without a shiver , and thought nothing of plunging through drifts as high as your head on your daily way to school . You jingled in sleighs , you snow-balled , you lived in snow like a snow-bird , and your blood coursed and tingled , in full tide of good , merry , real life , through your veins  --  none of the slow-creeping , black blood which clogs the brain and lies like a weight on the vital wheels ! " To illustrate the effects of this poison , the horrors of " the Black Hole of Calcutta " are often referred to , where one hundred and forty-six men were crowded into a room only eighteen feet square with but two small windows , and in a hot climate . After a night of such horrible torments as chill the blood to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-three dead men and twenty-three half dead that were finally recovered only to a life of weakness and suffering . In another case , a captain of the steamer Londonderry , in 1848 , from sheer ignorance of the consequences , in a storm , shut up his passengers in a tight room without windows . The agonies , groans , curses , and shrieks that followed were horrible . The struggling mass finally burst the door , and the captain found seventy-two of the two hundred already dead ; while others , with blood starting from their eyes and ears , and their bodies in convulsions , were restored , many only to a life of sickness and debility . It is ascertained by experiments that breathing bad air tends so to reduce all the processes of the body , that less oxygen is demanded and less carbonic acid sent out . This , of course , lessens the vitality and weakens the constitution ; and it accounts for the fact that a person of full health , accustomed to pure air , suffers from bad air far more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong and healthy persons demands more oxygen , and throws off more carbonic acid , and is distressed when the supply fails . But the one reduced by bad air feels little inconvenience , because all the functions of life are so slow that less oxygen is needed , and less carbonic acid thrown out . And the sensibilities being deadened , the evil is not felt . This provision of nature prolongs many lives , though it turns vigorous constitutions into feeble ones . Were it not for this change in the constitution , thousands in badly ventilated rooms and houses would come to a speedy death . One of the results of unventilated rooms is scrofula , A distinguished French physician , M. Baudeloque , states that : " The repeated respiration of the same atmosphere is the cause of scrofula . If there be entirely pure air , there may be bad food , bad clothing , and want of personal cleanliness , but scrofulous disease can not exist . This disease never attacks persons who pass their lives in the open air , and always manifests itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be found that a truly scrofulous disease is caused by vitiated air ; and it is not necessary that there should be a prolonged stay in such an atmosphere . Often , several hours each day is sufficient . Thus persons may live in the most healthy country , pass most of the day in the open air , and yet become scrofulous by sleeping in a close room where the air is not renewed . This is the case with many shepherds who pass their nights in small huts with no opening but a door closed tight at night . " The same writer illustrates this , by the history of a French village where the inhabitants all slept in close , unventilated houses . Nearly all were seized with scrofula , and many families became wholly extinct , their last members dying " rotten with scrofula . " A fire destroyed a large part of this village . Houses were then built to secure pure air , and scrofula disappeared from the part thus rebuilt . We are informed by medical writers that defective ventilation is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases of the eyes , ears , and skin . Foul air is the leading cause of tubercular and scrofulous consumption , so very common in our country . Dr , Guy , in his examination before public health commissioners in Great Britain , says : " Deficient ventilation I believe to be more fatal than all other causes put together . " He states that consumption is twice as common among tradesmen as among the gentry , owing to the bad ventilation of their stores and dwellings . Dr. Griscom , in his work on Uses and Abuses of Air , says : " Food carried from the stomach to the blood can not become nutritive till it is properly oxygenated in the lungs ; so that a small quantity of food , even if less wholesome , may be made nutritive by pure air as it passes through the lungs . But the best of food can not be changed into nutritive blood till it is vitalized by pure air in the lungs . " And again : " To those who have the care and instruction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  this subject of ventilation commends itself with an interest surpassing every other . Nothing can more convincingly establish the belief in the existence of something vitally wrong in the habits and circumstances of civilized life than the appalling fact that one fourth of all who are born die before reaching the fifth year , and one half the deaths of mankind occur under the twentieth year . Let those who have these things in charge answer to their own consciences how they discharge their duty in supplying to the young a pure atmosphere , which is the first requisite for healthy bodies and sound minds . " On the subject of infant mortality the experience of savages should teach the more civilized . Professor Brewer , who traveled extensively among the Indians of our western territories , states : " I have rarely seen a sick boy among the Indians . " Catlin , the painter , who resided and traveled so much among these people , states that infant mortality is very small among them , the reason , of course , being abundant exercise and pure air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health are well known , in his very useful work , Weak Lungs and How to Make them Strong , says : " As a medical man I have visited thousands of sickrooms , and have not found in one in a hundred of them a pure atmosphere . I have often returned from church doubting whether I had not committed a sin in exposing myself so long to its poisonous air . There are in our great cities churches costing $50,000 , in the construction of which , not fifty cents were expended in providing means for ventilation . Ten thousand dollars for ornament , but not ten cents for pure air ! " Unventilated parlors , with gas-burners , ( each consuming as much oxygen as several men , ) made as tight as possible , and a party of ladies and gentlemen spending half the night in them ! In 1861 , I visited a legislative hall , the legislature being in session . I remained half an hour in the most impure air I ever breathed . Our school-houses are , some of them , so vile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my son remain in utter ignorance of books rather than to breathe , six hours every day , such a poisonous atmosphere . Theatres and concert-rooms are so foul that only reckless people continue to visit them . Twelve hours in a railway-car exhausts one , not by the journeying , but because of the devitalized air . While crossing the ocean in a Cunard steamer , I was amazed that men who knew enough to construct such ships did not know enough to furnish air to the passengers . The distress of sea-sickness is greatly intensified by the sickening air of the ship . Were carbonic acid only black , what a contrast there would be between our hotels in their elaborate ornament ! " " Some time since I visited an establishment where one hundred and fifty girls , in a single room , were engaged in needle-work . Pale-faced , and with low vitality and feeble circulation , they were unconscious that they were breathing air that at once produced in me dizziness and a sense of suffocation . If I had remained a week with , them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscious of the vileness of the air ! " There is a prevailing prejudice against night air as unhealthful to be admitted into sleeping-rooms , which is owing wholly to sheer ignorance . In the night every body necessarily breathes night air and no other . When admitted from without into a sleeping-room it is colder , and therefore heavier , than the air within , so it sinks to the bottom of the room and forces out an equal quantity of the impure air , warmed and vitiated by passing through the lungs of inmates . Thus the question is , Shall we shut up a chamber and breathe night air vitiated with carbonic acid or night air that is pure ? The only real difficulty about night air is , that usually it is damper , and therefore colder and more likely to chill . This is easily prevented by sufficient bed-clothing . One other very prevalent mistake is found even in books written by learned men . It is often thought that carbonic acid , being heavier than common air , sinks to the floor of sleeping-rooms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . This is all a mistake ; for , as a fact , in close sleeping-rooms the purest air is below and the most impure above . It is true that carbonic acid is heavier than common air , when pure ; but this it rarely is except in chemical experiments . It is the property of all gases , as well as of the two ( oxygen and nitrogen ) composing the atmosphere , that when brought together they always are entirely mixed , each being equally diffused exactly as it would be if alone . Thus the carbonic acid from the skin and lungs , being warmed in the body , rises as does the common air , with which it mixes , toward the top of a room ; so that usually there is more carbonic acid at the top than at the bottom of a room . Footnote : Prof. Brewer , of the Tale Scientific School , says : " As a fact , often demonstrated by analysis , there is generally more carbonic acid near the ceiling than near the floor . " Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same proportions ; that is , for every degree of added heat they expand at the rate of 1/480 of their bulk . Here , let it be remembered , that in ill-ventilated rooms the carbonic acid is not the only cause of disease . Experiments seem to prove that other matter thrown out of the body , through the lungs and skin , is as truly excrement and in a state of decay as that ejected from the bowels , and as poisonous to the animal system . Carbonic acid has no odor ; but we are warned by the disagreeable effluvia of close sleeping-rooms of the other poison thus thrown into the air from the skin and lungs . There is one provision of nature that is little understood , which saves the lives of thousands living in unventilated houses ; and that is , the passage of pure air inward and impure air outward through the pores of bricks , wood , stone , and mortar . Were such dwellings changed to tin , which is not thus porous , in less than a week thousands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffocation . These statements give some idea of the evils to be remedied . But the most difficult point is how to secure the remedy . For often the attempt to secure pure air by one class of persons brings chills , colds , and disease on another class , from mere ignorance or mismanagement . To illustrate this , it must be borne in mind that those who live in warm , close , and unventilated rooms are much more liable to take cold from exposure to draughts and cold air than those of vigorous vitality accustomed to breathe pure air . Thus the strong and healthy husband , feeling the want of pure air in the night , and knowing its importance , keeps windows open and makes such draughts that the wife , who lives all day in a close room and thus is low in vitality , can not bear the change , has colds , and sometimes perishes a victim to wrong modes of ventilation . So , even in health-establishments , the patients will pass most of their days and nights in badly-ventilated rooms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insists on a mode of ventilation that brings more evil than good to the delicate inmates . The grand art of ventilating houses is by some method that will empty rooms of the vitiated air and bring in a supply of pure air by small and imperceptible currents . But this important duty of a Christian woman is one that demands more science , care , and attention than almost any other ; and yet , to prepare her for this duty has never been any part of female education . Young women are taught to draw mathematical diagrams and to solve astronomical problems ; but few , if any , of them are taught to solve the problem of a house constructed to secure pure and moist air by day and night for all its inmates . The heating and management of the air we breathe is one of the most complicated problems of domestic economy , as will be farther illustrated in the succeeding chapter ; and yet it is one of which , most American women are profoundly ignorant . IV . SCIENTIFIC DOMESTIC VENTILATION . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air is rendered unhealthful by close rooms and want of ventilation . Every person inspires air about twenty times each minute , using half a pint each time . At this rate , every pair of lungs vitiates one hogshead of air every hour . The membrane that lines the multitudinous air-cells of the lungs in which the capillaries are , should it be united in one sheet , would cover the floor of a room twelve feet square . Every breath brings a surface of air in contact with this extent of capillaries , by which the air inspired gives up most of its oxygen and receives carbonic acid in its stead . These facts furnish a guide for the proper ventilation of rooms . Just in proportion to the number of persons in a room or a house , should be the amount of air brought in and carried out by arrangements for ventilation . But how rarely is this rule regarded in building houses or in the care of families by housekeepers ! The evils resulting from the substitution of stoves instead of the open fireplace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of supplying pure air to both public and private houses . But as yet little has been accomplished , except for a few of the more intelligent and wealthy . The great majority of the American people , owing to sheer ignorance , are , for want of pure air , being poisoned and starved ; the result being weakened constitutions , frequent disease , and shortened life . Whenever a family-room is heated by an open fire , it is duly ventilated , as the impure air is constantly passing off through the chimney , while , to supply the vacated space , the pure air presses in through the cracks of doors , windows , and floors . No such supply is gained for rooms warmed by stoves . And yet , from mistaken motives of economy , as well as from ignorance of the resulting evils , multitudes of householders are thus destroying health and shortening life , especially in regard to women and children who spend most of their time within-doors . The most successful modes of making " a healthful home " by a full supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described and illustrated . It is the common property of both air and water to expand , become lighter and rise , just in proportion as they are heated ; and therefore it is the invariable law that cool air sinks , thus replacing the warmer air below . Thus , whenever cool air enters a warm room , it sinks downward and takes the place of an equal amount of the warmer air , which is constantly tending upward and outward . This principle of all fluids is illustrated by the following experiment : Take a glass jar about a foot high and three inches in diameter , and with a wire to aid in placing it aright , sink a small bit of lighted candle so as to stand in the centre at the bottom . ( Fig. 28 . ) The candle will heat the air of the jar , which will rise a little on one side , while the colder air without will begin falling on the other side . These two currents will so conflict as finally to cease , and then the candle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to go out . Insert a bit of stiff paper so as to divide the mouth of the jar , and instantly the cold and warm air are not in conflict as before , because a current is formed each side of the paper ; the cold air descending on one aide and the warm air ascending the other side , as indicated by the arrows . As long as the paper remains , the candle will burn , and as soon as it is removed , it will begin to go out , and can be restored by again inserting the paper . Illustration : Fig. 28 Illustration : Fig. 29 This illustrates the mode by which coal-mines are ventilated when filled with carbonic acid . A shaft divided into two passages , ( Fig. 29 , ) is let down into the mine , where the air is warmer than the outside air . Immediately the colder air outside presses down into the mine , through the passage which is highest , being admitted by the escape of an equal quantity of the warmer air , which rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first available opening for it to rise through . A current is thus created , which continues as long as the inside air is warmer than that without the mine , and no longer . Sometimes a fire is kindled in the mine , in order to continue or increase the warmth , and consequent upward current of its air . This illustrates one of the cases where a " wise woman that buildeth her house " is greatly needed . For , owing to the ignorance of architects , house-builders , and men in general , they have been building school-houses , dwelling-houses , churches , and colleges , with the most absurd and senseless contrivances for ventilation , and all from not applying this simple principle of science . On this point , Prof. Brewer , of the Scientific School of Yale College , writes thus : " I have been in public buildings , ( I have one in mind now , filled with dormitories , ) which cost half a million , where they attempted to ventilate every room by a flue , long and narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capacious garret of the fifth story . Every room in the building had one such flue , with an opening into it at the floor and at the ceiling . It is needless to say that the whole concern was entirely useless . Had these flues been of proper proportions , and properly divided , the desired ventilation would have been secured . " And this piece of ignorant folly was perpetrated in the midst of learned professors , teaching the laws of fluids and the laws of health . A learned physician also thus wrote to the author of this chapter : " The subject of the ventilation of our dwelling-houses is one of the most important questions of our times . How many thousands are victims to a slow suicide and murder , the chief instrument of which is want of ventilation ! How few are aware of the fact that every person , every day , vitiates thirty-three hogsheads of the air , and that each inspiration takes one fifth of the oxygen , and returns as much carbonic acid , from every pair of lungs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received ten per cent of this fatal gas , if drawn into the lungs , it can no longer take carbonic acid from the capillaries ! No wonder there is so much impaired nervous and muscular energy , so much scrofula , tubercles , catarrhs , dyspepsia , and typhoid diseases . I hope you can do much to remedy the poisonous air of thousands and thousands of stove-heated rooms . " In a cold climate and wintry weather , the grand impediment to ventilating rooms by opening doors or windows is the dangerous currents thus produced , which are so injurious to the delicate ones that for their sake it can not be done . Then , also , as a matter of economy , the poor can not afford to practice a method which carries off the heat generated by their stinted store of fuel . Even in a warm season and climate , there are frequent periods when the air without is damp and chilly , and yet at nearly the same temperature as that in the house . At such times , the opening of windows often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ventilating-flues , such as are used in mines , have , in such cases , but little influence ; for it is only when outside air is colder that a current can be produced within by this method . The most successful mode of ventilating a house is by creating a current of warm air in a flue , into which an opening is made at both the top and the bottom of a room , while a similar opening for outside air is made at the opposite side of the room . This is the mode employed in chemical laboratories for removing smells and injurious gases . The laboratory-closet is closed with glazed doors , and has an opening to receive pure air through a conductor from without . The stove or furnace within has a pipe which joins a larger cast-iron chimney-pipe , which is warmed by the smoke it receives from this and other fires . This cast-iron pipe is surrounded by a brick flue , through which air passes from below to be warmed by the pipe , and thus an upward current of warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top and bottom of the laboratory-closet into the warm-air flue , and the gases and smells are pressed by the colder air into this flue , and are carried off in the current of warm air . The same method is employed in the dwelling-house shown in a preceding chapter . A cast-iron pipe is made in sections , which are to be united , and the whole fastened at top and bottom in the centre of the warm-air flue by ears extending to the bricks , and fastened when the flue is in process of building . Projecting openings to receive the pipes of the furnace , the laundry stove , and two stoves in each story , should be provided , which must be closed when not in use . A large opening is to be made into the warm-air fine , and through this the kitchen stove-pipe is to pass , and be joined to the cast-iron chimney-pipe . Thus the smoke of the kitchen stove will warm the iron chimney-pipe , and this will warm the air of the flue , causing a current upward , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the kitchen into the opening of the warm-air flue . Every room surrounding the chimney has an opening at the top and bottom into the warm-air Hue for ventilation , as also have the bathroom and water-closets . Illustration : Fig. 30 . The writer has examined the methods most employed at the present time , which are all modifications of the two modes here described . One is that of Robinson , patented by a Boston company , which is a modification of the mining mode . It consists of the two ventilating tubes , such as are employed in mines , united in one shaft with a roof to keep out rain , and a valve to regulate the entrance and exit of air , as illustrated in Fig. 30 . This method works well in certain circumstances , but fails so often as to prove very unreliable . Another mode is that of Ruttan , which is effected by heating air . This also has certain advantages and disadvantages . But the mode adopted for the preceding cottage plan is free from the difficulties of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room in the house , both by day and night , and at all seasons , without any risk to health , and requiring no attention or care from the family . By means of a very small amount of fuel in the kitchen stove , to be described hereafter , the whole house can be ventilated , and all the cooking done both in warm and cold weather . This stove will also warm the whole house , in the Northern States , eight or nine months in the year . Two Franklin stoves , in addition , will warm the whole house during the three or four remaining coldest months . In a warm climate or season , by means of the non-conducting castings , the stove will ventilate the house and do all the cooking , without imparting heat or smells to any part of the house except the stove-closet . At the close of this volume , drawings , prepared by Mr. Lewis Leeds , are given , more fully to illustrate this mode of warming and ventilation , and in so plain and simple a form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that the plan is properly executed , even with workmen so entirely ignorant on this important subject as are most house-builders , especially in the newer territories . In the same article , directions are given as to the best modes of ventilating houses that are already built without any arrangements for ventilation . V. THE CONSTRUCTION AND CARE OF STOVES , FURNACES , AND CHIMNEYS . If all American housekeepers could be taught how to select and manage the most economical and convenient apparatus for cooking and for warming a house , many millions now wasted by ignorance and neglect would be saved . Every woman should be taught the scientific principles in regard to heat , and then their application to practical purposes , for her own benefit , and also to enable her to train her children and servants in this important duty of home life on which health and comfort so much depend . The laws that regulate the generation , diffusion , and preservation of heat as yet are a sealed mystery to thousands of young women who imagine they are completing a suitable education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in future domestic life is wholly excluded . We therefore give a brief outline of some of the leading scientific principles which every housekeeper should understand and employ , in order to perform successfully one of her most important duties . Concerning the essential nature of heat , and its intimate relations with the other great natural forces , light , electricity , etc. , we shall not attempt to treat , but shall , for practical purposes , assume it to be a separate and independent force . Heat or caloric , then , has certain powers or principles . Let us consider them : First , we find Conduction , by which heat passes from one particle to another next to it ; as when one end of a poker is warmed by placing the other end in the fire . The bodies which allow this power free course are called conductors , and those which do not are named non-conductors , Metals are good conductors ; feathers , wool , and furs are poor conductors ; and water , air , and gases are non-conductors . Another principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gases are warmed . This is , literally , the process of conveying heat from one portion of a fluid body to another by currents resulting from changes of temperature . It is secured by bringing one portion of a liquid or gas into contact with a heated surface , whereby it becomes lighter and expanded in volume . In consequence , the cooler and heavier particles above pressing downward , the lighter ones rise upward , when the former , being heated , rise in their turn , and give place to others again descending from above . Thus a constant motion of currents and interchange of particles is produced until , as in a vessel of water , the whole body comes to an equal temperature . Air is heated in the same way . In case of a hot stove , the air that touches it is heated , becomes lighter , and rises , giving place to cooler and heavier particles , which , when heated , also ascend . It is owing to this process that the air of a room is warmest at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owing to this principle , also , that water and air can not be heated by fire from above . For the particles of these bodies , being non-conductors , do not impart heat to each other ; and when the warmest are at the top , they can not take the place of cooler and heavier ones below . Another principle of heat ( which it shares with light ) is Radiation , by which all things send out heat to surrounding cooler bodies . Some bodies will absorb radiated heat , others will reflect it , and others allow it to pass through them without either absorbing or reflecting Thus , black and rough substances absorb heat , ( or light , ) colored and smooth articles reflect it , while air allows it to pass through without either absorbing or reflecting . It is owing to this , that rough and black vessels boil water sooner than smooth and light-colored ones . Another principle is Reflection , by which heat radiated to a surface is turned back from it when not absorbed or allowed to pass through ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sound is thrown back from a hill , making echo ; just as rays of light are reflected from a mirror . And , as with light , the rays of heat are always reflected from a surface in an angle exactly corresponding to the direction in which it strikes that surface . Thus , if heated are comes to an object perpendicularly  --  that is , at right angles , it will be reflected back in the same line . If it strikes obliquely , it is reflected obliquely , at an angle with the surface precisely the same as the angle with which it first struck . And , of course , if it moves toward the surface and comes upon it in a line having so small an angle with it as to be almost parallel with it , the heated air is spread wide and diffused through a larger space than when the angles are greater and the width of reflection less . Illustration : Fig. 31 . Illustration : Fig. 32 . Illustration : Fig. 33 . The simplest mode of warming a house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the most wasteful method , as respects time , labor , and expense . The most convenient , economical , and labor-saving mode of employing heat is by convection , as applied in stoves and furnaces . But for want of proper care and scientific knowledge this method has proved very destructive to health . When warming and cooking were done by open fires , houses were well supplied with pure air , as is rarely the case in rooms heated by stoves . For such is the prevailing ignorance on this subject that , as long as stoves save labor and warm the air , the great majority of people , especially among the poor , will use them in ways that involve debilitated constitutions and frequent disease . The most common modes of cooking , where open fires are relinquished , are by the range and the cooking-stove . The range is inferior to the stove in these respects : it is less economical , demanding much more fuel ; it endangers the dress of the cook while standing near for various operations ; it requires more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep a fire all night , as do the best stoves ; it will not burn wood and coal equally well ; and lastly , if it warms the kitchen sufficiently in winter , it is too warm for summer . Some prefer it because the fumes of cooking can be carried off ; but stoves properly arranged accomplish this equally well . After extensive inquiry and many personal experiments , the author has found a cooking-stove constructed on true scientific principles , which unites convenience , comfort , and economy in a remarkable manner . Of this stove , drawings and descriptions will now be given , as the best mode of illustrating the practical applications of these principles to the art of cooking , and to show how much American women have suffered and how much they have been imposed upon for want of proper knowledge in this branch of their profession . And every woman can understand what follows with much less effort than young girls at high-schools give to the first problems of Geometry  --  for which they will never have any practical use , while attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite as much as the abstract reasonings of Algebra and Geometry. , Illustration : Fig. 34 . Fig. 34 represents a portion of the interior of this cooking-stove . First , notice the fire-box , which has corrugated ( literally , wrinkled ) sides , by which space is economized , so that as much heating surface is secured as if they were one third larger ; as the heat radiates from every part of the undulating surface , which is one third greater in superficial extent than if it were plane . The shape of the fire-box also secures more heat by having oblique sides  --  which radiate more effectively into the oven beneath than if they were perpendicular , as illustrated below  --  while also it is sunk into the oven , so as to radiate from three instead of from two sides , as in most other stoves , the front of whose fire-boxes with their grates are built so as to be the front of the stove itself . Illustration : Fig 35 . Model Stove Illustration : Fig 36 . Ordinary Stove The oven is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire-box . The oven-bottom is not introduced in the diagram , but it is a horizontal plate between the fire-box and what is represented as the " flue-plate , " which separates the oven from the bottom of the stove . The top of the oven is the horizontal corrugated plate passing from the rear edge of the fire-box to the back flues . These are three in number  --  the back centre-flue , which is closed to the heat and smoke coming over the oven from the fire-box by a damper  --  and the two back corner-flues . Down these two corner-flues passes the current of hot air and smoke , having first drawn across the corrugated oven-top . The arrows show its descent through these flues , from which it obliquely strikes and passes over the flue-plate , then under it , and then out through the centre back-flue , which is open at the bottom , up into the smoke-pipe . The flue-plate is placed obliquely , to accumulate heat by forcing and compression ; for the back space where the smoke enters from the corner-flues is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot current is compressed in a narrow space , between the oven-bottom and the flue-plate at the place where the bent arrows are seen . Here again it enters a wider space , under the flue-plate , and proceeds to another narrow one , between the flue-plate and the bottom of the stove , and thus is compressed and retained longer than if not impeded by these various contrivances . The heat and smoke also strike the plate obliquely , and thus , by reflection from its surface , impart more heat than if the passage was a horizontal one . The external radiation is regulated by the use of nonconducting plaster applied to the flue-plate and to the sides of the corner-flues , so that the heat is prevented from radiating in any direction except toward the oven . The doors , sides , and bottom of the stove are lined with tin casings , which hold a stratum of air , also a non-conductor . These are so arranged as to be removed whenever the weather becomes cold , so that the heat may then radiate into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarly protected from loss of heat by tin casings and air-spaces , and the oven-doors opening at the front of the store are provided with the same economical savers of heat . High tin covers placed on the top prevent the heat from radiating above the stove . These are exceedingly useful , as the space under them is well heated and arranged for baking , for heating irons , and many other incidental necessities . Cake and pies can be baked on the top , while the oven is used for bread or for meats . When all the casings and covers are on , almost all the heat is confined within the stove , and whenever heat for the room is wanted , opening the front oven-doors turns it out into the kitchen . Another contrivance is that of ventilating-holes in the front doors , through which fresh air is brought into the oven . This secures several purposes : it carries off the fumes of cooking meats , and prevents the mixing of flavors when different articles are cooked in the oven ; it drives the heat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oven , and equalizes its heat , so that articles need not be moved while baking ; and lastly , as the air passes through the holes of the fire-box , it causes the burning of gases in the smoke , and thus increases heat . When wood or bituminous coal is used , perforated metal linings are put in the fire-box , and the result is the burning of smoke and gases that otherwise would pass into the chimney . This is a great discovery in the economy of fuel , which can be applied in many ways . Heretofore , most cooking-stoves have had dumping-grates , which are inconvenient from the dust produced , are uneconomical in the use of fuel , and disadvantageous from too many or too loose joints . But recently this stove has been provided with a dumping-grate which also will sift ashes , and can be cleaned without dust and the other objectionable features of dumping-grates . A further account of this stove , and the mode of purchasing and using it , will be given at the close of the book . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire going all night , and equally well with wood or coal , thus saving the expense of kindling and the trouble of starting a new fire . When the fuel is of good quality , all that is needed in the morning is to draw the back-damper , snake the grate , and add more fuel . Another remarkable feature of this store is the extension-top , on which is placed a water reservoir , constantly heated by the smoke as it passes from the stove , through one or two uniting passages , to the smoke-pipe . Under this is placed a closet for warming and keeping hot the dishes , vegetables , meats , etc. , while preparing for dinner . It is also very useful in drying fruit ; and when large baking is required , a small appended pot for charcoal turns it into a fine large oven , that bakes as nicely as a brick oven . Another useful appendage is a common tin oven , in which roasting can be done in front of the stove , the oven-doors being removed for the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an open fire . This stove is furnished with pipes for heating water , like the water-back of ranges , and these can be taken or left out at pleasure . So also the top covers , the baking-stool and pot , and the summer-back , bottom , and side-casings can be used or omitted as preferred . Illustration Fig 37 Fig. 37 exhibits the stove completed , with all its appendages , as they might be employed in cooking for a large number . Its capacity , convenience , and economy as a stove may be estimated by the following fact : With proper management of dampers , one ordinary-sized coal-hod of anthracite coal will , for twenty-four hours , keep the stove running , keep seventeen gallons of water hot at all hours , bake pies and puddings in the warm closet , heat flat-irons under the back cover , boil tea-kettle and one pot under the front cover , bake bread in the oven , and cook a turkey in the tin roaster in front . The author has numerous friends , who , after trying the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two or three years cleared the whole expense by the saving of fuel . The remarkable durability of this stove is another economic feature . For in addition to its fine castings and nice-fitting workmanship , all the parts liable to burn out are so protected by linings , and other contrivances easily renewed , that the stove itself may pass from one generation to another , as do ordinary chimneys . The writer has visited in families where this stove had been in constant use for eighteen and twenty years , and was still as good as new . In most other families the stoves are broken , burnt-out , or thrown aside for improved patterns every four , five , or six years , and sometimes , to the knowledge of the writer , still oftener . Another excellent point is that , although it is so complicated in its various contrivances as to demand intelligent management in order to secure all its advantages , it also can be used satisfactorily even when the mistress and maid are equally careless and ignorant of its distinctive merits . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is extensively used by those who take no pains to understand and apply its peculiar advantages . But the writer has managed the stove herself in all the details of cooking , and is confident that any housekeeper of common sense , who is instructed properly , and who also aims to have her kitchen affairs managed with strict economy , can easily train any servant who is willing to learn , so as to gain the full advantages offered . And even without any instructions at all , except the printed directions sent with the stove , an intelligent woman can , by due attention , though not without , both manage it , and teach her children and servants to do likewise . And whenever this stove has failed to give the highest satisfaction , it has been , either because the housekeeper was not apprized of its peculiarities , or because she did not give sufficient attention to the matter , or was not able or willing to superintend and direct its management . The consequence has been that , in families where this stove has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one half of the fuel that would be used in ordinary stoves , constructed with the usual disregard of scientific and economic laws . And it is because we know this particular stove to be convenient , reliable , and economically efficient beyond ordinary experience , in the important housekeeping element of kitchen labor , that we devote to it so much space and pains to describe its advantageous points . CHIMNEYS . One of the most serious evils in domestic life is often found in chimneys that will not properly draw the smoke of a fire or stove . Although chimneys have been building for a thousand years , the artisans of the present day seem strangely ignorant of the true method of constructing them so as always to carry smoke upward instead of downward . It is rarely the case that a large house is built in which there is not some flue or chimney which " will not draw . " One of the reasons why the stove described as excelling all others is sometimes cast aside for a poorer one is , that it requires a properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to secure it . The writer in early life shed many a bitter tear , drawn forth by smoke from an ill-constructed kitchen-chimney , and thousands all over the land can report the same experience . The following are some of the causes and the remedies for this evil . The most common cause of poor chimney draughts is too large an opening for the fireplace , either too wide or too high in front , or having too large a throat for the smoke . In a lower story , the fireplace should not be larger than thirty inches wide , twenty-five inches high , and fifteen deep . In the story above , it should be eighteen inches square and fifteen inches deep . Another cause is too short a flue , and the remedy is to lengthen it . As a general rule , the longer the flue the stronger the draught . But in calculating the length of a flue , reference must be had to side-flues , if any open into it . Where this is the case , the length of the main flue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point where the upper flue joins it , and where the lower will receive air from the upper flue . If a smoky flue can not be increased in length , either by closing an upper flue or lengthening the chimney , the fireplace must be contracted so that all the air near the fire will be heated and thus pressed upward . If a flue has more than one opening , in some cases it is impossible to secure a good draught . Sometimes it will work well and sometimes it will not . The only safe rule is to have a separate flue to each fire . Another cause of poor draughts is too tight a room , so that the cold air from without can not enter to press the warm air up the chimney . The remedy is to admit a small current of air from without . Another cause is two chimneys in one room , or in rooms opening together , in which the draught in one is much stronger than in the other . In this case , the stronger draught will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each room to have a proper supply of outside air ; or , in a single room , to stop one of the chimneys . Another cause is the too close vicinity of a hill or buildings higher than the top of the chimney , and the remedy for this is to raise the chimney . Another cause is the descent , into unused fireplaces , of smoke from other chimneys near . The remedy is to close the throat of the unused chimney . Another cause is a door opening toward the fireplace , on the same side of the room , so that its draught passes along the wall and makes a current that draws out the smoke . The remedy is to change the hanging of the door so as to open another way . Another cause is strong winds . The remedy is a turn-cap on top of the chimney . Another cause is the roughness of the inside of a chimney , or projections which impede the passage of the smoke . Every chimney should be built of equal dimensions from bottom to top , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible , and with the surface of the inside as smooth as possible . Another cause of poor draughts is openings into the chimney of chambers for stove-pipes . The remedy is to close them , or insert stove-pipes that are in use . Another cause is the falling out of brick in some part of the chimney so that outer air is admitted . The remedy is to close the opening . The draught of a stove may be affected by most of these causes . It also demands that the fireplace have a tight fire-board , or that the throat he carefully filled . For neglecting this , many a good stove has been thrown aside and a poor one taken in its place . If all young women had committed to memory these causes of evil and their remedies , many a badly-built chimney might have been cured , and many smoke-drawn tears , sighs , ill-tempers , and irritating words avoided . But there are dangers in this direction which demand special attention . Where one flue has two stoves or fireplaces , in rooms one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lower room , being the warmer , the colder air and carbonic acid in the room above will pass down into the lower room through the opening for the stove or the fireplace . This occurred not long since in a boarding-school , when the gas in a room above flowed into a lower one , and suffocated several to death . This room had no mode of ventilation , and several persons slept in it , and were thus stifled . Professor Brewer states a similar case in the family of a relative . An anthracite stove was used in the upper room ; and on one still , close night , the gas from this stove descended through the flue and the opening into a room below , and stifled two persons to insensibility , though , by proper efforts , their lives were saved . Many such cases have occurred where rooms have been thus filled with poisonous gases , and servants and children destroyed , or their constitutions injured , simply because housekeepers are not properly instructed in this important branch of their profession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of domestic life requiring more intelligent management than furnaces . Let us then consider some of the principles involved . The earth is heated by radiation from the sun . The air is not warmed by the passage of the sun 's heat through it , but by convection from the earth , in the same way that it is warmed by the surfaces of stoves . The lower stratum of air is warmed by the earth and by objects which have been warmed by radiated heat from the sun . The particles of air thus heated expand , become lighter , and rise , being replaced by the descent of the cooler and heavier particles from above , which , on being warmed also rise , and give place to others . Owing to this process , the air is warmest nearest the earth , and grows cooler as height increases . The air has a strong attraction for water , and always holds a certain quantity as invisible vapor . The warmer the air , the more moisture it demands , and it will draw it from all objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature . Thus , at fifty-two degrees , Fahrenheit 's thermometer , it holds half the moisture it can sustain ; but at thirty-six degrees , it will hold only one eighty-sixth part . The earth and all plants and trees are constantly sending out moisture ; and when the air has received all it can hold , without depositing it as dew , it is said to be saturated , and the point of temperature at which dew begins to form , by condensation , upon the surface of the earth and its vegetation , is called the dew-point . When air , at a given temperature , has only forty per cent of the moisture it requires for saturation , it is said to be dry . In a hot summer day , the air will hold far more moisture than in cool days . In summer , out-door air rarely holds less than half its volume of water . In 1838 , at Cambridge , Massachusetts , and New-Haven , Connecticut , at seventy degrees , Fahrenheit , the air held eighty per cent of moisture . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the moisture it is capable of holding ; and in cool days at the North , in foggy weather , the air is sometimes wholly saturated . When air holds all the moisture it can , without depositing dew , its moisture is called 100 . When it holds three fourths of this , it is said to be at seventy-five per cent . When it holds only one half , it is at fifty per cent . When it holds only one fourth , it is at twenty-five per cent , etc . Sanitary observers teach that the proper amount of moisture in the air ranges from forty to seventy per cent of saturation . Now , furnaces , which are of course used only in winter , receive outside air at a low temperature , holding little moisture ; This it sucks up , like a sponge , from the walls and furniture of a house . If it is taken into the human lungs , it draws much of its required moisture from the body , often causing dryness of lips and throat , and painfully affecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New-Haven , who has experimented extensively on this subject , states that , while forty per cent of moisture is needed in air to make it healthful , most stoves and furnaces do not , by any contrivances , supply one half of this , or not twenty per cent . He says most furnace-heated air is dryer than is ever breathed in the hottest deserts of Sahara . Thus , for want of proper instruction , most American housekeepers not only poison their families with carbonic acid and starve them for want of oxygen , but also diminish health and comfort for want of a due supply of moisture in the air . And often when a remedy is sought , by evaporating water in the furnace , it is without knowing that the amount evaporated depends , not on the quantity of water in the vessel , but on the extent of evaporating surface exposed to the air . A quart of water in a wide shallow pan will give more moisture than two gallons with a small surface exposed to heat . There is also no little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moisture in the air . For it is found that the body radiates its heat less in moist than in dry air , so that a person feels as warm at a lower temperature when the air has a proper supply of moisture , as in a much higher temperature of dry air . Of course , less fuel is needed to warm a house when water is evaporated in stove and furnace-heated rooms . It is said by those who have experimented , that the saving in fuel is twenty per cent when the air is duly supplied with moisture . There is a very ingenious instrument , called the hygrodeik , which indicates the exact amount of moisture in the air . It consists of two thermometers side by side , one of which has its bulb surrounded by floss-silk wrapping , which is kept constantly wet by communication with a cup of water near it . The water around the bulb evaporates just in proportion to the heat of the air around it . The changing of water to vapor draws heat from the nearest object , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercury is cooled and sinks . Then the difference between the two thermometers shows the amount of moisture in the air by a pointer on a dial-plate constructed by simple mechanism for this purpose . There is one very important matter in regard to the use of furnaces , which is thus stated by Professor Brewer : " I think it is a well-established fact that carbonic oxide will pass through iron . It is always formed in great abundance in any anthracite fire , but especially in anthracite stoves and furnaces . Moreover , furnaces always leak , more or less ; how much they leak depending on the care and skill with which they are managed . Carbonic oxide is much more poisonous than carbonic acid . Doubtless some carbonic oxide finds its way into all furnace-heated houses , especially where anthracite is used ; the amount varying with the kind of furnace and its management . As to how much escapes into a room , and its specific effect upon the health of its occupants , we have no accurate data , no analysis to show the quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity inhaled and the health of those exposed ; all is mere conjecture upon this point ; but the inference is very strong that it has a very injurious effect , producing headaches , weariness , and other similar symptoms . " Recent pamphlets lay the blame of all the bad effects of anthracite furnaces and stoves to the carbonic oxide mingled in the air . I think these pamphlets have a bad influence . Excessive dryness also has bad effects . So also the excessive heat in the evenings and coolness in the mornings has a share in these evils . But how much in addition is owing to carbonic oxide , we can not know , until we know something of the actual amount of this gas in rooms , and as yet we know absolutely nothing definite . In fact , it will be a difficult thing to prove . " There are other difficulties connected with furnaces which should be considered . It is necessary to perfect health that an equal circulation of the blood be preserved . The greatest impediment to this is keeping the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided in a nation where the brain is by constant activity drawing the blood from the extremities . And nowhere is this more important than in schools , churches , colleges , lecture and recitation-rooms , where the brain is called into active exercise . And yet , furnace-heated rooms always keep the feet in the coldest air , on cool floors , while the head is in the warmest air . Another difficulty is the fact that all bodies tend to radiate their heat to each other , till an equal temperature exists . Thus , the human body is constantly radiating its heat to the walls , floors , and cooler bodies around . At the same time , a thermometer is affected in the same way , radiating its heat to cooler bodies around , so that it always marks a lower degree of heat than actually exists in the warm air around it . Owing to these facts , the injected air of a furnace is always warmer than is good for the lungs , and much warmer than is ever needed in rooms warmed by radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we inspire , the more oxygen is received , the faster the blood circulates , and the greater is the vigor imparted to brain , nerves , and muscles . Scientific men have been contriving various modes of meeting these difficulties , and at the close of this volume some results will be given to aid a woman in selecting and managing the most healthful and economical furnace , or in providing some better method of warming a house . Some account will also be given of the danger involved in gas-stoves , and some other recent inventions for cooking and heating . VI . HOME DECORATION . Having duly arranged for the physical necessities of a healthful and comfortable home , we next approach the important subject of beauty in reference to the decoration of houses . For while the aesthetic element must be subordinate to the requirements of physical existence , and , as a matter of expense , should be held of inferior consequence to means of higher moral growth ; it yet holds a place of great significance among the influences which make home happy and attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young , and contributes much to the education of the entire household in refinement , intellectual development , and moral sensibility . Here we are met by those who tell us that of course they want their houses handsome , and that , when they get money enough , they intend to have them so , but at present they are too poor , and because they are poor they dismiss the subject altogether , and live without any regard to it . We have often seen people who said that they could not afford to make their houses beautiful , who had spent upon them , outside or in , an amount of money which did not produce either beauty or comfort , and which , if judiciously applied , might have made the house quite charming . For example , a man , in building his house , takes a plan of an architect . This plan includes , on the outside , a number of what Andrew Fairservice called " curlywurlies " and " whigmaliries , " which make the house neither prettier nor more comfortable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We would venture to say that we could buy the chromo of Bierstadt 's " Sunset in the Yosemite Valley , " and four others like it , for half the sum that we have sometimes seen laid out on a very ugly , narrow , awkward porch on the outside of a house . The only use of this porch was to cost money , and to cause every body who looked at it to exclaim as they went by , " What ever induced that man to put a thing like that on the outside of his house ? " Then , again , in the inside of houses , we have seen a dwelling looking very bald and bare , when a sufficient sum of money had been expended on one article to have made the whole very pretty : and it has come about in this way . We will suppose the couple who own the house to be in the condition in which people generally are after they have built a house  --  having spent more than they could afford on the building itself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now , " says the housewife , " I must at least have a parlor-carpet . We must get that to begin with , and other things as we go on . " She goes to a store to look at carpets . The clerks are smiling and obliging , and sweetly complacent . The storekeeper , perhaps , is a neighbor or a friend , and after exhibiting various patterns , he tells her of a Brussels carpet he is selling wonderfully cheap  --  actually a dollar and a quarter less a yard than the usual price of Brussels , and the reason is that it is an unfashionable pattern , and he has a good deal of it , and wishes to close it off . She looks at it and thinks it is not at all the kind of carpet she meant to buy , but then it is Brussels , and so cheap ! And as she hesitates , her friend tells her that she will find it " cheapest in the end  --  that one Brussels carpet will outlast three or four ingrains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , that she buys the Brussels carpet , which , with all its reduction in price , is one third dearer than the ingrain would have been , and not half so pretty . When she comes home , she will find that she has spent , we will say eighty dollars , for a very homely carpet whose greatest merit it is an affliction to remember  --  namely , that it will outlast three ordinary carpets . And because she has bought this carpet she can not afford to paper the walls or put up any window-curtains , and can not even begin to think of buying any pictures . Now let us see what eighty dollars could have done for that room . We will suppose , in the first place , she invests in thirteen rolls of wall-paper of a lovely shade of buff , which will make the room look sunshiny in the day-time , and light up brilliantly in the evening . Thirteen rolls of good satin paper , at thirty-seven cents a roll , expends four dollars and eighty-one cents . A maroon bordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can not at a distance be told from it , can be bought for six cents a yard . This will bring the paper to about five dollars and a half ; and our friends will give a day of their time to putting it on . The room already begins to look furnished . Then , let us cover the floor with , say , thirty yards of good matting , at fifty cents a yard . This gives us a carpet for fifteen dollars . We are here stopped by the prejudice that matting is not good economy , because it wears out so soon . We humbly submit that it is precisely the thing for a parlor , which is reserved for the reception-room of friends , and for our own dressed leisure hours . Matting is not good economy in a dining-room or a hard-worn sitting-room ; but such a parlor as we are describing is precisely the place where it answers to the very best advantage . We have in mind one very attractive parlor which has been , both for summer and winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wife , and family of children , where a plain straw matting has done service for seven years . That parlor is in a city , and these friends are in the habit of receiving visits from people who live upon velvet and Brussels ; but they prefer to spend the money which such carpets would cost on other modes of embellishment ; and this parlor has often been cited to us as a very attractive room . And now our friends , having got thus far , are requested to select some one tint or color which shall be the prevailing one in the furniture of the room . Shall it be green ? Shall it be blue ? Shall it be crimson ? To carry on our illustration , we will choose green , and we proceed with it to create furniture for our room . Let us imagine that on one side of the fireplace there be , as there is often , a recess about six feet long and three feet deep . Fill this recess with a rough frame with four stout legs , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an elastic rack of slats . Make a mattress for this , or , if you wish to avoid that trouble , you can get a nice mattress for the sum of two dollars , made of cane-shavings or husks . Cover this with a green English furniture print . The glazed English comes at about twenty-five cents a yard , the glazed French at seventy-five cents a yard , and a nice article of yard-wide French twill ( very strong ) is from seventy-five to eighty cents a yard . With any of these cover your lounge . Make two large , square pillows of the same substance as the mattress , and set up at the back . If you happen to have one or two feather pillows that you can spare for the purpose , shake them down into a square shape and cover them with the same print , and you will then have for pillows for your lounge  --  one at each end , and two at the back , and you will find it answers for all the purposes of a sofa . Illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , now , to cut out of the same material as your lounge , sets of lambrequins ( or , as they are called , lamberkins , ) a land of pendent curtain-top , as shown in the illustration , to put over the windows , which are to be embellished with white muslin curtains . The cornices to your windows can be simply strips of wood covered with paper to match the bordering of your room , and the lambrequins , made of chintz like the lounge , can be trimmed with fringe or gimp of the same color . The patterns of these can be varied according to fancy , but simple designs are usually the prettiest . A tassel at the lowest point improves the appearance . The curtains can be made of plain white muslin , or some of the many styles that come for this purpose . If plain muslin is used , you can ornament them with hems an inch in width , in which insert a strip of gingham or chambray of the same color as your chintz . This will wash with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fade , it can easily be drawn out and replaced . The influence of white-muslin curtains in giving an air of grace and elegance to a room is astonishing . White curtains really create a room out of nothing . No matter how coarse the muslin , so it be white and hang in graceful folds , there is a charm in it that supplies the want of multitudes of other things . Very pretty curtain-muslin can be bought at thirty-seven cents a yard . It requires six yards for a window . Let your men-folk knock up for you , out of rough , unplaned boards , some ottoman frames , as described in Chapter II ; stuff the tops with just the same material as the lounge , and cover them with the self-same chintz . Illustration : Fig. 39 . Now you have , suppose your selected color to be green , a green lounge in the corner and two green ottomans ; you have white muslin curtains , with green lambrequins and borders , and your room already looks furnished . If you have in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garret , draw it out  --  drive a nail here and there to hold it firm  --  stuff and pad , and stitch the padding through with a long upholsterer 's needle , and cover it with the chintz like your other furniture . Presto  --  you create an easy-chair . Thus can broken and disgraced furniture reappear , and , being put into uniform with the general suit of your room , take a new lease of life . If you want a centre-table , consider this  --  that any kind of table , well concealed beneath the folds of handsome drapery of a color corresponding to the general hue of the room , will look well . Instead of going to the cabinet-maker and paying from thirty to forty dollars upon a little , narrow , cold , marble-topped stand , that gives just room enough to hold a lamp and a book or two , reflect within yourself what a centre-table is made for . If you have in your house a good , broad , generous-topped table , take it , cover it with an ample cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half yards square , of fine green broadcloth , figured with black and with a pattern-border of grape-leaves , has been bought for ten dollars . In a room we wot of , it covers a cheap pine table , such as you may buy for four or five dollars any day ; but you will be astonished to see how handsome an object this table makes under its green drapery . Probably you could make the cover more cheaply by getting the cloth and trimming its edge with a handsome border , selected for the purpose ; but either way , it will be an economical and useful ornament . We set down our centre-table , therefore , as consisting mainly of a nice broadcloth cover , matching our curtains and lounge . We are sure that any one with " a heart that is humble " may command such a centre-table and cloth for fifteen dollars or less , and a family of five or six may all sit and work , or read , or write around it , and it is capable of entertaining a generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your parlor the following figures : Wall-paper and border , **36;89;TOOLONG $5.50 Thirty yards matting , **37;127;TOOLONG 15.00 Centre-table and cloth , **35;166;TOOLONG 15.00 Muslin for three windows , **34;203;TOOLONG 6.75 Thirty yards green English chintz @x txt Six chairs , at $2 each , ............... ............... ..... 12.00 Total , ............... ............... ...................... $61.75 Subtracted from eighty dollars , which we set down as the price of the cheap , ugly Brussels carpet , we have our whole room papered , carpeted , curtained , and furnished , and we have nearly twenty dollars remaining for pictures .

If any of our friends should ever carry it out , they will find that the buff paper , with its dark , narrow border ; the green chintz repeated in the lounge , the ottomans , and lambrequins ; the flowing , white curtains ; the broad , generous centre-table , draped with its ample green cloth , will , when arranged together , produce an effect of grace and beauty far beyond what any one piece or even half a dozen pieces of expensive cabinet furniture could . The great , simple principle of beauty illustrated in this room is harmony of color . You can , in the same way , make a red room by using Turkey red for your draperies ; or a blue room by using blue chintz . Let your chintz be of a small pattern , and one that is decided in color . We have given the plan of a room with matting on the floor because that is absolutely the cheapest cover . The price of thirty yards plain , good ingrain carpet , at $1.50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between forty-five and fifteen dollars would furnish a room with pictures such as we have instanced . However , the same programme can be even better carried out with a green ingrain carpet as the foundation of the color of the room . Our friends , who lived seven years upon matting , contrived to give their parlor in winter an effect of warmth and color by laying down , in front of the fire , a large square of carpeting , say three breadths , four yards long . This covered the gathering-place around the fire where the winter circle generally sits , and gave an appearance of warmth to the room . If we add this piece of carpeting to the estimates for our room , we still leave a margin for a picture , and make the programme equally adapted to summer and winter . Besides the chromos , which , when well selected and of the best class , give the charm of color which belongs to expensive paintings , there are engravings which finely reproduce much of the real spirit and beauty of the celebrated pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resources of economical art ; for there are few of the renowned statues , whether of antiquity or of modern times , that have not been accurately copied in plaster casts ; and a few statuettes , costing perhaps five or six dollars each , will give a really elegant finish to your rooms-providing always that they are selected with discrimination and taste . The educating influence of these works of art can hardly be over-estimated . Surrounded by such suggestions of the beautiful , and such reminders of history and art , children are constantly trained to correctness of tote and refinement of thought , and stimulated  --  sometimes to efforts at artistic imitation , always to the eager and intelligent inquiry about the scenes , the places , the incidents represented . Just here , perhaps , we are met by some who grant all that we say on the subject of decoration by works of art , and who yet impatiently exclaim , " But I have no money to spare for any thing of this sort . I am condemned to an absolute bareness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Are you sure , my friend ? If you live in the country , or can get into the country , and have your eyes opened and your wits about you , your house need not be condemned to an absolute bareness . Not so long as the woods are full of beautiful ferns and mosses , while every swamp shakes and nods with tremulous grasses , need you feel yourself an utterly disinherited child of nature , and deprived of its artistic use . For example : Take an old tin pan condemned to the retired list by reason of holes in the bottom , get twenty-five cents ' worth of green paint for this and other purposes , and paint it . The holes in the bottom are a recommendation for its new service . If there are no holes , you must drill two or three , as drainage is essential . Now put a layer one inch deep of broken charcoal and potsherds over the bottom , and then soil , in the following proportions : Two fourths wood-soil , such as you find in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One fourth meadow-soil , taken from under fresh turf . Mix with this some charcoal dust . In this soil plant all sorts of ferns , together with some few swamp-grasses ; and around the edge put a border of money-plant or periwinkle to hang over . This will need to be watered once or twice a week , and it will grow and thrive all summer long in a corner of your room . Should you prefer , you can suspend it by wires and make a hanging-basket.  --  Ferns and wood-grasses need not have sunshine  --  they grow well in shadowy places . On this same principle you can convert a salt-box or an old drum of figs into a hanging-basket . Tack bark and pine-cones and moss upon the outside of it , drill holes and pass wires through it , and you have a woodland hanging-basket , which will hang and grow in any corner of your house . We have been into rooms which , by the simple disposition of articles of this kind , have been made to have an air so poetical and attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any thing in the real world . Illustration : Fig. 44 . Another mode of disposing of ferns is this : Take a flat piece of board sawed out something like a shield , with a hole at the top for hanging it up . Upon the board nail a wire pocket made of an ox-muzzle flattened on one side ; or make something of the kind with stiff wire . Line this with a sheet of close moss , which appears green behind the wire net-work . Then you fill it with loose , spongy moss , such as you find in swamps , and plant therein great plumes of fern and various swamp-grasses ; they will continue to grow there , and hang gracefully over . When watering , set a pail under for it to drip into . It needs only to keep this moss always damp , and to sprinkle these ferns occasionally with a whisk-broom , to have a most lovely ornament for your room or hall . The use of ivy in decorating a room is beginning to be generally acknowledged . It needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a well-drained pot or box , and to have its leaves thoroughly washed once or twice a year in strong suds made with soft-soap , to free it from dust and scale-bug ; and an ivy will live and thrive and wind about in a room , year in and year out , will grow around pictures , and do almost any thing to oblige you that you can suggest to it . For instance , in a March number of Hearth and Home , Footnote : A beautifully illustrated agricultural and family weekly paper , edited by Donald G. Mitchell ( Ik Marvel ) and Mrs. H. B. Stowe , there is a picture of the most delightful library-window imaginable , whose chief charm consists in the running vines that start from a longitudinal box at the bottom of the window , and thence clamber up and about the casing and across the rustic frame-work erected for its convenience . On the opposite page we present another plain kind of window , ornamented with a variety of these rural economical adornings . Illustration : Fig. 45 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side is a pot of Fuchsia . On the other side is a Calla Lily . In the hanging-baskets and on the brackets are the ferns and flowers that flourish in the deep woods , and around the window is the ivy , running from two boxes ; and , in case the window has some sun , a Nasturtium may spread its bright blossoms among the leaves . Then , in the winter , when there is less sun , the Striped Spider-wort , the Smilax and the Saxifraga . Samantosa ( or Wandering Jew ) may be substituted . Pretty brackets can be made of common pine , ornamented with odd-growing twigs or mosses or roots , scraped and varnished , or in their native state . A beautiful ornament for a room with pictures is German ivy . Slips of this will start without roots in bottles of water . Slide the bottle behind the picture , and the ivy will seem to come from fairyland , and hang its verdure in all manner of pretty curves around the picture . It may then be trained to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornice along the ceiling . We have seen some rooms that had an ivy cornice around the whole , giving the air of a leafy bower . There are some other odd devices to ornament a room . For example , a sponge , kept wet by daily immersion , can be filled with flax-seed and suspended by a cord , when it will ere long be covered with verdure and afterward with flowers . A sweet potato , laid in a bowl of water on a bracket , or still better , suspended by a knitting-needle , run through or laid across the bowl half in the water , will , in due time , make a beautiful verdant ornament . A large carrot , with the smallest half cut off , scooped out to hold water and then suspended with cords , will send out graceful shoots in rich profusion . Half a cocoa-nut shell , suspended , will hold earth or water for plants and make a pretty hanging-garden . It may be a very proper thing to direct the ingenuity and activity of children into the making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundations are the cheap wooden bowls , which are quite easy to get , and the walks of children in the woods can be made interesting by their bringing home material for this rustic work . Different colored twigs and sprays of trees , such as the bright scarlet of the dog-wood , the yellow of the willow , the black of the birch , and the silvery gray of the poplar , may be combined in fanciful net-work . For this sort of work , no other investment is needed than a hammer and an assortment of different-sized tacks , and beautiful results will be produced . Fig. 46 is a stand for flowers , made of roots , scraped and varnished . But the greatest and cheapest and most delightful fountain of beauty is a " Ward case . " Illustration : Fig 46 . Now , immediately all our economical friends give up in despair . Ward 's cases sell all the way along from eighteen to fifty dollars , and are , like every thing else in this lower world , regarded as the sole perquisites of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plate-glass , and hot-house plants , and rare patterns , are the especial inheritance of the rich ; but any family may command all the requisites of a Ward case for a very small sum . Such a case is a small glass closet over a well-drained box of soil . You make a Ward case on a small scale when you turn a tumbler over a plant . The glass keeps the temperature moist and equable , and preserves the plants from dust , and the soil being well drained , they live and thrive accordingly . The requisites of these are the glass top and the bed of well-drained soil . Suppose you have a common cheap table , four feet long and two wide . Take off the top boards of your table , and with them board the bottom across tight and firm ; then line it with zinc , and you will have a sort of box or sink on legs . Now make a top of common window-glass such as you would get for a cucumber-frame ; let it be two and a half feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slanting roof of glass resting on this ridge-pole ; on one end let there be a door two feet square . Illustration : Fig. 47 . We have seen a Ward case made in this way , in which the capabilities for producing ornamental effect were greatly beyond many of the most elaborate ones of the shops . It was large , and roomy , and cheap . Common window-sash and glass are not dear , and any man with moderate ingenuity could fashion such a glass closet for his wife ; or a woman , not having such a husband , can do it herself . The sink or box part must have in the middle of it a hole of good size for drainage . In preparing for the reception of plants , first turn a plant-saucer over this hole , which may otherwise become stopped . Then , as directed for the other basket , proceed with a layer of broken charcoal and pot-sherds for drainage , two inches deep , and prepare the soil as directed above , and add to it some pounded charcoal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less charcoal and charcoal-dust is always in order in the treatment of these moist subjects , as it keeps them from fermenting and growing sour . Now for filling the case . Our own native forest-ferns have a period in the winter months when they cease to grow . They are very particular in asserting their right to this yearly nap , and will not , on any consideration , grow for you out of their appointed season . Nevertheless , we shall tell you what we have tried ourselves , because greenhouse ferns are expensive , and often great cheats when you have bought them , and die on your hands in the most reckless and shameless manner . If you make a Ward case in the spring , your ferns will grow beautifully in it all summer ; and in the autumn , though they stop growing , and cease to throw out leaves , yet the old leaves will remain fresh and green till the time for starting the new ones in the spring . But , supposing you wish to start your case in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the forest ; by searching carefully the rocks and clefts and recesses of the forest , you can find a quantity of beautiful ferns whose leaves the frost has not yet assailed . Gather them carefully , remembering that the time of the plant 's sleep has come , and that you must make the most of the leaves it now has , as you will not have a leaf more from it till its waking-up time in February or March . But we have succeeded , and you will succeed , in making a very charming and picturesque collection . You can make in your Ward case lovely little grottoes with any bits of shells , and minerals , and rocks you may have ; you can lay down , here and there , fragments of broken looking-glass for the floor of your grottoes , and the effect of them will be magical . A square of looking-glass introduced into the back side of your case will produce charming effects . The trailing arbutus or May-flower , if cut up carefully in sods , and put into this Ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it otherwise would , and gladden your eyes and heart . In the fall , if you can find the tufts of eye-bright or houstonia cerulia , and mingle them in with your mosses , you will find them blooming before winter is well over . But among the most beautiful things for such a case is the partridge-berry , with its red plums . The berries swell and increase in the moist atmosphere , and become intense in color , forming an admirable ornament . Then the ground pine , the princess pine , and various nameless pretty things of the woods , all flourish in these little conservatories . In getting your sod of trailing arbutus , remember that this plant forms its buds in the fall . You must , therefore , examine your sod carefully , and see if the buds are there ; otherwise you will find no blossoms in the spring . There are one or two species of violets , also , that form their buds in the fall , and these too , will blossom early for you . We have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as they all do well in moist , shady places , we recommend hopefully the experiment of putting some of them in . A Ward case has this recommendation over common house-plants , that it takes so little time and care . If well made in the outset , and thoroughly drenched with water when the plants are first put in , it will after that need only to be watered about once a month , and to be ventilated by occasionally leaving open the door for a half-hour or hour when the moisture obscures the glass and seems in excess . To women embarrassed with the care of little children , yet longing for the refreshment of something growing and beautiful , this indoor garden will be an untold treasure . The glass defends the plant from the inexpedient intermeddling of little fingers ; while the little eyes , just on a level with the panes of glass , can look through and learn to enjoy the beautiful , silent miracles of nature . For an invalid 's chamber , such a case would be an indescribable comfort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green woods brought in and silently growing ; it will refresh many a weary hour to watch it . VII . THE CARE OF HEALTH . There is no point where a woman is more liable to suffer from a want of knowledge and experience than in reference to the health of a family committed to her care . Many a young lady who never had any charge of the sick ; who never took any care of an infant ; who never obtained information on these subjects from books , or from the experience of others ; in short , with little or no preparation , has found herself the principal attendant in dangerous sickness , the chief nurse of a feeble infant , and the responsible guardian of the health of a whole family . The care , the fear , the perplexity of a woman suddenly called to these unwonted duties , none can realize till they themselves feel it , or till they see some young and anxious novice first attempting to meet such responsibilities . To a woman of age and experience these duties often involve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insupportable ; how hard , then , must they press on the heart of the young and inexperienced ! There is no really efficacious mode of preparing a woman to take a rational care of the health of a family , except by communicating that knowledge in regard to the construction of the body and the laws of health which is the basis of the medical profession . Not that a woman should undertake the minute and extensive investigation requisite for a physician ; but she should gain a general knowledge of first principles , as a guide to her judgment in emergencies when she can rely on no other aid . With this end in view , in the preceding chapters some portions of the organs and functions of the human body have been presented , and others will now follow in connection with the practical duties which result from them . On the general subject of health , one recent discovery of science may here be introduced as having an important relation to every organ and function of the body , and as being one to which frequent reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and operation of cell-life . By the aid of the microscope , we can examine the minute construction of plants and animals , in which we discover contrivances and operations , if not so sublime , yet more wonderful and interesting , than the vast systems of worlds revealed by the telescope . By this instrument it is now seen that the first formation , as well as future changes and actions , of all plants and animals are accomplished by means of small cells or bags containing various kinds of liquids . These cells are so minute that , of the smallest , some hundreds would not cover the dot of a printed i on this page . They are of diverse shapes and contents , and perform various different operations . Illustration : Fig 48 . The first formation of every animal is accomplished by the agency of cells , and may be illustrated by the egg of any bird or fowl . The exterior consists of a hard shell for protection , and this is lined with a tough skin , to which is fastened the yelk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as seen at a , a , in the diagram . In the yelk floats the germ-cell , b , which is the point where the formation of the future animal commences . The yelk , being lighter than the white , rises upward , and the germ being still lighter , rises in the yelk . This is to bring both nearer to the vitalizing warmth of the brooding mother . New cells are gradually formed from the nourishing yelk around the germ , each being at first roundish in shape , and having a spot near the centre , called the nucleus . The reason why cells increase must remain a mystery , until we can penetrate the secrets of vital force  --  probably forever . But the mode in which they multiply is as follows : The first change noticed in a cell , when warmed into vital activity , is the appearance of a second nucleus within it , while the cell gradually becomes oval in form , and then is drawn inward at the middle , like an hour-glass , till the two sides meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear , each containing its own germinal nucleus . These both divide again in the same manner , proceeding in the ratio of 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , and so on , until most of the yelk becomes a mass of cells . The central point of this mass , where the animal itself commences to appear , shows , first , a round-shaped figure , which soon assumes form like a pear , and then like a violin . Gradually the busy little cells arrange themselves to build up heart , lungs , brain , stomach , and limbs , for which the yelk and white furnish nutriment . There is a small bag of air fastened to one end inside of the shell ; and when the animal is complete , this air is taken into its lungs , life begins , and out walks little chick , all its powers prepared , and ready to run , eat , and enjoy existence . Then , as soon as the animal uses its brain to think and feel , and its muscles to move , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decay , while new cells are formed from the blood to take their place . Time with life commences the constant process of decay and renewal all over the body . Illustration : Fig. 49 . The liquid portion of the blood consists of material formed from food , air , and water . From this material the cells of the blood are formed : first , the white cells , which are incomplete in formation ; and then the red cells , which are completed by the addition of the oxygen received from air in the lungs . Fig. 49 represents part of a magnified blood-vessel , a , a , in which the round cells are the white , and the oblong the red cells , floating in the blood . Surrounding the blood-vessels are the cells forming the adjacent membrane , bb , each having a nucleus in its centre . Cells have different powers of selecting and secreting diverse materials from the blood . Thus , some secrete bile to carry to the liver , others secrete saliva for the mouth , others take up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , muscles , and all other organs . Cells also have a converting power , of taking one kind of matter from the blood , and changing it to another kind . They are minute chemical laboratories all over the body , changing materials of one kind to another form in which they can be made useful . Both animal and vegetable substances are formed of cells . But the vegetable cells take up and use unorganized or simple , natural matter ; whereas the animal cell only takes substances already organized into vegetable or animal life , and then changes one compound into another of different proportions and nature . These curious facts in regard to cell-life have important relations to the general subject of the care of health , and also to the cure of disease , as will be noticed in following chapters . THE NERVOUS SYSTEM . There is another portion of the body , which is so intimately connected with every other that it is placed in this chapter as also having reference to every department in the general subject of the care of health . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a collection of instruments to be used by the mind in securing various kinds of knowledge and enjoyment . The organs through which the mind thus operates are the brain and nerves . The drawing ( Fig. 50 ) represents them . Illustration : Fig. 50 . The brain lies in the skull , and is divided into the large or upper brain , marked 1 , and the small or lower brain , marked 2 . From the brain runs the spinal marrow through the spine or backbone . From each side of the spine the large nerves run out into innumerable smaller branches to every portion of the body . The drawing shows only some of the larger branches . Those marked 3 run to the neck and organs of the chest ; those marked 4 go to the arms ; those below the arms , marked 3 , go to the trunk ; and those marked 5 go to the legs . The brain and nerves consist of two kinds of nervous matter  --  the gray , which is supposed to be the portion that originates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the white , which seems to conduct this fluid to every part of the body . The brain and nervous system are divided into distinct portions , each having different offices to perform , and each acting independently of the others ; as , for example , one portion is employed by the mind in thinking , and in feeling pleasurable or painful mental emotions ; another in moving the muscles ; while the nerves that run to the nose , ears , eyes , tongue , hands , and surface generally , are employed in seeing , hearing , smelling , tasting , and feeling all physical sensations . The back portion of the spinal marrow and the nerves that run from it are employed in sensation , or the sense of feeling . These nerves extend over the whole body , but are largely developed in the network of nerves in the skin . The front portion of the spinal marrow and its branches are employed in moving those muscles in all parts of the body which are controlled by the will or choice of the mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sensation and nerves of motion , although they start from different portions of the spine , are united in the same sheath or cover , till they terminate in the muscles . Thus , every muscle is moved by nerves of motion ; while alongside of this nerve , in the same sheath , is a nerve of sensation . All the nerves of motion and sensation are connected with those portions of the brain used when we think , feel , and choose . By this arrangement the mind knows what is wanted in all parts of the body by means of the nerves of sensation , and then it acts by means of the nerves of motion . For example , when we feel the cold air on the skin , the nerves of sensation report to the brain , and thus to the mind , that the body is growing cold . The mind thus knows that more clothing is needed , and wills to have the eyes look for it , and the hands and feet move to get it . This is done by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves of involuntary motion , which move all those parts of the head , face , and body that are used in breathing , and in other operations connected with it . By these we continue to breathe when asleep , and whether we will to do so or not . There are also some of the nerves of voluntary motion that are mixed with these , which enable the mind to stop respiration , or to regulate it to a certain extent . But the mind has no power to stop it for any great length of time . There is another large and important system of nerves called the sympathetic or ganglionic system . It consists of small masses of gray and white nervous matter , that seem to be small brains with nerves running from them . These are called ganglia , and are arranged on each side of the spine , while small nerves from the spinal marrow run into them , thus uniting the sympathetic system with the nerves of the spine . These ganglia are also distributed around in various parts of the interior of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different ganglia are connected with each other by nerves , thus making one system . It is the ganglionic system that carries on the circulation of the blood , the action of the capillaries , lymphatics , arteries , and veins , together with the work of secretion , absorption , and most of the internal working of the body , which goes forward without any knowledge or control of the mind . Every portion of the body has nerves of sensation coming from the spine , and also branches of the sympathetic or ganglionic system . The object of this is to form a sympathetic communication between the several parts of the body , and also to enable the mind to receive , through the brain , some general knowledge of the state of the whole system . It is owing to this that , when one portion of the body is affected , other portions sympathize . For example , if one part of the body is diseased , the stomach may so sympathize as to lose all appetite until the disease is removed . All the operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nervous fluid , which is generated in the gray portions of the brain and ganglia . Whenever a nerve is cut off from its connection with these nervous centres , its power is gone , and the part to which it ministered becomes lifeless and incapable of motion . The brain and nerves can be overworked , and can also suffer for want of exercise , just as the muscles do . It is necessary for the perfect health of the brain and nerves that the several portions he exercised sufficiently , and that no part be exhausted by over-action . For example , the nerves of sensation may be very much exercised , and the nerves of motion have but little exercise . In this ease , one will be weakened by excess of work , and the other by the want of it . It is found by experience that the proper exercise of the nerves of motion tends to reduce any extreme susceptibility of the nerves of sensation . On the contrary , the neglect of such exercise tends to produce an excessive sensibility in the nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is employed in thinking , feeling , and willing , is greatly exercised by hard study , or by excessive care or emotion , the blood tends to the brain to supply it with increased nourishment , just as it flows to the muscles when they are exercised . Over-exercise of this portion of the brain causes engorgement of the blood-vessels . This is sometimes indicated by pain , or by a sense of fullness in the head ; but oftener the result is a debilitating drain on the nervous system , which depends for its supply on the healthful state of the brain . The brain has , as it were , a fountain of supply for the nervous fluid , which flows to all the nerves , and stimulates them to action . Some brains have a larger , and some a smaller fountain ; so that a degree of mental activity that would entirely exhaust one , would make only a small and healthful drain upon another . The excessive use of certain portions of the brain tends to withdraw the nervous energy from other portions ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fails by neglect . For example , a person may so exhaust the brain power in the excessive use of the nerves of motion by hard work , as to leave little for any other faculty . On the other hand , the nerves of feeling and thinking may be so used as to withdraw the nervous fluid from the nerves of motion , and thus debilitate the muscles . Some animal propensities may be indulged to such excess as to produce a constant tendency of the blood to a certain portion of the brain , and to the organs connected with it , and thus cause a constant and excessive excitement , which finally becomes a disease . Sometimes a paralysis of this portion of the brain results from such an entire exhaustion of the nervous fountain and of the overworked nerves . Thus , also , the thinking portion of the brain may be so overworked as to drain the nervous fluid from other portions , which become debilitated by the loss . And in this way , also , the overworked portion may be diseased or paralyzed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all portions of the brain by an appropriate exercise of all the faculties of mind and body , and the influence of this upon happiness , is the most important portion of this subject , and will be more directly exhibited in another chapter . VIII . DOMESTIC EXERCISE . In a work which aims to influence women to train the young to honor domestic labor and to seek healthful exercise in home pursuits , there is special reason for explaining the construction of the muscles and their connection with the nerves , these being the chief organs of motion . The muscles , as seen by the naked eye , consist of very fine fibres or strings , bound up in smooth , silky casings of thin membrane . But each of these visible fibres or strings the microscope shows to be made up of still finer strings , numbering from five to eight hundred in each fibre . And each of these microscopic fibres is a series or chain of elastic cells , which are so minute that one hundred thousand would scarcely cover a capital O on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 52 . The peculiar property of the cells which compose the muscles is their elasticity , no other cells of the body having this property . At Fig. 51 is a diagram representing a microscopic muscular fibre , in which the cells are relaxed , as in the natural state of rest . But when the muscle contracts , each of its numberless cells in all its small fibres becomes widened , making each fibre of the muscle shorter and thicker , as at Fig. 52 . This explains the cause of the swelling out of muscles when they act . Every motion in every part of the body has a special muscle to produce it , and many have other muscles to restore the part moved to its natural state . The muscles that move or bend any part are called flexors , and those that restore the natural position are called extensors . Illustration : Fig. 53 Fig. 53 represents the muscles of the arm after the skin and flesh are removed . They are all in smooth silky cases , laid over each other , and separated both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fat , so as to move easily without interfering with each other . They are fastened to the bones by strong tendons and cartilages ; and around the wrist , in the drawing , is shown a band of cartilage to confine them in place . The muscle marked 8 is the extensor that straightens the fingers after they have been closed by a flexor the other side of the arm . In like manner , each motion of the arm and fingers has one muscle to produce it and another to restore to the natural position . The muscles are dependent on the brain and nerves for power to move . It has been shown that the gray matter of the brain and spinal marrow furnishes the stimulating power that moves the muscles , and causes sensations of touch on the skin , and the other sensations of the several senses . The white part of the brain and spinal marrow consists solely of conducting tubes to transmit this influence . Each of the minute fibrils of the muscles has a small conducting nerve connecting it with the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibril is separate from every other . When , therefore , the mind wills to move a flexor muscle of the arm , the gray matter sends out the stimulus through the nerves to the cells of each individual fibre of that muscle , and they contract . When this is done , the nerve of sensation reports it to the brain and mind . If the mind desires to return the arm to its former position , then follows the willing , and consequent stimulus sent through the nerves to the corresponding muscle ; its cells contract , and the limb is restored . When the motion is a compound one , involving the action of several muscles at the same time , a multitude of impressions are sent back and forth to and from the brain through the nerves . But the person acting thus is unconscious of all this delicate and wonderful mechanism . He wills the movement , and instantly the requisite nervous power is sent to the required cells and fibres , and they perform the motions required . Many of the muscles are moved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little control . Among the muscles and nerves so intimately connected , run the minute capillaries of the blood , which furnish nourishment to all . Illustration : Fig. 54 Fig. 54 represents an artery a a , which brings pure blood to a muscle from the heart . After meandering through the capillaries at c , to distribute oxygen and food from the stomach , the blood enters the vein , b , loaded with carbonic acid and water taken up in the capillaries , to be carried to the lungs or skin , and thrown out into the air . The manner in which the exercise of the muscles quickens the circulation of the blood will now be explained . The veins abound in every part of every muscle , and the large veins have valves which prevent the blood from flowing backward . If the wrist is grasped tightly , the veins of the hand are immediately swollen . This is owing to the fact that the blood is prevented from flowing toward the heart by this pressure , and by the vein-valves from returning into the arteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are not so compressed , and continue to send the blood into the hand , and thus it accumulates . As soon as this pressure is removed , the blood springs onward from the restraint with accelerated motion . This same process takes place when any of the muscles are exercised . The contraction of any muscle presses some of the veins , so that the blood can not flow the natural way , while the valves in the veins prevent its flowing backward . Meantime the arteries continue to press the blood along until the veins become swollen . Then , as soon as the muscle ceases its contraction , the blood flows faster from the previous accumulation . If , then , we use a number of muscles , and use them strongly and quickly , there are so many veins affected in this way as to quicken the whole circulation . The heart receives blood faster , and sends it to the lungs faster . Then the lungs work quicker , to furnish the oxygen required by the greater amount of blood . The blood returns with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out with quicker action through the arteries to the capillaries . In the capillaries , too , the decayed matter is carried off faster , and then the stomach calls for more food to furnish new and pure blood . Thus it is that exercise gives new life and nourishment to every part of the body . It is the universal law of the human frame that exercise is indispensable to the health of the several parts . Thus , if a blood-vessel be tied up , so as not to be used , it shrinks , and becomes a useless string ; if a muscle be condemned to inaction , it shrinks in size and diminishes in power ; and thus it is also with the bones . Inactivity produces softness , debility , and unfitness for the functions they are designed to perform . Now , the nerves , like all other parts of the body , gain and lose strength according as they are exercised . If they have too much or too little exercise , they lose strength ; if they are exercised to a proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuously excited , by business , study , or the imagination , the nerves of emotion and sensation are kept in constant action , while the nerves of motion are unemployed . If this is continued for a long time , the nerves of sensation lose their strength from over-action , and the nerves of motion lose their power from inactivity . In consequence , there is a morbid excitability of the nervous , and a debility of the muscular system , which make all exertion irksome and wearisome . The only mode of preserving the health of these systems is to keep up in them an equilibrium of action . For this purpose , occupations must be sought which exercise the muscles and interest the mind ; and thus the equal action of both kinds of nerves is secured . This shows why exercise is so much more healthful and invigorating when the mind is interested , than when it is not . As an illustration , let a person go shopping with a friend , and have nothing to do but look on . How soon do the continuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus wearied , hears of the arrival of a very dear friend : she can instantly walk off a mile or two to meet her , without the least feeling of fatigue . By this is shown the importance of furnishing , for young persons , exercise in which they will take an interest . Long and formal walks , merely for exercise , though they do some good , in securing fresh air , and some exercise of the muscles , would be of triple benefit if changed to amusing sports , or to the cultivation of fruits and flowers , in which it is impossible to engage without acquiring a great interest . It shows , also , why it is far better to trust to useful domestic exercise at home than to send a young person out to walk for the mere purpose of exercise . Young girls can seldom be made to realize the value of health , and the need of exercise to secure it , so as to feel much interest in walking abroad , when they have no other object . But , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment of themselves and others , by performing domestic duties , they will constantly be interested and cheered in their exercise by the feeling of usefulness and the consciousness of having performed their duty . There are few young persons , it is hoped , who are brought up with such miserable habits of selfishness and indolence that they can not be made to feel happier by the consciousness of being usefully employed . And those who have never been accustomed to think or care for any one but themselves , and who seem to feel little pleasure in making themselves useful , by wise and proper influences can often be gradually awakened to the new pleasure of benevolent exertion to promote the comfort and enjoyment of others . And the more this sacred and elevating kind of enjoyment is tasted , the greater is the relish induced . Other enjoyments often cloy ; but the heavenly pleasure secured by virtuous industry and benevolence , while it satisfies at the time , awakens fresh desires for the continuance of so ennobling a good . IX . HEALTHFUL FOOD . The person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family , and the modes of its preparation , is the one who decides , to a greater or less extent , what shall be the health of that family . It is the opinion of most medical men , that intemperance in eating is one of the most fruitful of all causes of disease and death . If this be so , the woman who wisely adapts the food and cooking of her family to the laws of health removes one of the greatest risks which threatens the lives of those under her care . But , unfortunately , there is no other duty that has been involved in more doubt and perplexity . Were one to believe all that is said and written on this subject , the conclusion probably would be , that there is not one solitary article of food on God 's earth which it is healthful to eat . Happily , however , there are general principles on this subject which , if understood and applied , will prove a safe guide to any woman of common sense ; and it is the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All material things on earth , whether solid , liquid , or gaseous , can be resolved into sixty-two simple substances , only fourteen of which are in the human body ; and these , in certain proportions , in all mankind . Thus , in a man weighing 154 lbs . are found , 111 lbs . oxygen gas , and 14 lbs . hydrogen gas , which , united , form water ; 21 lbs . carbon ; 3 lbs . 8 oz. nitrogen gas ; 1 lb. 12 oz. 190 grs. phosphorus ; 2 lbs . calcium , the chief ingredient of bones ; 2 oz. fluorine ; 2 oz. 219 grs. sulphur ; 2 oz 47 grs. chlorine ; 2 oz. 116 grs. sodium ; 100 grs. iron ; 290 grs. potassium ; 12 grs. magnesium ; and 2 grs. silicon . These simple substances are constantly passing out of the body through the lungs , skin , and other excreting organs . It is found that certain of these simple elements are used for one part of the body , and others for other parts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the chief element of fat , and also supplies the fuel that combines with oxygen in the capillaries to produce animal heat . The nitrogen which we gain from our food and the air is the chief element of muscle ; phosphorus is the chief element of brain and nerves ; and calcium or lime is the hard portion of the bones . Iron is an important element of blood , and silicon supplies the hardest parts of the teeth , nails , and hair . Water , which is composed of the two gases , oxygen and hydrogen , is the largest portion of the body , forming its fluids ; there is four times as much of carbon as there is of nitrogen in the body ; while there is only two per cent as much phosphorus as carbon . A man weighing one hundred and fifty-four pounds , who leads an active life , takes into his stomach daily from two to three pounds of solid food , and from five to six pounds of liquid . At the same time he takes into his lungs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This amounts to three thousand pounds of nutriment received through stomach and lungs , and then expelled from the body , in one year ; or about twenty times the man 's own weight . The change goes on in every minute point of the body , though in some parts much faster than in others ; as set forth in the piquant and sprightly language of Dr. O. W. Holmes Footnote : Atlantic Almanac , 1869 , p. 40. , who , giving a vivid picture of the constant decay and renewal of the body , says : " Every organized being always lives immersed in a strong solution of its own elements . " " Sometimes , as in the case of the air-plant , the solution contains all its elements ; but in higher plants , and in animals generally , some of the principal ones only . Take our own bodies , and we find the atmosphere contains the oxygen and the nitrogen , of which we are so largely made up , as its chief constituents ; the hydrogen , also , in its watery vapor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our air-bath does not furnish us , we must take in the form of nourishment , supplied through the digestive organs . But the first food we take , after we have set up for ourselves , is air , and the last food we take is air also . We are all chameleons in our diet , as we are all salamanders in our habitats , inasmuch as we live always in the fire of our own smouldering combustion ; a gentle but constant flame , fanned every day by the same forty hogsheads of air which furnish us not with our daily bread , which we can live more than a day without touching , but with our momentary , and oftener than momentary , aliment , without which we can not live five minutes . " " We are perishing and being born again at every instant . We do literally enter over and over again into the womb of that great mother , from whom we get our bones , and flesh , and blood , and marrow . ' I die daily ' is true of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particle by particle , and to be born anew in the same proportion , the whole movement of life comes to an end , and swift , universal , irreparable decay resolves our frames into the parent elements . " " The products of the internal fire which consumes us over and over again every year , pass off mainly in smoke and steam from the lungs and the skin . The smoke is only invisible , because the combustion is so perfect . The steam is plain enough in our breaths on a frosty morning ; and an over-driven horse will show us , on a larger scale , the cloud that is always arising from own bodies . " " Man walks , then , not only in a vain show , but wrapped in an uncelestial aureole of his own material exhalations . A great mist of gases and of vapor rises day and night from the whole realm of living nature . The water and the carbonic acid which animals exhale become the food of plants , whose leaves are at once lungs and mouths . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , restoring the elements which that has combined and rendered effete for its own purposes , to their original condition . The salt-water ocean is a great aquarium . The air ocean in which we live is a ' Wardian case , ' of larger dimensions . " It is found that the simple elements will not nourish the body in their natural state , but only when organized , either as vegetable or animal food ; and , to the dismay of the Grahamite or vegetarian school , it is now established by chemists that animal and vegetable food contain the same elements , and in nearly the same proportions . Thus , in animal food , carbon predominates in fats , while in vegetable food it shows itself in sugar , starch , and vegetable oils . Nitrogen is found in animal food in the albumen , fibrin , and caseine ; while in vegetables it is in gluten , albumen , and caseine . Illustration : Fig. 55 It is also a curious fact that , in all articles of food , the elements that nourish diverse parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also that the proportions correspond in a great degree to the wants of the body . For example , a kernel of wheat contains all the articles demanded for every part of the body . Fig. 55 represents , upon an enlarged scale , the position and proportions of the chief elements required . The white central part is the largest in quantity , and is chiefly carbon in the form of starch , which supplies fat and fuel for the capillaries . The shaded outer portion is chiefly nitrogen , which nourishes the muscles , and the dark spot at the bottom is principally phosphorus , which nourishes the brain and nerves . And these elements are in due proportion to the demands of the body . A portion of the outer covering of a wheat-kernel holds lime , silica , and iron , which are needed by the body , and which are found in no other part of the grain . The woody fibre is not digested , but serves by its bulk and stimulating action to facilitate digestion . It is therefore evident that bread made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour . The process of bolting removes all the woody fibre ; the lime needed for the bones ; the silica for hair , nails , and teeth ; the iron for the blood ; and most of the nitrogen and phosphorus needed for muscles , brain , and nerves . Experiments on animals prove that fine flour alone , which is chiefly carbon , will not sustain life more than a month , while unbolted flour furnishes all that is needed for every part of the body . There are cases where persons can not use such coarse bread , on account of its irritating action on inflamed coats of the stomach . For such , a kind of wheaten grit is provided , containing all the kernel of the wheat , except the outside woody fibre . When the body requires a given kind of diet , specially demanded by brain , lungs , or muscles , the appetite will crave food for it until the necessary amount of this article is secured . If , then , the food in which the needed aliment abounds is not supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed until that amount is gained . For all kinds of food have supplies for every want of the body , though in different proportions . Thus , for example , if the muscles are worked a great deal , food in which nitrogen abounds is required , and the appetite will continue until the requisite amount of nitrogen is secured . If , then , food is taken which has not the requisite quantity , the consequence is , that more is taken than the system can use , while the vital powers are needlessly taxed to throw off the excess . These facts were ascertained by Liebig , a celebrated German chemist and physicist , who , assisted by his government , conducted experiments on a large scale in prisons , in armies , and in hospitals . Among other results , he states that those who use potatoes for their principal food eat them in very much larger quantities than their bodies would demand if they used also other food . The reason is , that the potato has a very large proportion of starch that supplies only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muscles . For this reason lean meat is needed with potatoes . In comparing wheat and potatoes we find that in one hundred parts wheat there are fourteen parts nitrogen for muscle , and two parts phosphorus for brain and nerves . But in the potato there is only one part in one hundred for muscle , and nine tenths of one part of phosphorus for brain and nerves . The articles containing most of the three articles needed generally in the body are as follows : for fat and heat-making  --  butter , lard , sugar , and molasses ; for muscle-making  --  lean meat , cheese , peas , beans , and lean fishes ; for brain and nerves  --  shell-fish , lean meats , peas , beans , and very active birds and fishes who live chiefly on food in which phosphorus abounds . In a meat diet , the fat supplies carbon for the capillaries and the lean furnishes nutriment for muscle , brain , and nerves . Green vegetables , fruits , and berries furnish the acid and water needed . In grains used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is in some more of carbon and in others more of nitrogen and phosphorus . For example , in oats there is more of nitrogen for the muscles , and less carbon for the lungs , than can be found in wheat . In the corn of the North , where cold weather demands fuel for lungs and capillaries , there is much more carbon to supply it than is found in the Southern corn . From these statements it may be seen that one of the chief mistakes in providing food for families has been in changing the proportions of the elements nature has fitted for our food . Thus , fine wheat is deprived by bolting of some of the most important of its nourishing elements , leaving carbon chiefly , which , after supplying fuel fur the capillaries , must , if in excess , be sent out of the body ; thus needlessly taxing all the excreting organs . So milk , which contains all the elements needed by the body , has the cream taken out and used for butter , which again is chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candies , are chiefly carbon , and supply but very little of other nourishing elements , while to make them safe much exercise in cold and pure air is necessary . And yet it is the children of the rich , housed in chambers and school-rooms most of their time , who are fed with these dangerous dainties , thus weakening their constitutions , and inducing fevers , colds , and many other diseases . The proper digestion of food depends on the wants of the body , and on its power of appropriating the aliment supplied . The best of food can not be properly digested when it is not needed . All that the system requires will be used , and the rest will be thrown out by the several excreting organs , which thus are frequently over-taxed , and vital forces are wasted . Even food of poor quality may digest well if the demands of the system are urgent . The way to increase digestive power is to increase the demand for food by pure air and exercise of the muscles , quickening the blood , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of life . Rules for persons in full health , who enjoy pure air and exercise , are not suitable for those whose digestive powers are feeble , or who are diseased . On the other hand , many rules for invalids are not needed by the healthful , while rules for one class of invalids will not avail for other classes . Every weak stomach has its peculiar wants , and can not furnish guidance for others . We are now ready to consider intelligently the following general principles in regard to the proper selection of food : Vegetable and animal food are equally healthful if apportioned to the given circumstances . In cold weather , carbonaceous food , such as butter , fats , sugar , molasses , etc. , can be used more safely than in warm weather . And they can be used more safely by those who exercise in the open air than by those of confined and sedentary habits . Students who need food with little carbon , and women who live in the house , should always seek coarse bread , fruits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar , and molasses , and articles containing them . Many students and women using little exercise in the open air , grow thin and weak , because the vital powers are exhausted in throwing off excess of food , especially of the carbonaceous . The liver is especially taxed in such cases , being unable to remove all the excess of carbonaceous matter from , the blood , and thus " biliousness " ensues , particularly on the approach of warm weather , when the air brings less oxygen than in cold . It is found , by experiment , that the supply of gastric juice , furnished from the blood by the arteries of the stomach , is proportioned , not to the amount of food put into the stomach , but to the wants of the body ; so that it is possible to put much more into the stomach than can be digested . To guide and regulate in this matter , the sensation called hunger is provided . In a healthy state of the body , as soon as the blood has lost its nutritive supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the food is suitable , and is taken in the proper manner , this sensation ceases as soon as the stomach has received enough to supply the wants of the system . But our benevolent Creator , in this , as in our other duties , has connected enjoyment with the operation needful to sustain our bodies . In addition to the allaying of hunger , the gratification of the palate is secured by the immense variety of food , some articles of which are far more agreeable than others . This arrangement of Providence , designed for our happiness , has become , either through ignorance , or want of self-control , the chief cause of the many diseases and suffering which afflict those classes who have the means of seeking a variety to gratify the palate . If mankind had only one article of food , and only water to drink , though they would have less enjoyment in eating , they would never be tempted to put any more into the stomach than the calls of hunger require . But the customs of society , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , with those various condiments which stimulate appetite , lead almost every person very frequently to eat merely to gratify the palate , after the stomach has been abundantly supplied , so that hunger has ceased . When too great a supply of food is put into the stomach , the gastric juice dissolves only that portion which the wants of the system demand . Most of the remainder is ejected , in an unprepared state ; the absorbents take portions of it into the system ; and all the various functions of the body , which depend on the ministries of the blood , are thus gradually and imperceptibly injured . Very often , intemperance in eating produces immediate results , such as colic , headaches , pains of indigestion , and vertigo . But the more general result is a gradual undermining of all parts of the human frame ; this imperceptibly shortening life , by so weakening the constitution , that it is ready to yield , at every point , to any uncommon risk or exposure . Thousands and thousands are parsing out of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could meet without any danger . It is owing to these considerations , that it becomes the duty of every woman , who has the responsibility of providing food for a family , to avoid a variety of tempting dishes . It is a much safer rule , to have only one kind of healthy food , for each meal , than the too abundant variety which is often met at the tables of almost all classes in this country . When there is to be any variety of dishes , they ought not to be successive , but so arranged as to give the opportunity of selection . How often is it the case , that persons , by the appearance of a favorite article , are tempted to eat merely to gratify the palate , when the stomach is already adequately supplied . All such intemperance wears on the constitution , and shortens life . It not infrequently happens that excess in eating produces a morbid appetite , which must constantly be denied . But the organization of the digestive organs demands , not only that food should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at proper times . Illustration : Fig. 56 . Fig. 56 shows one important feature of the digestive organs relating to this point . The part marked LM shows the muscles of the inner coat of the stomach , which run in one direction , and CM shows the muscles of the outer coat , running in another direction . As soon as the food enters the stomach , the muscles are excited by the nerves , and the peristaltic motion commences . This is a powerful and constant exercise of the muscles of the stomach , which continues until the process of digestion is complete . During this time the blood is withdrawn from other parts of the system , to supply the demands of the stomach , which is laboring hard with all its muscles . When this motion ceases , and the digested food has gradually passed out , nature requires that the stomach should have a period of repose . And if another meal be eaten immediately after one is digested , the stomach is set to work again before it has had time to rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The general rule , then , is , that three hours be given to the stomach for labor , and two for rest ; and in obedience to this , five hours , at least , ought to elapse between every two regular meals . In cases where exercise produces a flow of perspiration , more food is needed to supply the loss ; and strong laboring men may safely eat as often as they feel the want of food . So , young and healthy children , who gambol and exercise ranch and whose bodies grow fast , may have a more frequent supply of food . But , as a general rule , meals should be five hours apart , and eating between meals avoided . There is nothing more unsafe , and wearing to the constitution , than a habit of eating at any time merely to gratify the palate . When a tempting article is presented , every person should exercise sufficient self-denial to wait till the proper time for eating arrives . Children , as well as grown persons , are often injured by eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not affording it any time for rest . In deciding as to quantity of food , there is one great difficulty to be met by a large portion of the community . The exercise of every part of the body is necessary to its health and perfection . The bones , the muscles , the nerves , the organs of digestion and respiration , and the skin , all demand exercise , in order properly to perform their functions . When the muscles of the body are called into action , all the blood-vessels entwined among them are frequently compressed . As the veins have valves so contrived that the blood can not run back , this compression hastens it forward toward the heart ; which is immediately put in quicker motion , to send it into the lungs ; and they , also , are thus stimulated to more rapid action , which is the cause of that panting which active exercise always occasions . The blood thus courses with greater celerity through the body , and sooner loses its nourishing properties . Then the stomach issues its mandate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished . Thus it appears , as a general rule , that the quantity of food actually needed by the body depends on the amount of muscular exercise taken . A laboring man , in the open fields , probably throws off from his skin and lungs a much larger amount than a person of sedentary pursuits . In consequence of this , he demands a greater amount of food and drink . Those persons who keep their bodies in a state of health by sufficient exercise can always be guided by the calls of hunger . They can eat when they feel hungry , and stop when hunger ceases ; and thus they will calculate exactly right . But the difficulty is , that a large part of the community , especially women , are so inactive in their habits that they seldom feel the calls of hunger . They habitually eat , merely to gratify the palate . This produces such a state of the system that they lose the guide which Nature has provided . They are not called to eat by hunger , nor admonished , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , such persons eat what pleases the palate , till they feel no more inclination for the article . It is probable that three fourths of the women in the wealthier circles sit down to each meal without any feeling of hunger , and eat merely on account of the gratification thus afforded them . Such persons find their appetite to depend almost solely upon the kind of food on the table . This is not the case with those who take the exercise which Nature demands . They approach their meals in such a state that almost any kind of food is acceptable . The question then arises , How are persons , who have lost the guide which Nature has provided , to determine as to the proper amount of food they shall take ? The best method is for several days to take their ordinary exercise and eat only one or two articles of simple food , such as bread and milk , or bread and butter with cooked fruit , or lean meat with bread and vegetables , and at the same time eat less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take just enough to satisfy the appetite , and on the third day notice the quantity which satisfies . After this , decide before eating that only this amount of simple food shall be taken . Persons who have a strong constitution , and take much exercise , may eat almost any thing with apparent impunity ; but young children who are forming their constitutions , and persons who are delicate , and who take but little exercise , are very dependent for health on a proper selection of food . It is found that there are some kinds of food which afford nutriment to the blood , and do not produce any other effect on the system . There are other kinds , which are not only nourishing , but stimulating , so that they quicken the functions of the organs on which they operate . The condiments used in cookery , such as pepper , mustard , and spices , are of this nature . There are certain states of the system when these stimulants may be beneficial ; such cases can only be pointed out by medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , never receive any benefit from such kind of food ; and just in proportion as condiments operate to quicken the labors of the internal organs , they tend to wear down their powers . A person who thus keeps the body working under an unnatural excitement , live faster than Nature designed , and the constitution is worn out just so much the sooner . A woman , therefore , should provide dishes for her family which are free from these stimulating condiments . It is also found , by experience , that the lean part of animal food is more stimulating than vegetable . This is the reason why , in cases of fevers or inflammations , medical men forbid the use of meat . A person who lives chiefly on animal food is under a higher degree of stimulus than if his food was chiefly composed of vegetable substances . His blood will flow faster , and all the functions of his body will be quickened . This makes it important to secure a proper proportion of animal and vegetable diet . Some medical men suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many individuals , to be fully sufficient to nourish the body ; and bring , as evidence , the fact that some of the strongest and most robust men in the world are those who are trained , from infancy , exclusively on vegetable food . From this they infer that life will be shortened just in proportion as the diet is changed to more stimulating articles ; and that , all other things being equal , children will have a better chance of health and long life if they are brought up solely on vegetable food . But , though this is not the common opinion of medical men , they all agree that , in America , far too large a portion of the diet consists of animal food . As a nation , the Americans are proverbial for the gross and luxurious diet with which they load their tables ; and there can be no doubt that the general health of the nation would be increased by a change in our customs in this respect . To take meat but once a day , and this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rule , the observance of which would probably greatly reduce the amount of fevers , eruptions , headaches , bilious attacks , and the many other ailments which are produced or aggravated by too gross a diet . The celebrated Roman physician , Baglivi , ( who , from practicing extensively among Roman Catholics , had ample opportunities to observe , ) mentions that , in Italy , an unusual number of people recover their health in the forty days of Lent , in consequence of the lower diet which is required as a religious duty . An American physician remarks , " For every reeling drunkard that disgraces our country , it contains one hundred gluttons  --  persons , I mean , who eat to excess , and suffer in consequence . " Another distinguished physician says , " I believe that every stomach , not actually impaired by organic disease , will perform its functions , if it receives reasonable attention ; and when we perceive the manner in which diet is generally conducted , both in regard to quantity and variety of articles of food and drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of being astonished at the prevalence of indigestion , our wonder must rather be that , in such circumstances , any stomach is capable of digesting at all . " In regard to articles which are the most easily digested , only general rules can be given . Tender meats are digested more readily than those which are tough , or than many kinds of vegetable food . The farinaceous articles , such as rice , flour , corn , potatoes , and the like , are the most nutritious , and most easily digested . The popular notion , that meat is more nourishing than bread , is a great mistake . Good bread contains more nourishment than butcher 's meat . The meat is more stimulating , and for this reason is more readily digested . A perfectly healthy stomach can digest almost any healthful food ; but when the digestive powers are weak , every stomach has its peculiarities , and what is good for one is hurtful to another . In such cases , experiment alone can decide which are the most digestible articles of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article after another , till he learns , by experience , which is the best for digestion . Much evil has been done , by assuming that the powers of one stomach are to be made the rule in regulating every other . The most unhealthful kinds of food are those which , are made so by bad cooking ; such as sour and heavy bread , cakes , pie-crust , and other dishes consisting of fat mixed and cooked with flour . Rancid butter and high-seasoned food are equally unwholesome . The fewer mixtures there are in cooking , the more healthful is the food likely to be . There is one caution as to the mode of eating which seems peculiarly needful to Americans . It is indispensable to good digestion , that food be well chewed and taken slowly . It needs to be thoroughly chewed and mixed with saliva , in order to prepare it for the action of the gastric juice , which , by the peristaltic motion , will be thus brought into contact with every one of the minute portions . It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and labor of the stomach for digestion than divided substances . It has also been found , that as each bolus , or mouthful , enters the stomach , the latter closes , until the portion received has had some time to move around and combine with the gastric juice , and that the orifice of the stomach resists the entrance of any more till this is accomplished . But , if the eater persists in swallowing fast , the stomach yields ; the food is then poured in more rapidly than the organ can perform its duty of preparative digestion ; and evil results are sooner or later developed . This exhibits the folly of those hasty meals , so common to travelers and to men of business , and shows why children should be taught to eat slowly . After taking a full meal , it is very important to health that no great bodily or mental exertion be made till the labor of the stomach is over . Intense mental effort draws the blood to the head , and muscular exertions draw it to the muscles ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply which it requires when performing its office . When the blood with its stimulating effects is thus withdrawn from the stomach , the adequate supply of gastric juice is not afforded , and indigestion is the result . The heaviness which follows a full meal is the indication which Nature gives of the need of quiet . When the meal is moderate , a sufficient quantity of gastric juice is exuded in an hour , or an hour and a half ; after which , labor of body and mind may safely be resumed . When undigested food remains in the stomach , and is at last thrown out into the bowels , it proves an irritating substance , producing an inflamed state in the lining of the stomach and other organs . It is found that the stomach has the power of gradually accommodating indigestive powers to the food it habitually receives . Thus , animals which live on vegetables can gradually become accustomed to animal food ; and the reverse is equally true . Thus , too , the human stomach can eventually accomplish the digestion of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indigestible . But any changes of this sort should be gradual ; as those which are sudden are trying to the powers of the stomach , by furnishing matter for which its gastric juice is not prepared . Extremes of heat or cold are injurious to the process of digestion . Taking hot food or drink , habitually , tends to debilitate all the organs thus needlessly excited . In using cold substances , it is found that a certain degree of warmth in the stomach is indispensable to their digestion ; so that , when the gastric juice is cooled below this temperature , it ceases to act . Indulging in large quantities of cold drinks , or eating ice-creams , after a meal , tends to reduce the temperature of the stomach , and thus to stop digestion . This shows the folly of those refreshments , in convivial meetings , where the guests are tempted to load the stomach with a variety such as would require the stomach of a stout farmer to digest ; and then to wind up with ice-creams , thus lessening whatever ability might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fittest temperature for drinks , if taken when the food is in the digesting process , is blood heat . Cool drinks , and even ice , can be safely taken at other times , if not in excessive quantity . When the thirst is excessive , or the body weakened by fatigue , or when in a state of perspiration , large quantities of cold drinks are injurious . Fluids taken into the stomach are not subject to the slow process of digestion , but are immediately absorbed and carried into the blood . This is the reason why liquid nourishment , more speedily than solid food , restores from exhaustion . The minute vessels of the stomach absorb its fluids , which are carried into the blood , just as the minute extremities of the arteries open upon the inner surface of the stomach , and there exude the gastric juice from the blood . When food is chiefly liquid , ( soup , for example , ) the fluid part is rapidly absorbed . The solid parts remain , to be acted on by the gastric juice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual here referred to  --  Alexis St. Martin  --  was a young Canadian , eighteen years of age , of a good constitution and robust health , who , in 1822 , was accidentally wounded by the discharge of a musket which : carried away a part of the ribs , lacerated one of two lobes of the lungs , and perforated the stomach , making a large aperture , which never closed ; and which enabled Dr. Beaumont ( a surgeon of the American army , stationed at Michilimackanac , under whose care the patient was placed ) to witness all the processes of digestion and other functions of the body for several years. in fifty minutes after taking soup , the fluids were absorbed , and the remainder was even thicker than is usual after eating solid food . This is the reason why soups are deemed bad for weak stomachs ; as this residuum is more difficult of digestion than ordinary food . Highly-concentrated food , having much nourishment in a small bulk , is not favorable to digestion , because it can not be properly acted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so minutely divided as to enable the gastric juice to act properly . This is the reason why a certain bulk of food is needful to good digestion ; and why those people who live on whale-oil and other highly nourishing food , in cold climates , mix vegetables and even sawdust with it to make it more acceptable and digestible . So in civilized lands , fruits and vegetables are mixed with more highly concentrated nourishment . For this reason also , soups , jellies , and arrow-root should have bread or crackers mixed with them . This affords another reason why coarse bread , of unbolted wheat , so often proves beneficial . Where , from inactive habits or other causes , the bowels become constipated and sluggish , this kind of food proves the appropriate remedy . One fact on this subject is worthy of notice . In England , under the administration of William Pitt , for two years or more there was such a scarcity of wheat that , to make it hold out longer , Parliament passed a law that the army should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , that the health of the soldiers improved so much as to be a subject of surprise to themselves , the officers , and the physicians . These last came out publicly and declared that the soldiers never before were so robust and healthy ; and that disease had nearly disappeared from the army . The civic physicians joined and pronounced it the healthiest bread ; and for a time schools , families , and public institutions used it almost exclusively . Even the nobility , convinced by these facts , adopted it for their common diet , and the fashion continued a long time after the scarcity ceased , until more luxurious habits resumed their sway . We thus see why children should not have cakes and candies allowed them between meals . Besides being largely carbonaceous , these are highly concentrated nourishments , and should be eaten with more bulky and less nourishing substances . The most indigestible of all kinds of food are fatty and oily substances , if heated . It is on this account that pie-crust and articles boiled and fried in fat or butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following , then , may be put down as the causes of a debilitated constitution from the misuse of food . Eating too much , eating too often , eating too fast , eating food and condiments that are too stimulating , eating food that is too warm or too cold , eating food that is highly concentrated , without a proper admixture of less nourishing matter , and eating hot food that is difficult of digestion . X. HEALTHFUL DRINKS . There is no direction in which a woman more needs both scientific knowledge and moral force than in using her influence to control her family in regard to stimulating beverages . It is a point fully established by experience that the full development of the human body and the vigorous exercise of all its functions can be secured without the use of stimulating drinks . It is , therefore , perfectly safe to bring up children never to use them , no hazard being incurred by such a course . It is also found by experience that there are two evils incurred by the use of stimulating drinks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . Their peculiarity consists in so exciting the nervous system that all the functions of the body are accelerated , and the fluids are caused to move quicker than at their natural speed . This increased motion of the animal fluids always produces an agreeable effect on the mind . The intellect is invigorated , the imagination is excited , the spirits are enlivened ; and these effects are so agreeable that all mankind , after having once experienced them , feel a great desire for their repetition . But this temporary invigoration of the system is always followed by a diminution of the powers of the stimulated organs ; so that , though in all cases this reaction may not be perceptible , it is invariably the result . It may be set down as the unchangeable rule of physiology , that stimulating drinks deduct from the powers of the constitution in exactly the proportion in which they operate to produce temporary invigoration . The second evil is the temptation which always attends the use of stimulants . Their effect on the system is so agreeable , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a constant tendency to increase such excitement both in frequency and power . And the more the system is thus reduced in strength , the more craving is the desire for that which imparts a temporary invigoration . This process of increasing debility and increasing craving for the stimulus that removes it , often goes to such an extreme that the passion is perfectly uncontrollable , and mind and body perish under this baleful habit . In this country there are three forms in which the use of such stimulants is common ; namely , alcoholic drinks , opium mixtures , and tobacco . These are all alike in the main peculiarity of imparting that extra stimulus to the system which tends to exhaust its powers . Multitudes in this nation are in the habitual use of some one of these stimulants ; and each person defends the indulgence by certain arguments : First , that the desire for stimulants is a natural propensity implanted in man 's nature , as is manifest from the universal tendency to such indulgences in every nation . From this , it is inferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gratified to some extent , and that the aim should be to keep it within the limits of temperance , instead of attempting to exterminate a natural propensity . This is an argument which , if true , makes it equally proper for not only men , but women and children , to use opium , brandy , or tobacco as stimulating principles , provided they are used temperately . But if it be granted that perfect health and strength can be gained and secured without these stimulants , and that their peculiar effect is to diminish the power of the system in exactly the same proportion as they stimulate it , then there is no such thing as a temperate use , unless they are so diluted as to destroy any stimulating power ; and in this form they are seldom desired . The other argument for their use is , that they are among the good things provided by the Creator for our gratification ; that , like all other blessings , they are exposed to abuse and excess ; and that we should rather seek to regulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is based on the assumption that they are , like healthful foods and drinks , necessary to life and health , and injurious only by excess . But this is not true ; for whenever they are used in any such strength as to be a gratification , they operate to a greater or less extent as stimulants ; and to just such extent they wear out the powers of the constitution ; and it is abundantly proved that they are not , like food and drink , necessary to health . Such articles are designed for medicine and not for common use . There can be no argument framed to defend the use of one of them which will not justify women and children in most dangerous indulgences . There are some facts recently revealed by the microscope in regard to alcoholic drinks , which every woman should understand and regard . It has been shown in a previous chapter that every act of mind , either by thought , feeling , or choice , causes the destruction of certain cells in the brain and nerves . It now is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer is indebted to Maudsley , a recent writer on Microscopic Physiology. that the kind of nutrition furnished to the brain by the blood to a certain extent decides future feelings , thoughts , and volitions . The cells of the brain not only abstract from the blood the healthful nutrition , but also are affected in shape , size , color , and action by unsuitable elements in the blood . This is especially the case when alcohol is taken into the stomach , from whence it is always carried to the brain . The consequence is , that it affects the nature and action of the brain-cells , until a habit is formed which is automatic ; that is , the mind loses the power of controlling the brain , in its development of thoughts , feelings , and choices as it would in the natural state , and is itself controlled by the brain . In this condition a real disease of the brain is created , called oino-mania , ( see Glossary , ) and the only remedy is total abstinence , and that for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the danger more fearful is , that the brain-cells never are so renewed but that this pernicious stimulus will bring back the disease in full force , so that a man once subject to it is never safe except by maintaining perpetual and total abstinence from every kind of alcoholic drink . Dr. Day , who for many years has had charge of an inebriate asylum , states that he witnessed the dissection of the brain of a man once an inebriate , but for many years in practice of total abstinence , and found its cells still in the weak and unnatural state produced by earlier indulgences . There has unfortunately been a difference of opinion among medical men as to the use of alcohol . Liebig , the celebrated writer on animal chemistry , having found that both sugar and alcohol were heat-producing articles of food , framed a theory that alcohol is burnt in the lungs , giving off carbonic acid and water , and thus serving to warm the body . But modern science has proved that it is in the capillaries that animal heat is generated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing the power of the body to bear the cold . Sir John Koss , in his Arctic voyage , proved by his own experience and that of his men that cold-water drinkers could bear cold longer and were stronger than any who used alcohol . Carpenter , a standard writer on physiology , says the objection to a habitual use of even small quantities of alcoholic drinks is , that " they are universally admitted to possess a poisonous character , " and " tend to produce a morbid condition of body ; " while " the capacity for enduring extremes of heat and cold , or of mental or bodily labor , is diminished rather than increased by their habitual employment . " Prof. J. Bigelow , of Harvard University , says , " Alcohol is highly stimulating , heating , and intoxicating , and its effects are so fascinating that when once experienced there is danger that the desire for them may be perpetuated . " Dr. Bell and Dr. Churchill , both high medical authorities , especially in lung disease , for which whisky is often recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcoholic liquors have influence in preventing the deposition of tubercle is destitute of any foundation ; on the contrary , their use predisposes to tubercular deposition . " And " where tubercle exists , alcohol has no effect in modifying the usual course , neither does it modify the morbid effects on the system . " Prof. Youmans , of New-York , says : " It has been demonstrated that alcoholic drinks prevent the natural changes in the blood , and obstruct the nutritive and reparative functions . " He adds , " Chemical experiments have demonstrated that the action of alcohol on the digestive fluid is to destroy its active principle , the pepsin , thus confirming the observations of physiologists , that its use gives rise to serious disorders of the stomach and malignant aberration of the whole economy . " We are now prepared to consider the great principles of science , common sense , and religion , which should guide every woman who has any kind of influence or responsibility on this subject . It is allowed by all medical men that pure water is perfectly healthful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also that by proper means , which ordinarily are in the reach of all , water can be made sufficiently pure . It is allowed by all that milk , and the juices of fruits , when taken into the stomach , furnish water that is always pure , and that our bread and vegetable food also supply it in large quantities . There are besides a great variety of agreeable and healthful beverages , made from the juices of fruit , containing no alcohol , and agreeable drinks , such as milk , cocoa , and chocolate , that contain no stimulating principles , and which are nourishing and healthful . As one course , then , is perfectly safe and another involves great danger , it is wrong and sinful to choose the path of danger . There is no peril in drinking pure water , milk , the juices of fruits , and infusions that are nourishing and harmless . But there is great danger to the young , and to the commonwealth , in patronizing the sale and use of alcoholic drinks . The religion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the good of others , especially for the weaker members of society . It is on this principle that St. Paul sets forth his own example , " If meat make my brother to offend , I will eat no flesh while the world standeth , lest I make my brother to offend . " And again he teaches , " We , then , that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak , and not to please ourselves . " This Christian principle also applies to the common drinks of the family , tea and coffee . It has been shown that the great end for which Jesus Christ came , and for which he instituted the family state , is the training of our whole race to virtue and happiness , with chief reference to an immortal existence . In this mission , of which woman is chief minister , as before stated , the distinctive feature is self-sacrifice of the wiser and stronger members to save and to elevate the weaker ones . The children and the servants are these weaker members , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most danger . It is in this aspect that we are to consider the expediency of using tea and coffee in a family . These drinks are a most extensive cause of much of the nervous debility and suffering endured by American women ; and relinquishing them , would save an immense amount of such suffering . Moreover , all housekeepers will allow that they can not regulate these drinks in their kitchens , where the ignorant use them to excess . There is little probability that the present generation will make so decided a change in their habits as to give up these beverages ; but the subject is presented rather in reference to forming the habits of children . It is a fact that tea and coffee are at first seldom or never agreeable to children . It is the mixture of milk , sugar , and water , that reconciles them to a taste , which in this manner gradually becomes agreeable . Now suppose that those who provide for a family conclude that it is not their duty to give up entirely the use of stimulating drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching their children to love such drinks ? Let the matter be regarded thus : The experiments of physiologists all prove that stimulants are not needful to health , and that , as the general rule , they tend to debilitate the constitution . Is it right , then , for a parent to tempt a child to drink what is not needful , when there is a probability that it will prove , to some extent , an undermining drain on the constitution ? Some constitutions can bear much less excitement than others ; and in every family of children , there is usually one or more of delicate organization , and consequently peculiarly exposed to dangers from this source . It is this child who ordinarily becomes the victim to stimulating drinks . The tea and coffee which the parents and the healthier children can use without immediate injury , gradually sap the energies of the feebler child , who proves either an early victim or a living martyr to all the sufferings that debilitated nerves inflict . Can it be right to lead children where all allow that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease and death are met , when , another path is known to be perfectly safe ? The impression common in this country , that warm drinks , especially in winter , are more healthful than cold , is not warranted by any experience , nor by the laws of the physical system . At dinner , cold drinks are universal , and no one deems them injurious . It is only at the other two meals that they are supposed to be hurtful . There is no doubt that warm drinks are healthful , and more agreeable than cold , at certain times and seasons ; but it is equally true that drinks above blood-heat are not healthful . If a person should bathe in warm water every day , debility would inevitably follow ; for the frequent application of the stimulus of heat , like all other stimulants , eventually causes relaxation and weakness . If , therefore , a person is in the habit of drinking hot drinks twice a day , the teeth , throat , and stomach are gradually debilitated . This , most probably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teeth , which is observed to be much more common among American ladies , than among those in European countries . It has been stated to the writer , by an intelligent traveler who had visited Mexico , that it was rare to meet an individual with even a tolerable set of teeth , and that almost every grown person he met in the street had merely remnants of teeth . On inquiry into the customs of the country , it was found that it was the universal practice to take their usual beverage at almost the boiling-point ; and this doubtless was the chief cause of the almost entire want of teeth in that country . In the United States , it can not be doubted that much evil is done in this way by hot drinks . Most tea-drinkers consider tea as ruined if it stands until it reaches the healthful temperature for drink . The following extract , from Dr. Andrew Combe , presents the opinion of most intelligent medical men on this subject . Footnote : The writer would here remark , in reference to extracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abridging , she has often left out parts of a paragraph , but never so as to modify the meaning of the author . Some ideas , not connected with the subject in hand , are omitted , but none are altered . " Water is a safe drink for all constitutions , provided it be resorted to in obedience to the dictates of natural thirst only , and not of habit . Unless the desire for it is felt , there is no occasion for its use during a meal . " " The primary effect of all distilled and fermented liquors is to stimulate the nervous system and quicken the circulation . In infancy and childhood , the circulation is rapid and easily excited ; and the nervous system is strongly acted upon even by the slightest external impressions . Hence , slight causes of irritation readily excite febrile and convulsive disorders . In youth , the natural tendency of the constitution is still to excitement , and consequently , as a general rule , the stimulus of fermented liquors is injurious . " These remarks show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to themselves , may mistake in inferring from this that they will not be injurious to their children . Dr. Combe continues thus : " In mature age , when digestion is good , and the system in full vigor , if the mode of life be not too exhausting , the nervous functions and general circulation are in their best condition , and require no stimulus for their support . The bodily energy is then easily sustained by nutritious food and a regular regimen , and consequently artificial excitement only increases the wasting of the natural strength . " It may be asked , in this connection , why the stimulus of animal food is not to be regarded in the same light as that of stimulating drinks . In reply , a very essential difference may he pointed out . Animal food furnishes nutriment to the organs which it stimulates , but stimulating drinks excite the organs to quickened action without affording any nourishment . It has been supposed by some that tea and coffee have , at least , a degree of nourishing power . But it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the main portion of the drink , which imparts the nourishment . Tea has not one particle of nourishing properties ; and what little exists in the coffee-berry is lost by roasting it in the usual mode . All that these articles do , is simply to stimulate without nourishing . Although there is little hope of banishing these drinks , there is still a chance that something may be gained in attempts to regulate their use by the rules of temperance . If , then , a housekeeper can not banish tea and coffee entirely , she may use her influence to prevent excess , both by her instructions , and by the power of control committed more or less to her hands . It is important for every housekeeper to know that the health of a family very much depends on the purity of water used for cooking and drinking . There are three causes of impure and unhealthful water . One is , the existence in it of vegetable or animal matter , which can be remedied by filtering through sand and charcoal . Another cause is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries , producing diseases of the bladder . This is remedied in a measure by boiling , which secures a deposit of the lime on the vessel used . The third cause is , the corroding of zinc and lead used in pipes and reservoirs , producing oxides that are slow poisons . The only remedy is prevention , by having supply-pipes made of iron , like gas-pipe , instead of zinc and lead ; or the lately invented lead pipe lined with tin , which metal is not corrosive . The obstacle to this is , that the trade of the plumbers would be greatly diminished by the use of reliable pipes . When water must be used from supply-pipes of lead or zinc , it is well to let the water run some time before drinking it and to use as little as possible , taking milk instead ; and being further satisfied for inner necessities by the water supplied by fruits and vegetables . The water in these is always pure . But in using milk as a drink , it must be remembered that it is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken when milk is thus used , or bilious troubles will result from excess of food . The use of opium , especially by women , is usually caused at first by medical prescriptions containing it . All that has been stated as to the effect of alcohol in the brain is true of opium ; while , to break a habit thus induced is almost hopeless , Every woman who takes or who administers this drug , is dealing as with poisoned arrows , whose wounds are without cure . The use of tobacco in this country , and especially among young boys , is increasing at a fearful rate . On this subject , we have the unanimous opinion of all medical men ; the following being specimens . A distinguished medical writer thus states the case : " Every physician knows that the agreeable sensations that tempt to the use of tobacco are caused by nicotine , which is a rank poison , as much so as prussic acid or arsenic . When smoked , the poison is absorbed by the blood of the mouth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes to the blood through the mouth and stomach . In both cases , the whole nervous system is thrown , into abnormal excitement to expel the poison , and it is this excitement that causes agreeable sensations . The excitement thus caused is invariably followed by a diminution of nervous power , in exact proportion to the preceding excitement to expel the evil from the system . " Few will dispute the general truth and effect of the above statement , so that the question is one to be settled on the same principle as applies to the use of alcoholic drinks . Is it , then , according to the generous principles of Christ 's religion , for those who are strong and able to bear this poison , to tempt the young , the ignorant , and the weak to a practice not needful to any healthful enjoyment , and which leads multitudes to disease , and often to vice ? For the use of tobacco tends always to lessen nerve-power , and probably every one out of five that indulges in its use awakens a morbid craving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminishes the strength of the constitution , and sets an example that influences the weak to the path of danger and of frequent ruin . The great danger of this age is an increasing , intense worldliness , and disbelief in the foundation principle of the religion of Christ , that we are to reap through everlasting ages the consequences of habits formed in this life . In the light of his word , they only who are truly wise " shall shine as the firmament , and they that turn many to righteousness , as the stars , forever and ever . " It is increased faith or belief in the teachings of Christ 's religion , as to the influence of this life upon the life to come , which alone can save our country and the world from that inrushing tide of sensualism and worldliness , now seeming to threaten the best hopes and prospects of our race . And woman , as the chief educator of our race , and the prime minister of the family state , is bound in the use of meats and drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christ in forming habits of temperance and benevolent self-sacrifice for the good of others . XI . CLEANLINESS . Both the health and comfort of a family depend , to a great extent , on cleanliness of the person and the family surroundings . True cleanliness of person involves the scientific treatment of the skin . This is the most complicated organ of the body , and one through which the health is affected more than through any other ; and no persons can or will he be so likely to take proper care of it as those by whom its construction and functions are understood . Illustration : Fig. 57 . Fig. 57 is a very highly magnified portion of the skin . The layer marked 1 is the outside , very thin skin , called the cuticle or scarf skin . This consists of transparent layers of minute cells , which are constantly decaying and being renewed , and the white scurf that passes from the skin to the clothing is a decayed portion of these cells . This part of the skin has neither nerves nor blood-vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 , is that portion of the true skin which gives the external color marking diverse races . In the portion of the dark layer marked 3 , 4 , is seen a network of nerves which run from two branches of the nervous trunks coming from the spinal marrow . These arc nerves of sensation , by which the sense of touch or feeling is performed . Fig. 58 represents the blood-vessels , ( intermingled with the nerves of the skin , ) which divide into minute capillaries that act like the capillaries of the lungs , taking oxygen from the air , and giving out carbonic acid . At a , and b are seen the roots of two hairs , which abound in certain parts of the skin , and are nourished by the blood of the capillaries . Illustration : Fig. 58 . Illustration : Fig. 59 . At Fig. 59 is a magnified view of another set of vessels , called the lymphatics or absorbents . These are extremely minute vessels that interlace with the nerves and blood-vessels of the skin . Their office is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , and carry it to certain reservoirs , from which it passes into some of the large veins , to be thrown out through the lungs , bowels , kidneys , or skin . These absorbent or lymphatic ; vessels have mouths opening on the surface of the true skin , and , though covered by the cuticle , they can absorb both liquids and solids that are placed in close contact with the skin . In proof of this , one of the main trunks of the lymphatics in the hand can be cut off from all communication with other portions , and tied up : and if the hand is immersed in milk a given time , it will be found that the milk has been , absorbed through the cuticle and fills the lymphatics . In this way , long-continued blisters on the skin will introduce the blistering matter into the blood through the absorbents , and then the kidneys will take it up from the blood passing through them to carry it out of the body , and thus become irritated and inflamed by it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the skin , that draw off oil from the blood . This issues on the surface and spreads over the cuticle to keep it soft and moist . But the most curious part of the skin is the system of innumerable minute perspiration-tubes . Fig. 60 is a drawing of one very greatly magnified . These tubes open on the cuticle , and the openings are called pores of the skin . They descend into the true skin , and there form a coil , as is seen in the drawing . These tubes are hollow , like a pipe-stem , and their inner surface consists of wonderfully minute capillaries filled with the impure venous blood . And in these small tubes the same process is going on as takes places when the carbonic acid and water of the blood are exhaled from the lungs . The capillaries of these tubes through the whole skin of the body are thus constantly exhaling the noxious and decayed particles of the body , just as the lungs pour them out through the mouth and nose . It has been shown that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The number and extent of these tubes are astonishing . In a square inch on the palm of the hand have been counted , through a microscope , thirty-five hundred of these tubes . Each one of them is about a quarter of an inch in length , including its coils . This makes the united lengths of these little tubes to be seventy-three feet to a square inch . Their united length , over the whole body is thus calculated to be equal to twenty-eight miles . What a wonderful apparatus this ! And what mischiefs must ensue when the drainage from the body of such an extent as this becomes obstructed ! But the inside of the body also has a skin , as have all its organs . The interior of the head , the throat , the gullet , the lungs , the stomach , and all the intestines , are lined with a skin . This is called the mucous membrane , because it is constantly secreting from the blood a slimy substance called mucus . When it accumulates in the lungs , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood-vessels , and lymphatics . The outer skin joins to the inner at the month , the nose , and other openings of the body , and there is a constant sympathy between the two skins , and thus between the inner organs and the surface of the body . SECRETING ORGANS . Those vessels of the body which draw off certain portions of the blood and change it into a new form , to be employed for service or to be thrown out of the body , are called secreting organs . The skin in this sense is a secreting organ , as its perspiration-tubes secrete or separate the bad portions of the blood , and send them off . Of the internal secreting organs , the liver is the largest . Its chief office is to secrete from the blood all matter not properly supplied with oxygen . For this purpose , a set of veins carries the blood of all the lower intestines to the liver , where the imperfectly oxidized matter is drawn off in the form of bile , and accumulated in a reservoir called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller intestines receive the food from the stomach , and there it mixes with this food . Then it passes through the long intestines , and is thrown out of the body through the rectum . This shows how it is , that want of pure and cool air and exercise causes excess of bile , from lack of oxygen . The liver also has arterial blood sent to nourish it , and corresponding veins to return this blood to the heart . So there are two sets of blood-vessels for the liver  --  one to secrete the bile , and the other to nourish the organ itself . The kidneys secrete from the arteries that pass , through them all excess of water in the blood , and certain injurious substances . These are carried through small tubes to the bladder , and thence thrown out of the body . The pancreas , a whitish gland , situated in the abdomen below the stomach , secretes from the arteries that pass through it the pancreatic juice , which unites with the bile from the liver , in preparing the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the eyes that secrete the tears , and others near the mouth that secrete the saliva , or spittle . These organs all have arteries sent to them to nourish them , and also veins to carry away the impure blood . At the same time , they secrete from the arterial blood the peculiar fluid which it is their office to supply . All the food that passes through the lower intestines which is not drawn off by the lacteals or by some of these secreting organs , passes from the body through a passage called the rectum . Learned men have made very curious experiments ; to ascertain how much the several organs throw out of the body , It is found that the skin throws off five out of eight pounds of the food and drink , or probably about three or four pounds a day . The lungs throw off one quarter as much as the skin , or about a pound a day . The remainder is carried off by the kidneys and lower intestines . There is such a sympathy and connection between all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them is unable to work , the others perform the office of the feeble one . Thus , if the skin has its perspiration-tubes closed up by a chill , then all the poisonous matter that would have been thrown out through them must be emptied out either by the lungs , kidneys , or bowels . When all these organs are strong and healthy , they can bear this increased labor without injury . But if the lungs are weak , the blood sent from the skin by the chill engorges the weak blood-vessels , and produces an inflammation of the lungs . Or it increases the discharge of a slimy mucous substance , that exudes from the skin of the lungs . This fills up the air-vessels , and would very soon end life , were it not for the spasms of the lungs , called coughing , which throw off this substance . If , on the other hand , the bowels are weak , a chill of the skin sends the blood into all the blood-vessels of the intestines , and produces inflammation there , or else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called a diarrhea . Or if the kidneys are weak , there is an increased secretion and discharge from them , to an unhealthy and injurious extent . This connection between the skin and internal organs is shown , not only by the internal effects of a chill on the skin ; but by the sympathetic effect on the skin when these internal organs suffer . For example , there are some kinds of food that will irritate and influence the stomach or the bowels ; and this , by sympathy , will produce an immediate eruption on the skin . Some persons , on eating strawberries , will immediately be affected with a nettle-rash . Others can not eat certain shell-fish without being affected in this way . Many humors on the face are caused by a diseased state of the internal organs with which the skin sympathizes . This short account of the construction of the skin , and of its intimate connection with the internal organs , shows the philosophy of those modes of medical treatment that are addressed to this portion of the body . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by moisture and heat , they stimulate all the innumerable perspiration-tubes and lymphatics to force out from the body a flood of unnaturally excited secretions ; while it is " kill or cure , " just as the chance may meet or oppose the demands of the case . It is the skin also that is the chief basis of medical treatment in the Water Cure , whose slow processes are as much safer as they are slower . At the same time it is the ill-treatment or neglect of the skin which , probably , is the cause of disease and decay to an incredible extent . The various particulars in which this may be seen will now be pointed out . In the management and care of this wonderful and complex part of the body , many mistakes have been made . The most common one is the misuse of the bath , especially since cold water cures have come into use . This mode of medical treatment originated with an ignorant peasant , amid a population where outdoor labor had strengthened nerves and muscles and imparted rugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then introduced into England and America without due consideration or knowledge of the diseases habits , or real condition of patients , especially of women . The consequence was a mode of treatment too severe and exhausting ; and many practices were spread abroad not warranted by true medical science . But in spite of these mistakes and abuses , the treatment of the skin for disease by the use of cold water has become an accepted doctrine of the most learned medical practitioners . It is now held by all such that fevers can be detected in their distinctive features by the thermometer , and that all fevers can be reduced by cold baths and packing in the wet sheet , in the mode employed in all water-cures . Directions for using this method will be given in another place . It has been supposed that large bath-tubs for immersing the whole person are indispensable to the proper cleaning of the skin . This is not so . A wet towel , applied every morning to the skin , followed by friction in pure air , is all that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury . Access of air to every part of the skin when its perspiratory tubes are cleared and its blood-vessels are filled by friction is the best ordinary bath . In early life , children should be washed all over , every night or morning , to remove impurities from the skin . But in this process , careful regard should be paid to the peculiar constitution of a child . Very nervous children sometimes revolt from cold water , and like a tepid bath . Others prefer a cold bath ; and nature should be the guide . It must be remembered that the skin is the great organ of sensation , and in close connection with brain , spine , and nerve-centres : so that what a strong nervous system can bear with advantage is too powerful and exhausting for another . As age advances , or as disease debilitates the body , great care should be taken not to overtax the nervous system by sudden shocks , or to diminish its powers by withdrawing animal heat to excess . Persons lacking robustness should bathe or use friction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expose only a portion of the body at once to cold air . Johnson , a celebrated writer on agricultural chemistry , tells of an experiment by friction on the skin of pigs , whose skins are like that of the human race . He treated six of these animals with a curry-comb seven weeks , and left three other pigs untouched . The result was a gain of thirty-three pounds more of weight , with the use of five bushels less of food for those curried , than for the neglected ones . This result was owing to the fact that all the functions of the body were more perfectly performed when , by friction , the skin was kept free from filth and the blood in it exposed to the air . The same will be true of the human skin . A calculation has been made on this fact , by which it is estimated that a man , by proper care of his skin , would save over thirty-one dollars in food yearly , which is the interest on over five hundred dollars . If men will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they give to currying a horse , they will gain both health and wealth . XII . CLOTHING . There is no duty of those persons having control of a family where principle and practice are more at variance than in regulating the dress of young girls , especially at the most important and critical period of life . It is a difficult duty for parents and teachers to contend with the power of fashion , which at this time of a young girl 's life is frequently the ruling thought , and when to be out of the fashion , to be odd and not dress as all her companions do , is a mortification and grief that no argument or instructions can relieve . The mother is often so overborne that , in spite of her better wishes , the daughter adopts modes of dress alike ruinous to health and to beauty . The greatest protection against such an emergency is to train a child to understand the construction of her own body and to impress upon her , in early days , her obligations to the invisible Friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her body and the Father of her spirit , " who has committed to her care so precious and beautiful a casket . And the more she can be made to realize the skill and beauty of construction shown in her earthly frame , the more will she feel the obligation to protect it from injury and abuse . It is a singular fact that the war of fashion has attacked most fatally what seems to be the strongest foundation , and defense of the body , the bones . For this reason , the construction and functions of this part of the body will now receive attention . The bones are composed of two substances , one animal , and the other mineral . The animal part is a very fine network , called cellular membrane . In this are deposited the harder mineral substances , which are composed principally of carbonate and phosphate of lime . In very early life , the bones consist chiefly of the animal part , and are then soft and pliant . As the child advances in age , the bones grow harder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is supplied by the food , and carried to the bones by the blood . In old age , the hardest material preponderates ; malting the bones more brittle than in earlier life . The bones are covered with a thin skin or membrane , filled with small blood-vessels which convey nourishment to them , Where the hones unite with others to form joints , they are covered with cartilage , which is a smooth , white , elastic substance . This enables the joints to move smoothly , while its elasticity prevents injuries from sudden jars . The joints are bound together by strong , elastic bands called ligaments , which hold them firmly and prevent dislocation . Between the ends of the bones that unite to form joints are small sacks or bags , that contain a soft lubricating fluid . This answers the same purpose fur the joints as oil in making machinery work smoothly , while the supply is constant and always in exact proportion to the demand . If you will examine the leg of some fowl , you can see the cartilage that covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strong white ligaments that bind the joints together . The health , of the bones depends on the proper nourishment and exercise of the body as much as that of any other part . When a child is feeble and unhealthy , or when it grows up without exercise , the bones do not become firm and hard as they are when the body is healthfully developed by exercise . The size as well as the strength of the bones , to a certain extent , also depend upon exercise and good health . Illustration : Fig. 61 The chief supporter of the body is the spine , which consists of twenty-four small bones , interlocked or hooked into each other , while between them are elastic cushions of cartilage which aid in preserving the upright , natural position . Fig. 61 shows three of the spinal bones , hooked into each other , the dark spaces showing the disks or flat circular plates of cartilage between them . The spine is held in its proper position , partly by the ribs , partly by muscles , partly by aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packing of the intestines in front of it . The upper part of the spine is often thrown out of its proper position by constant stooping of the head over books or work . This affects the elastic disks so that they grow thick at the back side and thinner at the front side by such constant pressure . The result is the awkward projection of the head forward which is often seen in schools and colleges . Another distortion of the spine is produced by tight dress around the waist . The liver occupies the right side of the body and is a solid mass , while on the other side is the larger part of the stomach , which is often empty . The consequence of tight dress around the waist is a constant pressure of the spine toward the unsupported part where the stomach lies . Thus the elastic dials again are compressed ; till they become thinner on one side than the other , and harden into that condition . This produces what is called the lateral curvature of the spine , making one shoulder higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waist is especially dangerous at the time young girls first enter society and are tempted to dress according to the fashion . Many a school-girl , whose waist was originally of a proper and healthful size , has gradually pressed the soft bones of youth until the lower ribs that should rise and fall with every breath , become entirely unused . Then the abdominal breathing , performed by the lower part of the lungs , ceases ; the whole system becomes reduced in strength ; the abdominal muscles that hold up the interior organs become weak , and the upper ones gradually sink upon the lower . This pressure of the upper interior organs upon the lower ones , by tight dress , is increased by the weight of clothing resting on the hips and abdomen . Corsets , as usually worn , have no support from the shoulders , and consequently all the weight of dress resting upon or above them presses upon the hips and abdomen , and this in such a way as to throw out of use and thus weaken the most important supporting muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diaphragm is a kind of muscular floor , extending across the centre of the body , on which the heart and lungs rest . Beneath it are the liver , stomach , and the abdominal viscera , or intestines , which are supported by the abdominal muscles , running upward , downward , and crosswise . When these muscles are thrown out of use , they lose their power , the whole system of organs mainly resting on them for support can not continue in their naturally snug , compact , and rounded form , but become separated , elongated , and unsupported . The stomach begins to draw from above instead of resting on the viscera beneath . This in some cases causes dull and wandering pains , a sense of pulling at the centre of the chest , and a drawing downward at the pit of the stomach . Then as the support beneath is really gone , there is what is often called " a feeling of goneness . " This is sometimes relieved by food , which , so long as it remains in a solid form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displacement of the stomach , liver , and spleen interrupts their healthful functions , and dyspepsia and biliary difficulties not unfrequently are the result . As the stomach and its appendages fall downward , the diaphragm , which holds up the heart and lungs , must descend also . In this state of things , the inflation of the lungs is less and less aided by the abdominal muscles , and is confined chiefly to their upper portion . Breathing sometimes thus becomes quicker and shorter on account of the elongated or debilitated condition of the assisting organs . Consumption not unfrequently results from this cause . The heart also feels the evil . " Palpitations , " " flutterings , " " sinking feelings , " all show that , in the language of Scripture , " the heart trembleth , and is moved out of its place . " But the lower intestines are the greatest sufferers from this dreadful abuse of nature . Having the weight of all the unsupported organs above pressing them into unnatural and distorted positions , the passage of the food is interrupted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent result . Dreadful ulcers and cancers may be traced in some instances to this cause . Although these internal displacements are most common among women , some foolish members of the other sex are adopting customs of dress , in girding the central portion of the body , that tend to similar results . But this distortion brings upon woman peculiar distresses . The pressure of the whole superincumbent mass on the pelvic or lower organs induces sufferings proportioned in acuteness to the extreme delicacy and sensitiveness of the parts thus crushed . And the intimate connection of these organs with the brain and whole nervous system renders injuries thus inflicted the causes of the most extreme anguish , both of body and mind . This evil is becoming so common , not only among married women , but among young girls , as to be a just cause for universal alarm . How very common these sufferings are , few but the medical profession can realize , because they are troubles that must be concealed . Many a woman is moving about in uncomplaining agony who , with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed surrounded by sympathizing friends . The terrible sufferings that are sometimes thus induced can never be conceived of , or at all appreciated from , any use of language . Nothing that the public can be made to believe on this subject will ever equal the reality . Not only mature persons and mothers , but fair young girls sometimes , are shut up for months and years as helpless and suffering invalids from this cause . This may be found all over the land . And there frequently is a horrible extremity of suffering in certain forms of this evil , which no woman of feeble constitution can ever be certain may not be her doom . Not that in all cases this extremity is involved , but none can say who will escape it . In regard to this , if one must choose for a friend or a child , on the one hand , the horrible torments inflicted by savage Indians or cruel inquisitors on their victims , or , on the other , the protracted agonies that result from such deformities and displacements , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the fate that is coming to meet the young as well as the mature in every direction . And tender parents are unconsciously leading their lovely and hapless daughters to this awful doom . There is no excitement of the imagination in what is here indicated . If the facts and details could be presented , they would send a groan of terror all over the land . For it is not one class , or one section , that is endangered . In every part of our country the evil is progressing . And , as if these dreadful ills were not enough , there have been added methods of medical treatment at once useless , torturing to the mind , and involving great liability to immoralities . Illustration : Fig. 62 . In hope of abating these evils , drawings are given ( Fig. 62 and Fig. 63 ) of the front and back of a jacket that will preserve the advantages of the corset without its evils . This jacket may at first be fitted to the figure with corsets underneath it , just like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used to stiffen the jacket , so that it will take the proper shape , when the corset may be dispensed with . The buttons below are to hold all articles of dress below the waist by button-holes . By this method , the bust is supported as well as by corsets , while the shoulders support from above , as they should do , the weight of the dress below . No stiff bone should be allowed to press in front , and the jacket should be so loose that a full breath can be inspired with ease , while in a sitting position . Illustration : Fig. 63 . The proper way to dress a young girl is to have a cotton or flannel close-fitting jacket next the body , to which the drawers should be buttoned . Over this , place the chemise ; and over that , such a jacket as the one here drawn , to which should be buttoned the hoops and other skirts . Thus every article of dress will be supported by the shoulders . The sleeves of the jacket can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also a tape binding , must surround the arm-hole , which should be loose . It is hoped that increase of intelligence and moral power among mothers , and a combination among them to regulate fashions , may banish the pernicious practices that have prevailed . If a school-girl dress without corsets and without tight belts could be established as a fashion , it would be one step gained in the right direction . Then if mothers could secure daily domestic exercise in chambers , eating-rooms and parlors in loose dresses , a still farther advance would be secured . A friend of the writer informs her that her daughter had her wedding outfit made up by a fashionable milliner in Paris , and every dress was beautifully fitted to the form , and yet was not compressing to any part . This was done too without the use of corsets , the stiffening being delicate and yielding whalebones . Not only parents but all having the care of young girls , especially those at boarding-schools , have a fearful responsibility resting upon them in regard to this important duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much discretion is needed to adapt dress to circumstances and peculiar constitutions . The leading fact must be borne in mind that the skin is made strong and healthful by exposure to light and pure air , while cold air , if not excessive , has a tonic influence . If the skin of infants is rubbed with the hand till red with blood , and then exposed naked to sun and air in a well-ventilated room , it will be favorable to health . There is a constitutional difference in the skin of different children in regard to retaining the animal heat manufactured within , so that some need more clothing than others for comfort . Nature is a safe guide to a careful nurse and mother , and will indicate by the looks and actions of a child when more clothing is needful . As a general rule , it is safe for a healthful child to wear as little clothing as suffices to keep it from complaining of cold . Fifty years ago , it was not common for children to wear as much under-clothing as they now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though not of strong constitutions , used to play for hours in the snow-drifts without the protection of drawers , kept warm by exercise and occasional runs to an open fire . And multitudes of children grew to vigorous maturity through similar exposures to cold air-baths , and without the frequent , colds and sicknesses so common among children of the present day , who are more carefully housed and warmly dressed . But care was taken that the feet should be kept dry and warmly clad , because , circulation being feebler in the extremities , this precaution was important . It must also be considered that age brings with it decrease in vigor of circulation , and the consequent generation of heat , so that more warmth of air and clothing is needed at an advanced period of life than is suitable for the young . These are the general principles which must be applied with modification to each individual case . A child of delicate constitution must have more careful protection from cold air than is desirable for one more vigorous , while the leading general principle is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin whenever it does not produce an uncomfortable chilliness . XIII . GOOD COOKING . There are but a few things on which health , and happiness depend more than on the manner in which food is cooked . You may make houses enchantingly beautiful , hang them with pictures , have them clean and airy and convenient ; but if the stomach is fed with sour bread and burnt meats , it will raise such rebellions that the eyes will see no beauty anywhere . The abundance of splendid material we have in America is in great contrast with the style of cooking most prevalent in our country . How often , in journeys , do we sit down to tables loaded with material , originally of the very best kind , winch has been so spoiled in the treatment that there is really nothing to eat ! Green biscuits with acrid spots of alkali ; sour yeast-bread ; meat slowly simmered in fat till it seemed like grease itself , and slowly congealing in cold grease ; and above all , that unpardonable enormity , strong butter ! How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the raw material out of which all these monstrosities were concocted ! There is no country where an ample , well-furnished table is more easily spread , and for that reason , perhaps , none where the bounties of Providence are more generally neglected . Considering that our resources are greater than those of any other civilized people , our results are comparatively poorer . It is said that a list of the summer vegetables which are exhibited on New-York hotel-tables being shown to a French artiste , he declared that to serve such a dinner properly would take till midnight . A traveler can not but be struck with our national plenteousness , on returning from a Continental tour , and going directly from the ship to a New-York hotel , in the bounteous season of autumn . For months habituated to neat little bits of chop or poultry , garnished with the inevitable cauliflower or potato , which seemed to be the sole possibility after the reign of green peas was over ; to sit down all at once to such a carnival ! to such ripe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slices ; rich , yellow sweet-potatoes ; broad lima-beans , and beans of other and various names ; tempting ears of Indian-corn steaming in enormous piles ; great smoking tureens of the savory succotash , an Indian gift to the table for which civilization need not blush ; sliced egg-plant in delicate fritters ; and marrow-squashes , of creamy pulp and sweetness ; a rich variety , embarrassing to the appetite , and perplexing to the choice . Verily , the thought must often occur that the vegetarian doctrine preached in America leaves a man quite as much as he has capacity to eat or enjoy , and that in the midst of such tantalizing abundance he has really lost the apology , which elsewhere bears him out in preying upon his less gifted and accomplished animal neighbors . But with all this , the American table , taken as a whole , is inferior to that of England or France . It presents a fine abundance of material , carelessly and poorly treated . The management of food is nowhere in the world , perhaps , more slovenly and wasteful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on abundance ; there are great capabilities and poor execution . A tourist through England can seldom fail , at the quietest country-inn , of finding himself served with the essentials of English table-comfort  --  his mutton-chop done to a turn , his steaming little private apparatus for concocting his own tea , his choice pot of marmalade or slice of cold ham , and his delicate rolls and creamy butter , all served with care and neatness . In France , one never asks in vain for delicious cafe-au-lait , good bread and butter , a nice omelet , or some savory little portion of meat with a French name . But to a tourist taking like chance in American country-fare , what is the prospect ? What is the coffee ? what the tea ? and the meat ? and above all , the butter ? In writing on cooking , the main topics should be first , bread ; second , butter ; third , meat ; fourth , vegetables ; and fifth , tea  --  by which last is meant , generally , all sorts of warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called tea , coffee , chocolate , broma , or what not . If these five departments are all perfect , the great ends of domestic cookery are answered , so far as the comfort and well-being of life are concerned . There exists another department , which is often regarded by culinary amateurs and young aspirants as the higher branch and very collegiate course of practical cookery ; to wit , confectionery , by which is designated all pleasing and complicated compounds of sweets and spices , devised not for health and nourishment , and strongly suspected of interfering with both  --  mere tolerated gratifications of the palate , which we eat , not with the expectation of being benefited , but only with the hope of not being injured by them . In this large department rank all sorts of cakes , pies , preserves , etc. , whose excellence is often attained by treading under foot and disregarding the five grand essentials . There is many a table garnished with three or four kinds of well-made cake , compounded with citron and spices and all imaginable good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bread some hot preparation of flour , lard , saleratus , and acid , and the butter unutterably detestable , where , if the mistress of the feast had given the care , time , and labor to preparing the simple items of bread , butter , and meat , that she evidently had given to the preparation of these extras , the lot of her guests and family might be much more comfortable . But she does not think of these common articles as constituting a good table . So long as she has puff pastry , rich black cake , clear jelly and preserves , she considers that such unimportant matters as bread , butter , and meat may take care of themselves . It is the same inattention to common things as that which leads people to build houses with stone fronts , and window-caps and expensive front-door trimmings , without bathing-rooms or fireplaces , or ventilators . Those who go into the country looking for summer board in farm-houses know perfectly well that a table where the butter is always fresh , the tea and coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meats properly kept , dressed , and served , is the one table of a hundred , the fabulous enchanted island . It seems impossible to get the idea into the minds of many people that what is called common food , carefully prepared , becomes , in virtue of that very care and attention , a delicacy , superseding the necessity of artificially compounded dainties . To begin , then , with the very foundation of a good table :  --  Bread : What ought it to be ? It should be light , sweet , and tender . This matter of lightness is the distinctive line between savage and civilized bread . The savage mixes simple flour and water into balls of paste , which he throws into boiling water , and which come out solid , glutinous masses , of which his common saying is , " Man eat dis , he no die , " which a facetious traveler who was obliged to subsist on it interpreted to mean , " Dis no kill you , nothing will . " In short , it requires the stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this primitive form of bread , and of course more or less attention in all civilized modes of bread-making is given to producing lightness . By lightness is meant simply that in order to facilitate digestion the particles are to be separated from each other by little holes or air-cells ; and all the different methods of making light bread are neither more nor less than the formation of bread with these air-cells . So far as we know , there are four practicable methods of aerating bread ; namely , by fermentation ; by effervescence of an acid and an alkali ; by aerated egg , or egg which has been filled with air by the process of beating ; and lastly , by pressure of some gaseous substance into the paste , by a process much resembling the impregnation of water in a soda-fountain . All those have one and the same object  --  to give us the cooked particles of our flour separated by such permanent air-cells as will enable the stomach more readily to digest them . A very common mode of aerating bread in America is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flour . The carbonic acid gas time formed products minute air-cells in the bread , or , as the cook says , makes it light . When this process is performed with exact attention to chemical laws , so that the acid and alkali completely neutralize each other , leaving no overplus of either , the result is often very palatable . The difficulty is , that this is a happy conjunction of circumstances which seldom occurs . The acid most commonly employed is that of sour milk , and , as milk has many degrees of sourness , the rule of a certain quantity of alkali to the pint must necessarily produce very different results at different times . As an actual fact where this mode of making bread prevails , as we lament to say it does to a great extent in this country , one finds five cases of failure to one of success . It is a woeful thing that the daughters of our land have abandoned the old respectable mode of yeast-brewing and bread-raising for this specious substitute , so easily made , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance , called biscuit , which many of our worthy republicans are obliged to eat in these days , is wholly unworthy of the men and women of the republic . Good patriots ought not to be put off in that way  --  they deserve better fare . As an occasional variety , as a household convenience for obtaining bread or biscuit at a moment 's notice , the process of effervescence may be retained ; but , we earnestly entreat American housekeepers , in scriptural language , to stand in the way and ask for the old paths , and return to the good yeast-bread of their sainted grandmothers . If acid and alkali must be used , by all means let them be mixed in due proportions . No cook should be left to guess and judge for herself about this matter . There are articles made by chemical rule which produce very perfect results , and the use of them obviates the worst dangers in making bread by effervescence . Of all processes of aeration in bread-making , the oldest and most time-honored mode is by fermentation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is evident from the forcible simile in which he compares the silent permeating force of truth in human , society to the very familiar household process of raising bread by a little yeast . There is , however , one species of yeast , much used in some parts of the country , against which protest should be made . It is called salt-risings , or milk-risings , and is made by mixing flour , milk , and a little salt together , and leaving them to ferment . The bread thus produced is often , very attractive , when new and made with great care . It is white and delicate , with fine , even air-cells . It has , however , when kept , some characteristics which remind us of the terms in which our old English Bible describes the effect of keeping the manna of the ancient Israelites , which we are informed , in words more explicit than agreeable , " stank , and bred worms . " If salt-rising bread does not fulfill the whole of this unpleasant description , it certainly does emphatically a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baking , and when more than a day old , suggests the inquiry , whether it is the saccharine or the putrid fermentation with which it is raised . Whoever breaks a piece of it after a day or two , will often see minute filaments or clammy strings drawing out from the fragments , which , with the unmistakable smell , will cause him to pause before consummating a nearer acquaintance . The fermentation of flour by means of brewer 's or distiller 's yeast produces , if rightly managed , results far more palatable and wholesome . The only requisites for success in it are , first , good materials , and , second , great care in small things . There are certain low-priced or damaged kinds of flour which can never by any kind of domestic chemistry be made into good broad ; and to those persons whose stomachs forbid them to eat gummy , glutinous paste , under the name of bread , there is no economy in buying these poor brands , even at half the price of good flour . But good flour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of fermentation , the whole success of the process depends on the thorough diffusion of the proper proportion of yeast through the whole mass , and on stopping the subsequent fermentation at the precise and fortunate point . The true housewife makes her bread the sovereign of her kitchen  --  its behests must be attended to in all critical points and moments , no matter what else be postponed . She who attends to her bread only when she has done this , and arranged that , and performed the other , very often finds that the forces of nature will not wait for her . The snowy mass , perfectly mixed , kneaded with care and strength , rises in its beautiful perfection till the moment comes for filling the air-cells by baking . A few minutes now , and the acetous fermentation will begin , and the whole result be spoiled . Many bread-makers pass in utter carelessness over this sacred and mysterious boundary . Their oven has cake in it , or they are skimming jelly , or attending to some other of the so-called higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the acetous stage . At last , when they are ready to attend to it , they find that it has been going its own way ,  --  it is so sour that the pungent smell is plainly perceptible . Now the saleratus-bottle is handed down , and a quantity of the dissolved alkali mixed with the paste  --  an expedient sometimes making itself too manifest by greenish streaks or small acrid spots in the bread . As the result , we have a beautiful article spoiled  --  bread without sweetness , if not absolutely sour . In the view of many , lightness is the only property required in this article . The delicate refined sweetness which exists in carefully kneaded bread , baked just before it passes to the extreme point of fermentation , is something , of which they have no conception ; and thus they will even regard this process of spoiling the paste by the acetous fermentation , and then rectifying that acid by effervescence with an alkali , as something positively meritorious . How else can they value and relish bakers ' loaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreeable things ; light indeed , so light that they seem to have neither weight nor substance , but with no more sweetness or taste than so much cotton wool ? Some persons prepare bread for the oven by simply mixing it in the mass , without kneading , pouring it into pans , and suffering it to rise there . The air-cells in bread thus prepared are coarse and uneven ; the bread is as inferior in delicacy and nicety to that which is well kneaded as a raw servant to a perfectly educated and refined lady . The process of kneading seems to impart an evenness to the minute air-cells , a fineness of texture , and a tenderness and pliability to the whole substance , that can be gained in no other way . The divine principle of beauty has its reign over bread as well as over all other things ; it has its laws of aesthetics ; and that bread which is so prepared that it can be formed into separate and well-proportioned loaves , each one carefully worked and moulded , will develop the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand usually not over ten minutes , just long enough to allow the fermentation going on in them to expand each little air-cell to the point at which it stood before it was worked down , and then they should be immediately put into the oven . Many a good thing , however , is spoiled in the oven . We can not but regret , for the sake of bread , that our old steady brick ovens have been almost universally superseded by those of ranges and cooking-stoves , which are infinite in their caprices , and forbid all general rules . One thing , however , may be borne in mind as a principle  --  that the excellence of bread in all its varieties , plain or sweetened , depends on the perfection of its air-cells , whether produced by yeast , egg , or effervescence ; that one of the objects of baking is to fix these air-cells , and that the quicker this can be done through the whole mass , the better will the result be . When cake or bread is made heavy by baking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top crust hinders the exhaling of the moisture in the centre , and prevents the air-cells from cooking . The weight also of the crust pressing down on the doughy air-cells below destroys them , producing that horror of good cooks , a heavy streak . The problem in baking , then , is the quick application of heat rather below than above the loaf , and its steady continuance till all the air-cells are thoroughly dried into permanent consistency . Every housewife must watch her own oven to know how this can be best accomplished . Bread-making can be cultivated to any extent as a fine art  --  and the various kinds of biscuit , tea-rusks , twists , rolls , into which bread may be made , are much better worth a housekeeper 's ambition than the getting-up of rich and expensive cake or confections . There are also varieties of material which are rich in good effects . Unbolted flour , altogether more wholesome than the fine wheat , and when properly prepared more palatable  --  rye-flour and corn-meal , each affording a thousand attractive possibilities  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are worth a careful attention . A peculiarity of our American table , particularly in the Southern and Western States , is the constant exhibition of various preparations of hot bread . In many families of the South and West , bread in loaves to be eaten cold is an article quite unknown . The effect of this kind of diet upon the health has formed a frequent subject of remark among travelers ; but only those know the full mischiefs of it who have been compelled to sojourn for a length of time in families where it is maintained . The unknown horrors of dyspepsia from bad bread are a topic over which we willingly draw a veil . Next to Bread comes Butter  --  on which we have to say , that , when we remember what butter is in civilized Europe , and compare it with what it is in America , we wonder at the forbearance and lenity of travelers in their strictures on our national commissariat . Butter , in England , France , and Italy , is simply solidified cream , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churned each day , and unadulterated by salt . At the present moment , when salt is five cents a pound and butter fifty , we Americans are paying , at high prices , for about one pound of salt to every ten of butter , and those of us who have eaten the butter of France and England do this with rueful recollections . There is , it is true , an article of butter made in the American style with salt , which , in its own kind and way , has a merit not inferior to that of England and France . Many prefer it , and it certainly takes a rank equally respectable with the other . It is yellow , hard , and worked so perfectly free from every particle of buttermilk that it might make the voyage of the world without spoiling . It is salted , but salted with care and delicacy , so that it may be a question whether even a fastidious Englishman might not prefer its golden solidity to the white , creamy freshness of his own . But it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not the rule , on our tables . America must have the credit of manufacturing and putting into market more bad butter than all that is made in all the rest of the world together . The varieties of bad tastes and smells which prevail in it are quite a study . This has a cheesy taste , that a mouldy , this is flavored with cabbage , and that again with turnip , and another has the strong , sharp savor of rancid animal fat . These varieties probably come from the practice of churning only at long intervals , and keeping the cream meanwhile in unventilated cellars or dairies , the air of which is loaded with the effluvia of vegetable substances . No domestic articles are so sympathetic as those of the milk tribe : they readily take on the smell and taste of any neighboring substance , and hence the infinite variety of flavors on which one mournfully muses who has late in autumn to taste twenty firkins of butter in hopes of finding one which will simply not be intolerable on his winter table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at the tables where it is used it stands sentinel at the door to bar your way to every other kind of food . You turn from your dreadful half-slice of bread , which fills your mouth with bitterness , to-your beef-steak , which proves virulent with the same poison ; you think to take refuge in vegetable diet , and find the butter in the string-beans , and polluting the innocence of early peas ; it is in the corn , hi the succotash , in the squash ; the beets swim in it , the onions have it poured over them . Hungry and miserable , you think to solace yourself at the dessert ; but the pastry is cursed , the cake is acrid with the same plague . You are ready to howl with despair , and your misery is great upon you  --  especially if this is a table where you have taken board for three months with your delicate wife and four small children . Your case is dreadful , and it is hopeless , because long usage and habit have rendered your host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't like the butter , sir ? I assure you I paid an extra price for it , and it 's the very best in the market . I looked over as many as a hundred tubs , and picked out this one . " You are dumb , but not less despairing . Yet the process of making good butter is a very simple one . To keep the cream in a perfectly pure , cool atmosphere , to churn while it is yet sweet , to work out the buttermilk thoroughly , and to add salt with such discretion as not to ruin the fine , delicate flavor of the fresh cream  --  all this is quite simple , so simple that one wonders at thousands and millions of pounds of butter yearly manufactured which are merely a hobgoblin bewitchment of cream into foul and loathsome poisons . The third head of my discourse is that of Meat , of which America furnishes , in the gross material , enough to spread our tables royally , were it well cared for and served . The faults in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is too new . A beef steak , which three or four days of keeping might render palatable , is served up to us palpitating with freshness , with all the toughness of animal muscle yet warm . In the next place , there is a woeful lack of nicety in the butcher 's work of cutting and preparing meat . Who that remembers the neatly trimmed mutton-chop of an English inn , or the artistic little circle of lamb-chop fried in bread-crumbs coiled around a tempting centre of spinach which may always be found in France , can recognize any family resemblance to those dapper , civilized preparations , in these coarse , roughly-hacked strips of bone , gristle , and meat which are commonly called mutton-chop in America ? There seems to be a large dish of something resembling meat , in which each fragment has about two or three edible morsels , the rest being composed of dry and burnt skin , fat , and ragged bone . Is it not time that civilization should learn to demand somewhat more care and nicety in the modes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not some of the refinement and trimness which characterize the preparations of the European market be with advantage introduced into our own ? The housekeeper who wishes to garnish her table with some of those nice things is stopped in the outset by the butcher . Except in our large cities , where some foreign travel may have created the demand , it seems impossible to get much in this line that is properly prepared . If this is urged on the score of aesthetics , the ready reply will be , " Oh ! we ca n't give time here in America to go into niceties and French whim-whams ! " But the French mode of doing almost all practical things is based on that true philosophy and utilitarian good sense which characterize that seemingly thoughtless people . Nowhere is economy a more careful study , and their market is artistically arranged to this end . The rule is so to cut their meats that no portion designed to be cooked in a certain manner shall have wasteful appendages which that mode of cooking will spoil . The French soup-kettle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibrous flaps , the sinewy and gristly portions , which are so often included in our roasts or broilings , which fill our plates with unsightly debris , and finally make an amount of blank waste for which we pay our butcher the same price that we pay for what we have eaten . The dead waste of our clumsy , coarse way of cutting meats is immense . For example , at the beginning of the season , the part of a lamb denominated leg and loin , or hind-quarter , may sell for thirty cents a pound . Now this includes , besides the thick , fleshy portions , a quantity of bone , sinew , and thin fibrous substance , constituting full one third of the whole weight . If we put it into the oven entire , in the usual manner , we have the thin parts over-done , and the skinny and fibrous parts utterly dried up , by the application of the amount of heat necessary to cook the thick portion . Supposing the joint to weigh six pounds , at thirty cents , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become perfectly useless , we throw away sixty cents . Of a piece of beef at twenty-five cents a pound , fifty cents ' worth is often lost in bone , fat , and burnt skin . The fact is , this way of selling and cooking meat in large , gross portions is of English origin , and belongs to a country where all the customs of society spring from a class who have no particular occasion for economy . The practice of minute and delicate division comes from a nation which acknowledges the need of economy , and has made it a study . A quarter of lamb in this mode of division would be sold in three nicely prepared portions . The thick part would be sold by itself , for a neat , compact little roast ; the rib-bones would be artistically separated , and all the edible matter would form those delicate dishes of lamb-chop , which , fried in bread-crumbs to a golden brown , are so ornamental and palatable a side-dish ; the trimmings which remain after this division would be destined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little portion for every purse , and the far-famed and delicately flavored soups and stews which have arisen out of French economy are a study worth a housekeeper 's attention . Not one atom of food is wasted in the French modes of preparation ; even tough animal cartilages and sinews , instead of appearing burned and blackened in company with the roast meat to which they happen to be related , are treated according to their own laws , and come out either in savory soups , or those fine , clear meat-jellies which form a garnish no less agreeable to the eye than palatable to the taste . Whether this careful , economical , practical style of meat-cooking can ever to any great extent be introduced into our kitchens now is a question . Our butchers are against it ; our servants are wedded to the old wholesale wasteful ways , which seem to them easier because they are accustomed to them . A cook who will keep and properly tend a soup-kettle which shall receive and utilize all that the coarse preparations of the butcher would require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the most of all these remains , is a treasure scarcely to be hoped for . If such things are to be done , it must be primarily through the educated brain of cultivated women who do not scorn to turn their culture and refinement upon domestic problems . When meats have been properly divided , so that each portion can receive its own appropriate style of treatment , next comes the consideration of the modes of cooking . These may be divided into two great general classes : those where it is desired to keep the juices within the meat , as in baking , broiling , and frying  --  and those whose object is to extract the juice and dissolve the fibre , as in the making of soups and stews . In the first class of operations , the process must be as rapid as may consist with the thorough cooking of all the particles . In this branch of cookery , doing quickly is doing well . The fire must be brisk , the attention alert . The introduction of cooking-stoves offers to careless domestics facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor and nutriment  --  facilities which appear to be very generally accepted . They have almost banished the genuine , old-fashioned roast-meat from our tables , and left in its stead dried meats with their most precious and nutritive juices evaporated . How few cooks , unassisted , are competent to the simple process of broiling a beefsteak or mutton-chop ! how very generally one has to choose between these meats gradually dried away , or burned on the outside and raw within ! Yet in England these articles never come on the table done amiss ; their perfect cooking is as absolute a certainty as the rising of the sun . No one of these rapid processes of cooking , however , is so generally abused as frying . The frying-pan has awful sins to answer for . What untold horrors of dyspepsia have arisen from its smoky depths , like the ghost from witches ' caldrons ! The fizzle of frying meat is a warning knell on many an ear , saying , " Touch not , taste not , if you would not burn and writhe ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lightest , most palatable , and most digestible preparations of meat have come from this dangerous source . But we fancy quite other rites and ceremonies inaugurated the process , and quite other hands performed its offices , than those known to our kitchens . Probably the delicate cotelettes of France are not flopped down into half-melted grease , there gradually to warm and soak and fizzle , while Biddy goes in and out on her other ministrations , till finally , when they are thoroughly saturated , and dinner-hour impends , she bethinks herself , and crowds the fire below to a roaring heat , and finishes the process by a smart burn , involving the kitchen and surrounding precincts in volumes of Stygian gloom . From such preparations has arisen the very current medical opinion that fried meats are indigestible . They are indigestible , if they are greasy ; but French cooks have taught us that a thing has no more need to be greasy because emerging from grease than Venus had to be salt because she rose from the sea . There are two ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to immerse the article to be cooked in boiling fat , with an emphasis on the present participle  --  and the philosophical principle is , so immediately to crisp every pore , at the first moment or two of immersion , as effectually to seal the interior against the intrusion of greasy particles ; it can then remain as long as may be necessary thoroughly to cook it , without imbibing any more of the boiling fluid than if it were inclosed in an egg-shell . The other method is to rub a perfectly smooth iron surface with just enough of some oily substance to prevent the meat from adhering , and cook it with a quick heat , as cakes are baked , on a griddle . In both these cases there must be the most rapid application of heat that can be made without burning , and by the adroitness shown in working out this problem the skill of the cook is tested . Any one whose cook attains this important secret will find fried things quite as digestible , and often more palatable , than any other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slow and gradual application of heat for the softening and dissolution of its fibre and the extraction of its juices , common cooks are equally untrained . Where is the so-called cook who understands how to prepare soups and stews ? These are precisely the articles in which a French kitchen excels . The soup-kettle , made with a double bottom , to prevent burning , is a permanent , ever-present institution , and the coarsest and most impracticable meats distilled through that alembic come out again in soups , jellies , or savory stews . The toughest cartilage , even the bones , being first cracked , are here made to give forth their hidden virtues , and to rise in delicate and appetizing forms . One great law governs all these preparations : the application of heat must be gradual , steady , long protracted , never reaching the point of active boiling . Hours of quiet simmering dissolve all dissoluble parts , soften the sternest fibre , and unlock every minute cell in which Nature has stored away her treasures of nourishment . This careful and protracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two main points in all those nice preparations of meat for which the French have so many names  --  processes by which a delicacy can be imparted to the coarsest and cheapest food superior to that of the finest articles under less philosophic treatment . French soups and stews are a study , and they would not be an unprofitable one to any person who wishes to live with comfort and even elegance on small means . There is no animal fibre that will not yield itself up to long-continued , steady heat . But the difficulty with almost any of the common servants who call themselves cooks is , that they have not the smallest notion of the philosophy of the application of heat . Such a one will complacently tell you concerning certain meats , that the harder you boil them the harder they grow  --  an obvious fact which , under her mode of treatment by an indiscriminate galloping boil , has frequently come under her personal observation . If you tell her that such meat must stand for six hours in a heat just below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ma'am , " and go on her own way . Or she will let it stand till it burns to the bottom of the kettle  --  a most common termination of the experiment . The only way to make sure of the matter is , either to obtain a French kettle , or to fit into an ordinary kettle a false bottom , such as any tinman may make , that shall leave a space of an inch or two between the meat and the fire . This kettle may be maintained in a constant position on the range , and into it the cook maybe instructed to throw all the fibrous trimmings of meat , all the gristle , tendons , and bones , having previously broken up these last with a mallet . Such a kettle , the regular occupant of a French cooking-stove , which they call the pot au feu , will furnish the basis for clear , rich soups , or other palatable dishes . This is ordinarily called " stock . " Clear soup consists of the dissolved juices of the meat and gelatine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portions by straining . The grease , which rises to the top of the fluid , may be easily removed when cold . English and American soups are often heavy and hot with spices . There are appreciable tastes in them . They burn your mouth with cayenne , or clove , or allspice . You can tell at once what is in them , oftentimes to your sorrow . But a French soup has a flavor which one recognizes at once as delicious , yet not to be characterized as due to any single condiment ; it is the just blending of many things . The same remark applies to all their stews ; ragouts , and other delicate preparations . No cook will ever study these flavors ; but perhaps many cooks ' mistresses may , and thus , be able to impart delicacy and comfort to economy . As to those things called hashes , commonly manufactured by unwatched , untaught cooks out of the remains of yesterday 's meal , let us not dwell too closely on their memory  --  compounds of meat , gristle , skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pepper and salt flung at them , dredged with lumpy flour , watered from the spout of the tea-kettle , and left to simmer at the cook 's convenience while she is otherwise occupied . Such are the best performances a housekeeper can hope for from an untrained cook . But the cunningly devised minces , the artful preparations choicely flavored , which may be made of yesterday 's repast  --  by these is the true domestic artist known . No cook untaught by an educated brain ever makes these , and yet economy is a great gainer by them . As regards the department of Vegetables , their number and variety in America are so great that a table might almost be furnished by these alone . Generally speaking , their cooking is a more simple art , and therefore more likely to be found satisfactorily performed , than that of meats . If only they are not drenched with rancid butter , their own native excellence makes itself known in most of the ordinary modes of preparation . There is , however , one exception . Our staunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what bread is on the table . Like bread , it is held as a sort of sine-qua-non ; like that , it may be made invariably palatable by a little care in a few plain particulars , through neglect of which it often becomes intolerable . The soggy , waxy , indigestible viand that often appears in the potato-dish is a downright sacrifice of the better nature of this vegetable . The potato , nutritive and harmless as it appears , belongs to a family suspected of very dangerous traits . It is a family connection of the deadly-nightshade and other ill-reputed gentry , and sometimes shows strange proclivities to evil  --  now breaking out uproariously , as in the noted potato-rot , and now more covertly , in various evil affections . For this reason scientific directors bid us beware of the water in which potatoes are boiled-into which , it appears , the evil principle is drawn off ; and they caution us not to shred them into stews without previously suffering the slices to lie for an hour or so in salt and water . These cautions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potato for the table are by roasting or boiling . These processes are so simple that it is commonly supposed every cook understands them without special directions ; and yet there is scarcely an uninstructed cook who can boil or roast a potato . A good roasted potato is a delicacy worth a dozen compositions of the cook-book ; yet when we ask for it , what burnt , shriveled abortions are presented to us ! Biddy rushes to her potato-basket and pours out two dozen of different sizes , some having in them three times the amount of matter of others . These being washed , she tumbles them into her oven at a leisure interval , and there lets them lie till it is time to serve breakfast , whenever that may be . As a result , if the largest are cooked , the smallest are presented in cinders , and the intermediate sizes are withered and watery . Nothing is so utterly ruined by a few moments of overdoing . That which at the right moment was plump with mealy richness , a quarter of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this state that roast potatoes are most frequently served . In the same manner we have seen boiled potatoes from an untaught cook coming upon the table like lumps of yellow wax  --  and the same article , under the directions of a skillful mistress , appearing in snowy balls of powdery whiteness . In the one case , they were thrown in their skins into water , and suffered to soak or boil , as the case might be , at the cook 's leisure , and after they were boiled to stand in the water till she was ready to peel them . In the other case , the potatoes being first peeled were boiled as quickly as possible in salted water , which the moment they were done was drained off , and then they were gently shaken for a moment or two over the fire to dry them still more thoroughly . We have never yet seen the potato so depraved and given over to evil that it could not be reclaimed by this mode of treatment . As to fried potatoes , who that remembers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as wafers and light as snow-flakes , does not speak respectfully of them ? What cousinship with these have those coarse , greasy masses of sliced potato , wholly soggy and partly burnt , to which we are treated under the name of fried potatoes in America ? In our cities the restaurants are introducing the French article to great acceptance , and to the vindication of the fair fame of this queen of vegetables . Finally , we arrive at the last great head of our subject , to wit  - -  Tea  --  meaning thereby , as before observed , what our Hibernian friend did in the inquiry , " Will y'r honor take ' tay tay ' or coffee tay ? " We are not about to enter into the merits of the great tea-and-coffee controversy , further than in our general caution concerning them in the chapter on Healthful Drinks ; but we now proceed to treat of them as actual existences , and speak only of the modes of making the best of them . The French coffee is reputed the best in the world ; and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French coffee ? In the first place , then , the French coffee is coffee , and not chickory , or rye , or beans , or peas . In the second place , it is freshly roasted , whenever made  --  roasted with great care and evenness in a little revolving cylinder which makes part of the furniture of every kitchen , and which keeps in the aroma of the berry . It is never overdone , so as to destroy the coffee-flavor , which is in nine cases out of tent the fault of the coffee we meet with . Then it is ground , and placed in a coffee-pot with a filter through which , when it has yielded up its life to the boiling water poured upon it , the delicious extract percolates in clear drops , the coffee-pot standing on a heated stove to maintain the temperature . The nose of the coffee-pot is stopped up to prevent the escape of the aroma during this process . The extract thus obtained is a perfectly clear , dark fluid , known as caf noir , or black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being in fact almost the very essential oil of coffee . A table-spoonful of this in boiled milk would make what is ordinarily called a strong cup of coffee . The boiled milk is prepared with no less care . It must be fresh and new , not merely warmed or even brought to the boiling-point , but slowly simmered till it attains a thick , creamy richness . The coffee mixed with this , and sweetened with that sparkling beet-root sugar which ornaments a French table , is the celebrated cafe-au-lait , the name of which has gone round the world . As we look to France for the best coffee , so we must look to England for the perfection of tea . The tea-kettle is as much an English institution as aristocracy or the Prayer-Book ; and when one wants to know exactly how tea should he made , one has only to ask how a fine old English house-keeper makes it . The first article of her faith is , that the water must not merely be hot , not merely have boiled a few moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touches the tea . Hence , though servants in England are vastly better trained than with us , this delicate mystery is seldom left to their hands . Tea-making belongs to the drawing-room , and high-born ladies preside at " the bubbling and loud hissing urn , " and see that all due rites and solemnities are properly performed  --  that the cups are hot , and that the infused tea waits the exact time before the libations commence . Of late , the introduction of English breakfast-tea has raised a new sect among the tea-drinkers , reversing some of the old canons . Breakfast-tea must be boiled ! Unlike the delicate article of olden time , which required only a momentary infusion to develop its richness , this requires a longer and severer treatment to bring out its strength  --  thus confusing all the established usages , and throwing the work into the hands of the cook in the kitchen . The faults of tea , as too commonly found at our hotels and boarding-houses , are , that it is made in every way the reverse of what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not boiling ; the tea has a general flat , stale , smoky taste , devoid of life or spirit ; and it is served usually with thin milk , instead of cream . Cream is an essential to the richness of tea as of coffee . Lacking cream , boiled milk is better than cold . Chocolate is a French and Spanish article , and one seldom served on American tables . We in America , however , make an article every way equal to any which can be imported from Paris , and he who buys the best vanilla-chocolate may rest assured that no foreign land can furnish any thing better . A very rich and delicious beverage may be made by dissolving this in milk , slowly boiled down after the French fashion . A word now under the head of Confectionery , meaning by this the whole range of ornamental cookery  --  or pastry , ices , jellies , preserves , etc . The art of making all these very perfectly is far better understood in America than the art of common cooking . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good bread  --  more who can furnish you with a good ice-cream than a well-cooked mutton-chop ; a fair charlotte-russe is easier to gain than a perfect cup of coffee ; and you shall find a sparkling jelly to your dessert where you sighed in vain for so simple a luxury as a well-cooked potato . Our fair countrywomen might rest upon their laurels in these higher fields , and turn their great energy and ingenuity to the study of essentials . To do common things perfectly is far better worth our endeavor than to do uncommon things respectably . We Americans in many things as yet have been a little inclined to begin making our shirt at the ruffle ; but , nevertheless , when we set about it , we can make the shirt as nicely as any body ; it needs only that we turn our attention to it , resolved that , ruffle or no ruffle , the shirt we will have . A few words as to the prevalent ideas in respect to French cookery . Having heard much of it , with no very distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen into the notion that its forte lies in high spicing  --  and so when our cooks put a great abundance of clove , mace , nutmeg , and cinnamon into their preparations , they fancy that they are growing up to be French cooks . But the fact is , that the Americans and English are far more given to spicing than the French . Spices in our made dishes are abundant , and their taste is strongly pronounced . Living a year in France one forgets the taste of nutmeg , clove , and allspice , which abounds in so many dishes in America . The English and Americans deal in spices , the French in flavors  --  flavors many and flue , imitating often in their delicacy those subtle blendings which nature produces in high-flavored fruits . The recipes of our cookery-books are most of them of English origin , coming down from the times of our phlegmatic ancestors , when the solid , burly , beefy growth of the foggy island required the heat of fiery condiments , and could digest heavy sweets . Witness the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pound of every indigestible substance you can think of , boil into a cannon-ball , and serve in flaming brandy . So of the Christmas mince-pie , and many other national dishes . But in America , owing to our brighter skies and more fervid climate , we have developed an acute , nervous delicacy of temperament far more akin to that of France than of England . Half of the recipes in our cook-books are mere murder to such constitutions and stomachs as we grow here . We require to ponder these things , and think how we , in our climate and under our circumstances , ought to live ; and in doing so , we may , without accusation of foreign foppery , take some leaves from many foreign books . XIV . EARLY RISING There is no practice which has been more extensively eulogized in all ages than early rising ; and this universal impression is an indication that it is founded on true philosophy . For it is rarely the case that the common sense of mankind fastens on a practice as really beneficial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This practice , which may justly be called a domestic virtue , is one which has a peculiar claim to be styled American and democratic . The distinctive mark of aristocratic nations is a disregard of the great mass , and a disproportionate regard for the interests of certain privileged orders . All the customs and habits of such a nation are , to a greater or less extent , regulated by this principle . Now the mass of any nation must always consist of persons who labor at occupations which demand the light of day . But in aristocratic countries , especially in England , labor is regarded as the mark of the lower classes , and indolence is considered as one mark of a gentleman . This impression has gradually and imperceptibly , to a great extent , regulated their customs , so that , even in their hours of meals and repose , the higher orders aim at being different and distinct from those who , by laborious pursuits , are placed below them . From this circumstance , while the lower orders labor by day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the honored sleep by day , and follow their pursuits and pleasures by night . It will be found that the aristocracy of London breakfast near midday , dine after dark , visit and go to Parliament between ten and twelve at night , and retire to sleep toward morning . In consequence of this , the subordinate classes who aim at gentility gradually fall into the same practice . The influence of this custom extends across the ocean , and here , in this democratic land , we find many who measure their grade of gentility by the late hour at which they arrive at a party . And this aristocratic folly is growing upon us , so that , throughout the nation , the hours for visiting and retiring are constantly becoming later , while the hours for rising correspond in lateness . The question , then , is one which appeals to American women , as a matter of patriotism and as having a bearing on those great principles of democracy which we conceive to be equally the principles of Christianity . Shall we form our customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Shall we assume , by our practice , that the interests of the great mass are to be sacrificed for the pleasures and honors of a privileged few ? Shall we ape the customs of aristocratic lands , in those very practices which result from principles and institutions that we condemn ? Shall we not rather take the place to which we are entitled , as the leaders , rather than the followers , in the customs of society , turn back the tide of aristocratic inroads , and carry through the whole , not only of civil and political but of social and domestic life , the true principles of democratic freedom and equality ? The following considerations may serve to strengthen an affirmative decision . The first relates to the health of a family . It is a universal law of physiology , that all living things flourish best in the light . Vegetables , in a dark cellar , grow pale and spindling . Children brought up in mines are always wan and stunted , while men become pale and cadaverous who live under ground . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of day produces on all animated creation . Sir James Wylie , of the Russian imperial service , states that in the soldiers ' barracks , three times as many were taken sick on the shaded side as on the sunny side ; though both sides communicated , and discipline , diet , and treatment were the same . The eminent French surgeon , Dupuytren , cured a lady whose complicated diseases baffled for years his own and all other medical skill , by taking her from a dark room to an abundance of daylight . Florence Nightingale writes : " Second only to fresh air in importance for the sick is light . Not only daylight but direct sunlight is necessary to speedy recovery , except in a small number of cases . Instances , almost endless , could be given where , in dark wards , or wards with only northern exposure , or wards with borrowed light , even when properly ventilated , the sick could not be , by any means , made speedily to recover . " In the prevalence of cholera , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets or in houses having only northern exposures than in those having sunlight . Several physicians have stated to the writer that , in sunny exposures , women after childbirth gained strength much faster than those excluded from sunlight . In the writer 's experience , great nervous debility has been always immediately lessened by sitting in the sun , and still more by lying on the earth and in open air , a blanket beneath , and head and eyes protected , under the direct rays of the sun . Some facts in physiology and natural philosophy have a bearing on this subject . It seems to be settled that the red color of blood is owing to iron contained in the red blood-cells , while it is established as a fact that the sun 's rays are metallic , having " vapor of iron " as one element . It is also true that want of light causes a diminution of the red and an increase of the imperfect white blood-cells , and that this sometimes results in a disease called leucoemia , while all who live in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak muscles . Thus it would seem that it is the sun that imparts the iron and color to the blood . These things being so , the customs of society that bring sleeping hours into daylight , and working and study hours into the night , are direct violations of the laws of health . The laws of health are the laws of God , and " sin is the transgression of law . " To this we must add the great neglect of economy as well as health in substituting unhealthful gaslight , poisonous , anthracite warmth , for the life-giving light and warmth of the sun . Millions and millions would be saved to this nation in fuel and light , as well as in health , by returning to the good old ways of our forefathers , to rise with the sun , and retire to rest " when the bell rings for nine o'clock . " The observations of medical men , whose inquiries have been directed to this point , have decided that from six to eight hours is the amount of sleep demanded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight , and others no more than six hours of repose . But eight hours is the maximum for all persons in ordinary health , with ordinary occupations . In cases of extra physical exertions , or the debility of disease , or a decayed constitution , more than this is required . Let eight hours , then , be regarded as the ordinary period required for sleep by an industrious people like the Americans . It thus appears that the laws of our political condition , the laws ofthe natural world , and the constitution of our bodies , alike demand that we rise with the light of day to prosecute our employments , and that we retire in time for the requisite amount of sleep . In regard to the effects of protracting the time spent in repose , many extensive and satisfactory investigations have been made . It has been shown that , during sleep , the body perspires most freely , while yet neither food nor exercise are ministering to its wants . Of course , if we continue our slumbers beyond the time required to restore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unperceived undermining of the constitution , by this protracted and debilitating exhalation . This process , in a course of years , readers the body delicate and less able to withstand disease , and in the result shortens life . Sir John Sinclair , who has written a large work on the Causes of Longevity , states , as one result of his extensive investigations , that he has never yet heard or read of a single case of great longevity where the individual was not an early riser . He says that he has found cases in which the individual has violated some one of all the other laws of health , and yet lived to great age ; but never a single instance in which any constitution has withstood that undermining consequent on protracting the hours of repose beyond the demands of the system . Another reason for early rising is , that it is indispensable to a systematic and well-regulated family . At whatever hour the parents retire , children and domestics , wearied by play or labor , must retire early . Children usually awake with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestics usually prefer the freshness of morning for their labors . If , then , the parents rise at a late hour , they either induce a habit of protracting sleep in their children and domestics , or else the family are up , and at their pursuits , while their supervisors are in bed . Any woman who asserts that her children and domestics , in the first hours of day , when their spirits are freshest , will be as well regulated without her presence as with it , confesses that which surely is little for her credit . It is believed that any candid woman , whatever may be her excuse for late rising , will concede that if she could rise early it would be for the advantage of her family . A late breakfast puts back the work , through the whole day , for every member of a family ; and if the parents thus occasion the loss of an hour or two to each individual who , but for their delay in the morning , would be usefully employed , they alone are responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of early rising has a relation to the general interests of the social community , as well as to that of each distinct family . All that great portion of the community who are employed in business and labor find it needful to rise early ; and all their hours of meals , and their appointments for business or pleasure , must be accommodated to these arrangements . Now , if a small portion of the community establish very different hours , it makes a kind of jostling in all the concerns and interests of society . The various appointments for the public , such as meetings , schools , and business hours , must be accommodated to the mass , and not to individuals . The few , then , who establish domestic habits at variance with the majority , are either constantly interrupted in their own arrangements , or else are interfering with the rights and interests of others . This is exemplified in the case of schools . In families where late rising is practiced , either hurry , irregularity , and neglect are engendered in the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus of the community , are sacrificed . In this , and many other matters , it can be shown that the well-being of the bulk of the people is , to a greater or less extent , impaired by this self-indulgent practice . Let any teacher select the unpunctual scholars  --  a class who most seriously interfere with the interests of the school  --  and let men of business select those who cause them most waste of time and vexation , by unpunctuality ; and it will be found that they are generally among the late risers , and rarely among those who rise early . Thus , late rising not only injures the person and family which indulge in it , but interferes with the rights and convenience of the community ; while early rising imparts corresponding benefits of health , promptitude , vigor of action , economy of time , and general effectiveness both to the individuals who practice it and to the families and community of which they are a part . CHAPTER XV . DOMESTIC MANNERS . Good manners are the expressions of benevolence in personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enjoyment of others , and to avoid all that gives needless uneasiness . It is the exterior exhibition of the divine precept , which requires us to do to others as we would that they should do to us . It is saying , by our deportment , to all around , that we consider their feelings , tastes , and conveniences , as equal in value to our own . Good manners lead us to avoid all practices which offend the taste of others ; all unnecessary violations of the conventional rules of propriety ; all rude and disrespectful language and deportment ; and all remarks which would tend to wound the feelings of others . There is a serious defect in the manners of the American people , especially among the descendants of the Puritan settlers of New England , which can never be efficiently remedied , except in the domestic circle , and during early life . It is a deficiency in the free expression of kindly feelings and sympathetic emotions , and a want of courtesy in deportment . The causes which have led to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation , to a wide extent , were men who were driven from their native land by laws and customs which they believed to be opposed both to civil and religious freedom . The sufferings they were called to endure , the subduing of those gentler feelings which bind us to country , kindred , and home ; and the constant subordination of the passions to stern principle , induced characters of great firmness and self-control . They gave up the comforts and refinements of a civilized country , and came as pilgrims to a hard soil , a cold clime , and a heathen shore . They were continually forced to encounter danger , privations , sickness , loneliness , and death ; and all these their religion taught them to meet with calmness , fortitude , and submission . And thus it became the custom and habit of the whole mass , to repress rather than to encourage the expression of feeling . Persons who are called to constant and protracted suffering and privation are forced to subdue and conceal emotion ; for the free expression of it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . Those , only , who are free from care and anxiety , and whose minds are mainly occupied by cheerful emotions , are at full liberty to unveil their feelings . It was under such stern and rigorous discipline that the first children in New England were reared ; and the manners and habits of parents are usually , to a great extent , transmitted to children . Thus it comes to pass , that the descendants of the Puritans , now scattered over every part of the nation , are predisposed to conceal the gentler emotions , while their manners are calm , decided , and cold , rather than free and impulsive . Of course , there are very many exceptions to these predominating characteristics . Other causes to which we may attribute a general want of courtesy in manners are certain incidental results of our domestic institutions . Our ancestors and their descendants have constantly been combating the aristocratic principle which would exalt one class of men at the expense of another . They have had to contend with this principle , not only in civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own person as well as in behalf of his class , has had to assume and defend the main principle of democracy  --  that every man 's feelings and interests are equal in value to those of every other man . But , in doing this , there has been some want of clear discrimination . Because claims based on distinctions of mere birth , fortune , or position , were found to be injurious , many have gone to the extreme of inferring that all distinctions , involving subordinations , are useless . Such would wrongfully regard children as equals to parents , pupils to teachers , domestics to their employers , and subjects to magistrates  --  and that , too , in all respects . The fact that certain grades of superiority and subordination are needful , both for individual and public benefit , has not been clearly discerned ; and there has been a gradual tendency to an extreme of the opposite view which has sensibly affected our manners . All the proprieties and courtesies which depend on the recognition of the relative duties of superior and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to an increasing extent , disrespectful treatment of parents , by children ; of teachers , by pupils ; of employers , by domestics ; and of the aged , by the young . In all classes and circles , there is a gradual decay in courtesy of address . In cases , too , where kindness is rendered , it is often accompanied with a cold , unsympathizing manner , which greatly lessens its value ; while kindness or politeness is received in a similar style of coolness , as if it were but the payment of a just due . It is owing to these causes that the American people , especially the descendants of the Puritans , do not do themselves justice . For , while those who are near enough to learn their real character and feelings can discern the most generous impulses , and the most kindly sympathies , they are often so veiled behind a composed and indifferent demeanor , as to be almost entirely concealed from strangers . These defects in our national manners it especially falls to the care of mothers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rectify ; and if they seriously undertake the matter , and wisely adapt means to ends , these defects will be remedied . With reference to this object , the following ideas are suggested . The law of Christianity and of democracy , which teaches that all men are born equal in rights , and that their interests and feelings should be regarded as of equal value , seems to be adopted in aristocratic circles , with exclusive reference to the class in which the individual moves . The courtly gentleman addresses all of his own class with politeness and respect ; and in all his actions , seems to allow that the feelings and convenience of these others are to be regarded the same as his own . But his demeanor to those of inferior station is not based on the same rule . Among those who make up aristocratic circles , such as are above them are deemed of superior , and such as are below of inferior , value . Thus , if a young , ignorant , and vicious coxcomb happens to have been born a lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the well-bred of another class must give his convenience the precedence , and must address him in terms of respect . So sometimes , when a man of " noble birth " is thrown among the lower classes , he demeans himself in a style which , to persons of his own class , would be deemed the height of assumption and rudeness . Now , the principles of democracy require that the same courtesy which we accord to our own circle shall be extended to every class and condition ; and that distinctions of superiority and subordination shall depend , not on accidents of birth , fortune , or occupation , but solely on those mutual relations which the good of all classes equally require . The distinctions demanded in a democratic state are simply those which result from relations that are common to every class , and are for the benefit of all . It is for the benefit of every class that children be subordinate to parents , pupils to teachers , the employed to their employers , and subjects to magistrates . In addition to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or convenience of the delicate and feeble should be preferred to that of the strong and healthy , who would suffer less by any deprivation ; that precedence should be given to their elders by the young ; and that reverence should be given to the hoary head . The rules of good-breeding , in a democratic state , must be founded on these principles . It is indeed assumed that the value of the happiness of each individual is the same as that of every other ; but as there must be occasions where there are advantages which all can not enjoy , there must be general rules for regulating a selection . Otherwise , there would be constant scrambling among those of equal claims , and brute force must be the final resort ; in which case , the strongest would have the best of every thing . The democratic rule , then , is , that superiors in age , station , or office have precedence of subordinates ; age and feebleness , of youth and strength ; and the feebler sex , of more vigorous man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus giving precedence to woman has been severely commented on by foreigners , and by some who would transfer all the business of the other sex to women , and then have them treated like men . But we hope this evidence of our superior civilization and Christianity may increase rather than diminish . There is , also , a style of deportment and address which is appropriate to these different relations . It is suitable for a superior to secure compliance with his wishes from those subordinate to him by commands ; but a subordinate must secure compliance with his wishes from a superior by requests . ( Although the kind and considerate manner to subordinates will always be found the most effective as well as the pleasantest , by those in superior station . ) It is suitable for a parent , teacher , or employer to admonish for neglect of duty ; but not for an inferior to adopt such a course toward a superior . It is suitable for a superior to take precedence of a subordinate , without any remark ; but not for an inferior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is proper for a superior to use language and manners of freedom and familiarity , which would be improper from a subordinate to a superior . The want of due regard to these proprieties occasions a great defect in American manners . It is very common to hear children talk to their parents in a style proper only between companions and equals ; so , also , the young address their elders ; those employed , their employers ; and domestics , the members of the family and their visitors , in a style which is inappropriate to their relative positions . But courteous address is required not merely toward superiors ; every person desires to be thus treated , and therefore the law of benevolence demands such demeanor toward all whom we meet in the social intercourse of life . " Be ye courteous , " is the direction of the apostle in reference to our treatment of all . Good manners can be successfully cultivated only in early life and in the domestic circle . There is nothing which depends so much upon habit as the constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grows up without forming such habits , it is very rarely the case that they can be formed at a later period . The feeling that it is of little consequence how we behave at home if we conduct ourselves properly abroad , is a very fallacious one . Persons who are careless and ill-bred at home may imagine that they can assume good manners abroad ; but they mistake . Fixed habits of tone , manner , language , and movements can not be suddenly altered ; and those who are ill-bred at home , even when they try to hide their bad habits , are sure to violate many of the obvious rules of propriety , and yet be unconscious of it . And there is nothing which would so effectually remove prejudice against our democratic institutions as the general cultivation of good-breeding in the domestic circle . Good manners are the exterior of benevolence , the minute and constant exhibitions of " peace and good-will ; " and the nation , as well as the individual , which most excels in the external demonstration , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is only the training of the family state according to its true end and aim that is to secure to woman her true position and rights . When the family is instituted by marriage , it is man who is the head and chief magistrate by the force of his physical power and requirement of the chief responsibility ; not less is he so according to the Christian law , by which , when differences arise , the husband has the deciding control , and the wife is to obey . " Where love is , there is no law ; " but where love is not , the only dignified and peaceful course is for the wife , however much his superior , to " submit , as to God and not to man . " But this power of nature and of religion , given to man as the controlling head , involves the distinctive duty of the family state , self-sacrificing love . The husband is to " honor " the wife , to love her as himself , and thus account her wishes and happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than this , he is to love her " as Christ loved the Church ; " that is , he is to " suffer " for her , if need be , in order to support and elevate and ennoble her . The father then is to set the example of self-sacrificing love and devotion ; and the mother , of Christian obedience when it is required . Every boy is to be trained for his future domestic position by labor and sacrifices for his mother and sisters . It is the brother who is to do the hardest and most disagreeable work , to face the storms and perform the most laborious drudgeries . In the family circle , too , he is to give his mother and sister precedence in all the conveniences and comforts of home life . It is only those nations where the teachings and example of Christ have had most influence that man has ever assumed his obligations of self-sacrificing benevolence in the family . And even in Christian communities , the duty of wives to obey their husbands has been more strenuously urged than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Christ loved the Church . " Here it is needful to notice that the distinctive duty of obedience to man does not rest on women who do not enter the relations of married life . A woman who inherits property , or who earns her own livelihood , can institute the family state , adopt orphan children and employ suitable helpers in training them ; and then to her will appertain the authority and rights that belong to man as the head of a family . And when every woman is trained to some self-supporting business , she will not be tempted to enter the family state as a subordinate , except by that love for which there is no need of law . These general principles being stated , some details in regard to domestic manners will be enumerated . In the first place , there should be required in the family a strict attention to the rules of precedence , and those modes of address appropriate to the various relations to be sustained . Children should always be required to offer their superiors , in age or station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always address them in a respectful tone and manner . The custom of adding , " Sir , " or " Ma'am , " to " Yes , " or " No , " is valuable , as a perpetual indication of a respectful recognition of superiority . It is now going out of fashion , even among the most well bred people ; probably from a want of consideration of its importance . Every remnant of courtesy of address , in our customs , should be carefully cherished , by all who feel a value for the proprieties of good breeding . If parents allow their children to talk to them , and to the grown persons in the family , in the same style in which they address each other , it will be in vain to hope for the courtesy of manner and tone which good breeding demands in the general intercourse of society . In a large family , where the elder children are grown up , and the younger are small , it is important to require the latter to treat the elder in some sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children to assume airs of equality ; and if they are allowed to treat one class of superiors in age and character disrespectfully , they will soon use the privilege universally . This is the reason , why the youngest children of a family are most apt to be pert , forward , and unmannerly . Another point to be aimed at is , to require children always to acknowledge every act of kindness and attention , either by words or manner . If they are so trained as always to make grateful acknowledgments , when receiving favors , one of the objectionable features in American manners will be avoided . Again , children should be required to ask leave , whenever they wish to gratify curiosity , or use an article which belongs to another . And if cases occur , when they can not comply with the rules of good-breeding , as , for instance , when they must step between a person and the fire , or take the chair of an older person , they should be taught either to ask leave , or to offer an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not , in all cases , be understood and applied by children in its widest extent . It is that which requires us to avoid all remarks which tend to embarrass , vex , mortify , or in any way wound the feelings of another . To notice personal defects ; to allude to others ' faults , or the faults of their friends ; to speak disparagingly of the sect or party to which a person belongs ; to be inattentive when addressed in conversation ; to contradict flatly ; to speak in contemptuous tones of opinions expressed by another ; all these are violations of the rules of good-breeding , which children should be taught to regard . Under this head comes the practice of whispering and staring about , when a teacher , or lecturer , or clergyman is addressing a class or audience . Such inattention is practically saying that what the person is uttering is not worth attending to ; and persons of real good-breeding always avoid it . Loud talking and laughing in a large assembly , even when no exercises are going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face a person who is addressing you , are deemed marks of ill-breeding . Another branch of good manners relates to the duties of hospitality . Politeness requires us to welcome visitors with cordiality ; to offer them the best accommodations ; to address conversation to them ; and to express , by tone and manner , kindness and respect . Offering the hand to all visitors at one 's own house is a courteous and hospitable custom ; and a cordial shake of the hand , when friends meet , would abate much of the coldness of manner ascribed to Americans . Another point of good breeding refers to the conventional rules of propriety and good taste . Of these , the first class relates to the avoidance of all disgusting or offensive personal habits : such as fingering the hair ; obtrusively using a toothpick , or carrying one in the mouth after the needful use of it ; cleaning the nails in presence of others ; picking the nose ; spitting on carpets ; snuffing instead of using a handkerchief , or using the article in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as some men do , to tend them on the knee , or to finger them : all these tricks , either at home or in society , children should be taught to avoid . Another topic , under this head , may be called table manners . To persons of good-breeding , nothing is more annoying than violations of the conventional proprieties of the table . Reaching over another person 's plate ; standing up , to reach distant articles , instead of asking to have them passed ; using one 's own knife and spoon for butter , salt , or sugar , when it is the custom of the family to provide separate utensils for the purpose ; setting cups with the tea dripping from them , on the table-cloth , instead of the mats or small plates furnished ; using the table-cloth instead of the napkins ; eating fast , and in a noisy manner ; putting large pieces in the mouth ; looking and eating as if very hungry , or as if anxious to get at certain dishes ; sitting at too great a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knife and fork on the table-cloth , instead of on the edge of the plate ; picking the teeth at table : all these particulars children should be taught to avoid . It is always desirable , too , to train children , when at table with grown persons , to be silent , except when addressed by others ; or else their chattering will interrupt the conversation and comfort of their elders . They should always be required , too , to wait in silence , till all the older persons are helped . When children are alone with their parents , it is desirable to lead them to converse and to take this as an opportunity to form proper conversational habits . But it should be a fixed rule that , when strangers are present , the children are to listen in silence and only reply when addressed . Unless this is secured , visitors will often be condemned to listen to puerile chattering , with small chance of the proper attention due to guests and superiors in age and station . Children should be trained , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , not only to put their hair , face , and hands in neat order , but also their nails , and to habitually attend to this latter whenever they wash their hands . There are some very disagreeable tricks which many children practice even in families counted well-bred . Such , for example , are drumming with the fingers on some piece of furniture , or humming a tune while others are talking , or interrupting conversation by pertinacious questions , or whistling in the house instead of out-doors , or speaking several at once and in loud voices to gain attention . All these are violations of good-breeding , which children should be trained to avoid , lest they should not only annoy as children , but practice the same kind of ill manners when mature . In all assemblies for public debate , a chairman or moderator is appointed whose business it is to see that only one person speaks at a time , that no one interrupts a person when speaking , that no needless noises are made , and that all indecorums are avoided . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Children should be encouraged freely to use lungs and limbs out-doors , or in hours for sport in the house . But at other times , in the domestic circle , gentle tones and manners should be cultivated . The words gentleman and gentlewoman came originally from the fact that the uncultivated and ignorant classes used coarse and loud tones , and rough words and movements ; while only the refined circles habitually used gentle tones and gentle manners . For the same reason , those born in the higher circles were called " of gentle blood . " Thus it came that a coarse and loud voice , and rough , ungentle manners , are regarded as vulgar and plebeian . All these things should be taught to children , gradually , and with great patience and gentleness . Some parents , with whom good manners are a great object , are in danger of making their children perpetually uncomfortable , by suddenly surrounding them with so many rules that they must inevitably violate some one or other a great part of the time . It is much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and persevering with these , till a habit is formed , and then take a few more , thus making the process easy and gradual . Otherwise , the temper of children will be injured ; or , hopeless of fulfilling so many requisitions , they will become reckless and indifferent to all . If a few brief , well-considered , and sensible rules of good manners could be suspended in every school-room , and the children all required to commit them to memory , it probably would do more to remedy the defects of American manners and to advance universal good-breeding than any other mode that could be so easily adopted . But , in reference to those who have enjoyed advantages for the cultivation of good manners , and who duly estimate its importance , one caution is necessary . Those who never have had such habits formed in youth are under disadvantages which no benevolence of temper can altogether remedy . They may often violate the tastes and feelings of others , not from a want of proper regard for them , but from ignorance of custom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or from other causes which demand forbearance and sympathy , rather than displeasure . An ability to bear patiently with defects in manners , and to make candid and considerate allowance for a want of advantages , or for peculiarities in mental habits , is one mark of the benevolence of real good-breeding . The advocates of monarchical and aristocratic institutions have always had great plausibility given to their views , by the seeming tendencies of our institutions to insubordination and bad manners . And it has been too indiscriminately conceded , by the defenders of the latter , that such are these tendencies , and that the offensive points in American manners are the necessary result of democratic principles . But it is believed that both facts and reasoning are in opposition to this opinion . The following extract from the work of De Tocqueville , the great political philosopher of France , exhibits the opinion of an impartial observer , when comparing American manners with those of the English , who are confessedly the most aristocratic of all people . He previously remarks on the tendency of aristocracy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class , and less so toward those of lower degree ; and he then contrasts American manners with the English , claiming that the Americans are much the more affable , mild , and social . " In America , where the privileges of birth never existed and where riches confer no peculiar rights on their possessors , men acquainted with each other are very ready to frequent the same places , and find neither peril nor disadvantage in the free interchange of their thoughts . If they meet by accident , they neither seek nor avoid intercourse ; their manner is therefore natural , frank , and open . " " If their demeanor is often cold and serious , it is never haughty or constrained . " But an " aristocratic pride is still extremely great among the English ; and as the limits of aristocracy are still ill-defined , every body lives in constant dread , lest advantage should be taken of his familiarity . Unable to judge , at once , of the social position of those he meets , an Englishman prudently avoids all contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered should draw them into an unsuitable acquaintance ; they dread civilities , and they avoid the obtrusive gratitude of a stranger , as much as his hatred . " Thus , facts seem to show that when the most aristocratic nation in the world is compared , as to manners , with the most democratic , the judgment of strangers is in favor of the latter . And if good manners are the outward exhibition of the democratic principle of impartial benevolence and equal rights , surely the nation which adopts this rule , both in social and civil life , is the most likely to secure the desirable exterior . The aristocrat , by his principles , extends the exterior of impartial benevolence to his own class only ; the democratic principle requires it to be extended to all . There is reason , therefore , to hope and expect more refined and polished manners in America than in any other land ; while all the developments of taste and refinement , such as poetry , music , painting , sculpture , and architecture , it may be expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here as in any other nation . If this country increases in virtue and intelligence , as it may , there is no end to the wealth which will pour in as the result of our resources of climate , soil , and navigation , and the skill , industry , energy , and enterprise of our countrymen . This wealth , if used as intelligence and virtue dictate , will furnish the means for a superior education to all classes , and every facility for the refinement of taste , intellect , and feeling . Moreover , in this country , labor is ceasing to be the badge of a lower class ; so that already it is disreputable for a man to be " a lazy gentleman . " And this feeling must increase , till there is such an equalization of labor as will afford all the time needful for every class to improve the many advantages offered to them . Already through the munificence of some of our citizens , there are literary and scientific advantages offered to all classes , rarely enjoyed elsewhere . In most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , now offered to the poorest classes , often without charge , surpass what , some years ago , most wealthy men could purchase for any price . And it is believed that a time will come when the poorest boy in America can secure advantages , which will equal what the heir of the proudest peerage can now command . The records of the courts of France and Germany , ( as detailed by the Duchess of Orleans , ) in and succeeding the brilliant reign of Louis the Fourteenth  --  a period which was deemed the acme of elegance and refinement  --  exhibit a grossness , a vulgarity , and a coarseness , not to be found among the very lowest of our respectable poor . And the biography of the English Beau Nash , who attempted to reform the manners of the gentry , in the times of Queen Anne , exhibits violations of the rules of decency among the aristocracy , which the commonest yeoman of this land would feel disgraced in perpetrating . This shows that our lowest classes , at this period , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred years ago ; and another century may show the lowest classes , in wealth , in this country , attaining as high a polish as adorns those who now are leaders of good manners in the courts of kings . CHAPTER XVI . THE PRESERVATION OF GOOD TEMPER IN THE HOUSEKEEPER . There is nothing which has a more abiding influence on the happiness of a family than the preservation of equable and cheerful temper and tones in the housekeeper . A woman who is habitually gentle , sympathizing , forbearing , and cheerful , carries an atmosphere about her which imparts a soothing and sustaining influence , and renders it easier for all to do right , under her administration , than in any other situation . The writer has known families where the mother 's presence seemed the sunshine of the circle around her ; imparting a cheering and vivifying power , scarcely realized till it was withdrawn . Every one , without thinking of it , or knowing why it was so , experienced a peaceful and invigorating influence as soon as he entered the sphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindness and sympathy . On the contrary , many a good housekeeper , ( good in every respect but this , ) by wearing a countenance of anxiety and dissatisfaction , and by indulging in the frequent use of sharp and reprehensive tones , more than destroys all the comfort which otherwise would result from her system , neatness , and economy . There is a secret , social sympathy which every mind , to a greater or less degree , experiences with the feelings of those around , as they are manifested by the countenance and voice . A sorrowful , a discontented , or an angry countenance produces a silent , sympathetic influence , imparting a sombre shade to the mind , while tones of anger or complaint still more effectually jar the spirits . No person can maintain a quiet and cheerful frame of mind while tones of discontent and displeasure are sounding on the ear . We may gradually accustom ourselves to the evil till it is partially diminished ; but it always is an evil which greatly interferes with the enjoyment of the family state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a family seems to awaken a slight apprehension in every mind around , as if each felt in danger of a reproof , for something either perpetrated or neglected . A woman who should go around her house with a small stinging snapper , which she habitually applied to those whom she met , would be encountered with feelings very much like those which are experienced by the inmates of a family where the mistress often uses her countenance and voice to inflict similar penalties for duties neglected . Yet there are many allowances to be made for housekeepers , who sometimes imperceptibly and unconsciously fall into such habits . A woman who attempts to carry out any plans of system , order , and economy , and who has her feelings and habits conformed to certain rules , is constantly liable to have her plans crossed , and her taste violated , by the inexperience or inattention of those about her . And no housekeeper , whatever may be her habits , can escape the frequent recurrence of negligence or mistake , which interferes with her plans . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world who have such incessant trials of temper , and temptations to be fretful , as American housekeepers . For a housekeeper 's business is not , like that of the other sex , limited to a particular department , for which previous preparation is made . It consists of ten thousand little disconnected items , which can never be so systematically arranged that there is no daily jostling somewhere . And in the best-regulated families , it is not unfrequently the case that some act of forgetfulness or carelessness , from some member , will disarrange the business of the whole day , so that every hour will bring renewed occasion for annoyance . And the more strongly a woman realizes the value of time , and the importance of system and order , the more will she be tempted to irritability and complaint . The following considerations may aid in preparing a woman to meet such daily crosses with even a cheerful temper and tones . In the first place , a woman who has charge of a large household should regard her duties as dignified , important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be elevated and cheered by a sense of far-reaching influence and usefulness . A woman who feels that she is a cipher , and that it makes little difference how she performs her duties , has far less to sustain and invigorate her , than one who truly estimates the importance of her station . A man who feels that the destinies of a nation are turning on the judgment and skill with which he plans and executes , has a pressure of motive and an elevation of feeling which are great safeguards against all that is low , trivial , and degrading . So , an American mother and housekeeper who rightly estimates the long train of influence which will pass down to thousands , whose destinies , from generation to generation , will be modified by those decisions of her will which regulate the temper , principles , and habits of her family , must be elevated above petty temptations which would otherwise assail her . Again , a housekeeper should feel that she really has great difficulties to meet and overcome . A person who wrongly thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guard as one who rightly estimates the temptations which beset her . Nor can one who thinks that they are trifling difficulties which she has to encounter , and trivial temptations to which she must yield , so much enjoy the just reward of conscious virtue and self-control as one who takes an opposite view of the subject . A third method is , for a woman deliberately to calculate on having her best-arranged plans interfered with very often ; and to be in such a state of preparation that the evil will not come unawares . So complicated are the pursuits and so diverse the habits of the various members of a family , that it is almost impossible for every one to avoid interfering with the plans and taste of a housekeeper , in some one point or another . It is , therefore , most wise for a woman to keep the loins of her mind ever girt , to meet such collisions with a cheerful and quiet spirit . Another important rule is , to form all plans and arrangements in consistency with the means at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who has a heedless husband , and young children , and incompetent domestics , ought not to make such plans as one may properly form who will not , in so many directions , meet embarrassment . She must aim at just as much as she can probably attain , and no more ; and thus she will usually escape much temptation , and much of the irritation of disappointment . The fifth , and a very important consideration , is , that system , economy , and neatness are valuable , only so far as they tend to promote the comfort and well-being of those affected . Some women seem to act under the impression that these advantages must be secured , at all events , even if the comfort of the family be the sacrifice . True , it is very important that children grow up in habits of system , neatness , and order ; and it is very desirable that the mother give them every incentive , both by precept and example ; but it is still more important that they grow up with amiable tempers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with patience and cheerfulness ; and nothing has a greater influence to secure this than a mother 's example . Whenever , therefore , a woman can not accomplish her plans of neatness and order without injury to her own temper or to the temper of others , she ought to modify and reduce them until she can . The sixth method relates to the government of the tones of voice . In many cases , when a woman 's domestic arrangements are suddenly and seriously crossed , it is impossible not to feel some irritation . But it is always possible to refrain from angry tones . A woman can resolve that , whatever happens , she will not speak till she can do it in a calm and gentle manner . Perfect silence is a safe resort , when such control can not be attained as enables a person to speak calmly ; and this determination , persevered in , will eventually be crowned with success . Many persons seem to imagine that tones of anger are needful , in order to secure prompt obedience . But observation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all cases , reproof , administered in calm tones , would be better . A case will be given in illustration . A young girl had been repeatedly charged to avoid a certain arrangement in cooking . On one day , when company was invited to dine , the direction was forgotten , and the consequence was an accident , which disarranged every thing , seriously injured the principal dish , and delayed dinner for an hour . The mistress of the family entered the kitchen just as it occurred , and at a glance , saw the extent of the mischief . For a moment , her eyes flashed , and her cheeks glowed ; but she held her peace . After a minute or so , she gave directions in a calm voice , as to the best mode of retrieving the evil , and then left , without a word said to the offender . After the company left , she sent for the girl , alone , and in a calm and kind manner pointed out the aggravations of the case , and described the trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and herself . She then portrayed the future evils which would result from such habits of neglect and inattention , and the modes of attempting to overcome them ; and then offered a reward for the future , if , in a given time , she succeeded in improving in this respect . Not a tone of anger was uttered ; and yet the severest scolding of a practiced Xantippe could not have secured such contrition , and determination to reform , as were gained by this method . But similar negligence is often visited by a continuous stream of complaint and reproof , which , in most cases , is met either by sullen silence or impertinent retort , while anger prevents any contrition or any resolution of future amendment . It is very certain , that some ladies do carry forward a most efficient government , both of children and domestics , without employing tones of anger ; and therefore they are not indispensable , nor on any account desirable . Though some ladies of intelligence and refinement do fall unconsciously into such a practice , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scold ; and the further a woman departs from all approach to it , the more perfectly she sustains her character as a lady . Another method of securing equanimity , amid the trials of domestic life is , to cultivate a habit of making allowances for the difficulties , ignorance , or temptations of those who violate rule or neglect duty . It is vain , and most unreasonable , to expect the consideration and care of a mature mind in childhood and youth ; or that persons of such limited advantages as most domestics have enjoyed should practice proper self-control and possess proper habits and principles . Every parent and every employer needs daily to cultivate the spirit expressed in the divine prayer , " Forgive us our trespasses , as we forgive those who trespass against us . " The same allowances and forbearance which we supplicate from our Heavenly Father , and desire from our fellow-men in reference to our own deficiencies , we should constantly aim to extend to all who cross our feelings and interfere with our plans . The last and most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , by a constant belief in the influence of a superintending Providence . All persons are too much in the habit of regarding the more important events of life exclusively as under the control of Perfect Wisdom . But the fall of a sparrow , or the loss of a hair , they do not feel to be equally the result of his directing agency . In consequence of this , Christian persons who aim at perfect and cheerful submission to heavy afflictions , and who succeed to the edification of all about them , are sometimes sadly deficient under petty crosses . If a beloved child be laid in the grave , even if its death resulted from the carelessness of a domestic or of a physician , the eye is turned from the subordinate agent to the Supreme Guardian of all ; and to him they bow , without murmur or complaint . But if a pudding be burnt , or a room badly swept , or an errand forgotten , then vexation and complaint are allowed , just as if these events were not appointed by Perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , needs to cultivate the habitual feeling that all the events of her nursery and kitchen are brought about by the permission of our Heavenly Father , and that fretfulness or complaint in regard to these is , in fact , complaining at the appointments of God , and is really as sinful as unsubmissive murmurs amid the sorer chastisements of his hand . And a woman who cultivates this habit of referring all the minor trials of life to the wise and benevolent agency of a heavenly Parent , and daily seeks his sympathy and aid to enable her to meet them with a quiet and cheerful spirit , will soon find it the perennial spring of abiding peace and content . The power of religion to impart dignity and importance to the ordinary and seemingly petty details of domestic life , greatly depends upon the degree of faith in the reality of a life to come , and of its eternal results . A woman who is training a family simply with reference to this life may find exalted motives as she looks forward to unborn generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and skill . But one who truly and firmly believes that this life is but the beginning of an eternal career to every immortal inmate of her home , and that the formation of tastes , habits , and character , under her care , will bring forth fruits of good or ill , not only through earthly generations , but through everlasting ages ; such a woman secures a calm and exalted principle of action , which no earthly motives can impart . CHAPTER XVII . HABITS OF SYSTEM AND ORDER . Any discussion of the equality of the sexes , as to intellectual capacity , seems frivolous and useless , both because it can never be decided , and because there would be no possible advantage in the decision . But one topic , which is often drawn into this discussion , is of far more consequence ; and that is , the relative importance and difficulty of the duties a woman is called to perform . It is generally assumed , and almost as generally conceded , that a housekeeper 's business and cares are contracted and trivial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far less expansion of mind and vigor of intellect than the pursuits of the other sex . This idea has prevailed because women , as a mass , have never been educated with reference to their most important duties ; while that portion of their employments which is of least value has been regarded as the chief , if not the sole , concern of a woman . The covering of the body , the convenience of residences , and the gratification of the appetite , have been too much regarded as the chief objects on which her intellectual powers are to be exercised . But as society gradually shakes off the remnants of barbarism and the intellectual and moral interests of man rise , in estimation , above the merely sensual , a truer estimate is formed of woman 's duties , and of the measure of intellect requisite for the proper discharge of them . Let any man of sense and discernment become the member of a large household , in which a well-educated and pious woman is endeavoring systematically to discharge her multiform duties ; let him fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is probable he would coincide in the opinion that no statesman , at the head of a nation 's affairs , had more frequent calls for wisdom , firmness , tact , discrimination , prudence , and versatility of talent , than such a woman . She has a husband , to whose peculiar tastes and habits she must accommodate herself ; she has children whose health she must guard , whose physical constitutions she must study and develop , whose temper and habits she must regulate , whose principles she must form , whose pursuits she must guide . She has constantly changing domestics , with all varieties of temper and habits , whom she must govern , instruct , and direct ; she is required to regulate the finances of the domestic state , and constantly to adapt expenditures to the means and to the relative claims of each department . She has the direction of the kitchen , where ignorance , forgetfulness , and awkwardness are to be so regulated that the various operations shall each start at the right time , and all be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims of society to meet , visits to receive and return , and the duties of hospitality to sustain . She has the poor to relieve ; benevolent societies to aid ; the schools of her children to inquire and decide about ; the care of the sick and the aged ; the nursing of infancy ; and the endless miscellany of odd items , constantly recurring in a large family . Surely , it is a pernicious and mistaken idea , that the duties which tax a woman 's mind are petty , trivial , or unworthy of the highest grade of intellect and moral worth . Instead of allowing this feeling , every woman should imbibe , from early youth , the impression that she is in training for the discharge of the most important , the most difficult , and the most sacred and interesting duties that can possibly employ the highest intellect . She ought to feel that her station and responsibilities in the great drama of life are second to none , either as viewed by her Maker , or in the estimation of all minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the mother and housekeeper in a large family is the sovereign of an empire , demanding more varied cares , and involving more difficult duties , than are really exacted of her who wears a crown and professedly regulates the interests of the greatest nation on earth . There is no one thing more necessary to a housekeeper in performing her varied duties , than a habit of system and order ; and yet , the peculiarly desultory nature of women 's pursuits , and the embarrassments resulting from the state of domestic service in this country , render it very difficult to form such a habit . But it is sometimes the case that women who could and would carry forward a systematic plan of domestic economy do not attempt it , simply from a want of knowledge of the various modes of introducing it . It is with reference to such , that various modes of securing system and order , which the writer has seen adopted , will be pointed out . A wise economy is nowhere more conspicuous , than in a systematic apportionment of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , intellectual , social , and domestic nature , each having different relative claims on attention . Unless a person has some general plan of apportioning these claims , some will intrench on others , and some , it is probable , will be entirely excluded . Thus , some find religious , social , and domestic duties so numerous , that no time is given to intellectual improvement . Others find either social , or benevolent , or religious interests excluded by the extent and variety of other engagements . It is wise , therefore , for all persons to devise a systematic plan , which they will at least keep in view , and aim to accomplish ; and by which a proper proportion of time shall be secured for all the duties of life . In forming such a plan , every woman must accommodate herself to the peculiarities of her situation . If she has a large family and a small income , she must devote far more time to the simple duty of providing food and raiment than would be right were she in affluence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , to draw out any general plan , which all can adopt . But there are some general principles , which ought to be the guiding rules , when a woman arranges her domestic employments . These principles are to be based on Christianity , which teaches us to " seek first the kingdom of God , " and to deem food , raiment , and the conveniences of life , as of secondary account . Every woman , then , ought to start with the assumption , that the moral and religious interests of her family are of more consequence than any worldly concern , and that , whatever else may be sacrificed , these shall be the leading object , in all her arrangements , in respect to time , money , and attention . It is also one of the plainest requisitions of Christianity , that we devote some of our time and efforts to the comfort and improvement of others . There is no duty so constantly enforced , both in the Old and New Testament , as that of charity , in dispensing to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selecting objects of charity , the same rule applies to others as to ourselves ; their moral and religions interests are of the highest moment , and for them , as well as for ourselves , we are to " seek first the kingdom of God . " Another general principle is , that our intellectual and social interests are to be preferred to the mere gratification of taste or appetite . A portion of time , therefore , must be devoted to the cultivation of the intellect and the social affections . Another is , that the mere gratification of appetite is to be placed last in our estimate ; so that , when a question arises as to which shall be sacrificed , some intellectual , moral , or social advantage , or some gratification of sense , we should invariably sacrifice the last . As health is indispensable to the discharge of every duty , nothing which sacrifices that blessing is to be allowed in order to gain any other advantage or enjoyment . There are emergencies , when it is right to risk health and life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are exceptions , which do not militate against the general rule . Many persons imagine that , if they violate the laws of health , in order to attend to religious or domestic duties , they are guiltless before God . But such greatly mistake . We directly violate the law , " Thou shalt not kill , " when we do what tends to risk or shorten our own life . The life and happiness of all his creatures are dear to our Creator ; and he is as much displeased when we injure our own interests , as when we injure those of others . The idea , therefore , that we are excusable if we harm no one but ourselves , is false and pernicious . These , then , are some general principles , to guide a woman in systematizing her duties and pursuits . The Creator of all things is a Being of perfect system and order ; and , to aid us in our duty in this respect , he has divided our time , by a regularly returning day of rest from worldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days maybe subdivided to secure similar benefits . In doing this , a certain portion of time must be given to procure the means of livelihood , and for preparing food , raiment , and dwellings . To these objects , some must devote more , and others less , attention . The remainder of time not necessarily thus employed , might be divided somewhat in this manner : The leisure of two afternoons and evenings could be devoted to religious and benevolent objects , such as religious meetings , charitable associations , school visiting , and attention to the sick and poor . The leisure of two other days might be devoted to intellectual improvement , and the pursuits of taste . The leisure of another day might be devoted to social enjoyments , in making or receiving visits ; and that of another , to miscellaneous domestic pursuits , not included in the other particulars . It is probable that few persons could carry out such an arrangement very strictly ; but every one can make a systematic apportionment of time , and at least aim at accomplishing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outline , the time which they actually devote to these different objects , for the purpose of modifying any mistaken proportions . Without attempting any such systematic employment of time , and carrying it out , so far as they can control circumstances , most women are rather driven along by the daily occurrences of life ; so that , instead of being the intelligent regulators of their own time , they are the mere sport of circumstances . There is nothing which so distinctly marks the difference between weak and strong minds as the question , whether they control circumstances or circumstances control them . It is very much to be feared , that the apportionment of time actually made by most women exactly inverts the order required by reason and Christianity . Thus , the furnishing a needless variety of food , the conveniences of dwellings , and the adornments of dress , often take a larger portion of time than is given to any other object . Next after this , comes intellectual improvement ; and , last of all , benevolence and religion . It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give more time to earn a livelihood , and to prepare food , raiment , and dwellings , than , to any other object . But it may be asked , how much of the time , devoted to these objects , is employed in preparing varieties of food not necessary , but rather injurious , and how much is spent for those parts of dress and furniture not indispensable , and merely ornamental ? Let a woman subtract from her domestic employments all the time given to pursuits which are of no use , except as they gratify a taste for ornament , or minister increased varieties to tempt the appetite , and she will find that much which she calls " domestic duty , " and which prevents her attention to intellectual , benevolent , and religious objects , should be called by a very different name . No woman has a right to give up attention to the higher interests of herself and others , for the ornaments of person or the gratification of the palate . To a certain extent , these lower objects are lawful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they become selfish and degrading . Every woman , then , when employing her hands in ornamenting her person , her children , or her house , ought to calculate whether she has devoted as much time to the really more important wants of herself and others . If she has not , she may know that she is doing wrong , and that her system for apportioning her time and pursuits should be altered . Some persons endeavor to systematize their pursuits by apportioning them to particular hours of each day . For example , a certain period before breakfast , is given to devotional duties ; after breakfast , certain hours are devoted to exercise and domestic employments ; other hours , to sewing , or reading , or visiting ; and others , to benevolent duties . But in most cases , it is more difficult to systematize the hours of each day , than it is to secure some regular division of the week . In regard to the minutia of family work , the writer has known the following methods to be adopted . Monday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing for the labors of the week . Any extra cooking , the purchasing of articles to be used during the week , the assorting of clothes for the wash , and mending such as would otherwise be injured  --  these , and similar items , belong to this day . Tuesday is devoted to washing , and Wednesday to ironing . On Thursday , the ironing is finished off , the clothes are folded and put away , and all articles which need mending are put in the mending-basket , and attended to . Friday is devoted to sweeping and house-cleaning . On Saturday , and especially the last Saturday of every month , every department is put in order ; the casters and table furniture are regulated , the pantry and cellar inspected , the trunks , drawers , and closets arranged , and every thing about the house put in order for Sunday . By this regular recurrence of a particular time for inspecting every thing , nothing is forgotten till ruined by neglect . Another mode of systematizing relates to providing proper supplies of conveniences , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some ladies keep a large closet , in which are placed the tubs , pails , dippers , soap-dishes , starch , blueing , clothes-lines , clothes-pins , and every other article used in washing ; and in the same , or another place , is kept every convenience for ironing . In the sewing department , a trunk , with suitable partitions , is provided , in which are placed , each in its proper place , white thread of all sizes , colored thread , yarns for mending , colored and black sewing-silks and twist , tapes and bobbins of all sizes , white and colored welting-cords , silk braids and cords , needles of all sizes , papers of pins , remnants of linen and colored cambric , a supply of all kinds of buttons used in the family , black and white hooks and eyes , a yard measure , and all the patterns used in cutting and fitting . These are done up in separate parcels , and labeled . In another trunk , or in a piece-bag , such as has been previously described , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . A trunk , like the first mentioned , will save many steps , and often much time and perplexity ; while by purchasing articles thus by the quantity , they come much cheaper than if bought in little portions as they are wanted . Such a trunk should be kept locked , and a smaller supply for current use retained in a work-basket . A full supply of all conveniences in the kitchen and cellar , and a place appointed for each article , very much facilitate domestic labor . For want of this , much vexation and loss of time is occasioned while seeking vessels in use , or in cleansing those employed by different persons for various purposes . It would be far better for a lady to give up some expensive article in the parlor , and apply the money thus saved for kitchen conveniences , than to have a stinted supply where the most labor is to be performed , If our countrywomen would devote more to comfort and convenience , and less to show , it would be a great improvement . Expensive mirrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloomy , ill-furnished kitchen , not unfrequently are found under the same roof . Another important item in systematic economy is , the apportioning of regular employment to the various members of a family . If a housekeeper can secure the cooperation of all her family , she will find that " many hands make light work . " There is no greater mistake than in bringing up children to feel that they must be taken care of , and waited on by others , without any corresponding obligations on their part . The extent to which young children can be made useful in a family would seem surprising to those who have never seen a systematic and regular plan for utilizing their services . The writer has been in a family where a little girl , of eight or nine years of age , washed and dressed herself and young brother , and made their small beds , before breakfast ; set and cleared all the tables for meals , with a little help from a grown person in moving tables and spreading cloths ; while all the dusting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A brother of ten years old brought in and piled all the wood used in the kitchen and parlor , brushed the boots and shoes , went on errands , and took all the care of the poultry . They were children whose parents could afford to hire servants to do this , but who chose to have their children grow up healthy and industrious , while proper instruction , system , and encouragement made these services rather a pleasure than otherwise , to the children . Some parents pay their children for such services ; but this is hazardous , as tending to make them feel that they are not bound to be helpful without pay , and also as tending to produce a hoarding , money-making spirit . But where children have no hoarding propensities , and need to acquire a sense of the value of property , it may be well to let them earn money for some extra services rather as a favor . When this is done , they should be taught to spend it for others , as well as for themselves ; and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivated . There are some mothers who take pains to teach their boys most of the domestic arts which their sisters learn . The writer has seen boys mending their own garments and aiding their mother or sisters in the kitchen , with great skill and adroitness ; and , at an early age , they usually very much relish joining in such occupations . The sons of such mothers , in their college life , or in roaming about the world , or in nursing a sick wife or infant , find occasion to bless the forethought and kindness which prepared them for such emergencies . Few things are in worse taste than for a man needlessly to busy himself in women 's work ; and yet a man never appears in a more interesting attitude than when , by skill in such matters , he can save a mother or wife from care and suffering . The more a boy is taught to use his hands , in every variety of domestic employment , the more his faculties , both of mind and body , are developed ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The early training of New-England boys , in which they turn their hand to almost every thing , is one great reason of the quick perceptions , versatility of mind , and mechanical skill , for which that portion of our countrymen is distinguished . It is equally important that young girls should be taught to do some species of handicraft that generally is done by men , and especially with reference to the frequent emigration to new territories where well-trained mechanics are scarce . To hang wall-paper , repair locks , glaze windows , and mend various household articles , requires a skill in the use of tools which every young girl should acquire . If she never has any occasion to apply this knowledge and skill by her own hands , she will often find it needful in directing and superintending incompetent workmen . The writer has known one mode of systematizing the aid of the older children in a family , which , in some cases of very large families , it may be well to imitate . In the case referred to , when the oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister was given to her , as her special charge . She tended it , made and mended its clothes , taught it to read , and was its nurse and guardian , through all its childhood . Another infant was given to the next daughter , and thus the children were all paired in this interesting relation . In addition to the relief thus afforded to the mother , the elder children , were in this way qualified for their future domestic relations , and both older and younger bound to each other by peculiar ties of tenderness and gratitude . In offering these examples of various modes of systematizing , one suggestion may be worthy of attention . It is not unfrequently the case , that ladies , who find themselves cumbered with oppressive cares , after reading remarks on the benefits of system , immediately commence the task of arranging their pursuits , with great vigor and hope . They divide the day into regular periods , and give each hour its duty ; they systematize their work , and endeavor to bring every thing into a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find themselves baffled , discouraged , and disheartened , and finally relapse into their former desultory ways , in a sort of resigned despair . The difficulty , in such cases , is , that they attempt too much at a time . There is nothing which so much depends upon habit , as a systematic mode of performing duty ; and where no such habit has been formed , it is impossible for a novice to start , at once , into a universal mode of systematizing , which none but an adept could carry through . The only way for such persons is to begin with a little at a time . Let them select some three or four things , and resolutely attempt to conquer at these points . In time , a habit will be formed , of doing a few things at regular periods , and in a systematic way . Then it will be easy to add a few more ; and thus , by a gradual process , the object can be secured , which it would be vain to attempt by a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to success , in such an effort ; but where a woman lacks either the health or the energy to secure a period for devotional duties before breakfast , let her select that hour of the day in which she will be least liable to interruption , and let her then seek strength and wisdom from the only true Source . At this time , let her take a pen , and make a list of all the things which she considers as duties . Then , let a calculation be made , whether there be time enough , in the day or the week , for all these duties . If there be not , let the least important be stricken from the list , as not being duties , and therefore to be omitted . In doing this , let a woman remember that , though " what we shall eat , and what we shall think , and wherewithal we shall be clothed , " are matters requiring due attention , they are very apt to obtain a wrong relative importance , while intellectual , social , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eating , dressing , and household furniture and ornaments , take far too large a place in the estimate of relative importance ; and it is probable that most women could modify their views and practice , so as to come nearer to the Saviour 's requirements . No woman has a right to put a stitch of ornament on any article of dress or furniture , or to provide one superfluity in food , until she is sure she can secure time for all her social , intellectual benevolent , and religions duties . If a woman will take the trouble to make such a calculation as this , she will usually find that she has time enough to perform all her duties easily and well . It is impossible for a conscientious woman to secure that peaceful mind and cheerful enjoyment of life which all should seek , who is constantly finding her duties jarring with each other , and much remaining undone , which she feels that she ought to do . In consequence of this , there will be a secret uneasiness , which will throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be removed , till she so efficiently defines and regulates her duties that she can fulfill them all . And here the writer would urge upon young ladies the importance of forming habits of system , while unembarrassed with those multiplied cares which will make the task so much , more difficult and hopeless . Every young lady can systematize her pursuits , to a certain extent . She can have a particular day for mending her wardrobe , and for arranging her trunks , closets , and drawers . She can keep her work-basket , her desk at school , and all her other conveniences , in their proper places , and in regular order . She can have regular periods for reading , walking , visiting , study , and domestic pursuits . And by following this method in youth , she will form a taste for regularity and a habit of system , which will prove a blessing to her through life . XVIII . GIVING IN CHARITY . It is probable that there is no point of duty whereon conscientious persons differ more in opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decided views , than on the matter of charity . That we are bound to give some of our time , money , and efforts , to relieve the destitute , all allow . But , as to how much we are to give , and on whom our charities shall be bestowed , many a reflecting mind has been at a loss . Yet it seems very desirable that , in reference to a duty so constantly and so strenuously urged by the Supreme Ruler , we should be able so to fix metes and bounds , as to keep a conscience void of offense , and to free the mind from disquieting fears of deficiency . The writer has found no other topic of investigation so beset with difficulty , and so absolutely without the range of definite rules which can apply to all , in all circumstances . But on this , as on previous topics , there seem to be general principles , by the aid of which any candid mind , sincerely desirous of obeying the commands of Christ , however much self-denial may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own individual obligations ; so that when these are fulfilled , the mind may be at peace . But for a mind that is worldly , living mainly to seek its own pleasures instead of living to please God , no principles can be so fixed as not to leave a ready escape from all obligation . Such minds , either by indolence ( and consequent ignorance ) or by sophistry , will convince themselves that a life of engrossing self-indulgence , with perhaps the gift of a few dollars and a few hours of time , may suffice to fulfill the requisitions of the Eternal Judge . For such minds , no reasonings will avail , till the heart is so changed that to learn the will and follow the example of Jesus Christ become the leading objects of interest and effort . It is to aid those who profess to possess this temper of mind that the following suggestions are offered . The first consideration which gives definiteness to this subject is a correct view of the object for which we are placed in this world . A great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting on the supposition that the object of life is to secure as ranch as possible of all the various enjoyments placed within reach . Not so teaches reason or revelation . From these we learn that , though the happiness of his creatures is the end for which God created and sustains them , yet this happiness depends not on the various modes of gratification put within our reach , but mainly on character . A man may possess all the resources for enjoyment which this world can afford , and yet feel that " all is vanity and vexation of spirit , " and that he is supremely wretched . Another may be in want of all things , and yet possess that living spring of benevolence , faith , and hope , which will make an Eden of the darkest prison . In order to be perfectly happy , man must attain that character which Christ exhibited ; and the nearer he approaches it , the more will happiness reign in his breast . But what was the grand peculiarity of the character of Christ ? It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ; " He " went about doing good , " and this was his " meat and drink ; " that is , it was this which sustained the health and life of his mind , as food and drink sustain the health and life of the body . Now , the mind of man is so made that it can gradually be transformed into the same likeness . A selfish being , who , for a whole life , has been nourishing habits of indolent self-indulgence , can , by taking Christ as his example , by communion with him , and by daily striving to imitate his character and conduct , form such a temper of mind that " doing good " will become the chief and highest source of enjoyment . And this heavenly principle will grow stronger and stronger , until self-denial loses the more painful part of its character ; and then , living to make happiness will be so delightful and absorbing a pursuit , that all exertions , regarded as the means to this end , will be like the joyous efforts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the full hope of success . In this view of the subject , efforts and self-denial for the good of others are to be regarded not merely as duties enjoined for the benefit of others , but as the moral training indispensable to the formation of that character on which depends our own happiness . This view exhibits the full meaning of the Saviour 's declaration , " How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God ! " He had before taught that the kingdom of heaven consisted not in such enjoyments as the worldly seek , but in the temper of self-denying benevolence , like his own ; and as the rich have far greater temptations to indolent self-indulgence , they are far less likely to acquire this temper than those who , by limited means , are inured to some degree of self-denial . But on this point , one important distinction needs to be made ; and that is , between the self-denial which has no other aim than mere self-mortification , and that which is exercised to secure greater good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of monasticism , penances , and all other forms of asceticism ; the latter , only , is that which Christianity requires . A second consideration , which may give definiteness to this subject , is , that the formation of a perfect character involves , not the extermination of any principles of our nature , but rather the regulating of them , according to the rules of reason and religion ; so that the lower propensities shall always be kept subordinate to nobler principles . Thus we are not to aim at destroying our appetites , or at needlessly denying them , but rather so to regulate them that they shall best secure the objects for which they were implanted . We are not to annihilate the love of praise and admiration ; but so to control it that the favor of God shall be regarded more than the estimation of men . We are not to extirpate the principle of curiosity , which leads us to acquire knowledge ; but so to direct it , that all our acquisitions shall be useful and not frivolous or injurious . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has implanted no desires in our constitution which are evil and pernicious . On the contrary , all our constitutional propensities , either of mind or body , he designed we should gratify , whenever no evils would thence result , either to ourselves or others . Such passions as envy , selfish ambition , contemptuous pride , revenge , and hatred , are to be exterminated ; for they are either excesses or excrescences , not created by God , but rather the result of our own neglect to form habits of benevolence and self-control . In deciding the rules of our conduct , therefore , we are ever to bear in mind that the development of the nobler principles , and the subjugation of inferior propensities to them , is to be the main object of effort both for ourselves and for others . And in conformity with this , in all our plans we are to place religious and moral interests as first in estimation , our social and intellectual interests next , and our physical gratifications as subordinate to all . A third consideration is that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be regarded as necessaries , without which no other duties can be performed , yet a very large portion of the time spent by most persons in easy circumstances for food , raiment , and dwellings , is for mere superfluities ; which are right when they do not involve the sacrifice of higher interests , and wrong when they do . Life and health can be sustained in the humblest dwellings , with the plainest dress , and the simplest food ; and , after taking from our means what is necessary for life and health , the remainder is to be so divided , that the larger portion shall be given to supply the moral and intellectual wants of ourselves and others , together with the physical requirements of the destitute , and the smaller share to procure those additional gratifications of taste and appetite which are desirable but not indispensable . Mankind , thus far , have never made this apportionment of their means ; although , just as fast as they have risen from a savage state , mere physical wants have been made , to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important consideration is that , in urging the duty of charity and the prior claims of moral and religious objects , no rule of duty should be maintained which it would not be right and wise for all to follow . And we are to test the wisdom of any general rule by inquiring what would be the result if all mankind should practice according to it . In view of this , we are enabled to judge of the correctness of those who maintain that , to be consistent , men believing in the perils of all those of our race who are not brought under the influence of the Christian system should give up not merely the elegancies but all the superfluities of life , and devote the whole of their means not indispensable to life and health to the propagation of Christianity . But if this is the duty of any , it is the duty of all ; and we are to inquire what would be the result , if all conscientious persons gave up the use of all superfluities . Suppose that two millions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relinquished the use of every thing not absolutely necessary to life and health . Besides reducing the education of the people in all the higher walks of intellectual , social , and even moral development , to very narrow limits , it would instantly throw out of employment one half of the whole community . The writers , book-makers , manufacturers , mechanics , merchants agriculturists , and all the agencies they employ , would be beggared , and one half of those not reduced to poverty would be obliged to spend all their extra means in-simply supplying necessaries to the other half . The use of superfluities , therefore , to a certain extent , is as indispensable to promote industry , virtue , and religion , as any direct giving of money or time ; and it is owing entirely to a want of reflection and of comprehensive views , that any men ever make so great a mistake as is here exhibited . Instead , then , of urging a rule of duty which is at once irrational and impracticable , there is another course , which commends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the practice of intelligent men , they universally concede the principle , that our physical gratifications should always be made subordinate to social , intellectual , and moral advantages . And all that is required for the advancement of our whole race to the most perfect state of society is , simply , that men should act in agreement with this principle . And if only a very small portion of the most intelligent of our race should act according to this rule , under the control of Christian benevolence , the immense supplies furnished for the general good would be far beyond what any would imagine who had never made any calculations on the subject . In this nation alone , suppose the one million and more of professed followers of Christ should give a larger portion of their means for the social , intellectual , and moral wants of mankind , than for the superfluities that minister to their own taste , convenience , and appetite ; it would be enough to furnish all the schools , colleges , Bibles , ministers , and missionaries , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be far more than properly qualified agents to administer it could employ . But it may be objected that , though this view in the abstract looks plausible and rational , not one in a thousand can practically adopt it . How few keep any account , at all , of their current expenses ! How impossible it is to determine , exactly , what are necessaries and what are superfluities ! And in regard to women , how few have the control of an income , so as not to be bound by the wishes of a parent or a husband ! In reference to these difficulties , the first remark is , that we are never under obligations to do what is entirely out of our power ; so that those persons who can not regulate their expenses or their charities are under no sort of obligation to attempt it . The second remark is that , when a rule of duty is discovered , if we can not fully attain to it , we are bound to aim at it , and to fulfill it just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw it aside because we shall find some difficult cases when we come to apply it . The third remark is , that no person can tell how much can be done , till a faithful trial has been made . If a woman has never kept any accounts , nor attempted to regulate her expenditures by the right rule , nor used her influence with those that control her plans , to secure this object , she has no right to say how much she can or can not do , till after a fair trial has been made . In attempting such a trial , the following method can be taken . Let a woman , keep an account of all she spends , for herself and her family , for a year , arranging the items under three general heads . Under the first , put all articles of food , raiment , rent , wages , and all conveniences . Under the second , place all sums paid in securing an education , and books , and other intellectual advantages . Under the third head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the end of the year , the first and largest account will show the mixed items of necessaries and superfluities , which can be arranged so as to gain some sort of idea how much has been spent for superfluities and how much for necessaries . Then , by comparing what is spent for superfluities , with what is spent for intellectual and moral advantages , data will be gained for judging of the past and regulating the future . Does a woman say she can not do this ? let her think whether the offer of a thousand dollars , as a reward-for attempting it one year , would not make her undertake to do it ; and if so , let her decide , in her own mind , which is most valuable , a clear conscience , and the approbation of God , in this effort to do his will , or one thousand dollars . And let her do it , with this warning of the Saviour before her eyes  --  " No man can serve two masters . " " Ye can not serve God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we decide between superfluities and necessities , in this list ? It is replied , that we are not required to judge exactly , in all cases . Our duty is , to use the means in our power to assist us in forming a correct judgment ; to seek the divine aid in freeing our minds from indolence and selfishness ; and then to judge , as well as we can , in our endeavors rightly to apportion and regulate our expenses . Many persons seem to feel that they are bound to do better than they know how . But God is not so hard a master ; and after we have used all proper means to learn the right way , if we then follow it according to our ability , we do wrong to feel misgivings , or to blame ourselves , if results come out differently from what seems desirable . The results of our actions , alone , can never prove as deserving of blame . For men are often so placed that , owing to lack of intellect or means , it is impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of knowledge within our reach , and then to judge , with a candid and conscientious spirit , is all that God requires ; and when we have done this , and the event seems to come out wrong , we should never wish that we had decided otherwise . For this would be the same as wishing that we had not followed the dictates of judgment and conscience . As this is a world designed for discipline and trial , untoward events are never to be construed as indications of the obliquity of our past decisions . But it is probable that a great portion of the women of this nation can not secure any such systematic mode of regulating their expenses . To such , the writer would propose one inquiry : Can not you calculate how much time and money you spend for what is merely ornamental , and not necessary , for yourself , your children , and your house ? Can not you compare this with the time and money you spend for intellectual and benevolent purposes ? and will not this show the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not this brief rule , deducible from the principles before laid down , the one which should regulate you ? Every person does right in spending some portion of time and means in securing the conveniences and adornments of taste ; but the amount should never exceed what is spent in securing our own moral and intellectual improvement , nor what is spent in benevolent efforts to supply the physical and moral wants of our fellow-men . In making an examination on this subject , it is sometimes the case that a woman will count am//
