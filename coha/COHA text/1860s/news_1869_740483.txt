txt Governor HOFFMAN delivered . tin Friday , the address before the Union County Agricultural Society , at their annual Fair , in Kingston . We quote the following paragraphs from the report of the address published in the Albany IVIS our country , notwithsta7uling the great debt which rests upon it , can not fail to grow rich and prosperous , if our people will be economical . The extravagance of the age in which we live , however , must be checked , or , with the corruption and demoralization which attend it , will come disaster and distress . There is no estate so large that a spendthrift can not exhaust It . There is no people so powerful that extravagance and corruption can not destroy them . Our exports of the great staples will bring neither tuitional nor individual wealth , if they go only to pay for luxuries widen enervate and corrupt . Far be it from me to deny to any man or woman the enjoyment of anything which will contribute to his or her peace and happiness . But the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people owe , and what the people owe , earls individual owes , for we are sureties and bondsmen for our country and for each other . Bondsmen , indeed I and who is so much a bondsman Its the debtor ! There is no way to got out of debt but one , either for nations or for individuals . A man can not pay his debts by giving his note , nor can any Government pay its obligations by the issue of irredeemable paper . There is but 0110 standt and cf value , and that has been fixed by the common consent of the world , and by thastandard must all debtors ultimately be judged . As no quack remedies can remove deep-seated diseases , so no ingeniously devised financial schemes can point out any but the one way to pay a nation 's debt . When a man has violated the laws of health and finds his system broken , and his powers weakened , there is no medical specific , which can save him . He must cease the practice of dissipation and folly . lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasted strength . lle must develop . as best lie can , his physical powers . So it is with our country , which has been called upon for profuse expenditures . It has within it elements of strength and the means to meet all its obligations , fully and fairly , if it will , but it must diminish its expenses as well as increase its re V0111108 . It must stop waste and develop all Its resources . It must labor in earnest and economize in earliest . If a farmer owes $1,000 , the payment of which is secured by a mortgage , lie can pay it If he will , by his labor and out of his land . It he neglect his farm ; if he and his Fens and daughters are extravagant and wasteful ; if family discord destroy the peace of his home ; if a reckless dissipation characterizes his life , he will add to his obligation and will not pay his debt . So with the nation . The labor of the country , and the great area of its territory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can sustain the credit of the Government and pay its obligations . But if the people , who are the laborers , are extravagant and idle ; it strife , discord and contention shall prevail among them ; if passion and folly , instead of judgment and good sense , shall control them ; if hatred , rather than love of one another and of their common country shall move them , then the national honor will be imperiled . I have read many learned essays on the question of " How to Pay the National Debt . " when men ask me what financial theory I have , I answer , " Only on and it is this : A union of people and of States ; a hearty joining together of all sections , in the common work of reestablishment and restoration ; industry , prudence , retrenchment and economy . Increase our earnings ; diminish your expenditures. ave when you can and spend only when you must , and lot the whole world see that you mean to pay your debts . " If the people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not rise higher than its source . The representative will not be hotter than those he represents . Other peoples have sunk under the crushing weight of individual and general extravagance and folly . Let us take warning by their examples , and in doing so avoid their fate .
