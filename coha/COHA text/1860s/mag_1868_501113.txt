Do you know what the transfer work is on a bank-note ? If you do not , it would be useless to attempt to explain it minutely , unless I desired to use the whole space allotted to my article for that purpose . But I may be able , perhaps , briefly to impart a glimmering idea of it . If you happen to have a national bank-note or bond in your pocket , take it out and examine it . You will see that on both sides it is a labyrinth of delicatelyengraved lines , some of them so fine that you need a magnifying glass to observe clearly how beautiful and accurate they are . But do not suppose that all this work has been engraved especially for this note . Look , for i*stance , at the border . You will see that it is a repetition by sections of the same lines . The transferrer had a piece of engraving or lathe-work on a steel-plate , which he may have used fn whole or part on fifty other bills or checks . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty border . So , by process of hardening and softening of metals and concentration of great lever powers , he presses these fine lines , elevated or depressed , from one metal surface to another , filing off all which he does not want , until the section he wishes is transferred to the plate of the bill , and until this section is repeated again and again to the end of the border . Then , suppose he wishes to make a round groundwork , with fine lines , in which the figure representing the denomination shall be placed . From the same engraving , or some other , he takes a wedge-shaped sixteenth section , it may be , and , by repeating this sixteen times around a common centre , the circumference is complete . And all these sections , in the border and in the round groundwork , are so accurately joined that you do not know where the point of separation was . Again , it may be that the workman files away a place in the centre of this round figure for the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note , and that he has this character also ready engraved to transfer to this space . So by the different combinations of a few engravings he makes all sorts of notes , checks , drafts , and bonds , with scarcely a feature that can be recognized as similar by a casual observer , while scarcely anything , unless it be the name or the date , has been engraved expressly for any one of them . Even the letters of the name and the figures of the date may be old ones also transferred to the plate . The plate from which this beautiful bill or bond is printed is not at all an original engraving , but a different combination of different parts of old engravings that have been used a hundred times before . If this work had been attempted to be done especially for this bill or bond , it would have taken an amount of labor and time that would astonish you . And after all it would have been no better for the popular eye than this . Now a great proportion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our essays , and even our books , are made up of old quotations , old metaphors , old jokes , old ideas , old clusters of words , old forms of treating subjects , // transferred by small sections and in new combinations to new pages . There is very little new work put in . One good reason for this is that there is scarcely a strictly new thing that can be said , and that those who strive for the original and think they have attained it are apt to find that some one has done something very similar in former years . Another good reason is that these old sayings have been culled as the best from all the ages that are past , and are such that one man , always excepting Shakespeare , uttered only a very few of them in a lifetime . A saying , too , which has been repeated a thousand times is just as new to a person who never read it , as one which is put in type for the first time . Those pertinent old quotations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and localities , will never lose their potency , for the evident reason that by the time one generation learns them , it dies and they remain quite as new to the next . The old man to whom all these things are hackneyed , leaves a son , nevertheless , to whom they give just as much delight as though his ancestors had not been repeating them to their contemporaries for two hundred years back . I remember the pleasurable sensation with which I first heard the lineThough the mills of God grind slowly , yet they grind exceeding small . I did not know how many times it had been quoted , or who wrote it . I did not know , what I afterward read in a newspaper , that it had been ascribed to the German of Von Logau , might also be found in the Spanish of Padre de Isla 's " Friar Gerund , " and had trickled down the centuries , through many languages , as most of the best thoughts have done . I heard a lecture this winter which was merely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jokes , all of which I can conscientiously say I had heard at least half a dozen times . It was a marked success , and a very intelligent audience applauded and enjoyed it more than any entertainment of the kind that I have attended for a long time . Another lectuter , perhaps , with a grim determination to be original , would have put a collection of stale platitudes about some abstruse subject into inane words , and would have been intensely dull to listen to . I have no doubt , however , that at this lecture of which I speak , there was some simple old duffer in the audience , to whom some one of the jokes was familiar , who , with mild contempt , pluming himself on his knowledge , remarked , " Oh ! that 's old . " But he seemed not to know that all the rest which he enjoyed so much was just as old , and that this joke , which he thought stale , was deemed by most of the audience to be the best in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is to be decided entirely by what happens to be familiar to the hearer . Emerson says , that a man is original now-a-days in proportion to the amount which he steals from Plato . The great point in quoting is to quote from out-ofthe-way books which but few have seen . To introduce a familiar quotation , the following formula is effective : " The reader well remembers the beautiful passage , " etc . Something of this kind disarms those who have read it before ; and , strange to say , flatters those who have not . I think you will be surprised , in looking at our current literature , to see how much transfer work there is in it . Did you ever happen to discover an article about songs that did not quote that saying of Fletcher of Saltoun , which I have seen also attributed to Sir Philip Sidney , " Let who will make the laws of a people if I write their songs ; " or one about poets that did not quote " Poeta nascitur non fit ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir John SucklingHer // feet beneath her petticoat , Like littte mice stole in and out , As if they feared the light ; or one on names that did not sayA rose by any other name would smell as sweet ; or one about unappreciated worth that did not draw upon Gray 's Elegy for the stanza commencingFull many a gem of purest ray serene ; or one about vanity that did not say , with Burns0 wad some power the giftie gie us To see oursels as ithers see us , etc. ; or one about peace that did not remark , with Milton , that " Peace hath her victories , " etc. ; or one about music that did not say that it had charms to soothe the savage breast , or that the individual who had none of it in his soul was fit for treason , stratagems , and spoils ; or one on education that did not refer , with Thomson , to teaching the young idea how to shoot ; or one about tenement house that did not inform the reader that one-half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one on the Great West that did not tell us that Bishop Berkeley said " Westward the course of empire takes its way " ( the course of empire in this instance being as peculiar as " the course of true love ; " ) or any reference to soldiers and ladies that did not insist that none but the brave deserve the fair ; or any argument about a thing being impossible that did not refer to Mrs. Partington 's attempt to sweep the Atlantic Ocean out of her door with a broom ; or anything about trans-continental telegraphic enterprises that did not refer to Puck putting a girdle round the earth ; or anything about running away from battle that did not quote " He that fights and runs away , " etc. ; or any reference to anybody being vulnerable in one place that did not call to mind Achilles 's heel ; or anything about a decisive crisis that did not speak of crossing the Rubicon . If you ever happened to see any such article as I have suggested , you may be sure that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a professional writer . But this transfer work is even more effective in addresses and orations . There are a hundred quotations , with which we are all familiar , that never fail to give great delight to a promiscuous audience : Breathes there a man with soul so dead , etc. , and For freedom 's battle once begun , Bequeathed from bleeding sire to son , Though battled oft , is always won , may grow hackneyed to the learned and cultivated few , but never to the populace . How few original figures of speech there are printed . This department of literature is pretty much all transfer work . Some metaphors seem to be like wine , and to grow better with age ; and those which have been in use from the earliest days of literature are the ones which call forth the most profound admiration , when falling from the pulpit , and the loudest applause when uttered in the lyceum or on the political forum . There is nothing finer with which a political orator can enliven his peroration than that good old metaphor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storms , and in imminent danger of being engulpbed unless his candidate is called to the helm , in which case the grand // old vessel will be guided safely through the threatening billows , and anchor before long in the peaceful harbor of prosperity and never-fading glory . Let any youthful orator look over his speech , and observe critically how many of his figures have been the common property of every public speaker for the last forty years , and how many are drawn , original , from his own actual experience . I need not say that he is always entirely unprepared . He commences , very probably , hy stating that language is inadequate to express his emotions on the present occasion . But these emotions , which language is inadequate to express , are only the counterpart of those scenes in the novels which beggar description , and of those feelings which can better be imagined than described . The orator then ventures the statement that our beloved country has recently been convulsed by a terrible civil war , or that its institutions have been shaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After basking for eighty years in the sunshine of prosperity , we were suddenly overshadowed by the dark cloud of adversity . In pursuing this train of thought , he remarks that traitor hands have attempted to overthrow the grandest structure of human government upon which the sun ever shone . Sometimes he prefers to call it the fairest fabric of human government under the blue vault of heaven . There are several approved forms of this idea ; but he is sure to use it in some shape . He does not know what a yeoman is , and he never saw a plough in the furrow ; but , notwithstanding this , he goes on to relate , in glowing language , that the hardy yeomen of the land , leaving the plough in the furrow , sprang forward to the rescue of the imperilled commonwealth . Sometimes it is the lion-hearted yeomanry who spring forward , and sometimes they have hearts of oak and nerves of steel ; sometimes they rush to the breach ; sometimes they swear by their altars and their fires ( the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relinquish the sword until success crowns their efforts , or better , until victory perches upon their banners . Then it is that the smouldering embers of patriotism are enlivened then it is that the beacon-fires of liberty are rekindled ; then it is that they lay their bands upon the altars of their common country , and swear something or other ; then it is that men are willing to die at the post of duty ; then it is that men have an eye single , or a single eye ( the latter form having become quite popular since Mr. Fernando Wood introduced it ) , to their country 's welfare ; then it is that men think of the days that tried men 's souls , when the fathers of the Republic threw off the yoke of oppression , or burst the galling chains of slavery , or broke the shackles that bound them , that they might hand down to us the fair fabric ( sometimes it is a priceless inheritance ; sometimes it is an heir-loom , or , if not , perhaps a sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of American liberty , to be by us transmitted to our children 's children unimpaired . There never was an eloquent patriotic speech that did not bring in our forefathers and our latest posterity . Sometimes the orator hears the voices of the former from the tombs ; sometimes he " methinks " he sees the form of Washington hovering over the hotly-contested battle-field ; sometimes he sees posterity looking down upon us from the pyramids of the future . The pyramids are supposed to be originally the property of Napoleon Bonaparte . Then it is that youths , over whose heads not more than sixteen summers have passed , fly to the theatre of action , and rush fearlessly into the embrace of death , or the jaws of death , as the case may be . Mr. Tennyson has the six hundred riding into the jaws of hell . Then it is that mourning is brought to every hearthstone // The youthful orator is totally unfamiliar with hearths ; yet he never fails to refer to them . He is more accustomed to stoves and heaters ; hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the destinies of the country hang trembling in the balance ; then it is that we have to lay our axe to the root of something , or destroy it , root and branch ; then it is that that banner is unfurled which was never trailed in the dust , and which is certain to float again triumphantly over every foot of our common territory , from the Androscoggin to the Rio Grande , and from the Atlantic to the Pacific . Sometimes the names of the States are used in this connection . Possibly at the present time the eloquent speaker is willing to pour oil upon the troubled waters . Yet he does not worship at the shrine of a miserable subserviency , and he will not have any unpopular measure forced down the throats of the people . The gentleman of the opposite party has said something offensive , and the orator hurls back the base insinuation into his very teeth with scorn and contempt . He denounces the influences which go forth from the coffers of monied monopolists ; for whatever coffers may be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He denounces those men who , goaded on by the spur of ambition , are sowing the seeds of corruption and sapping the foundations of public morality ; and he invariably knows of some Augean stable which ought to be cleansed . The Augean stable was known a long time ago . In " Dekkers Guls Home Booke " ( 1609 ) it is said , " To purge ( the world ) will be a sorer labor than the cleansing of Augeas 's stable , or the scouring of Moore ditch . " Moore ditch has gone out of memory ; but the Augean stable was immediately transmitted by poets and orators from generation to generation . Warton mentions another early use of it in Marston 's " Scoorge of Villanie " as follows : Oh that a satyr 's hand had force to pluck Some floodgate up to purge the world from muck ! Would God I could turn Aipheus 's river in To purge this Augean stahle from foul sin ! The orator , in the course of his speech , is also likely to refer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damocles , to the mirror of Archimedes , to the wealth of Crcesus , to lazar-houses , to the horrors of Tartarus , and to Scylla and Charybdis . He thinks , however , that we still live under the regis of a glorious constitution , and that we shall successfully solve the problem of republican government on this grand American continent . He then beholds various things in the dim vista of the future , among which there is likely to be a cloud-capped pinnacle , or mayhap , a beacon-light , and he sails away magnificently , with all his colors flying upon the ship of state . Now it is undeniable that a great proportion of the very young ladies and gentlemen who write poetry and stories never saw an aspen leaf or heard the notes of a nightingale , to recognize either of them . Yet it is quite safe to challenge any one to find anywhere in their poetry or prose that when their heroine was frightened she did not tremble like an aspen leaf ; or when she lifted up her voice in song that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is also an undeniable fact that no human corpse that is properly buried is ever eaten by worms , and yet with what ill-concealed delight they always remind us that we shall all be food for those detestable animals , and how pleased they are to speak ( more correctly ) of man himself being but a worm of the dust . You will also notice in the writings of these persons that though they are always climbing the mount of Parnassus or attempting to scale its heights , yet that they deem fame // to be but an empty bubble or like tbe baseless fabric of a dream . They love to study the book of nature , and hope with them often soars exultant , and subsequently folds her wings . Their youth build many air castles and poise the cup of happiness to their lips ; a certain number of summers or springs always pass over their heads ( which gave rise to a joke referring to the springs in ladies ' hoops ) after which time they fall a prey to Cupid 's arrows , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children perish like blossoms , while their old men are cut down by time 's scythe . They speak of those who are born as being ushered into existence , and of those who die as being launched into eternity . Their travellers always wend their way instead of going . Their ships , before embarking on the raging main , invariably weigh anchor and then walk the waters like a thing of life . Their cannon are loud-mouthed . Their streams , when frozen , are hound ' by winter 's icy chain . The twelve o'clock bell is the iron tongue of midnight . Their dancers are votaries of Terpsichore who trip the light fantastic toe . They frequently refer also to beetling crags , natal days , green-eyed jealousy , bitter tears , the king of day , the silver moon , forlorn hopes , adamantine souls , bowers of ease , the pangs of poverty , time 's effacing lingers , laughing sunbeams , false caitiffs , the fleeting breath , and to skeletons in the closet . In descriptions of natural scenes you will notice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , babbling brooks , blue skies , smiling sunlight , green verdure , cool retreats , umbrageous shadows , feathered songsters , and melodious warblers . You will notice that pretty girls are as beautiful as houris , with the form of 1-lebe , with rosy cheeks , pearly teeth , laughing eyes , dimpled chins , alabaster brows , and cherry or ruby or coral lips . Certainly there is no womanly beauty that has not been described over and over again ; and I suppose the descriptions of heroines from all the novels and short stories ever written would conform to six or eight models , that would include several eccentric types ; for the great mass would be included under four models . In the papers an accident is a frightful catastrophe , a street light is a terrible affray , an assault is a diabolical outrage , suicide is a rash act , a bad man is a fiend in human shape , a person who does anything bad succeeds in accomplishing his hellish design , fire is the devouring element , things are postponed on account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people are prevented from doing things by circumstances over which they have no control , and actors and actresses are deterred from playing by indisposition ( meaning that they are sick or indisposed to play ) . Considering the state of facts in our literature , of which I have spoken , it is very hard to say where quotation marks may be left out and where plagiarism begins . A phrase or quotation ought , after a while , to become common property , and educated people ought to know where it came from without using the formula of reference . The " Tribune " some time ago had the good sense to say of Mrs. Kemble : " Age can not wither her nor custom stale her infinite variety , " without quoting it or even putting it into different type to show that it should be versified. some writers indulge in quotation marks as profusely as young ladies in italics , and their writings bristle with inverted commas . They think that they thus display extensive reading , or make the particular words enclosed very funny or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for noting down what are called // plagiarisms . I suppose when Franklin copied the whole of Jeremy Taylor 's allegory against Intolerance , in his works , without any reference to its authorship , so that Lord Kaimes quoted it as Franklin 's own , that might seem to be a real case of plagiarism . But when Young spoke of " varieties ' fantastic toe , " I think he was right in not using quotation marks , though Milton had already spoken of the light fantastic toe . Longfellow has been accused of plagiarism , because he compared blossoms to snow , in " The Golden Legend : " White with blossoming cherry-trees , as if just covered with lightest snow , when Ward had said : For all the bloomy orchards glow As with a fall of rosy snow . Tennyson also has this passage in " Two Voices : " That all about the thorn will blow In tufts of rosy-tinted snow . Still worse , Longfellow is accused of borrowing : And all the broad leaves over me Clapped their little hands in glee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mountains , clapped their hands . If this is plagiarism , it is plagiarism to speak of " rosy cheeks . " A much more striking coincidence than hundreds that have been collated , to show how poets steal from each other , occurred in the " Atlantic Monthly " of July , i866 , under circumstances where , of course , there could not have been intentional plagiarism . Longfellow 's poem is " On Translating the Divina Coinmedia , " and Bryant 's on " The Death of Slavery . " Longfellow addresses the shade of the " poet saturnine " ( Dante ) : I enter and see thee in tJse gloom Of the long aisles , The congregation of the dead make room For thee to pass . Bryant addresses the shade of the " Great Wrong " which he sends , " accursed of God , " to its place where Lo , the fool phantoms , silent lie /ke gloom Of the flown ages , part toyleld i/we room . An incident is told by Mr. Thomas XV . Gibson , in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of how Poe once expressed his contempt of Campbell . " There , " said he , " is a line more often quoted than any other passage of his : Like angel visits few and far between , ' and he stole it bodily from Blair 's " Grave . " Not satisfied with the theft , he has spoiled it in the effort to disguise it . Blair wrote , Like angel visits short and far between . ' Campbell 's few and far between ' is mere tautology . " But on looking further , Poe would have found that Blair was no better than Campbell , for Norris , who died in 1711 , had written , " Like angels visits short and bright . " Blair changed " bright " into " far between , " and Campbell changed " short " into " few . " Probably the same idea might be traced far back into other languages . I have read , somewhere , a charming description of the manner in which Campbell originated the second line of the following : T is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming events cast their shadows before . If I remember rightly , he was worrying his mind all day for an appropriate line , and went to bed without it . Suddenly , in the darkness , as in a dream , this line // came to him , and he struck a light and transfixed it on paper . Yet some have accused him of plagiarism , because Paul says , in Hebrews x. i , " For the law having a shadow of good things to come , " etc. , and because Shelley , in his defence of poetry , says " Poets are the hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration ; the mirrors of the gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the present . " The question is , was it not an impulse of memory , instead of inspiration , as he supposed , which gave Campbell that line ? Many of us , no doubt , have a great admiration for Milton , because he wrote on his slate at school this " unpremeditated verse : The conscious water saw its God and blushed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also , as well as Milton , the credit for writing the same thing at school , while in Aaron Hill 's works we find the lines : See ! cried they , while in redduing tide it gushed , The bashful water saw its God and blushed . And in Richard Crashawe 's works we find : Lympha pudica Deum videt et erubuit . We are told that Talleyrand was the author of the saying that the true use of language is to conceal our thoughts ; yet Pycroft 's " Ways and Words of Men of Letters " quotes an article from a periodical published in i7* , in which is the passage , " The true use of speech is not so much to express our wants as to conceal them ; " and Dr. South , a long time before , had said in a sermon , " In short , this seems to be the true inward judgment of all our politic sages , that speech was given to the ordinary sort of men whereby to communicate their mind , but to wise men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says of such parallels : There is no borrowing ; there is no recollection or conscious appropriation ; there is , indeed , seldom any reason for either the thought being usually quite different . It is merely that certain words cohere in the mind , and fall into certain new places , like words in dreams . " The cups that cheer but not inebriate " are in Cowper and in Bishop Berkeley ; " With all thy faults I love thee still " is in Cowper and Churchill ; and Bolingbroke had previously written , in a letter to Dean Swift , " Dear Swift , with all thy faults , I love thee entirely . " Milton says , " And justify the ways of God to man , " and Pope says , " But vindicate the ways of God to man . " Byron and Waller both call the head " the palace of the soul . " Addison and Pope both have the lineRides on the whirlwind , and directs the storm . " The luxury of doing good " is in Goldsmith 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crabbe 's " Tales . " Waller , Byron , Moore , and I know not how many others , use the figure about the eagle seeing his own feather on the shaft that caused his death . Shakespeare has " The elements so mixed in him , " and Bryant " To mix forever with the elements , " the words being similar , but the idea and connection totally different . Hundreds of these parallels might be mentioned , and nine out of ten of them amount to about as much , as charges of plagiarism , as that against Swinburne , who is accused of borrowing the idea : I dare not always touch her , lest the kiss Leave my lips charred. // Married the baboon 's sister , Smacked bis lips , and then he kissed herKissed so hard he raised a blister ; She set up a yelL Many are explained on the theory of the " Pall Mall Gazette , " given above , or on that of Dr. Holmes : " A man can not always tell whether his ideas are stolen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse it , like a babe , in our bosom , and , if it looks pretty when it has grown older , we flatter ourselves that it has the family countenance . " Our jokes are also mostly transfer work . A great many of the funny things which we think are quite original now-a-days were all said centuries ago . Some of the best bulls attributed during recent years to Irishmen are to be found iz the works of Hierocles . Matreas , the Alexandrian , used to write comic historie* like " Knickerbocker 's History of New York , " containing learned inquiries as t why swans never get drunk with drinking ; and why the sun when he sets in th' sea does not set off swimming . A similar joke to that of Theodore Hook , who induced a large number of people to get into the circumscribed limits of J3erners street at the same time , and the hoax of the man in Wall street who looked fixedly into the sky and got a large crowd around him looking in the same direction at nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who hired a vast number of laborers and appointed them all to meet in a narrow street into which not a tenth of them could enter , and on whom , as they blocked up the way , this ancient humorist looked with great amusement . There is a joke older than the Crusades which is ascribed to Lady Vortley Montague and half a dozen others , to the effect that being rallied on the dirtiness of her hands she said , " Ah , you should see my feet ! " Another form of the joke represents that when some one said " What a dirty hand ! " she offered to bet that there was a dirtier in the room , and the bet being accepted she showed her other hand and won it . When I was quite a small boy I had strict moral and physiological notions about tight-lacing , and I invented out of my own head , positively , a pun which I thought remarkably fine , to this effect : " A small waist is a great waste-of life , health , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishment to find that , as long ago as Shakespeare 's time , Falstaff said " Indeed I am in the waist two yards about ; but I am now about no waste ; I am about thrift , " and that it was old even then , because the following occurs in Heywood 's " Epigrammes , " 1562 : " Where aize I least , husband ? " Quoth he , " In the waist ; Which cometh of this thou art vengeance straight-laced . Where am I biggest , wife ? " " In the waste , " quoth she , For all is waste in you as far as I can see . " It is quite safe to say , I think , that there is no pun on any word in the English languaze which has not already been made . The only chance for a new on 15 when a new word is coined . Of course they are printed in ephetneral pub ' 2-cations or are shot off in conversation , and go down to oblivion , and so they are made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new . Nearly all those fine old repartees of which we read are attributed to half a dozen great names , and were probably original with none of them . " Punch " sometime ago warned contributors not to send jokes transcribed from its early volumes , and mentioned that it kept a memory boy who knew every line that bad been putlished in it from its first number . 14 // All this , you will say , may be true of books and essays ; but our daily papers , of course , being made up of statements of immediate events , must necessarily be new , and there is no transfer work about them . You know what they do with old paper . They grind it up and make paper of it again . A similar process goes on in the mind of the reporter and editor . He has a certain stock of ideas and information . He wrote that stock out last year , and it appeared in the newspaper . This year he grinds the same ideas over and they appear again .

He could tell you just what arguments and what figures of speech each man would indulge in at a political meeting . I should like to make two or three exceptions to that , but it might be deemed too personal . Of course , in writing for the press , he never committed himself too much to details . When he was set down for a meeting for some general , popular object , he would oftentimes sit down in the office and write up the whole thing , somewhat after the following model : A large and intelligent audience assembled last evening at the George Washington Hall to make arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . After the usual preliminary business necessary to put the association in working order , the Hon. - was introduced , and delivered an eloquent and forcible address .

It might be impeded for a time , but it would spring forth again , like Phcenix from his ashes , with new strength and beauty . Truth crushed to earth would surely rise again . The persons enlisted in this cause were energetic and determined . They knew their rights , and knowing , dared maintain . He proceeded at some length to expatiate upon the benefits to be derived from success in their efforts , and concluded by exhorting all present to put their shoulders to the wheel and aid the object for which they had assembled , by every means in their power . // i863. * LITERARY TRANSFER WORK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly interrupted by applause .

Suppose that somebody came to the office and told him that the Hon. - had been tendered the nomination for the Assembly or for Congress , and had attended the meeting and accepted the nomination . He immediately sat down and wrote an account including the honorable gentleman 's speech as follows The Hon. - here entered the room , escorted by the committee , which had been appointed to wait upon him and inform him of his nomination .

( Loud cheering . ) In conclusion he stated his profound conviction that they should emergevictoriously from this contest , and would go forward with renewed energy to the rescue of our common country from the hands of the miserable demagogues who now , for a brief period , held LhO helm of power . The meeting adjourned with rousing cheers for the speaker and for the Republocratic party . Invariably after reading this report of his speech the Hon. - would ask my friend the reporter , whenever he saw him , to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item about a ball . Notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather , the votaries of Terpsichore assembled last evening in full force at Independence Hall to enjoy the festivities of the 44th anniversary of the Bullgine Guards . The music , which was furnished by Gideon 's Band , was excellent , the arrangements of the committee perfect , and everything passed off in the pleasantest manner . The company continued to trip the " light fantastic toe " until " the wee sma ' hours ayant the twal , " and when our reporter left ( this was a bold stroke ef fancy ) " the mirth and fun grew fast and furious , " and the enjoyment had reached its height . This of course could have been extended to half a column by a description of the terrible condition of the weather , by some complimentary and historical remarks about the Bullgine Guards ( for he knew all about them ) and by a description of the scene in the hall-room , and of the dancing , the supper , and the music . Suppose he was called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of the breaking up of the ice in the river . He had done it twenty times before , and knew everything that was likely to happen on such an occasion . The whole scene was present to his mind , for in his early reporting days he had trudged many weary blocks to get the impressions and facts which he now drew from his memory . On the other hand if he was asked to write a letter from the West Indies describing an earthquake , though he had never seen either an earthquake or the West Indies , he would find a description of some former earthquake in the en cyclop*dia // and of the locality in the gazetteer , and would thus bring the whole scene directly before his mind 's eye . I have only spoken of strict matters of news . How about the other departrnents of a newspaper ? The political editorials are a rehash of ideas a century old . We are grinding over the same arguments . There is always a crisis . The present issue is always the most momentous that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The perpetuity of our institutions always depends on its decision . I have never discovered the time in the writings of editors or the speeches of politicians when there was not a crisis . I can not find such a time in looking over all the debates of Congress since its first assembling . I can not find such a time in looking over old reports of parliamentary speeches . I can not find a time when the country was not on the brink of a precipice . You can read in Jeremy Bentham 's Works half the arguments you hear to-day , and a great many of them will be in his " Book of Fallacies . " I once knew still another member of the press who kept an enormous collection of scraps from newspapers . He produced more articles in a given time than anybody I ever knew , for he kept two or three persons busy copying them for him . At Christmas and New Year 's , at Valentine 's day , at All Fool 's day , at Lent , at all the noticeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a mixture of gossip and history that made them very readable and appropriate . They had all been quoted from his scraps , perhaps with a combination of two or three accounts , and perhaps with the addition of a few lines at the beginning to change them and make them fresh . They had all been written by other hands for previous anniversaries . At one time he would have a little descriptive article about spring at the Central Park ; now one about the Five Points ; now gossip about fashions . I once wrote an article about a rainy first of May , or moving day , and laid it aside until it was too late to print it for that year . I. happened to fish it out from my old papers four years afterward , about the last week in April . I watched for the weather on the first of May with some interest . It turned out a rainy day , and I sold my article without the change of a word , as though it had just been written . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ferry mismanagement , the need of public baths , the reckless use of lire-arms , the necessity of cheaper houses for the poorer classes , the wrongs of women , the extravagance of fashion , the corruption in public places , are as forcible one year as another . An incident occurred last year , which , if I remember rightly , was as follows : A grand ball was given at Saratoga , and was reported in the " Saratogian , " with a full account of the ladies ' dresses . A week after a ball was given at Cape May , and , strange to say , there appeared in a New Jersey paper a report of it , with precisely the same account of dresses , the initials of ladies wearing them being the only part changed . I am , of course , giving an exaggerated case ; but it is an illustration of the manner in which much work is done in newspaper offices . But , after all is said , there is a great deal of nonsense written about originality . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great a genius he is , but to do the best he can to interest and reform the greatest number of his readers . His success in this is the measure of the success due him . The work of creation in literature is pretty nearly accomplished , and it is now undergoing the processes of differentiation and integration .
