ARTICLE IX. - THE DOCTRINE OF LOYALTY . To settle the meaning of a word is often a matter even of the highest consequence to the welfare of society . Most especially is this tine of words that are used with a standard reference to great moral and political distinctions . Never do men put themselves in the wrong so often , or with so great seeming perversity , as when they have only confused , half-partisan ideas of the right . Thus it is enough , at such a time as this , to make thousands disloyal , that they have only random notions of loyalty , or such as come to them only in the smoke of a merely contentious use . The time has come , therefore , when this word , never till quite recently applied to American uses , should , if possible , have its meaning clearly made out and determinately settled . Heretofore we have looked upon this word , and , in fact , have even spoken of it , as a strictly old-world 's word , capable never of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposes , we have conceived , some kind of hereditary magistracy , such as belongs , in other nations , to royal and princely orders . Thus , when Mr. Dana published , thirty or forty years ago , his rather famous Article on the need of Orders in the State , to impersonate , and connect with a personal sentiment , the otherwise vapid and dry abstractions of law , his regret was , in fact , that we had no place for loyalty , and that , on our footing of equal society , no such necessary homage to a natively personal magistracy is possible . He had probably never heard the word loyal applied to an American citizen , and had no conception that it ever could be . All the great sentiments that figure under this word he conceived as belonging to the poetry of a more poetic society , blessed with the picturesque figures and distinctions of noble orders . And yet we find ourselves using , now , the words loyal and loyalty , as freely as they were ever used by Englishmen . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , in fact , are having // as great sentiments in them as ever swelled the bosom of any people in the world . And we are certainly so far right in this as a very badly confused use of the words allows us to be . We may even thank God in the fact that a public fire has broken out , finally , in our republican society , such as shows the capacity of fire to be in it . We have seen the consciously great sentiment of a great history bursting into flame , and we hope it may never cease to burn , till the stars grow dim in the sky . We are , just now , a kind of revelation to ourselves in this matter-surprised by the majestic figure of our self-devotion , and of the immense , all-dominating loyalty now visible , that before slumbered and was hid in the recesses of our republican feeling and life . And we are none the less ludicrously affected , in this really grand waking of high sentiment , by the awkwardness with which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , as he wakes , the pine tree for his staff , stalking down the hill sides , with unsteady feet , and bellowing after the enemies he can not see or seize . We lay charges of disloyalty , but have really no clear sense of what it is . We glory in the character as being just what it is not . We claim a right to the name of it , on grounds that wholly misconceive its meaning . We even put it in a field where it does not belong ; for the gentlemen of the law assume a special right to be its expounders and patrons , as if it were a matter belonging to their sole jurisdiction ; when it is , in fact , no matter of legal significance whatever , amid never belonged to the jurisdiction of the law at all . Indeed , this latter mistake is so common that , in almost all our discussions of the subject , the charges we lay and those we rep*l , there appears to be a certain reverting to the law and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolvable there . In our endeavor , therefore , to settle the meaning and place of loyalty , we shall be obliged , first of all , to examine its relations to law , or to show , as we easily may , that it is , in fact , no subject of the law at all . A somewhat conspicuous legal advocate , in New York , un // dertook , a short time ago , to enlighten the people of that city and of the nation generally , by a discourse on this partjcular subject . He was a little less modest than he might b e , in what he had to say of " the frantic declamations of the pulpit , " and we are the less inclined to engage in a controversy with him on that account . We only advert to his argument because it is a convenience to have sonic presentation of the question on that side , which is not from us , and can fitly be responsible for itself . As a general thing , legal questions will be more adequately stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the subject matter discussed , does not belong to the law at all , the mere claim of a legal jurisdiction gives no special capacity for it , and no special title to respect . We undertake , then , to say that the law has nothing whatever to do with loyalty , and that it is not , in any sense , a legal subject . It stands on the same footing with patriotism , honor , and bravery  --  the law has no definitions for it , and never had ; takes no jurisdiction of it . The subject is purely moral , lying in the field of right sentiment and religion ; just like other matters that are analogous in some of the other relations of life . Thus a man is honorable when he is true to his own personal convictions ; filial , when lie is faithful and dutiful to parents ; pious , when he is obedient and true to God ; and in just the same way he is loyal when he is devoted and true to his country . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case than in the others . There is no legal definition of honor , none of filial virtue , none of piety , and there is no more any such definition of loyalty . The English common law makes a distinction between what it rather paradoxically calls " imperfect obligations " and those which are perfect ; meaning , by the imperfect , those which are too far-reaching , and deep , and subtle , and spiritual , in one word , perfect , to be administered by the clumsy faculty of human tribunals ; and , by the perfect , those which are single , and simple , and superficial enough to be maintained by the short perception of human evidences and judgments . Ninetynine one-hundredths of the duties of life , and probably a much // larger proportion , belong to what are called , by the conceit of the common law , imperfect obligations ; that is , to the class which are so perfect that God only can administer them , because only He can trace the motives , distinguish tbe evidences , and settle the judgments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dishonesty , for example , kindness and nnkindness , truth and untruth , patriotic and unpatrioti6 actiou ,  --  the civil law can do nothing with these and a thou ; sand other like obligations , save when the relation passes into some outward act that is a personal or public wrong , and can be investigated by human testimony . Thus , if the dishonesty takes the shape of a fraud , if the unkindness takes the shape of cruelty to animals , or to one 's children , if the untrutb passes into slander or perjury , if the defect of patriotism runs to an act of conspiracy with the enemies of the country , then , the civil law finds a case within its narrow jurisdiction , and is able to undertake the matter of redress-redressing , however , the fraud never as dishonesty , the cruelty never as unkindness , the perjury never as untruth , the conspiracy with enemies never as a breach of patriotism . Exactly so it is with loyalty . It belongs to the class of imperfect obligations , such as God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to do with it , till the disloyalty runs to some act of public treason . And then it punishes the disloyalty as treason , never as disloyalty . With that , as sneb , it has never anything to do , more than with dishonor , envy , covetousness ; uncharitableness , anger , hatred , revenge , censoriousness ; for which it has no definitions , and concerning which it has neither principles nor penal ties . So stands this matter of loyalty as before the law ; it is wholly outside of the law , recognized and recognizable only by the law of God . Therefore when this gentleman of the law , annoyed by the suspicion , or supposed imputation , of disloyalty , comes into the field challenging any one to give him a definition of it-that is , a proper , legal definition-protesting that he will not have this epithet shot at himn as a " missile , " unless by some one who can tell him , in good legal definition , what he means by it ! the brave air of confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . It is much as if some one should charge him with being a liar , or a coward , and he should reply , what then is your legal definition of a liar ? and what of a coward ? expecting to be triumphantly acquitted till the said legal definition isgiven ! It will occur to almost any one that a great many very bad vices and wicked delinquencies could be sheltered , as easily , in the same manner . But there is less to be made of this , for the fact that he is bold enough to make out the definition himself which he thus peremptorily demands ; and for this it is that we are particularly indebted to him and to the assistance he contributes by a legal statement of the subject . It will be understood beforehand that the definition given depends , of course , in some way , on the Constitution ; for there is no so ready way of excusing the vice of disloyalty , or any other vice , as to hold the Constitution before it-are not all the vices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American loyalty are to be found in the law of the land , in the duties flowing from the Constitution of our country . " Again , " no duty of loyalty can possibly be predicated of any claim that is not founded in the supreme law of the land . " He cites accordingly from the Constitution what , in his view , concludes the argument . " This Constitution and the laws of the United States , which shall be made in pursuance thereof , and all treaties made , or which shall be made , under the authority of the United States , shall be the supreme law of the land . " Anything then is loyal which is constitutional , or supreme law under the Constitution ; anything disloyal which is unconstitutional , or against the supreme law . What a conclusion this , to be set to the credit of the law , or to stand for the defense of society ! As if any citizen could not do the very worst , and wickedest , and most detestable , and really most mischievously disloyal things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional and violates , in fact , no law whatever . Besides , if the Constitution and the supreme law are , in this manner , " conditions of loyalty , " the conclusion appears to follow that whoever violates the Constitution , or the supreme law under it , is ipeo facto disloyal ; that every one who takes a // bribe , for example , or an extortious fee , or sails without a clearance , or snmggles a piece of goods , or does not duly execute a legal process , or connives at a process which is fraudulent , is equally chargeable with disloyalty on that account ! True he may be a very disorderly person in these things , a great violator of the laws . But how many thousands have we that have been violating the laws of their country , in one way or another , every month and week , and perhaps day of their lives , who are yet offering even their bodies for their country on the field of battle ? Donbtless they would be much better men and truer patriots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no reason whatever to conclude against their loyalty , in the fact that they sometimes break the supreme law . If they so far violate the law as to become traitors , every traitor is , of course , disloyal ; but not every disloyal person is a traitor , neither is any violation of the law , short of treason , a necessary proof of disloyalty . It may be such a proof or it may not . Loyalty then is no subject of law or legal definition . It belongs entirely to the moral department of life . It is what a man thinks and feels and contrives , not as being commanded , but of his own accord , for his country and his country 's honor - his great sentiment , his deep and high devotion , the fire of his habitual or inborn homage to hi* country 's welfare . It goes before all constitutions , and goes by the letter of all statutes , to do and suffer , out of the spontaneous liberties of right feeling , what the petty constructions and laggard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It does not measure itself by what the Constitution or the laws prescribe . It has no art of contriving , for itself and others , how to hide from the country behind the Constitution . It loves what the Constitution loves , and keeps it only the more rationally , that it will even die for its objects ; when to die pleading the letter on the side of its enemies , it would only deem a mockery to it and its objects too . Doubtless it is something to stand by the Constitution and to faithfully keep the laws . In ordinary times , one might naturally enough give it as the definitien of a good citizen . But genuine loyalty is in a higher key , at such a time as this . One may even be a great stickler for the Constitution , // at such a time , and be only one of the most pestilent movers of sedition-more poisonously disloyal than he could be in the open renunciation of his allegiance . The loyal citizen , at such a time , do nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him ! Why the supreme law requires not one of the duties that are so genuinely great and true in loyalty ; to volunteer body and life for the country ; to stand fast when leaders are incompetent and armies reel away in panic before the foe ; to send off to the field , as bravely consenting women do , husbands , sons , and brothers , the props and protectors of home ; to wrestle day and night in prayer , as Christian souls are wont , bearing the nation as their secret burden , when , for sex , or age , or infirmity , they can not do more ; to come forward as protectors and helpers of the children made fatherless ; to give money and work and prepare expeditious of love to mitigate the hardships of the wounded in their hospitals ; to vote with religious fidelity for what will help and save the country , rising wholly above the mercenary motives and selfish trammels of party-why the supreme law requires not one of these , nor , in fact , anything else that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how then is it the measure and bound of loyalty ? The mistake at this point , of those gentlemen who come forward to instruct us in the legal definitions of loyalty , is that that they conceive it to be the same thing as keeping allegiance ; confounding , thus , the tamest and lowest of all modes of political virtue with the highest and noblest the legal with the moral , compulsion with impulse . What can be a lower style of citizenship than that of a man who does not , or it may be dares not , break allegiance ? But if the loyal man goes higher and does more than simply keep the Constitution and the laws , he will at least do that some one may urge-what then but disloyal is any man , of any sphere , who breaks , or even lets go , the Constitution ? To go over this whole field and handle the question exhaustively would occupy more space than is now permitted ; we can only suggest the fact that constitutions are made to carry on government , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // and that , in this latter kind of endeavor , where , to simply go by the letter , reasoning always from it , in the professional manner of the lawyers , would certainly sacrifice both Government and Constitution together , the real statesman will take a freer method for the salvation of both . According to the lawyers ' method , the revolted states are just as truly under the Constitution now as ever ; there is , of course , no legal right of ' blockade , no right of war , but only to send a sheriff with a troop for his posse , no right to distress and reduce the revolt by touching the security of slavery , one of the specially doinestic institutions over which the Constitution has no power . But the statesman will reason differently . These revolted States , he will say , are themselves parts of the document as truly as any of its articles . Tearing out these from the document , the sovereign order itself is so far broken up . If they can not be recovered , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood outside , with new dangers to encounter and diplomacies more critical and complex to manage , and a treaty of peace to arrange with successfully revolting subjects , which treaty itself must even be a breach of the Constitution , the true statesman will assume a certain freedom under it , or the letter of it , that he may save what he can of it , even though it be at the risk of sonic damage . Even as the skillful ship master whom the storm is driving on a lee shore off the gate of his harbor , will cut loose from his anchor and put himself boldly to sea , willing to save the ship without his anchor if he must , so , for the Constitution 's sake , he will declare the blockade of rebel ports , inaugurate a quasi war with the rebellion , permitting an exchange of prisoners , and will even dare to revolutionize revolution that he may briub it under ; - all this by no permission of the Constitution , or even against the letter of it , not knowing how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to save what he can when he can not save all . In this we conceive he is truly , grandly , because practically , loyal ; when if he wanted courage or spirit to strike off from the latter and take the open sea , his timid , pusillanimous coasting , would be scarcely better than treason . But the Constitution , the supreme law , it will be said , is // really and dangerously violated by the executive magistracy . Must we not then do what we can against that magistrac.y ? Does not loyalty itself require it ? That does not follow by any means . What is more frequent than a disagreement with some party or administration , about the constitutionality of this or that particular measure ? Is the loyal subject , therefore , justified in doing everything he can against the government , or to cripple the success of the government ? By the supposition he is in the minority , and the Constitution itself expects him to suspend his judgment , and , for so long a time , ' defer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be anything but anarchy under the Constitution . Is it not then , may we ask , his right and duty , in such a case , to raise a vote , if possible , against such an administration , and bring in a better that shall rectify the abuse ? Sometimes it is and sometimes it is not . If it happens at the time , that there is a grand rebellion on foot throwing off , by open proclamation , all the bonds of allegiance , and tearing the nation itself asunder forever , and if this rebellion waits to see dissensions raised and will even value more a defeat of the adininistration , than it would the greatest possible victory in the field - in such a case any citizen of a large and steady loyalty will be slow to redress some partial and partly questionable breach of the Constitution , by a course that jeopardizes plainly even the existence of the nation itself . Such kind of redress for the Constitution he will even declare to be a crime of faction against it , because of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertaken as a party measure-he will then both disrespect the motive , and despise the recklessness and almost treasonable perversity of it . And* if the endeavor is maintained by appeals that indicate sympathy , or almost friendship , or it may be even connivance , with the flagrant treason of the times , he can not , as a loyal man , be anything less than profoundly disgusted . The instinct of a loyal heart is wonderfully single . In the hour of the nation 's peril , it can not look after that and party together . It scorns the attempt at such a time to divide or carry double , protesting " Who can be temperate and furious , Loyal and neutral in a moment ? " // - let n* fight our nation 's enemies and destroyers till th ey are crushed everlastingly , and then , if we can , it will be time to mend the abuses of the laws . How then is it , some may ask , if loyalty is a matter so completely apart from law , that the word itself indicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Loyalty is literally law-alty ; how then comes it to be a purely moral word , having nothing at all to do with legal definitions and duties ? The answer is two-fold ; first , that it has nothing to do with the law , only in the sense that the law has nothing to do with it ; for how can a purely volunteer devotion be enforced by legal methods ? Secondly , that it is a kind of homage historically older than statutes , having respect as to a law , moral or primitive , which goes before all enactments . Thus it is a great mistake to suppose , as many have done , that English loyalty has respect , directly and simply , to the persons of the kinc* and his noble orders . It pays them homage because there b is felt to be a law primitive that makes them and creates for itself , by inheritance , a magistracy iu them . And that homage is law-alty , because it accepts them as the orgaus of a grand providential order , prior to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Constitution here , if we may so speak , before the Constitution , a nation before the defined Articles of nationality . It required , in fact , as good and high loyalty to fight the Providential nation out into independence , as it now does to defend it . Nay , it required more loyalty to make the Constitution , than it ever can to keep it . It was that old providential Constitution , too , prior to the Constitution , prior even to the Confederacy , that gave the Convention itself a right to say by what kind of vote the Constitution should be binding ; for , if the body had no right , stood in no providential order , then the vote prescribed , never had or can have any binding force . Loyalty , in this view , is even older thin the Constitution ; a moral bond created by Disposing Providence , and sanctified to be the matrix of the coming nationality and the Constitution to be . It must also be added , as regards the relations of the Constitution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled , // by perverse construction , as even to make a genuine loyalty impossible . Just this was the effect of Mr. Calhoun 's doctrine 91 state rights , and it could have no other . Loyalty , so far , is like chastity ; the perpetual boasting of a right against it makes a full end of it shortly . Further , as no husband and wife can once name the word divorce without making sure of the fact , so no people can so much as talk of retrocession from their govermnent as a right , without having half accoi*plished the fact already . Government , like marriage , is either a finality , a state of supreme order that suffers no other even to be thought of or else it is nothing . All the great sentiments that may gather to it and fortify its life depend on this . And , in this view , IMir . Calhoun , so often recognized as the great statesman , or political philosopher , has the very singular merit of having made up a theory of our government which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is only a congeries of little supremacies , that may stay together as long as they please , parting when they please ; a general sovereignty by leasehold , till some one of a score of minor sovereignties may see fit to stop the lease . He is a philosopher , in fact , who never , in his life , conceived the fonndations of a government ; and it will even be one of the wonders of the coming ages that he believed , as he really appears to have done , the flimsy , traditional assumptions lie takes for his first principles ; and another that a great people , even in its green age of history , could have discovered any look of philosophy , in the wooden platitudes of his argument . Indeed , it is one of the bitter mortifications of this dreadful rebellion , that it is the price we pay for shallow doctrine ; viz : such as gives us a government having no final authority-just that imbecile , mock majesty that Mr. Buchanan so fitly represented , when protesting , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not find anything to do for it ! A government challengeable every year and day by new threats ; bidding always for impatience and defiance ; impossible therefore to become a fixed center of homage and loyalty ; inevitably doomed by its own weakness , to lose , at last , the scanty homage of allegiance . How far the politico-legal gentleman , who has undertaken to // lecture us on the subject of loyalty , means to go in his doctrine of " supreme law " in the States , we do not know ; he would evidently hint some coincidence with the state right doctrine , that may give him a taking position of favor with the party in rebellion-winning , probably , about as good title to respect in the connivance , as he would in a legal justification . Dropping now all further reference to the Constitution and the laws , as conditions of loyalty , let us pass to what is more simple and refreshing ; viz , to the purely moral nature and quality of it , where , happily , we shall have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first thing that occurs to us here , is the close affinity of the loyal sentiment , with that which attaches us to our native locality , or country . It is , in the same way , a kind of natural necessity , upon such as feel naturally , and is almost equally undiscriminating . Thus , we remember that , conversing once with a sailor at sea , we rallied him playfully on the hardship it must be to him to return to the rather dismal and forlorn country of his birth , and were handsomely , because touch* ingly , answered : " Why , sir , " he said , " if I had been born upon some nakedest , most barren rock of the ocean , it would be dear to nie . " The woman of Sychar , in just the same way , could not bear so much as the hint of a more " living water " than the ancient father Jacob 's well ; and if Jacob had left a government instead , she would have been as jealous for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only true and grandly real cosmopolitan among men , because he is the world 's incarnate Lord and Saviour , proves his proper humanity still , in the distinctly Jewish feeling of his humanly political nature ; calling it the heavenly felicity to be in Abraham 's bosom , and exulting in expectation of a day when many shall come from the East , and from the West , and from all remotest Gentile peoples , to sit down with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , in the kingdom of God-using , fondly , this very exclusive image , to si*nify the grandeur and dignity of his most catholic , // universal empire . Now , this natural sentiment of country and race , and fatherhood , is but a very short remove distant from loyalty , running into it even by a kind of necessity . It inaugurates law in us before the law is written , or pronounced ; passing through all codes , and polities , and constitutions , to shape them to itself and flavor them with sanctity . It takes hold of what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent , and begets a kind of homage in us that makes us patient and brave in sacrifice-patient also , how often , under bitter mockeries of right and cruel oppressions . Our very nature is political , in short , just as it is domestic ; configured to the state as to the family , craving after loyal emotion , even as after family love . Without this political equipment , we should not even be complete men . Being so nearly natural or close to nature , the loyal sentiment is of course free . Allegiance may be compelled ; loyalty is a volunteer devotion , else it is nothing . One requires to be watched , the other keeps watch itself for the nation . To make sure of one may require a legal or court-in artial investigation ; the other goes by hearts ' - full , always out in its evidences , never ambiguous . A man stuck fast in the intrigues , and swayed by the clanship of party , will contrive to maintain a dastardly and mean allegiance , arguing , it may be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has no appetile , in fact , but for some party victory ; deploring the wrongs of the magistrates in power , when really he is only feeding his appetite on them ; and asserting what he calls his sacred right of speech only to stir up faction , even in the critical hour of the nation 's peril . But , where there is a true soul of loyalty , patience with the nilscarriages and even the supposed wrong* of government , slowness to accuse , readiness to postpone accusations that might be too hastily made-anything almost will be yielded to for the time , that may fortify the causeof the nation and give it victory . Conscious of party affinities , swayed by strong , possibly just , prejudices against the ruling administration , there will yet be such nobility of feeling in the true loyal citizen , as allows himu never to bear a look of sympathy , or suffer a suspicion of connivance , with disorder and rebellion . // How far the loyal sentiment reaches and how much it carries with it , or after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willingly husbands , fathers , brothers , and sons , consenting to the fearful chance of a home always desolate . It offers body and blood , and life , on the altar of its devotion . It is in fact , a political worship , offering to seal itself by a martyrdom in the field . Wonderful , grandly honorable fact , that human nature can be lifted by an inspiration so high , even in the fallen state of wrong and evil ! It is also one of the noble incidents of loyalty that it is not easily discouraged . It has the most " per durable toughness " of all human sentiments . The burdens it will bear , the sacrifices it will make , the defeats it will suffer without surrender to them , the weary , long , long years of hope deferred , and desolating war it will undergo , still fighting on ; the mistakes or imbecilities of bad counsel and ineffective leadership it will excuse , and go on to repair-these and such like are the proofs of loyalty , and history is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heroic age of the Greeks down to the last modern records . Men will faint anywhere and everywhere , sooner than they will in what they do for their laws and liberties . The passion for money is a strong one-we speak as if it were the ruling passion of mankind  --  but the loyal passion burns how much higher and more inexhaustibly ! All because it takes hold of moral ideas and goes into sacrifices for right and law . It is only the doubtfully loyal , such as offer weak and washy protestations of loyalty in the place of an earnest devotion , that see lions always in the way and begin to talk discouragement . The true , great heart of loyal men is rock to all waves of disaster . Possibilities left , discouragements are nothing . Whoever then will talk to us of disloyalty at such a time asU*.is , let him see first of all that his heart is tough in it , and then we shall know that he is qualified to speak . It also requires to be noted that loyalty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here of that mock honor which some muon hold by their will , when the true is gone out in their character , but of that which is true , that in which a firm , great mind honors , first of all , itself . All great and true sentiments // have this kind of honor in them , and hence it is that , in a great war , heroically maintained for ends of patriotic devotion , the public sentiment is raised to a grade of honor so much higher than it can be , under the blandishments of peace and prosperous security . Every man feels that he is exalted , raised in honor before himselt , when he gives himself to his country . And this majestic honor of the mind to itself is the power that makes a hero . There is even a kind of impassiveness in it . The soul is put in armor by it , as if the bosom were become a keep of iron . Even as the great poet says with true dramatic insight " A jewel in a ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loyal breast . " All the romantic virtues move in the ranges of loyalty . Hence also it is that the class of men who are most doubtfully loyal , or positively disloyal , are commonly such as are wanting somewhere , in the great heart principle . The brute masses that have never risen to a conception of honor , the hacks and expectant spolismen of party , the wooden decoys and trimmers of the pulpit , the sophists and mere words-men of the bar , whoever wants the great heart altogether , or has a low , mean side of a heart otherwise noble-such commonly , if not always , are the natures that run to disloyalty ; they make up a class , of whom it might generally be told beforehand . There is also , we must not omit to say , a very perceptible amid very close relation between loyalty and religion . For what is religion but loyalty to God , and if there were no letting down of our great nature by sin , how grandly and heroically would it stand , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is capped by its homages , and they rise in dignity according to the height of their objects . What the man goes up to , thus , or after , in worship and devotion , is the measure of his noblest reach and capacity . Cleaving thus to God in worship , to parentage in filial piety , to great names in reverence , he also cleaves , in the same natural way , to the State . And the two homages , in particular that which goes after the state and that which goes after God , are so clearly related // that one may even speak of loyalty as the religion of our political nature . Nor is it any mean token of our poor broken hnmanity that we have a political nature , mounting thns instinctively towards order , and justice , and complete society . Besides the state itself , erected by eternal Providence , is felt to be a throne which he maintains and crowns even by his divine sanctions . We do not commonly speak of those who give up their lives in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet it is the martyrdom of loyalty unto which they freely gave their bodies , and knowingly consented to the sacrifice . The martyrs of religion scarcely make a sacrifice more real , or total , though they suffer in a way more trying to constancy . We believe too that there is a relation so deep between true loyalty and religion that the loyal man will be inclined towards religion by his public devotion , and the religions man raised in the temper of his loyalty to his conntry , by his religions devotion . The two fires will burn together and one will kindle the other . How many men have actually become religions on giving them .. selves to their country , as soldiers ! The religions feeling also breaks ont , we may see , nuwontedly , as the great struggle goes on , in our speeches and public proceedings , onr proclamations and the reports of our victories . Our recognitions of God are easy and natural , and we draw no small part of our strength from the confidence that God is with ns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , or sing , and how many hearts that never cared for any hymn before , beat answeringly to the words " For right is right , since God is God , And right the day must win ; To doubt would be disloyalty , To falter would be sin . " Mnch has been made by Englishmen , and occasionally by writers of our own country , of the supposed fact that loyalty , or the loyal sentiment , is the privilege only of states that are under the sway of princely families and orders of nobility . There is a very great practical mistake in such an impression . The assumption is that loyalty is a strictly personal sentiment , wanting , of necessity , some loyal or noble person to be the mark of its devotion . No vague , multitudinous , scarcely // apprehensible object like a nation , or people , or even a constitution , will suffice , we are told ; it must have a person , or throne , to em body all it clings to so fondly in the native land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark of its political wurship-this to enjoy , or even as in fealty to serve . But the king , autocrat , monarch , or czar , is taken hold of thus by loyalty , be it observed , not simply as being a person-little is known of him commonly in that regard  --  but he is accepted simply as the symbol-person , in whom victory , and law , and state are embodied . Just as good a symbol , and , in some respects , better , we have , as republicans , in our flag ; for it is no frothy and vapid excitement that stirs our headless passion , as many conceive , when we gather to our flag in vivas , and swear to maintain it . Our flag represents everything  --  the nation itself , the history , the laws , the snccesses , the honors of the past , the promises of the great future unknown , all that we have been , all that we can be . We make no idol of a poor rag in three colors , but we take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could signify as much with as little confusion . Most royal persons have bad passions , weaknesses , meannesses , vices , that awfully mar the symbol-force of their persons ; flags have none . Loyalty puts nothing into them but honors , protections , principles of justice , promises of good , and then the *ag it clings to with such homage and devotion is no more any such abstraction as many think of , when they sentimentally deplore the want of a personal objectivity in our institutions ; it embraces all the good and great persons of the past , and all the blessed hopes of a good and great future . Therefore it is that we rush to the flag with so passionate fervor , and , with no particle of nonsense , vow to die for it . The symbol our loyalty has in it is only the more perfect , that we are distracted by no personal imbecilities and vices , claiming homage , in part , to themselves . Loyalty , then , is seen to be no matter of legal jurisdiction . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is , next in dignity , below the sentiment of religion , which is loyalty to God . We are to judge it accordingly and all // seeming defections from it , just as we do all other matters of a purely moral significance-such as truth , honor , honesty , charity . *o man has a right to complain of being wronged in the charge of disloyalty , just because lie holds the Constitution , or does not break out in some flagrant treason . He may even be more basely and mischievously disloyal because be does not . By secret connivances , and factious words , and party cabals , he may even serve the enemies of his country more than he could by the open mustering of treason . Let no man whimper at the charge of disloyalty , then , just because he is too much of a dastard in his crime to act himself boldly out and take the risk of a traitor 's death . The meanest kind of disloyalty is that which keeps just within the law and only dares not perpetrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airs of patriotic concern for the Constitution , when it really has none for all the wrong that can be done it by enemies openly fighting against it . Such persons must be judged morally , just as we judge all pretenders and hypocrites under false shows of virtue . Tim public understand them well and read them , for the most part , truly , and it is too much to ask that we shall be fools for their sake . At the same time , there is a possibility of doing injustice in this charge of disloyalty . If we mean by it , as we often seem to do , that the persons charged in this manner have actually broken loose from their alleo'iance or that they understand 6 themselves to be really disloyal in their intent , it will often not be true . Moral defections more commonly cheat their victims at the beginning . They do not understand the immoralities in which they are being steeped , and , so far , do not intend them . In the same way it is iiossible for large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in . Some of them are young and trust themselves to leaders who prey upon the green age of their confidence . Some are ignorant and are taken artfully by catch-words of which they have really no understanding . And some , again , it must be admitted , have a mean , cold nature , in which all the great sentiments get a place of lodgment with difficulty . They can hardly mount high enough in feeling to conceive what loyalty is . The // sense of *ountry , family , honor , the political or social sense , runs low in their sterile natures ; all the great inspirations take them at an awful disadvantage . Meantime , tbe crabbed , selfish impulses of clanship and party , are a lean kine of poverty devouring everything noble or generous they might begin to feel . They think they are loyal , it may be , and then they will go to the Constitution or the court records to prove it ! But the great heart-*how can they have it when it is not in them ? We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them . Hut who that knows them will ever expect more ? Who will even expect them to know that the*y are disloyal when they are ? Going after cabal more easily than after country , what will they do more naturally than give themselves to cabal and call it their country ? We see , in this manner , what multitudes there may be , in every community or country , who fall , as it were , by gravity , into the disloyal state , without intending it , or even knowing it . What then , shall we say ? Shall we class them as loyal ? We can not do that . The best that we can do for them is to call them unloyal , or disloyal , and add the salvos of pity as our qualification . They ought to be condemned , and they must also be pitied . None the less to be pitied are they that they are , some of them , persons who have come , or would hereafter come , into conditions of power and public honor ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power and public honor are forever gone by to them . When this rebellion is finally put down , as it most assuredly will be , then the day of their damnation is come . They can now return to their country , but they must do it soon . To come back into the range of its honor and love when the day of trial is over , is impossible . Then it is too late  --  the gate is shut ! Had we some near and much valued friend who had fallen off into this gulf , onr particular prayer for him would be , that he might discover his mistake speedily enough , and renounce it ingenuously enough , to be recorded as the friend of his country while the rebellion is still on foot . For after it is once gone down , woe to any man who is obliged to live under the incubus of a name for disloyalty , or a faltering adherence to his country . // At the same time , that we may not seem to speak with unnecessary harshness , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , different . from those which we have named , in which some persons have been carried over to the verge of disloyalty , by motives that more nearly entitle them to sympathy . We speak of those who have taken part hastily against the government , from a false anxiety to save the government . Who of us , that kept our sobriety , did not cling , for a time , to the 8tatn8 in quo of the political order and law ?  --  the same which has been popularly phrased , " the Constitution as it is " - for how shall we ever get back into a state of settlement , we said , if the terms of settlement are themselves gone by ? We saw clearly enough that slavery is one of the most assailable points of weakness on the side of the rebellion , and , if not assailed , that it is even an element of strength in the rebellion . The right of war to assail this point of weakness and turn it on our side , we did not doubt ; for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little did we doubt that it must finally be done , if the war be long protracted ; recoiling still , with instinctive dread , from the terrible necessity . For after public war has begun to gather large numbers of slaves to its aid , no settlement on the basis of slavery will any longer be left ; for the manifest reason that who shall be the bond and who the free , will then be a question forever impossible . First came the Confiscation Act , striking down the title of all masters joining the treason . At length , au d probably not too soon , came the Proclamation , so comprehensively worded that the President seemed to assume the right of a general emancipation , by his own civil edict . Many of our most sober and thoughtful citizens were alarmed* It was as if the gates of confusion were opened . They saw the anchor hold of law loosened , , and everything drifting towards inextricable anarchy . They took ground hastily , coming , as they thought , to the rescue of the law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to set upon the government , in a way that , considering the time , was really not loyal , and it drew them farther , even than they knew , towards the rebellion itself . It is impossible not to yield all such a degree of sympathy , // and we shall do it the more easily if we find them ready now , at the more advanced stage of affairs , to advance also themselves , and modify their sentimeiits enough to meet our new conditions . Ko real statesman will undertake to be a mere lawyer , standing fast in the letter , when eternal doom has pushed it by . Every man can see that , under the doom of war , we were bound to just the crisis we have reached , proclamation or no proclamation . It was right , for a time , t osay , " the Constitution as it is , " but it could not be always . The statesman is no bigot , sticking fast in what he determined rightly , when it is a possibility forever gonO by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with affairs . Nothing is now left us , from the first nothing was finally to be left us , but to champion the liberty of the slave . We do not understand that the President meant anything more , by his Proclamation , than to seize on the right of war , and to emancipate just as far and as fast as war could execute the fact . If he did , there is no court in the land that would execute his edict farther . In this understanding we can all be agreed , and also in the fact that the river of our destiny now runs where it must . We can not tie ourselves to the legalities onger , and reason upon the war as if it were only a sheriff 's posse out for the arrest of treason . We must take it as war , grim war , having all the rights of war , and must join ourselves heartily to it as the only chance of our future . The debates and misgivings are all over ; nothing is now left us but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differed honestly , and in ways that do not exclude respect ; now there is no place for difference longer . We have only to add , in conclusibn , that when our present struggle is over and triumphantly ended , as it must some time be , then it will be our thanksgiving and joy that we have constitutions and laws more sublime and sacred than we ever thought them to be ; a name and heritage more august ; and , what is more than all , that we have more heart for our country and a more intensely moral devotion to its honor and perpetuity . We shall then have passed the ordeal of history . Our great battle fields will be hallowed by song . Our great leaders // and patriots will be names consecrated by historic reverence . We shall be no more a compact , or a confederation , or a composition made np by the temporary surrender of powers , but a nation-God 's own nation , providentially planted , established on moral foundations . These throes of civil order are but the schooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be raised , under the discipline , by the sense of a new public honor and morality . What loyalty was we did not even know before ; now we shall know it , and the word , at once , and fact will be American-not American only , but republican .
