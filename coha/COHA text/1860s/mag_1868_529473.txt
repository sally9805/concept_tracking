ABYSSINJA AND KING THEODORE . " BYSSINIA ! Abyssinia ! " I hear A some reader exclaim ; " and where and of what special importance is Abyssinia to me , that I should turn from topics of immediate interest nearer home to give it even a passing thought ? And yet , - now you mention it , - was not that the name of the country concerning whose barbarous habits a mendacious old Scotchman , named Bruce , told our grandfathers such marvellous legends ? And have I not lately seen in my morning newspaper , every week or two , a scanty telegram headed Abyssinia ? Is not Abyssinia a wild , out-ofthe-way place , somewhere in Asia , or Africa , or some other uncivilized part of the world , where irascible John Bull , peering about to find a new opening for commerce , has managed to get at loggerheads with a savage potentate called King Theodore ? " Yes , my good friend , Abyssinia is that very country , the faithful report of whose customs cost an honest old tray-. eller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not recover until half a century too late . to do him any good in this world . And it is in this out-ofthe-way region of strange people and stranger customs that excellent John Bull , to his disgust , has been hurried into a most unprofitable contest . As a Parliament man put 's it , " England is ' about to pay ? * , coo , ooo postage on a mislaid Afiican lctter . " The simple fact is , an English army of ten thousand men has gained a foothold on the highlands which look down into the Red Sea . But whether the expedition will prove to be " a voyage of discovery , " a war of conquest , a fruitless chase after a fugitive from justice , or a magnificent farce with all Europe for spectators and ready to re*vard the actors with a universal " guffaw , " is the very question in debate . Accept the bystander 's view of the case . One of the great powers has unwittingly become involved in a war in an almost unknown country . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war are all uncertain . Then does not this uncertainty'add new zest to the whole subject ? For it is among the possible things , that this English expedition may change the government and social condition of the finest country in Northeastern Africa . The English Ministry disclaims any . such intent . The English people were sick of the whole affair before the first tent was pitched on African soil . But how many people sit down and count all the cost before they put on the armor ? One hundred years ago England had a fe*v trading-posts on the shores of Hindostan , and she cherished no higher ambition than that of turning an honest penny by th' exchange of her *vares for native products . She had no more thought of conquering the Peninsula than we have of taking possession of Tartary . For all that , the red cross floats from cape to mountain and over a tenth part of the human race . What manner of man is Lord Stanley , that he should be so much wiser than his fathers ? He never , meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Against his will British soldiers are in the country . Against his will they may be forced to remain . Who knows ? But , aside from the events of the passing moment , Abyssinia has in itself inherent and permanent interest . Consider , in the first place , that here , just where you would least expect it , in intertropical Africa , is one of the finest countries in the world , fertile , ten*perate , salubrious , picturesque . Consider , in the second place , that in the heart of that Africa , whose institutions elsewhere are as shifting as the sands of her deserts , there is found a people the annals of whose unconquered national // June , existence run back until they are lost in the darkness of legendary history . Consider , in the third place , that this is the one solitary , indigenous Christian state now left in the two great continents of Asia and Africa ; - the one lonely outpost of the faith , where once every neighboring coast had its powerful Christian commonwealth , and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every account , therefore , the subject , which accidental circumstances have brought to thi* surface , is full of natural interest . One wishes , as it were , to get a foothold upon the S0ii* to make the acquaintance of the people , to seek an introduction to this half-savage monarch ; and possibly to obtain his photograph to put into an album of notables . Begin with the soil , with the country as it came from the Creator 's hand . What is your idea of Africa ? A marshy coast , dank with moisture , impassable with jungles , heavy with deadly malana ! Great rivers , which creep slowly beneath a torrid sun , and whose steaming banks are the home of fevers , which put liquid fire into the white man 's veins ! Interminable des*rts , glowing like a furnace , where the fiery simoom first blasts and then buries the bestequipped caravan ! Are not these some of the prominent objects in your ideal picture ? Reserve one spot for brighter tints . Here , in this Africa , between the tropics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift steamers are weekly plying , stretches for many hundred miles Abyssinia , - a high , healthy plateau , more temperate than New England , and to which any one of my readers might emigrate as safely as to Missouri or Illinois , - at least so far as climate is concerned . Study now , if you please , a little more minutely the geographical situation . On the Red Sea you have a few ports owned by Egypt . Then comes a strip of sand thirty to a hundred miles wide , flat , hot , almost treeless and waterless , and over which the wild tribes , the Shihos and the Taltals , wander . Its western boundary is the first range of the Abyssinian highlands , which at a distance look like a high wall . Climb these , and you rise gradually to the height of eight thousand feet and to a cool and equable climate . But this plateau is not flat like a plain , nor yet undulating like a prairie , but infinitely diversified . From the general level rise mountains and ranges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a truncated pyramid . Some are conical . Some ranges are so perfectly serrated , that they look like a saw 's edge with here and there a tooth wanting . On the other hand the great rivers , the Tacasse , the Atbara* the Blue Nile , and their tributaries , have been for ages ploughing the soil , until they have literally excavated valleys a half-mile deep and miles wide , and borne thousands of cubic miles of the rich uplands into Egypt . Of course , the valleys are tropical . But on the highlands are found the flora of temperate zones . The English soldier-boy writes to his friends " A lovely place ; a perfectly English climate ; scenes almost like home . " What has man done for this country ? Almost nothing . He builds no roads here : the high way from Tigre to Gondar is no broader than a cow-path across a New Hampshire pasture . He bridges no rivers : a bridge of rough stones , the work of a Portuguese missionary in the sixteenth century , is now one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the metropolis of the eastern province . He has in mind London or New York , or at least Cairo or Alexandria . He looks . Lo ! there meets his eye a motley collection of round huts , built of small stones plastered together with mud . He enters the king 's palace . This is not an African Tuileries ; it is only a little larger hut , whose partitions are hanging cotton cloths , such as you might find in the log-cabin of a frontiersman . Even agriculture languishes . Does any one ask the cause ? To this squalor and barbarism civil war , chronic and unceasing , has reduced a // nation which a thousand years ago was powerful and conquering , and governed by one mind and one will . At first there were endless struggles between pretenders to the crown ; then the feudal chieftairrs took up the contest , and made the royal power a mere semblance . One tourist finds a king supporting himself by begging ; another discovers a worthy successor of Soloipon earning an honest living in the parasol business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage in perpetual struggles for supremacy ; the lesser chiefs rise in as perpetual struggles against their natural lords . Note one effect , - the utter discouragement of commerce . You are a trader , sailing down the Red Sea , and bound with a stock of goods to the western provinces of Abyssinia . The vessel drops anchor in the little harbor of Massowa . You must pay the Egyptian a generous duty , or he will not let you land . Then the Shiho chief must , of course , have a gratuity for convoying you across the desert strip . Arrived at the pass of the highlands , his serene Majesty , the Ras of Tigre , demands a fat custom . You are out of the woods now , you think . Never a more mistaken mortal . You wind along ten or twenty miles with cheery heart . You grow poetical , as your eye takes in the picturesque hills which confront , you , and the green glades and groups of majestic trees which are scattered on every side . But your poetry gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bends into some little gorge , up start a dozen greasy rascals , and , in behalf of some petty potentate , insist upon bleeding again your purse . This process is repeated over and over again , until at last you reach the bounds of Amhara , the next great province . You can not deal any less liberally with the Gondar Ras than with his Tigre brother ; nor will you expect his subordinates to be less importunate . So it happens that , by the time you arrive at your destination , you feel either that you must get a remarkable price for your goods , or else , commercially speaking , too frequent trips will not pay . And when you get back to Massowa with a whole skin , - if you are so fortunate , after a six months ' sojourn in a country where " every prospect pleases , and only man is vile , " - you will find that every vestige of mercantile enterprise has vanished , as the transient herbage from the hot sands across which your weary mule last crept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Physically they are a comely race . In complexion they are generally light brown , with European rather than African f*atures , * crisp but not woolly hair , slender figures , and especially delicate hands . Morally they are a bundle of contradictions . The official Abyssinian is , as we have seen , a grasping personage . The private Abyssinian , on the contrary , is given to hospitality . " A traveller hardly need seek for lodging . The first person whom he meets will ask him to stop with him . And though he were laden with gold his host would not touch it . " The incessant wars , the shameful mutilation of fallen enemies , the many instances of treachery , all lead you to expect a bloodthirsty people . To your surprise you find the peasants a simple , manly race , and all classes sufficiently inoffensive and kindly . You picture to yourself a dozen half-naked Abyssinians , squatted in a circle , devouring strips of raw beef yet quivering with animal life ; or you think of a perfect Abyssinian gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odorous but not sweet , and his curled locks surmounted by the everlast-. ing butter-pat , which is Abyssinian full dress ; or you remember the gross sensuality of both sexes , so a matter of course that nobody is ashamed of it , and you say , " Here is a race of perfect barbarians . " Then some credible witness steps up and exclaims , " 0 no ! a most agree able people ; very hospitabTh , eminently social too ; conversation usually sensible , and always witty . " " At any rate , " you cry out , " this agreeable people , as you call them , but so scourged // by war , must be very unhappy , and sick of the soil which gave them birth . " " Not at all , " rejoins your travelled friend ; " they are a happy people , gay by constitution , true philosophers , preferring laughter to tears . Sick of their country ! They hardly believe that the rain falls , or the sun shines , or the grass is green anywhere but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , shattering the structare of society , and destroying the sanctions of law , and unrestrained personal sensuality , blunting the conscience and making coarse the moral fibre , has made of a people naturally quick of v4t , brave , enduring , and cheerful , and who have behind them honorable memories , and around them favorable physical influences . But their Christianity ! Why has not that shaped a better character ? A curious Christianity indeed ! , Start with the church gove1*nment . The Abuna , the head of the church , is never an Abyssinian . By a singular custom , established in the thirteenth century , the Coptic patriarch of Alexandria appoints an alien , bound by no ties of blood or memory , to the people of his charge . Generally lie enters his office minus these two important qualities , - patriotism and virtue . But this makes no difference with the mass of men . He may be rapacious . He may be a sensualist . He may use the confessional to further vicious ends . Yet the reverence they cherish for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he puts a bridle in the mouths even of the most haughty chiefs . A single anecdote illustrates . Nathaniel Pearce , an English sailor , was a friend and favorite of Ras Welled , one of the best of the numerous chiefs who have figured conspicuously in the present century . Pearce had built him a house a little more cleanly and commodious than those of his neighbors . Attached to it was a garden , filled with European fruits and vegetables . A new Abuna demanded possession of this house . After a brief parley it was given up , with the stipulation , however , that the garden should be respected . As soon as the priest was fairly settled In his new home , lie sent his attendants to pluck both fruits and vegetables . In short , he took possession of the garden . Ras Welled despatched a servant to remonstrate . The Abuna struck the niessenger in the mouth , and threatened his master with excommunication . The Ras succunibed , saying dolefully to Mr. Pearce , " The tongue of that Abuna has speared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am bound by my religion to bear it . Still , I think that we are rather a weak-minded people . " Like priest like people , is the old saw . And one can conceive that civil war itself could hardly be a worse teacher than such a priest . Abyssinian Christianity as personal religion is hardly better . It is a burden of forms , and nothing more . A devout Abyssinian fasts , every year in various seasons two hundred and fifty days out of the three hundred and sixty-five . Some of these fasts are from sunrise to sunset sonic until such time in the afternoon as the body of a man shall cast a shadow of n4ne , nine and a haW or ten feet . The more religious a man is , the more need that , to avoid starvation , lie turn night into day , and give the hours of darkness , not to sleep , but carousing . To compensate for this enforced daylight temperance , pretty much all the rest of the year is given to religious feasts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not at all pious or edifying to European eyes . And if this religion of the common people seem a little material and fleshly , perhaps , we hasten to say , that the theologians in their differences rise into the most rarefied atmosphere of metaphysical subtilty , and hate each other with an intensity which would be respectable in the most cultivated regions . Do we ask now what else Christianity accomplishes for this people ? This is the answer : that no part of the Bible except the Psalms is ever taught to the laity , and even that only in a dialect which has ceased to be a spoken language ; that the most // common precepts of Christian morality and religion are unknown to them ; that the priesthood steadfastly resist the distribution among the common people of the New Testament printed in the native tongue . Considering , therefore , what kind of a Christianity it is , it would be simply absurd to expect from the Abyssinian religion any profound influence for good upon the individual character . Observe , however , one striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion is to the Abyssinian . The esprit de corps generated by a common faith alone accounts for the pertinacity with which so many savage onsets from all sides , of Arab , of pagan Galla , of pseudo - civilized Egyptian , have been repelled . Abyssinia , as against itself ; is split into separate and warring states . As against Moslem or Pagan , it is an undivided unit . This detestation of Mohammedanism leads occasionally to ludicrous results . Parkyns insists that it makes Christianity in this region a dirty religion , - that , in their hatred of Moslem ablutions , the people are really clean only once in a year , on St. John 's day , when they bathe freely , - that he himself was suspected of rank heresy because he was in the habit of taking a morning bath ; the faithful crying out , " Is he a Mohammedan that he thus bathes , and so often ? " Whoever could have visited Abyssinia in the middle of the present century , and rightly comprehended the results of all the varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a nation which had lost all the traditions and sanctities of regular and legal authority , and in which the supreme rule was held up as the prize to be snatched by the strongest and most audacious . He would have found a people of much original greatness or character , but with cruel and sensual qualities developed by the exigencies and temptations of a life of perpetual civil war . He would have found a religion which had lost its soul , and had become a dead body of unmeaning and burdensome forms . He would have found , in short , a state of society in which every change is possible , where any one may rise to-day out of the nothingness of yesterday only to sink again into the equal nothingness of to-morrow ; where the king on his throne may fear any fall , and where the meanest soldier in the ranks may hope for any rise ; where , in fine , those sharp transitions , those romantic careers of meteor-like greatness , so alien to civilized experience , are too common even to excite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of the western provinces of Abyssinia a young robber chieftain , named Li Kassa or Kassai . He called himself a son of Solomon , and claimed to be of royal blood . Whatever may be true about his origin , certain it is that he began life in a humble station , as the son of a poor woman who dealt in a medicine coinmonly used for the cure of the , tapeworm . His audacity , which knew no fear and shrank from no difficulty , soon drew around him a band of desperadoes ; and he became the terror of the provinces which he infested . In i8*o he attracted the attention of Ras Ali , then the dominant chief of the province of Amhara , who made him his lieutenant , and gave him his daughter for wife . The alliance was of brief duration . The Ras suspected his son-inlaw of a towering ambition which no subordinate position would satisfy . An open rupture took place , and in 1853 , on a bloody field , Kassai was victorious over his master . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , defeated , and slew the Ras of Tigre . The next year he subdued Shoa , a southern province , which had long maintained a real independence . For the first time in many years Abyssinia owned a single master . One of those strange prophecies which take hold of the faith and superstitions of half-civilized races had obtained credence . It ran thus : " In the appointed time , a king shall arise whose name shall be Theodorus . He shall restore 705 // the ancient boundaries of Ethiopia , and trample the Moslem beneath his feet . " Kassai claimed to be this personage , and under the name of Theodore was crowned Negus or Emperor . The horoscope of the new monarch seemed fortunate . He pretended that he was a man of destiny , and that he had from his earliest years had dim presages of coming greatness . H is reign opened auspiciously . Personally imposing , with an open and winning face , yet with an eye which could at will dart lightning glances , he was in the beginning temperate , continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no rest . Brave to the verge of temerity , he was swift in the onset and untiring in the pursuit . Capable of the fiercest outbre*iks of temper , at this period he held his passions at the control of his policy . His haughty pride and jealous resentment of any affront were not unbecoming one who had achieved so much . The hardihood with which he attempted to curb the feudal lords and reform the church , while his own power was yet unconsolidated and threatened by foes from without and within , indicated the possession of no inconsiderable moral courage . Even the constancy with which he described himself as a blind instrument for the fulfilment of the divine purposes , while it exposed him to the charge of superstition or duplicity , gave dignity and apparent sincerity to his language . His plans , too , were full of greatness . He proposed nothing less than the regeneration of the Abyssinian state , and the restoration of its ancient glory . To repress anarchy , to protect the peaceful , to restore order , safety , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he placed before him . " I will convert swords and lances into ploughshares and reaping-hooks , and hasten the time when the ox which draws the plough shall he of more value than the bravest steed which carries the warrior . " Strange and memorable words to be spoken by a robber chief from a throne which he had won at the point of his sword ! His first acts did not . belie his promises . He suppressed the slave-trade ; abolished the custom of handing murderers over to the relatives of the slain ; put an end to private exactions on commerce ; reduced the exorbitant and crushing revenues of the church ; and sought to establish a standing army with something of European discipline , and which should be amenable to the rules of civilized warfare . Especially did he determine to break up that system of brigandage of which he was himself a graduate . He issued a proclamation that " every one should return to the profession of his fathers , the merchant to his shop , the peasant to his plough . " Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession . " And what was that profession ? " asked Theodore . " Robbers on the highway . " The king offered them lands and agricultural impJements . But still they insisted upon being confirmed in an employment which they pretended that an earlier king , named David , had guaranteed to their tribe . At last their request was granted . Proud of vanquishing so great a monarch , they rode gayly away ; but on the road they were overtaken by a squadron of cavalry , and cut off to a man , Theodore saying with a grim smile , " that no doubt King David had authorized them to rob , but that a greater than David had authorized his soldiers to destroy robbers . " His desires were not limited to the restoration of internal order and prosperity . He had more ambitious hopes . To push out the bounds of the country on every side - eastward to the Red Sea , southward over the fair rolling country which the Galla had snatched , north and west into Nubia and Sennaar - seemed not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restoring to Ethiopia its original territory . He was not excited by merely personal ambition , - he shared fully the aspirations and hatreds of his race . " The name of Egyptian is a stench in the nostrils of an Abyssinian " is the familiar proverb ; and the new king understood and // sympathized with the sentiment which is underneath the proverb . Besides , by his assumption of the name Theodore , he stood pledged to organize a crusade against Mohammedanism . The glowing prophecy , of which that name is but the battle-cry , originated in the time when Islam had begun her conquering march , and was trampling under the feet of her armies the Christian nationalities . It expressed the deathless hate and unquenchable faith of a people who , whatever their errors , have never turned their backs to the Moslem . To have united the country under one head , to have extinguished the last embers of civil war , to have developed all the rich resources of the land , and so to have sat a mighty monarch on a firm throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after him , would , in the Abyssinians ' eyes , and probably in the king 's own eyes , very poorly have fulfilled the proud expectation of many generations . If it shall seem in the future that the lust of Turkish conquest was very largely the sOurce of the errors and violent deeds of the king , the candid mind will suggest that he was impelled , not simply by his own evil temper , but by passions and prejudices planted in the blood of his race . Now that every voice is raised against him , and he is viewed , perhaps with entire justice , as a monster of treachery and broken faith , and it is held to be the first duty to hunt him down like a dangerous beast , it is striking to remember , that , but a little while ago , he seemed to fascinate all who approached him ; that men began to call him the restorer of his country ; that a wise person could write , " He is a man of no ordinary stamp , who has risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has done great things , and proposes greater . " And , when all these great plans have come to naught , and their projector , hemmed in by domestic foes , and threatened by foreign vengeance , is striking fiercely at every one , like a tiger at bay , there is a touch of pathos in the thought , that , had he perished a dozen years ago , 707 history would have recorded him as a barbaric Alfred the Great , who died too soon . How largely his early self-restraint and nobility of purpose sprar*g from his inherent greatness , and how much was dependent upon the influence of good advisers , it is impossible to decide . That he had wise counsellors , and knew how to value them when living , and to mourn them when dead , seems certain . In 1841 , through the report of MM . Ferret and Galinier , the leaders of a French exploring expedition in Abyssinia , we hear of a certain young Englishman , Captain Bell by name . He was then t*venty-two years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regions about the Euphrates , and wished to join the French party , that he might visit the sources of the Nile . His sense , gallantry , unflagging cheerfulness , and sparkling wit won the hearts of the Frenchmen , and they speak of him with an enthusiasm pleasant to behold . This young Englishman , for reasons which do not appear , decided to make the country his home , married a native woman , and attached himself in the first place to Ras Ali , and , after his defeat , to his conqueror . Toward this latter , if we may believe the French consul , Bell cherished an almost canine attachment , sleeping across his door at night , following him in all fortunes , and finally dying on a battle-field which his own gallantry had won , in the very act of saving the monarch 's life . Theodore is known to have reciprocated this regard ; to have given him his confidence , as to no other person ; to have heeded very greatly his suggestions ; to have heard with constant delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics , warlike resources , and comparative advance of the separate states in the arts of peace . About the same time , Captain Plowden , a young naval officer , succeeded in getting from Lord Palmerston the appointment of consul to Massowa . The great duty of his office was , not to care for English interests in the petty Egyptian port , but , // as was distinctly implied , to promote commerce with Abyssinia and the adjacent countries . The better to fulfil this duty , he passed most of his time in the camp and court of Theodore , and shared , though in a lesser degree , with Mr. Bell , that monarch 's confidence . The official report of this gentleman is a sufficient voucher for the clearness , energy , and breadth of his mind . The facts are concentrated in it after a manner so remarkable that it has been called " literary pemmican " ; and , from the intimate knowledge which it displays of Abyssinian customs , opinions , resources , and character , must be always one of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubted that these men exercised a vast and beneficial influence over the counsels of the king . But whatever the power , whether for good or evil , they exerted , it was soon to cease . In iS6o Plowden , with a few attendants , was surrounded by a band of insurgents , mortally wounded , and then taken prisoner . A few months after , Bell , as we have before stated , died at the close of a successful battle , while shielding his master . Theodore sacrificed fifteen hundred rebels to the memory of his friends , but that did not compensate him for their loss , nor make him the heir of their wisdom . The last year has given us a striking proof that these men are not forgotten by him whom they sought to serve . Dr. Beke , pleading for the release of the British captives , alluded to Plowden and Bell , and the time when Theodore was fighting for the crown . The king visibly softened . He broke out : " It is the Devil who made me angry with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the power of God ! I will fight the Turk . I will never fight the English . " That any necessary connection exists between the death of these men and the events which have followed may be hard to prove . This only can be asserted : there was a close coincidence of the time of their loss and the close of the earlier and better period of Theodore 's reign . Nothing is more justly painful than to behold the failure of any career , especially if that career has awakened rational expectations that it would be in a great and permanent way a blessing to mankind . Just such a failure of a hopeful career we have now to trace . The early character of Theodore was not destitute of a certain irregular greatness . But he laid a foundation upon which no man perhaps , however great his genius or steady his virtue , could have reared a fitting superstructure . The task which he undertook - to purify the streams of national life which had been poisoned at their fountains , to root up national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries , to rear the fabric of material prosperity on soil yet rough with deep furrows of civil war - was too mighty for any ordinary mind . The temper of the king was too uncertain , his culture too narrow , his impulses too ungovernable , his self-restraint too feeble , to permit him long to resist the increasing temptation and the ever-accumulating difficulties of his position . He has broken down personally in his moral nature . In every half-civilized community , appetite and passion are the lions in the path . But Theodore began *lfe temperate and continent . All witnesses agree on this point . In a community where sensuality brings no disgrace , and the seventh commandment is practically abrogated , he was the husband of one wife , - and faithful . Amid a people whose habits tend at least to periodical gluttony and drunkenness , he verged rather towards abstinence than excess . Even the Protestant missionaries - no very favorable critics - held him in high esteem for the " purity of his life . " But continence and temperance have given way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king has assumed the likeness of the seraglio of a Turkish sultan . We hear of a harem of nearly a hundred concubines gathered at Magdala . And , as if to lend an aspect of comedy even to // treachery and broken faith , Bishop Gobat 's lay-missionaries , sent into Abyssinia for the double purpose of preaching the Gospel and instructing the natives in the arts of peace , are chronicled as receiving employment in the manufacture of some delectable strong drink wherewith to tickle the palates of the king* and his court . His temper has grown steadily worse . From the beginning he was capable of terrible outbreaks of wrath , but this wrath was under the control of his judgment , and it was directed against real offenders . But when we hear that faithful servants commend their souls to God before entering his presence , lest upon the most trivial mistake they may be flogged to death , or when we read of three hundred of his own soldiers driven , with their hands bound , into an enclosure , and there shot , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " surround , " and all this , not because of any fault of their own , but because their tribe is in rebellion , we understand that we are no longer contemplating the awful severity of a judge , but rather the freaks of a madman . He has broken down in his attempt to play the part of an enlightened statesman . What he undertook was to restore the integrity and prosperity of the empire by enforcing with strict impartiality the ancient code , thus guaranteeing private rights , prrtecting the feeble , punishing the rapacious , and rebuking the venal . But in part perhaps because he is too fickle and impatient to accomplish a solid reform , but far more from the stress of circumstances , he has virtually abandoned his noble aims , and become the chief patron of rapine . For this he is more to be pitied than condemned . To climb an ice peak is comparatively easy ; your impetus carries you onward , and those who are following push you up . But it is a different matter to stand on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cling to , while a dozen below are struggling to hurl you down headlong , that they may occupy your place . This is a just picture of the position 709 of King Theodore . This is the story of the career of every one who has risen to notice in Abyssinia during the last fifty years . So long as he was rising , everybody who thirsted for change , and saw in it an opportunity for personal gain , was content to follow , and make him the instrument for the pulling down of existing powers ; but when he had risen , and no more was to be hoped from him , every petty chief , every ambitious bandit , who could boast a less ignoble origin , joined in endless conspiracies to pluck him from his seat . As a result his reign has been , not as he dreamed , adorned by the bloodless victories of peace , but vexed by incessant warfare , waged in defence of his crown and his life . For his own power and safety , therefore , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , variously estimated at from fifty thousand to one hundred and fifty thousand men . Now there are but two ways in which such a force can be supported : the one is by regular pay and rations ; the other , by rapine . But it is the highest achievement of artificial and civilized life to devise a system by which resources to feed and pay such an army shall be drawn in justly , safely , and continuously . How then could it be done , where the last vestiges of such a system were in danger of being trampled beneath the heavy hoof of war ? There was but one possible method of supporting his forces , namely , by ravaging the fields and flocks of the defenceless husbandmen . The miserable peasants , stripped of all , rose in hopeless insurrection . They rose only to be crushed and slain . But that did not cultivate waste fields . Then the soldiers , finding no booty and little food , began to desert . Then desertion was repressed by savage punishments . So , by steps which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the high regions of ideal statesmanship , to become a brutal struggle for self- preservation . Instead of order there is anarchy ; instead of prosperity , misery . The ox which was to draw the plough in that // Abyssinian millennium feeds the soldier , and the war-horse spurns his wretched owner with his iron heels . The utterdisappointment of his hopes , and the ceaseless conspiracy of his chiefs , have stung the king to frenzy , and the anecdotes of his cruelty and recklessness which are told almost surpass belief . Here are some instances of his cruelty . Three hundred petty chiefs , with twentyfive hundred followers , sought to desert him . They failed . The merciless despot ordered that the hands and feet of the leaders should be cut off , and they left to bleed to death , while the private soldiers should be , without exception , shot . And a letter from one of the missionaries , secretly forwarded , says that " these two days , from morn till sunset , the silence has been broken by volleys of musketry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken prisoners have been mutilated , and then cast over precipices , often to die by the prolonged agony of starvation . Women whose only offence was that their relatives were in rebellion have been first outraged , and then rolled up in wax cloths and burned like can*lles . Here is a picture of his recklessness . " Theodore has just plundered two provinces so utterly that they are no better than Sahara . You have now no home , no food , no cattle , ' he says , addressing the people . I have not done it , God did it . Follow me , and I will take you where you will find plenty to eat and cattle in abundance , and you can punish those who have brought God 's anger upon you . ' With these followers he will march from place to place . carrying them like a cloud of locusts to destroy the land . " He has not lost , however , the grim humor of former days . He has a superstition that he shall die some time in the month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought to take advantage of this expectation . He assured the peasants of a certain district , from which Theodore had swept ten thousand head of cattle , that they would certainly recover them , for that the king was fated to die this year . " I may die this year , " said the king , " God knows . But I will prove that this fellow is an impostor . " So saying , he ordered the whole immense drove to be shot , which was punctually done . What are the present prospects and condition of the Abyssinian moz*arch it is difficult to say . Oi the one hand , there is no doubt that his forces are greatly reduced , and that formidable rebellions have arisen on every side . But , on the other hand , such is the fear of his military prowess , and such the superstitious dread which he still inspires , that wherever he personally comes rebellions fade out or are crushed out . It is the best proof of his real vigor of character , that , in these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his adversaries dare not bring him to bay . The German missionary , Flad , says contemptuously : " The rebels talk big and do little . The king of Shoa " ( a province containing a third part of Abyssinia ) " writes that he is coming to take Magdala . He writes like a child . The very name of Theodorus would make him hide under his mother 's dress . " Were it not for the English , who , however big they may talk , are pretty sure to make their talk good , one would be apt to prophesy to the king , if not a peaceful crown , at least the power to ride in the future , as in the past , uppermost on the stormy waves . After reading the many accounts of the remorseless cruelty of this singular being , one is astonished to learn from the concurrent testimony of many that he is a fine-looking and even handsome man , of a dark complexion , forehead full , eyes bright and piercing , . mouth perfect , expression full of mildness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and manners gracious and polite , and , when he wishes , full of delicacy and tact . How did the English get complicated with this savage ? That is a long story , and has a great many chapters in it , and some of them are written in characters which perhaps nobody can deci // pher . The London Times 4says that " England is like the man in the Eastern story , who threw his date-stones about carelessly , and hit the son of the terrible Genii . " Not exactly ; for , as we recall the tale , the man never could have known his danger , while England , if she did not know , ought to have known that her date-stones were flying straight at one of , the most jealous and proud of the African Genii . A member of Parliament says this quarrel finds its true origin in the appointment of Mr. Plowden consul . Hardly . Some of the general causes are older yet , and the special causes are certainly more recent . Any one who studies carefully the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century preceding 1855 , will find that in that period there was springing up an intense naval and commercial rivalry between the two great powers , England and France . That was the time when the French seized Algiers and the island of Otaheite , and cast longing eyes on the Sandwich Island group . Then it was that England got possession of that impregnable stronghold and safe harbor , Aden . About that time French and English steamers began to ply upon the Red Sea . Simultaneously it seemed to occur to both parties that it would be a good stroke of policy to establish mercantile relations with Abyssinia , and Lhrough Abyssinia with the vast regions of Central Africa . Between 1837 and 1842 France sent no less than three expeditions into the country , under special instructions to ascertain where a grand en/r***t for French goods could best be established , and what towns would furnish fitting stations for agents and sub-agents . About this time , too , * rance bought on rather poor security some indifferent ports on the Red Sea , which have not proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has now secret commercial agents in Abyssinia , who have done all they could to undermine the English . The authority for this last is doubtful . Meantime , England has not been asleep . Mr. Bell probably went to Abyssinia to further British influence . He certainly used the power which he acquired to that end . Mr. Plowden was appointed consul for this very purpose . Here are some of the words of his instructions : " It is obvious that the difficulty of dealing with Abyssinia results in a great measure from the absence of any place on the coast with which a safe communication can be kept up ; and it is to the discovery of such a place that I would particularly call your attention . " For this same end , the furtherance of English commerce , Major Harris visited Shoa . But it so happened that , when an Abyssinian king really wanted to make European alliances , a change had come over the spirit of English dreams . The reason was clear . Shrewd people had found out , what they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a country so torn asunder and devastated by war was not worth having . So when King Theodore began to love the English very much , they turned the cold shoulder , and seemed disposed to deny all acquaintance with him ; in fact , gave him an unmistakable snub . Ten years before it was well enough for Consul Plowden to make his home at Gondar , three hundred miles from his true post . It was no unpardonable error to plunge deeply into the chaos of Abyssinian politics , and even to join in the fray . But now the imperative order to his successor is , to come back to Massowa and to stay there . Unfortunately the me*sage was sent one month too late to save him from a Lingering imprisonment . The desires of the Englishman and African were so wide apart ! This was another difficulty . So far as the former cared at all for the latter , he did so in the interests of commerce . The latter dreamed only of an English alliance as part of a crusade of Christian powers against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " If your England is so mighty strong , why do n't she use up the Mohammedan ? " This using up of the Mohammedan in Abyssinian eyes is i868. 7 " // the chief end of man . England then wanted to get out of the trouble ; but she could not unscathed . Mr. Plow*Ien reports , and to all appearance without rebuke , " that he had ventured to hint that the sea-coast and Massowa might be given up to Theodore , on his consent " to receive an English consul . And he was constantly dinning it into the ears of a willing minis try , that " the fatal barrier to commerce was the Turkish domination along the coast . " Now , if Mr. Plowden said all this in his official capacity , what encouragement was he not likely to whisper into the king 's ear in those years when he served in that other capacity of friend , not to say instructor and guide ? One can imagine the rage and disappointment with which Theodore read , and read them he did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed preferable to the British government to withdraw as much as possible from Abyssinian alliances and Abyssinian engagements . " Do you wonder that one of the early results of such a perusal was that Consul Cameron was sent to beat his manacled heels with Mr. Stern in a dirty dungeon ? English statesmen do not wish , of course , to own that they have made a faux-pas ; but they feel it all the same . Says Lord Stanley : " This is not the stage to discuss the propriety of diplomatic relations . The thing was done long before the present advisers of her Majesty were at the head of affairs . " What is that but a polite way of saying that his predecessor had made a fool of himself , and a very expensive one too ? Mr. Layard adds : " If we had gone on supporting the policy of helping against the Turk , all would have gone on well . " What does that mean , if not a diplomatic ' way of saying , " If we had not changed our minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the just expectations of our friend in Abyssinia " ? Here is the first chapter of complications . Just glance at another entanglement , for which England certainly is not responsible , - the missionary one . The Missionary Society thought with justice that the Christianity of that part of the world needed improving . But the Abyssinian , when he remembers that the presence and labors of Romish priests nearly cost the nation its existence four centuries ago , does not find the missionary subject an agreeable one . King Theodore , tqo , either because he was not at this time religiously inclined , or else because he believed according to the faith of his fathers , did not wish for preachers , but did wish very much for artisans . A happy thought suggested itself to Bishop Gobat of Jerusalem . Why not send artisan missionaries , laymen , apt to teach and as apt in all kinds of cunning workmanship ? No sooner said than done . M. Flad and his companions were forthwith sent to Gondar . It is impossible to acquit the missionaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who seems to have conducted the negotiations , informed them that the Abuna was favorable to them , and that they might speak with him upon the religious aspects of their work . With the king , however , they were sedulously to cover up the surplice of the priest with the blouse of the workman . They consented , and the king gave them a promise not to interfere with their belief , but no permission to preach . There has evidently been some friction . Theodore has taken gre at pains to develop the artisan side of their nature . He set them to building a chariot , which came to almost as universal a dissolution as the " one - hoss shay , " but by no means after a hundred years . He turned their skill then into the howitzer line of business , but the first specimen of their art burst with one discharge . The missionaries , on the other hand , like conscientious men , were not willing to hide their Christian light under a bushel , and so neglect the real work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation , two clergymen , Mr. Stern and Mr. Rosenthal , followed soon after the lay-preachers , but were told by Theodore that they might , if they chose , preach to the Jews or Galla // c4tives , but that they would not be allowed to discuss theological themes with his Christian subjects . Some circumstances of special irritation have arisen , particularly the treatment of the king 's letter to the queen . Many stories about this letter have been circulated . One , thaf it contained an offer *f marriage , is simply absurd . Another , that it conveyed a proposal to unite fortunes with England in an attack upon Egypt , is substantially true . But whatever may have been its contents , either from carelessness or set purpose , it slept for one or two years in a pigeon-hole of an under-secretary 's desk ; and it was not answered until the danger of certain English subjects made it *pedient to search it out , jind reply to it with all politeness . It will be admitted that the most good-humored European court would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theodore is a man of towering pride , and has , added to it , the sensitiveness of a *z5arvenzi . Of this last quality we have an amusing illustration . On one occasion he summoned into his presence the British agent , and made him sit , while no less than fifteen witnesses were brought forward to prove that the king was of royal blood , and so entitled to treat on terms of equality with any power . That he resents the affront is very evident . " XVho is this Russell ? " he said , on the reception of the long-delayed answer . " Can not your queen write to her brother Theodore herself ? " At this critical juncture Consul Cameron increased the monarch 's irritation by a great indiscretion , to give it no harsher term . Without permission , he went to the frontier of Egypt and Abyssinia , - as he says , for the purpose of promoting peace between the two powers ,  --  as the king asserts , to give counsel to a hated enemy of his race . The English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done no little to poison the king 's mind . One , terming himself Count du Bisson , wrote an article in the Journal de Nice , which was speedily translated into Egyptian , and as speedily brought to Theodore 's notice . In this remarkable article our tourist asserts that an English company is furnishing arms to a crazy black rebel called Gobezi ; that the English governor of Aden is also sending warlike stores in unlimited quantities ; that the English mean by help of this rebel to make the Red Sea an English lake and Abvssinia the seat of a great African empire . Bardel is another French adventurer . He came out as private secretary to Consul Cameron , but soon quarrelled with him . The assertion is , that this man is the channel through which every galling article appearing in English newspaper or review , and every depreciatory remark made in Parliament , is brought to the notice of the jealous monarch . Buf what need is there of seeking for just causes and explanations ? In these latter days the capricious and irrational conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you apply to the baseless suspicions of a savage . It has been said that the final cause of his bad faith was the fact that Mr. Stern had taken a few photographic views of the country , - a proceeding which , it is alleged , was looked upon with profound distrust . This explanation has been scouted as utterly unreasonable . But what mad freak may not be expected of one of whom the following story can be told ? A young Irishman , a mere boy , who had been hunting on the borders of Abyssinia , led by curiosity , came to Theodore 's camp . He had with him a rug on which was a design representing Jules Gerard attacking a lion . He thought it would please the king , and so presented it to him . Theodore looked at it . Behold the audacity of these English ! See this man , this Turk in a fez ! Who is the lion at which he is firing but myself , the lion of Abyssinia ? Wherewith he hurried the poor boy into prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fifty who are waiting with that hope deferred which makes the heart sick the slow manoeuvres of the English army . // The facts with regard to the so-called British captives ( for they seem to belong to various nationalities* are few and simple . In the year 1863  --  the month is not stated - Mr. Stern , having completed his arrangements for a mission to the Jews , or Falashas as they are called , was preparing to leave the country . As a matter of proper courtesy , he sought a parting interview with the king , taking with him for interpreters his own servant and one of Mr. Cameron 's . For some unknown reason the interpreters did not please his Majesty , and were so severely beaten that they died that night . In his agitation Mr. Stern bit his finger , an act which it appears in Abyssinia is held to indicate a purpose of revenge . Whereupon he was beaten , chained , and confined in a filthy hut . Besides the finger-biting , the reasons given for this conduct are the rumor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Mr. Stem , in a book published in England , had termed him a semi-savage , and had called some of his wholesale butcheries by the appropriate name of murders . The English consul did what he could . But the affair of the letter to the queen effectua1l* tied his hands . After a brief interval the consul himself was arrested , then the missionaries and their families ; the whole , men , women , and children , amounting perhaps to fifty individuals . They have been treated with varying circumstances of ignominy . The full vials of the monarch 's wrath have been poured out upon Mr. Stern , while the scanty stream of his kindness has been reserved for Mr. Flad and the other artisans . His conduct towards them has been marked by an incredible fickleness , making it truly impossible to tell what a day would bring forth . At one time he will give them liberty like prisoners on parole , and encourage them with hope of speedy deliverance . Then , for no conceivable cause , he will load them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day , perhaps , he will appear with a carpet and insist upon their sifting on it , and , bringing forward wine , will beg them to drink with him in mutual forgiveness . The next scene in this seriocomic drama may be the mock-trial of some of the captives for treason , and before as impressive a tribunal as can be made out of a few dozen very dirty , very greasy , and not very sweet Abyssinian barons . Sometimes the prisoners are surfeited ; sometimes they are in danger of starvation . " We had a fearful night , " says Mr. Flad . " Ladies and children were together with us . No bed , no food . The poor little children weeping and crying ; one for a bit of bread , another for milk . " The latest intelligence represents the whole party as alive and well , but still at the mercy of the king . The best proof of the essential healthiness of the A*yssinian climate is this single fact , that forty or fifty European men and women have undergone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their health . What the king expects seems cleai* enough . He is not free from the delusion of his countrymen , that Abyssinia in power and resources is the peer of any nation , and he hopes to drive England either into a course of policy which shall suit him , or else force her to pay him a heavy ransom for the restitution of her subjects . His constant change of conduct betrays the vacillation of a mind tossed between hopes of gain and fears of vengeance . The conduct of the British government has certainly been temperate . After various ineffectual efforts at correspondence with the king , the Ministry procured letters from the Coptic Patriarch at Alexandria to the king and Abuna . These were intrusted to Mr. Hormuzd Rassam , who was appointed special agent at the Court of Abyssinia . At the same time various articles were committed to his charge , which were to be given to the king whenever he should release his captives . Mr. Rassam was a Syrian Christian who had been connected with Mr. Layard in his Assyrian explorations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propriety of his selection has been sharply discussed in England . His // knowledge of Eastern languages and character , and his past success in several very delicate negotiations , seemed to indicate a special fitness . He arrived at Massowa , August , 1864 , and at once despatched a letter to Theodore . But , though his message was received , for more than a year no notice whatever was taken of it . The rumor was that the king was angry that he was not to receive his presents until he had delivered up his captives . It looked as though his stainless faith was doubted . There was a story floating about that he had sent two shrewd spies to report what sort of an embassy this was , and whether its personnel and equipments were sufficiently dignified . At last , just as the government had decided to recall Mr. Rassam , a telegram came from that gentleman . He stated that he had received a letter from the king inviting him to his court , that Mr. Cameroti had been released , that he himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the 25th of November , 1865 , he began his journey . Arrived at Gondar , he found everything bright and hopeful . Nothing could equal the king 's politeness . He had ordered the release of his prisoners . All was prepared for a speedy return . A chilling change came in this mild form : " His Majesty desires that for friendship 's sake you would remain in the country a few months . " And sure enough , for friendship 's sake , or some other equally irresistible reason , he has kept them there ever since . On the very day appointed for departure , by his order they were arrested . He has trumped up a fable about Mr. Cameron , that he at- tempted to take his departure without bidding the king an affectionate adieu , - a proceeding which so moved that friendly personage , that he has felt obliged to shut his prisoners up again , and to keep Mr. Rassam himself in honorable confinement as a hostage for the good behavior of the rest . The natives whisper quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined was completed , say they , a fortnight before the ambassador reached Gondar . Theodore accomplished just what he purposed , - the getting of one more prisoner into his hands . " The queen values Mr. Rassam very much , " he is reported to have said ; " she will pay me a great deal for him . " Lord Stanley , having exhausted all peaceable methods , in the middle of April of last year gave Theodore due notice that , if the captives were not released within three months , all amicable relations between England and Abyssinia must cease . From that moment warlike preparations were pushed forward with all possible speed ; and late in the fall the transports , containing a compact , well-equipped army of ten thousand men , dropped anchor in Annesley Bay , a few miles south of Massowa . After the debarkation , everybody seemed to be doleful . Telegrams , which came so quickly , and the letters of correspondents , which seemed to linger so unreasonably , all had one stQry , and that a bad one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing else was . The sand was glowing ; the climate was hot . Water was scarce , and flies were plenty . The mules and horses were all dying , and the men , if they were not sick , soon would be . Red tape , too , was just as great a sinner as at Sebastopol . The census had been taken , and there were for ten thousand men just ten axes , only twenty bill hooks , and not one spade or pickaxe . And then these prophets of evil looked ahead . There , frowning down upon the luckless forces , were the Ahyssinian Highlands , whose passes were steep and narrow , choked with thorns and obstructed with rocks . The foolish authorities again had furnished no blasting tools , no pulleys , no ropes . Goats might ascend and chamois-hunters , but not an army with warlike impedimenta . That was simply impossible . And if the army did get up , then it was no better off . The water must be brought twelve miles , and the provisions fifty miles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the nearer it got to Theodore , the farther the water must be carried ; and the i868. 7 's // more stragglers would be left to Abyssinian mercy . It was plain that everybody felt disconsolate , and was convinced that a bad business was ahead . Three weeks passed , and the smoke cleared a little . What was true or false in these forebodings was ascertained . To begin with , the army was on the Uighlands , in good health and spirits . The march had not been a trying one ; for under the efforts of the sappers , the Koomaylee Pass had lost all its terrors and most of its difficulties . Water , too , was found in abundance , and of the best quality . By the convincing argument of twenty pounds apiece each month , all the Shiho chiefs had been bought up , and , so far from any stragglers being cut off ; the way to the sea-shore was pronounced safer than Cheapside . Even the pure-blooded Abyssinians had not proved so evilminded as had been anticipated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the value of products . One writer complains , indeed , that , while the traditional African would have sold his father and half his blood relations for a jack-knife , this African insisted upon being paid in Austrian dollars , and even then was specially particular about weight and time of coinage . So the period of despair has been succeeded by an era of good-feeling , - the sum total of losses proving to be , first , a great many good mules , which was necessary ; and second , a great deal of good-temper , which was entirely unnecessary . The army is now well advanced on its march . Already it has been greatly helped by chiefs friendly to the English , or rather most unfriendly to Theodore ; and such aid is likely to increase rather than decrease in the future . It is dangerous to predict anything concerning results , when so many of the conditions upon which judgment must be founded are uncertain , and liable to be shifting . Yet we may safely say as much as this : it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove true . That the British army , bound on a long march in a country but little known , may encounter great difficulties , great discomforts , and even great dangers , is not improbable . There may be rough and almost impassable gorges to be smoothed down , and bridgeless rivers which shall task the invention of the engineer . An active enemy , too , may impede the march , if he cannGt *vithstand the onstt of his foe . But so far as successful armed resistai*ce is concerned , nothing seems surer than that the ten thousand good soldiers under Sir Robert Napier can crush any native army which ever stOod on Alsyssinian soil . And as to sickness , while it must be allowed that all warlike operations bring exposure and fatigue injurious to health , it is difficult to understand why warlike operations on the Ethiopian highlands , so elevated , so equable , in climate , can , without criminal carelessness , be attended with any larger m*asure of disease than is incident to all military movements unde.r the most favorable conditions . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calamity . A speaker in Parliament suggests a far more likely result . " Suppose that King Theodore should kill his prisoners , or take them out of reach , and we should find ourselves with a magmificent army on the highlands of Abyssinia , unable to inflict punishment or to take reven*e , and obliged to march back as wise as we came , amid the laughter of the whole civilized world . Pity we pledged ourselves beforehand not to occupy the country ! " The suggestion may be ventured , that , rather than come back in such shape , our kinsmen across the water would find that their pledge might be modified or else forgotten . The objects for which the war was undertaken are what everybody is curious to know . Those who have watched the quiet and steady perseverance with which England has advanced her commercial interests in all quarters of the globe are looking.for some i*ilterior purpose other than the avowed one ; and // to believe that , under the pretext of protecting her subjects , she aspires to the control of the commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often thoughtlessly said that England has entered upon this war that she may wrench from Abyssinia her ports on the Red Sea . The one sufficient-answer is , that Abyssinia does not own , and has not owned for centuries , one foot of strand on the Red Sea . So far as anyb6dy owns that shore the title is in Egypt , while Abyssinia nowhere approac ? xes it nearer than twenty or thirty miles . If ports on the Red Sea are the object , the Pasha of Egypt is the person upon whom such a demand ought to be made ; and the mouths of the Nile would be a more proper rendezvous for navies and transport than Annesley Bay . But can any one read the manly words of Lord Stanley , pervaded in every line and sentence with the spirit of sincerity , and a deep sense of responsibility , and for a moment believe that the English Ministry sends its army into Abyssinia for purposes of conquest ? " I believe that I am not demanding too much , if I ask the house to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing would have induced the present government , or indeed any government , to undertake it , but the cor ? viction of its necessity . It is quite unnecessary to disclaim the idea of conquest . We have already as much territory as we can safely hold . And , if we had not , Abyssinia is not the part of the world which England would covet . No , this work comes to us as a duty , not agreeable , but which has to be done . " The present Ministry then has no ulterior ends . No doubt there have been men in office in times past who dreamed of territorial acquisitions 1n that direction . Beyond a question , there are many men now in India , and some in England , who will use every effort to change the war from one of liberation to one of conquest . It is very possible that the exigencies of the campaign may force the Ministry to an entire change of purpose . But , 717 unless they are the falsest. of men , no visions of conquest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ministry are pushed on by a dire necessity . They are in a position where but two alternatives are possible , - war with all the cost and peril of war , and peace with the deep ignominy of le ing English subjects to their fate in tY cruel hands of a fickle tyrant . War has its difficulties . War , in these modern days , is too expensive a business to be entered upon for amusement . To use the vigorous language of the English minister : " No doubt those who have the conduct of this expedition will find difficulties in the way ; but the British Empire was not built up and made what it is by men who shrank from their obvious duty . " And as for the other alternative , what is that but simple , unmitigated disgrace ? No power could live under it , - least of all England . The hundred millions of her subjects in Asia , in Africa , in every nook and cranny of the round earth , are held under her sway by her prestige . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrong , that she can not or will not protect her children wherever they may wander , and her vast dominions , won by how many glorious contests on sea and land , cemented by her best blood , would fall asunder by simple incoherence . It is stout Roland de Caxton , if our memory serves us , who maintains that " honor is the virtue from which all safety and civilization do proceed , and that it is a virtue which should be kept clear from all money-making , mercenary , pay-mein - cash abominations . " There is a spice of truth in this language , as there is in all truly chivalrous notions . And , looking candidly on the present contest , we may be content to believe that a really great and heroic nation , like that from whose loins we ourselves are sprung , however much she may be subject to utilitarian ideas , can upon occasions rise quite above them , and encounter difficulties , and dare perils , and lavish treasure and blood , from simple sense of honor and duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
