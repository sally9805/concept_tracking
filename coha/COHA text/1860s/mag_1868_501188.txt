A CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF THE LATE WAR . USUALLY , in the history of wars , the legislative department of the goveminent makes a considerable and interesting figure . It is not only that branch of the government which holds the purse and administers supplies ; but it also furnishes the arena of that debate which may be taken for the fresh and current commentary of public opinion on the great events as they transpire . Thus , in all mGdern histories of war , the legislative assembly or body comes in for conspicuous notice , and furnishes a large subject for critical disquisitions . It is in this general view that it is remarkable that the Congress of the Confederate States should have been so utterly sunk out of sight in all present historical notices , on both sides , of the late war . But it must be confessed that the little attention heretofore given it in the popular compends of the war is not so much to be ascribed to the neglect or slight of the historian as to the actual meagreness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a pretence of performing legislative duties in the South during the war . It was really the most inane , unimportant , incompetent , and barren of public assemblies . And yet we believe that , in the just sense of history , it was curious for its comparative blankness , the very absence of practical details ; and we , therefore , propose to supply a brief sketch of the Confederate Congress , as of a subject heretofore overlooked by the annalists of the war . The subject is new to most readers ; it has been unduly neglected ; and the little it affords of information yet strongly provokes curiosity , and suggests lively and , perhaps , valuable speculations for the philosophic historian . There were , properly , two Southern Congresses , two distinct legislative organizations in the history of the war ; one Provisional , the other Permanent . The provisional Congress was composed of delegates sent to Montgomery , and afterward to Richmond , by the different State conventions , as they respectively passed ordinances of secession . It was part of the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was supposed would continue for only a few months ; and it is a fact not generally noticed or estimated , that it was designed at iIontgomery to determine a *errnanent system of government for the South only after the war had concluded , and to accommodate its results . The length and pre-occupation of the war defeated this design , and so busy was the South repelling the enemy in February , 1862  --  the period appointed for a permanent organization of the government-that there was no time for the political afterthought , no time to execute a design , which possibly lurked in the minds of some of the Southern leaders , to change the form of government ; and thus the provisional passed into the permanent government with slight ceremony , and without even a canvass or an opposing candidate to question the succession of Mr. Davis to the presidency , or to disturb his authority . He ascended from the mere provisional chief of a rebellion to the office of President of the Confeder // ate States for the term of six years , without question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his cabinet , or in the executive branches of his government . But in this curious political translation  --  the event of a day marked only by a tawdry ceremony in Capitol square-there was a radical change in Congress . Formerly it was hut one house , possibly from the idea that a single legislative body is most efficient in time of war . Now , it was divided into a Senate and House of Representatives , after the fashion of the old government at Washington . The provisional Congress had been designed as a revolutionary council rather than as a regular legislative body ; it was a national assembly , but with the defect that , instead of being the fresh and immediate representative of the popular will , it was the secondary and weak creature of conventions . Yet it contained some distinguished names , and , when first organized , there was considerable weight of character in it . Howell Cobb , of Georgia , was its President . All the heads of the Executive Departments had seats in it , and participated in its debates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished themselves at Washington in leading from there the first movements of secession , such as Toombs , Wigfall , Pryor , and Keitt . But a single measure expelled from Congress nearly all it had of worth and talents , and in a day reduced it to an inane body of mediocrities . Its most distinguished m embers had also military commissions ; they were generals , colonels , etc. , as well as legislators . It was a time when the most brilliant and ambitious men of the South sought the field , and preferred its honors ; and , when a few weeks after the first session of the Congress in Richmond , the objection was raised that the two careers were incompatible , and that members of Congress could not hold military commissions , the decision drove from it nearly every man of merit or note . Military men who had come down from Manassas to take their places in Congress , and who proposed to fill the pauses of the war with legislative duties , were excluded , and compelled to rejoin their commands , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant men , who were satisfied to remain in seats which soon came to be considered as even dishonorable in comparison with the places of glory and danger in the field . The decision that excluded military officers from Congress was , probably , just , hut in many respects unfortunate . It accounts for that extreme intellectual degradation which made the Confederate Congress a peculiar stock of shame in the war , actually one of the weakest and most inane bodies that ever met under the title of a legislative assembly in historical times . It came , at last , to be composed chiefly of two classes-men who were neyer before publicly known , or old politicians , too far broken down in their fortunes to attempt new careers or to be invited by the prospect of military honors . This prospect , unfortunately for the South , drew from its political councils too much of its best mind , and may be said to have abandoned the whole government to Mr. Davis and a few weak creatures surrounding him ; alt bough in later periods of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field , either from disappointment there or from resentment of what they supposed Mr. Davis 's disfavor , returned to plague him and to assail his administration ; but , unhappily , only after it had sunk almost beneath reproach . Beyond this brief and exceptional animation , the history of the Confederate Congress is scarcely more than that of the reflection of the will and temper of President Davis  --  a mere servile appendage to an autocracy the most supreme of modern times . // It is difficult to understand how , at one time of the war , the political concerns of the Southern Confederacy were almost entirely abandoned to Mr. Davis and a Congress which was scarcely more than a figure-head , unless we take into account a peculiar passion in the South for military service that marked the first years of hostilities . There was nothing like it in the North ; there the ambition for military honors was not so absorbing , and the labors and aspirations of public men were divided with singular fairness between the political council and the field . But to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been almost exclusively directed . Scarcely anything was attempted in that career of statesmanship which , in such great historical periods , should run even with that of arms . The best men of the South neglected all former fields of political ambition ; they were no longer anxious to be known as statesmen , or legislators , or orators , when they might be known as successful generals . It was not only that the South , probably from its natural temper , placed a higher value on martial prowess than did the North , but the former had a peculiar estimation of the war-it was pro aris et focis ; and there was a public sentiment that drove men into the army from every occupation in life , and from every seat of public office , until , at last , civil office was held in disrepute , and the government was denuded almost to the point of stark incapacity . This inflated desire for the military field might have been admirable in some respects ; but none , except those who witnessed its wild and sweeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political arena , or estimate the injury it wrought in surrendering the civil affairs of the Southern Confederacy to incompetent men , and securing an easy and blind toleration of Mr. Davis and the servile Congress that waited on and executed his decrees . Indeed , for the first year of the war Mr. Davis was actually the legislator of the Confederacy , and laws framed in the Executive Office were as regularly sent into the dingy room in which Congress sat in secret session as th&amp;common communications of information from the departments . Unfortunately , Mr. Davis had an excessive conceit that he was born under the star of Mars , and that he was excellently qualified to legislate on military subjects ; and Congress was weak enough to indulge his foolish and pragmatical fancy . He was the real author of two notable military measures , in the first year of the war , which brought the Confederacy to the brink of ruin , and , indeed , would have delivered her an easy prey to the enemy , had the hesitating and unready McClellan known the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law passed in December , i86i , of which it has been well-remarked its true title would have been " to disband the armies of the Confederacy . " It was the fruit of the lowest demagogueism . It permitted the men to change their arm of the service , to elect new officers , and to reorganize throughout the army . It was said that the soldiers claimed the letter of their contract  --  to leave the service at the expiration of one year ; and the weak legislators at Richmond thought it necessary to indulge what was called their democratic sense of individualism by allowing them to reduce the organization and discipline of the army to whatever standards would content them , and to convert their camps into a carnival of misrule , and into the vilest scenes of electioneering for commissions . This so-called " reorganization " had gone on in the face of an enemy who , if he had taken timely advantage of it , would have found little else than demoralized men disgracing the uniform of soldiers , covering the most vital points of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // country with braid on his shoulders , plied the men with the lowest arts of the cross-roads politician , even to the argument of whiskey , and contributed to the general demoralization , until the men , feeling the power to dethrone their present officers , lost all respect for their authority , and became the miserable tools of every adventurer and charlatan who imposed upon their confidence . Not satisfied with demoralizing the army , another legislative measure was passed , some months later , under the inspiration of Mr. Davis , to deplete it . With the professed purpose of inciting re*nlistments , it was provided that furloughs for sixty days should be granted all those soldiers who would reenlist for three years or the war , said furloughs to be dealt out in lots drawn from each company . The consequence was , the Southern armies wasted away in front of the enemy , and at a period most critical-when he was completing his own elaborate and imposing preparations for the spring campaign of 1862 . Those who lived in Richmond in those times will remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in magnitude of numbers almost an army , sometimes in a single day an unbroken throng stretching from the depot on Broad street to the bridge over the James . It appeared as if the army in Northem Virginia had disbanded . The newspapers could not use remonstrance ; and how narrow was their field for critical discussion , may be understood from the fact that they were enjoined to make no reference that could possibly be construed as revealing any weakness in the Confederacy , so as " to give information to the enemy . " This absurd rule was practised on the press , sometimes to the point of puerility ; and once it is known that Secretary Benjamin prepared an order to suppress the Richmond " Examiner , " because its criticisms of public affairs gave information to the enemy . Mr. Davis prudently declined to sign the order , and Mr. Benjamin , or his successors , never dared to repeat the experiment on a free and virile press . But though , in the instance of public danger referred to , the press was dumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They took the alarm before it was too late . Generals Johnston and Beauregard united in letters of protest , and it was only when they intimated that they would resign their commands before their forces should be spirited away by foolish legislation , that Congress repealed the disastrous law , or , rather , unwilling to incur the appearance of concession , suffered its operations to be withheld by military orders . When the Permanent Congress came in-which it did when Mr. Davis was inaugurated President on the 22d of February , 1862-it was hoped that there would be an infusion of new blood and vigor in this withered branch of the Government . It commenced well , with the passage of a conscription law , in place of the old system of volunteers . The critical value of this law may be estimated from the fact that nearly two-thirds of the forces with which General Lee , some months later , saved Richmond from the hosts of McClellan , were gathered under its operations . It saved the Confederacy for the time , and gave a new lease to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conscription law was not properly produced by Congress , but had been prepared for it before it met , by the press , even to details , Congress only adopting it from the columns of the newspapers , and only after the latter had carefully brought public opinion up to the necessary point of sacrifice . If any one is to stand as author of this law , it is the Richmond " Examiner . " When it first proposed such a measure , another journal , popularly known as Mr. Davis 's organ , opposed it , and actually scoffed it as a reflection on the patriotism of the South . Mr. Davis-who had that wretched and dangerous vanity which resents the tone of suggestion , no // matter what the value of the counsel it would impart , and who , besides , had his own reasons to hate the " Examiner **-was long in being brought to the conscription ; and he at last ungracefully and imperfectly yielded the recommendation which the necessity of the case extorted from his pride of opinion . He referred to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable jesuitism , having at once the shamelessness and the shallowness to pretend that the conscription , instead of testifying to any necessity in the South for troops , was really intended to moderate the rage for volunteering . He wrote a paltry and detestahle falsehood rather than an ingenuous statement . In his message to Congress he declared : " The operation of the various laws now in force for raising armies has exhibited the necessity for reform . . . . The vast preparations made by the enemy for a combined assault at numerous points on our frontier and seaboard , have produced results that might have been expected . They have animated the people with a spirit of resistance so general , so resolute , and so self-sacrificing , that it requires rat/icr to be regulated tkau stimulated ! " In the conscription law , Congress demanded from the people the greatest of sacrifices ; and it followed the act by resolutions , offered by Mr. Rawles , of Albama , and unanimously adopted , announcing to the world that " it is the unalterable determination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most protracted war , but that they will never , on any terms , politically affiliate with a people who are guilty of an invasion of their soil and the butchery of their citizens . " Would it he believed that after such testimonies , this Congress would , a few weeks later , give , in the person of its own members , an exhibition of the most arrant cowardice and the meanest selfishness-an exhibition almost incredible , and unparalleled , perhaps , in similar historical circumstances in modern times It was at the time when McClellan was approaching Richmond , and it was feared that the Confederate capital would fall into his possession . It was a memorable season of popular alarm ; there were uneasy whispers in Richmond ; a panic was threatened ; and it was just that critical period when the authorities were required and called upon to do everything to nourish and sustain public confidence . The infamous response of Congress to the popular alarm was to exceed it , to adjourn precipitately , to break up in confusion , its members fleeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execrations of the press , the hootings of the populace , and with even the contempt of the women thrown after them . The shame of the fugacious Congress was in the mouth of every one in Richmond . It was one of the most contemptible and ludicrous incidents of the war . The shop-windows were filled with caricatures of it-one of the most popular , and which might be considered to have originated the tradition of the cai*et-bag , representing a fat and terrified Congressman , with his slight baggage in hand , pursued by a gun-boat , the apparition of a magnified insect mounted on spindle legs . The cowardice of the Congress in this flight from McClellan was so extravagant that the people of Richmond actually took heart from its contrast to their own reasonable fears , in which they had not yet lost their self-possession , and amused themselves in ridiculing and lampooning it . The Richmond " Whig* ' announced the hasty adjournment and its consequences in the folloxving paragraph : For fear of accidents on the railroad , the stampeded Congress left in a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn by mules of approved sweetness of temper . To protect the stampeders from the snakes and bull-frogs that abound // along the line of the canal , General Winder has detailed a regiment of ladies to march in advance of the mules , and clear the tow-path of the pirates . The ladies will accompany the stampeders to a secluded cave in the mountains of Hepsidan , and leave them there in charge of the children of the vicinage , until McClellan thinks proper to let them come forth . The ladies return to the defence of their country . The Confederate Congress re-assembled at Richmond in August , i86 2 , tO enter upon a prolonged term of existence , which , for some time , was scarcely more than a dreary servitude to Mr. Davis . Its existence was almost unnoticed , except for some occasional foolish and empirical measure , with which it startled the public . It transacted all important business in secret session . It was a violent affectation of the concealed habits of a despotism , and its insolent withdrawal fi-om public notice presenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which claimed to represent the people of a country , and to he acting by their authority and in their behalf sitting with closed doors , and withholding all its important transactions from their knowledge . Such an exhibition illustrates that curious mixture in the Southern Confederacy , which made it such a strange and anomalous government , holding out to the world republican forms and yet practising in many things the recluseness and isolation and arrogance of the worst despotisms . Occasionally there would issue from these veiled mysteries of legislation the most unexpected and astounding measures , some of them expressing the most puerile conceits , and disarming criticism by the very excess of their absurdity . Such was the empiricism which repudiated one-third of the public debt , destroying the public credit , with but little immediate advantage to the government ; for it would certainly have been much better if the currency was to be forcibly reduced , that it should have been brought down at once , as Mr. Boyce of South Carolina proposed , to the specie value of five cents on the dollar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members . The law just referred to excepted from the partial repudiation all notes of five dollars and less ; and it is notorious that before the promulgation of the law , a distinguished Senator bought up the small currency in every broker 's shop in Richmond , and made his millions by the operation . But such corruption was only a day 's gossip . The Confederate Congress had long ceased to maintain anything of public respect . Its secret sessions were regarded only with slighting or suspicious interest ; and when it did indulge in public some slight discussion , those who happened to attend the exhibition confessed themselves stricken with shame , and repeated the coihmon bit of sarcasm in Richmond of " the college debating society on Capitol Hill . " The appearance of the Congress was singularly plain and unimposing . It was mostly composed of men who were as ordinary in appearance as they were dull in mind . Its surroundings were excessively democratic , dingy , and dirty , and the poverty of the Confederacy scarcely afforded those conveniences and accessories , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halls of our legislation . The Congress sat in the " State House , " and such was the want of convenient room , that the Senate was forced to occupy a room in the third story , separated by a simple railing from the audience ; the only apparent distinction between it and the rough crowd ( for there was no accommodation for ladies ) being that the Senators sat , while the listeners and loafers , having not even benches , were satisfied to find standing-room on the same floor , with the slight separation we have described . The House had a better chamber ; but the bare // walls , where there were no paintings , the uncushioned chairs , the dingy desks slashed with pocket-knives , and the attitudes of members , with their heels in air , or their bodies sprawled over two or three chairs , gave one but little idea of legislative dignity or decorum . There were not more than half a dozen men in both Houses who were before known to the country , or had enjoyed a reputation a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the enemy , who had been elected by a few dozens of soldiers ' votes cast in camp . It was absurd to find Senators and Representatives from Missouri , Arkansas , Louisiana , etc. , holding their seats by virtue of a handful of votes cast by soldiers from these respective States in the camps of the Army of Northern Virginia . Among these unworthy members of Congress were some ridiculous figures , and not a few rustic curiosities who suggested the backwoods and the sedge-fields . The men who relieved something of the rude and ludicrous aspect of the body had generally served before in the old Congress at Washington ; but it was often remarked that even they appeared to have lost their former force and dignity , and to have been belittled by the company in which they were misplaced . There were of remarkable members in the House , Mr. Foote , who spoke classical English , and dealt historical illustrations to the unappreciating homespun members , a voluble debater , but afflicted with extravagance and a colicky delivery ; William Porcher Miles , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a master of deportment , deprecating anything like violence in speech or manner ; Barksdale , of Mississippi , the especial friend and champion of Mr. Davis , the leader of the Administration party in the House , a small , dark-featured man , who spoke so vehemently as sometimes to overrun the rules of grammar , but really forcible , dealing rude blows with facts and solid arguments . In the Senate were Yancey , of Alabama , the silver-tongued orator of the South , speaking a subdued but luxuriant language , quite unlike that of the American hustings ; Wigfall , of Texas , fierce , impatient , incandescent , illustrating another school of eloquence ; Orr , of South Carolina , an excellent man in the committee-room , but as heavy and blundering as a school-boy in his speeches ; and Hill , of Georgia , the very picture of a smooth and plausible mediocrity , having much of address and of gentlemanly equivocations , inclining to the administration of the President , but at an angle nice and variable in the degrees . In a body chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as exceptions the names above-there might naturally be expected some breaches of decorum and some scenes of personal violence . Indeed , several most extraordinary scenes of this sort occurred in the Confederate Congress , which were either suppressed in the newspapers , or were but meagrely and tenderly mentioned in their columns . An occurrence at a certain time , by which the whole House of Representatives was thrown into a panic and into the most disgraceful disorder , was so carefully suppressed that but few people in Richmond ever obtained any knowledge of it , or ever suspected that a scene of bloodshed was about to be enacted behind the convenient curtains of a secret legislative session . The immediate parties to the disgraceful occurrence ( which happened in the summer of 1863 ) were Mr. Foote , of Tennessee , and Judge Dargan , of Alabama , the latter an old man whose eccentric dress and whose soliliquies on the street were well known in Richmond , and whose habit in Congress of scratching his arms and saying " Mr. Cheer-man , " had often brought him under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defiance had passed between the two members . While Judge Dargan was speaking , Mr. Foote sat near him , and muttered that he was a " d-d rascal . " The member from Alabama immediately drew a bowie knife , brandished it in the gas-light ( it was a night session ) , amid the shouts and cries of the House , and made for the member from Tennessee . For a moment all was consternation , and members rushed to the scene of encounter . Several of them literally threw themselves upon Judge Dargan , and wrested from his grasp the murderous weapon ; when , just at this moment , Dargan having been pinned to the floor , the whole scene was converted into one irresistibly ludicrous , shouts of laughter succeeding those of passion , as Mr. Foote , striking an attitude and smiting his expanded breast , exclaimed with peculiar melodramatic air , " I defy the steel of the assassin ! " Another memorable scene of personal violence was in the Senate , and was more tragical in its results . In a secret session of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Hill , in which the latter , being greatly superior in strength , threw his antagonist across a desk , and bent him over it , continuing to strike him in the face . The consequence was a wrenching and severe injury to Mr. Yancey 's spine . It was rumored that it caused his death a few months later ; but there is at least no doubt that it hastened the decline of a constitution already feeble by years and disease . There were other scenes of indecorum in the Congress , of which we may spare details , in one of which a member was flogged with a cowhide in his seat for some indignity or aspersion in social life . Half an hour after this dramatic display took place , messages were flying to all the newspapers in Richmond asking that their reporters should make no mention of it , putting the request on the ground that the publication would degrade the character of the Confederacy , and might be construed as " givi/ig ixformatioll to die enemy/ " There is no intention of satire or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was actually given by sapient Congressmen , and accepted by complaisant journalists . The newspapers were generally taught an obligation to put all Confederate affairs in the color of the rose , and to dress them up in the stiffest garments of dignity . To relate anything prejudicial to the Confederacy , to mention even a derogatory social incident , was to incur in the minds of certain vain and paltry , but numerous persons in the South , the charge of publishing " contraband " matter , or of at least lacking in proofs of Southern patriotism . It was thus , to an extent , that the reader of this day can scarcely believe that public opinion in the Southern Confederacy was disarmed , and a wretched Congress passed almost unchallenged and unnoticed4hrough a history of vile excesses and flagitious scenes . But there is yet something to be said of this Congress , of serious historical importance . In another part of this article we have referred to some exceptional animation in it toward the end of the war . It came from an opposition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few men of power , incited by the press , and aroused and alarmed by the evidently declining fortunes of the Confederacy . If it had had the intellectual capacity and the nerve , its disposition would have carried it to the extent of a cou* dY/at against Mr. Davis . It was astonishing how , in the last periods of the war , it threw off its servile habit to the President .. It became as men often do who have long lived in mean and interested compliance and then break away from it , sudden and violent in its resentment . In this disposition it was spurred by the newspapers . The Rich- // 757 mond " Examiner " wrote : " It will be for Congress to repair as it best can the mischief done the public service by a weak and impracticable Executive ; to look at the reduction of our forces in the field ; the decay of military discipline ; the demoralization of our armies , and the jeopardy to which our cause has been put by a long course of trifling conduct , childish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceit , defiance of public opinion , imperiousness , and despotic affectation on the part of those intrusted with the execution of the war . " In less passionate phrase , but with not less determined purpose , the Charleston " Mercury " said : " Congress must assume its duties under the Constitution as an independent element of power . It must abandon the idea that it is only a secret power for resisting the will of the President . It must be the people standing forth in the light of day , clothed with the whole legislative power of the Government , and with their agent , the President , instrumental for their deliverance . . . . But if President Davis is to be treated as our Moses , ' we really do not see the use of Congress . If the people , through their representatives in Congress , are to exercise no power but at the bidding of the Executive , Congress is a nonentity . It is worse , it is the tool of the Executive by which the Constitution is practically overthrown , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a base assumption of power on the part of the Executive , and a baser betrayal of trust on the part of Congress . " But the opposition that thus sprang up in the later years of the war between the Confederate Congress and the President , although stimulated by public opinion , and carried to the point of personal exasperation , was singularly without results . Some of this opposition in Congress was merely petulant . Mr. Foote represented it in the Lower House with voluble speeches , but without weight of character to impress even his shallow audience . In the Senate , General Wigfall , who had returned from the army to the political arena , was more formidable . Perhaps the greatest orator of the South , he spoke with powerful effect , in language that could mount from the most even and classical flow of words to the most rugged and eccentric force , and sometimes penetrating his audience with the electrical passion that would blaze in his seamed and fierce face . The Richmond papers feared to report his bitter and vindictive speeches . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he roasted that " amalgam of malice and mediocrity , " as he described the august person of Mr. Davis . But after all , these were fruitless censures and declamations , and no positive measure ever grew out of them beyond a formal relinquishment of the control of military affairs to General Lee , which he practically never accepted . The fact is  --  and it is a fact that has never had its just proportion of mention in the current histories of the war-there was in the last year of hostilities a serious and determined thought in the minds of the Southern people to get up a counter-revolution in the Confederacy , or , at least , to overthrow the military authority of Mr. Davis ; and that the Congress , while weakly assuming to respond to this design , really belittled it , and reduced it to nothing more than a wordy and indecent controversy with the President . It never represented the depth of the public sentiment in the Confederacy on this subject . It fell utterly below the occasion , and degraded an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly have saved the Confederacy , to a low competition in recriminating and fruitless words . Meanwhile , it is curious to notice the shape which the intercourse between 48 // President Davis and the Congress took toward the end of the war . It became a singularly devious intercourse , in which delegations composed of five or six Congressmen would visit the President in a private way , and make remonstrances and protests to him on special subjects . The public was generally kept in ignorance of these back-door communications ; it was a private sort of interlocution and catechism dishonorable to both parties , and the incidents of which would scarcely bear publication . On one occasion Mr. Foote , with two or three other Congressmen , visited the President to make some remonstrance about the military commands in the West , and abruptly retired from the room without finishing their mission , on the allegation of Mr. Foote that Mr. Davis had spies posted in or near the room , to catch and retail the conversation ! On another occasion a Congressional delegation called on Mr. Davis to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army of Tennessee , representing that he had quitted it on a short sick furlough , not supposing that the advantage would be meanly taken of construing his furlough into a resignation , and forcing him into retirement . The President replied , in measured and memorable words : " If the whole world was to ask me to restore General Beauregard to the command which I have already given to General Bragg , I would refuse it . " Yet another instance of desperate remonstrance by Congress deserves to be related . Senator Orr , of South Carolina , backed by several Congressmen , attempted to procure the removal of Commissary Northrop , moved by the outcry from the army and the country against an officer especially hateful and ignorant , who was ridiculed for his grotesque incompetency , and had been lampooned as a vegetarian and " the pepper-doctor from North Carolina . " " Gentlemen , " replied Mr. Davis , " you do not know Mr. Northrop as I do . I assure you he is a great military genius , and if he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the command of one of the armies in the field . " And so Lee 's army was left to starve on the theoretic genius of the pepper-doctor , and Congress , abas bed and impotent , was left to eke out the barren remnant of its days . It is remarkable that this Congress , which had lived so dishonorably , giving so much of imbecile and disgraceful record to the Southern story of the war , should have fitly expired in a weak and disreputable recrimination with President Davis . Its last official act was to raise a committee in the Senate to report upon a message in which Mr. Davis had reproved it for designing to abandon the affairs of the Confederacy , and to leave important interests unprovided for , as the enemy approached and pressed upon the capitol . He wrote : " The capitol of the Confederate States is now threatened , and it is in greater danger than it has heretofore been during the war . " Congress replied that it had finished its legislation , that it proposed to adjourn , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government , it did not lie at the doors of the legislative department . It adjourned on the *8th of March , 1865 , unwilling to witness the end which it saw approaching , and repeating the cowardice of its flight in 1862 , refused to take any official lot in the final catastrophe . Thus meanly expired a legislative body , remarkable in the annals of the world for its weakness and ignorance , whose record was a constant degradation of the Confederate name , and whose composition and nature will afford to the future historian an especial study among the contradictions and curiosities of the late war .
