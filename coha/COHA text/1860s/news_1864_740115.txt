txt There are indications that our troops will have more work to do in this valley before it is yielded up to Federal rule , and possioly within a very few days . Intelligent rumor gives E Arai reinforcements . That he has a desire to retrieve his fallen fortunes is a fact fully set forth in the published address to his den , comments upon which I made in a previous letter . Another indication of activity on the part of the enemy was shown last night near this place . A small detachment of rebel cavalry made their way to the infantry pickets , less than two miles west of the town , captured three men and wounded another . A detachment of the Twenty-second Pennsylvania Cavalry went out subsequently in pursuit , and succeeded in capturing several of the party and wounding a few . The prisoners represent that IMBoDaN , Many and MOBLEY have united their decimated forces , and for the present will act in conjunction ; probably they will threaten this place occasionally , or attempt to make a dash across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force will be on the lookout for some valuable train on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad , or between this and Winchester . What seems to give some color to the report as to the cooperation of the ! parties named above , isthe fact that a force , numbering at least 400 or 500 men , has been seen during the last week between this point and Winchester . Indeed they have threatened several supply trains . I opine , however , that the day has passed by when even the combined forces of the three men named will be able to do much harm to trains or Government property . Martinsburgh , under the rule of Gen. SEWARD , is rapidly improving in , general appearance , and notwithstanding this is the depot for the supplies of a large army , and the town is constantly full of a migratory population , order reigns in every department ; so much so , indeed . that ladles parade the streets In large numbers , unattended by gentlemen , and are as free from annoyance as though in the streets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns under military rule . As I write , word comes in that our cavalry at Fisher 's Hill , or Round Top , had a little skirmish with the enemy night before last . Tnere was also some picket firing at different points along the front . All surplus wagons and stores have been moved out of the way , so that the army is as mobile as it is possible to make it . PREBRITATION . En passant , I will mention that a very deserving officer  --  Col , BASBETT , Eighty-second Pennsylvania Volunteers , commanding Tnird Brigade , First Division , Sixth Corps , stationed at Winchester  --  was recently presented with a valuable sword and accoutrements by the officers of the command , as a token of their respect and esteem for him as an officer and man . This being Emancipation Day in Maryland , as a matter of course , it is the subject of comment in every circle . I find that even Secessionists here are disposed , to acquiesce in the march of events , and some go so far as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now have nothing more to battle for . When the people of a State like Matyland  --  or a majority of the loyal people of that State , find it for their interest or politic to overturn . in a single day , as it were , their whole social system . it leads the opponents of free labor to think that there must be something radically wrong in it . Little or no heed , whatever , is given to the fact that only a minority of the people who voted for the Presidential candidates four years ago , saw fit to vote for the new Constitution ; for , they argue an institution not worth the sacrifice they were called upon to make , certainly is not worth Perpetuating . It should be borne in mind that there has always existed a strong sympathy between this portion of Virginia and Western Maryland . So nearly allied are they socially , that the feelings of people here may be safely taken as the predominant feeling across the river .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
