THE present fearful crisis in our national affairs , though it came upon the greater part of the citizens of our republic like a thunderbolt out of the clear sky , corresponds only too well with the expectations of the patriotic men who formed our Constitution . Our government has already lasted longer than they anticipated . The permanent union of even the thirteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and interest , seemed to them beyond hope . Their aim was to ward // off for a while anarchy or military despotism , and to hold the several commonwealths together till they should float into smoother waters . To this aim we owe the snrvivance of our Constitution to the present time , and its adaptation to the needs of a free people for an indefinite future . Its framers , planning primarily to meet the then existing exigency , would not build a ship of state , which would surely have foundered in the next gale . They constructed a raft , which should bend and yield , take the very shape of the waves , let the water in and out freely through its seams and junctures , and by its loose couplings and elastic movement divide and dissipate the force of any sudden shock . But , though they saw it not , this was the very structure suited to defy time no less than wave and storm ; and it has been imperilled and damaged mainly by the attempt to consolidate it , to bind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free scope and sway to its separate members . In proportion to this tendency in our administration , it has been weakened by the very measures designed to strengthen it , till now some of its couplings have parted , others are strained almost to the point of rupture , and the hearts of loyal citizens palpitate in dread of its entire disintegration and dissolution . The founders of our government evidently intended to lodge in the central administration only such powers as were essential to the common safety , order , and well-being , and to leave to the individual States entire jurisdiction over their local institutions , without interference from beyond their borders . The tendency of national politics has been to encroach gradually on the reserved rights of the States . To the unpopularity of this tendency the Federal party succumbed early in the present century ; but the instinctive love of power soon led the victorious party to adopt the same policy , which has for the most part been prevalent in our national counsels , and has , on other issues than that now paramount , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at nullification which have their record in our history . Of late years the sectional parties which joined issue on the question of slavery have aimed to nationalize their respective policies , - the one to legislate for the exclusion of slavery from the common domain of the nation , and to inter-42* // fere with the right of reclamation as regards fugitive slaves , which , lamentable as it is in its exercise , is yet incident to the national compact ; the other , to extend the legal existence and protection of slavery beyond the limits which our fathers contemplated , and which the comity of sister States renders expedient . Hence the secession and disunion , which are already working so disastrously , and the end of which no human foresight can predict . We are unwilling as yet to believe the restoration of the sundered Union impossible . By such concessions as may be made without the sacrifice of principle , the border Slave States may be preserved within the confederation ; if they remain , it will clearly be for the interest of the seceding States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present paroxysm of hostile feeling shall give place to calmer thought , the reviving love of country may merge the fierce sectional antipathy now rife . Meanwhile it becomes the prime duty of those in power , and of those whose sovereign behests our rulers but register and execute , to use every honorable endeavor for the prevention of a fratricidal war , - that direst of all events , we should say , did not there loom up in almost inevitable connection with it the untold horrors of a servile war . In this view , we can not overestimate our indebtedness to the bold and wise discretion of Major Anderson , in withdrawing his little garrison from a weak fortress which invited tumultuous attack ; for , blood once drawn in civil feud , it was hardly possible that the entire North and the entire South should not have risen forthwith in internecine hostility . It may be that , in the future history of this epoch , this soldier , modest as he is brave and loyal , will find himself written the saviour of his country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not time to speak judicially . No man can have ever occupied a more difficult post than our late chief magistrate in the closing months of his official term . The progress of events may justify what seemed a vacillating policy . It was certainly in his power to hasten collision between the seceding States and the forces of the nation ; and if he has been indeed actuated , not by unmanly fear , or by personal favor , or by his intimacy with disunionists , but by the love of country and of peace , the // purity of his motives will be recognized when the heat of strife and the stress of peril are overpassed . It is too early to take a calm review of the initial acts of the disunion drama , and a veil which no human foresight can penetrate hangs over those that yet remain . The national title and aim of our journal would forbid , did not our own principles and feelings preclude , recrimination , or the utterance of harsh sectional feeling . Yet we should be false to the demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our pages all discussion of the institution which is the source and cause of the evils we experience and dread . Moreover , the calm , temperate , and kindly treatment of this subject should be welcomed from whatever quarter , as tending to allay bitterness , to elicit conciliatory sentiments where they are wanting , and to strengthen them where they exist . We propose , therefore , to consider slavery not so much in its national relations as in its origin , its causes , and its remedies . An institution is but a social fact , org ? anized and legalized . The fact precedes the institution , and often exceeds it , and exists in full force beyond its pale . This is emphatically the case with slavery . It was not created by , nor is it confined within , the institutions that give it name and sanction . It exists all the world over , and the very laws which seem to define its localities , while in some respects they intensify it , in others restrain and limit it . To us who boast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and denunciation against our Southern brethren , there might well be a rejoinder in the words of the old Hebrew prophet : " Are there not with you , even with you , sins against the Lord your God ? " Slavery has its origin in the essential conditions of human society . So long as there is an unequal distribution of talent , advantage , opportunity , and enterprise , there must be no less wide inequalities in the distribution of property ; there must be the rich and the poor , - the very rich , the very poor , - those who command the resources for the subsistence of all , and those who are dependent in some form on their more fortunate neighbors for their daily bread . Hence the division of the community into the employers and the employed , or , more // accurately , into the privileged classes and the proletaries. * Under the former head we include not only those who live on the income of property , but those who subsist by salaries or fees for such services as imply or confer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter we group all who depend for their livelihood on such manual labor as demands little or no skill , and is regarded and compensated as mere hand-work . Now , omitting all consideration of moral elements in society , there is an antagonism of interests between the privileged and the proletaries . The former will seek from the latter as much work , and at as low a cost , as possible ; and the auguries of success are all on their side . From their superior intelligence and freer command of the means of communication , concerted or coincident action throughout an entire district or community is easy and natural . With some provision always in hand and in reserve for immediate and future wants , they can postpone compliance with increased demands on the part of the laboring classes , and by the pressure of urgent need can starve them to their own terms . The laboring classes suffer not only by this competition of interest with their employers , in which the odds are so fearfully against them , but still more severely by their competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of subsistence and its opportunity of remunerative employment . Except in times of war or of rapid emigration , the supply of labor exceeds the demand , and this very excess tends to reduce the wages of labor to its lowest possible limits , and to bow the successful candidates for employment in entire subserviency to the will of their employer , inasmuch as in case of their nonsubserviency their places can be readily filled by the unemployed , and they may be left to idleness and beggary . Bastiat , who , in a very elaborate chapter of his " Harmonies Economiques , " attempts to show the beneficent tendency of competition of all kinds in the social system , makes the following noteworthy admission - * We use this word because it denotes precisely what we mean , - not merely the employed , but the capite censi , those who are to be registered by names and numbers only , tbose whose property and income are too slender to bear assessment for the public burdens . // 1861 . SLAVERY , ITS ORIGIN AND ITS REMEDY . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is essentially precarious . As they receive their wages from day to day , they live also from day to day . In the debate which , under a free system , precedes every stipulation , they can not wait , - they must find work for to-morrow on whatever conditions , under pain of death . If this is not strictly true of all , it is true of many among them , and this is sufficient to depress the entire class ; for it is those most hardly pushed , the most miserable , who capitulate first , and establish the general rate of wages . It thence results that wages tend to adjust themselves to the level of what is absolutely neccessary for subsistence , and , in this state of things , the intervention of the least increase of competition is a veritable calamity ; for the question with them is not that of well-being diminished , but of life rendered impossible . " - pp. 311 , 312 . Where this double competition is active , it is idle to call the laborer free . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he means to live , it must be under the control and by the prescribed terms of the dominant class . The employer may be more or less imperious in his demands ; but whatever they are , they must be submitted to . Instances are not wanting in our own republic , in which , as to matters nominally under the arbitrament of the individual will , that will has been overborne . Thus outward religious conformity to the rites of the employer 's church has sometimes been enforced , and we have ourselves known of frequent cases in which the exercise of independent suffrage has been denied to the laborer , and he has been compelled by a necessity which knew no law to vote as his employer dictated . And this is slavery . It may exist under widely various forms . Sometimes it is the bondage of a race to a race , as of the Gibeonites to the Jews , and of the ilelots to the Spartans . Sometimes , as in Media*val Europe , it is a serfdom attached to the occupancy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes , as in many ancient states , and in a portion of this country , it is the ownership of individuals by individuals . These are cases in which slavery has become an institution . But where it has neither form nor legal recognition , it none the less exists . Wherever there is selfishness on the part of the employers , and a low standard of self-respect on the part of the employed , there is slavery . Great Britain , with her // boast of freedom , has in her factories and mines many thousands of slaves , - men , women , and children , who are no more the proprietors of their own muscles and sinews , than of those of their antipodes , - nominally free indeed , but in fact utterly incapable of changing their place of service , or of dcserting it without starvation . This condition of things has been somewhat modified by the slaughter of the Crimean war , the Celtic emigration , and the Australian drain upon the surplus population ; but a few years of peace and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full . Even in New England we have our slaves . There prevails in some of our seaports a system under which large numbers of sailors are not their own masters for a moment from the time they first step on board a vessel 's deck till the death-angel sets them free . Pauper children are often legally bound to a servitude , not lifelong indeed , but crushingly severe and intensely cruel , through the very best years of life . In some branches of manufacture and of manual labor , the employed are so needy and depressed as to be wholly subject to the arbitrary and irresponsible control of their employers . There are , in and near our large cities , multitudes of needlewomen , whose enforced , exhausting , and underpaid toil is a lifelong slavery of the most oppressive description . In fine , just so far as the power which position and wealth confer is untempered by high moral principle , slavery exists in its disabilities and hardships , though it may be without legal protection and sustenance for infancy , infirmity , and old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contingent reliefs and benefits which are secured by recognized ownership . As regards the imported Africans and their descendants , their presence in our land is the memorial of an international wrong and crime , which has not one redeeming feature . But , now that they are here , and collected in the South in such large numbers , they must needs be slaves in some form ; for , with the signal virtues and the examples of eminent excellence in which we by no means regard our Southern brethren as inferior to ourselves , they still are not , in the aggregate , devoid of that selfishness which at the North makes so many slaves from among the nominally free . Moreover , the undoubted inferiority of the Africans - we waive for the present // the question whether that inferiority is inherent and irremovable , or whether it is the result of centuries of degradation - places them at a peculiar disadvantage iu the contest with the selfishness of the dominant race . They are slaves , not because they live south of Mason and Dixon 's line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws . Were a thousand of them transported into Massachusetts to-day , before the close of the year nine hundred of the thousand would be as truly slaves , that is , with as little control over their own destiny , as now . In their present home , the laws which relate to them define , rather than create , their condition . Those laws exist because of the fact of slavery ; not slavery because of those laws . Slavery is the result of avarice and selfishness on the one hand , of ignorance and abjectness on the other . The only remedy for slavery is to be found in sentiments of justice and humanity on the part of the employers , in intelligence and self-respect on the part of the employed , or - to sum up the whole in brief , and with reference to the one great humanizing and elevating agent - in the prevalence of Christian principle . So far as this exists , its modifying effects are benignantly felt , alike where slavery is an institution and where it is an extra-legal fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brotherly love . Its question is not , How much , and for how little compensation , can be exacted of a subject class or race ? but , What are their rights and the correlative duties of those on whom they are dependent ? Its voice is , " Masters , render unto your servants that which is just and equal , knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven . " It makes wealth , position , and opportunity a stewardship in the hands of the stronger for the protection and benefit of the weaker . In the individual it produces personal dissent from selfish custom and precedent , and renders one 's own conscience , not the habit of the community , the rule and measure of action . In a nation , its increased prevalence manifests itself in an enhanced scale of wages , in diminished exaction as to the hours and quantity of labor , and in provision for the culture , elevation , and progress of the depressed classes . In the employed , Christian principle lifts the mere operative , the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of // the employer . It endows him with a conscious dignity , which can not be the subject of servile treatment , which precludes and forbids its own degradation . It puts him in a position to command the respect and kind consideration of those for whom he toils , and constrains them to concede his due liberties and privileges . But can moral causes modify the economical laws by which the pressure of population upon the resources for its subsistence pushes the laboring classes into ruinous competition with one another ? We believe that this competition is under the control of moral causes alone . Imprudent marriages will be the rule and habit among the proletaries , wherever their standard of self-respect is low . They feel , in that case , no reluctance to expose a rapidly increasing progeny to penury , hardship , and vice . But with improved moral and religions culture , families would gradually cease to be formed where there was no hope of providing for their comfort . Provident habits would postpone the period of marriage , and limit the overgrowth of population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all civilized countries . The average age at which marriage is contracted , and the average size of families , differ very essentially in different strata of every community . We believe that God made men for domestic duties and relations , nor would we advocate principles that should harmfully multiply the ranks of the homeless . But because we regard the family as a divine and sacred institution , we can not but look to the growth of moral and religious culture for a condition of society in which the family shall have what is its essential correlative , a home worthy of the name , with its due privileges and comforts . Then , and not till then , will the emancipation of the laboring classes be complete . But while so much remains to be done for the virtually enslaved all over the civilized world , we can distinctly trace the beneficent agency of Christianity where slavery exists as an institution . What it has done for the southern section of our country may be seen in the contrast between what slavery is there and what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman empire before the age of Constantine . Under the Greek and the Roman systems , the slaves had no legal protection , or // redress for injury . Their lives might be taken with impunity , and they were seldom produced as witnesses in a court of justice without being put to the torture . Though they were from races often equal , sometimes superior , to their masters in culture and refinement , the law made no distinction between them and brutes . The specifications under this general statement , which we could easily cite from classic authors , are too numerous for insertion ; but , as the subject is one worthy of illustration , we beg leave to present a few of the recorded facts and opinions which bear upon it . On one occasion , the Spartans dreading , as Thucydides says , " the youth and the multitude " of the ilelots , the Ephori invited those of their number who thought that they had earned their liberty by military services to proffer their claim in public . Of those who appeared , two thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then disappeared , " and no one knew in what manner each was destroyed . " * Not only were the Helots thus cut down to the standard of safety by the constituted authorities of the state , but the young Spartans were at liberty to bathe their virgin swords in Helot blood , and thus to inure themselves to slaughter before they met their equals in arms . Aristotle says that the Ephori , as soon as they assumed their official duties , made a formal declaration of war against the ilelots , that they might be massacred without the violation of any implied social right or covenant . The condition of things was similar in Rome . Cicero relates that Lucius IDomitius , when pra*tor in Sicily , being presented with a boar of extraordinary size , and learning that a slave had killed the beast with a hunting-spear , ordered the man at once to the cross , on the ground of a provincial statute , never meant to cover cases of this kind , which forbade slaves to carry weap. * ons of war ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly a humane man , - while he admits that this may seem . cruel ( durun* hoc fortasse videatur ) , yet is on the whole inclined to regard it as a wholesome precedent.f Seneca relates that Vedius Pollio , the intimate friend and one of the heirs of Augustus C*esar , was wont to throw his slaves , whenever they * Thucydides , IV . 50. t Cicero in Verrem , II . v. 3 . VOL . XCII. - NO. 191. 43 // offended him , into his fish-pond to feed the lampreys. * During the reign of Nero , a noble Roman having been slain by one of his slaves , although the culprit was detected , his entire family of slaves , to the number of four hundred , without distinction of sex or age , were put to death , and their execution was advocated in the Senate as in accordance equally with natural justice and with the law of the empire . Indeed , Tacitus , in describing the transaction , expressly says , that , " according to ancient usage , all the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given over to punishment . " f We quote from Taylor 's " Elements of the Civil Law " the following comprehensive statement of the legal status of the Roman slaves under the later Commonwealth and the earlier Emperors - " They were held pro 3Tullis , pro Alortuis , pro Quadr*pedibus , nay , were in a much worse state than any cattle whatsoever . They had no head in the state , no name , tribe , or register ; they were not capable of being injured ; nor could they take by purchase or descent ; had no heirs , and therefore could make no will of course . Exclusive of what was called their Peculium , whatever they acquired was their master 's . They could not plead , nor be pleaded , but were excluded from all civil concerns whatsoever ; could not claim the indulgence of absence Reipublice causa ; were not entitled to the rights and considerations of matrimony , and therefore had no relief in the case of adultery . Nor were they the proper objects of cognation or affinity , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pawned as goods or personal estate ; for goods they were , and such were they esteemed . Might be tortured for evidence ; punished at the discretion of their lord ; or even put to death by his authority ; together with many other civil incapacities , which I have not room to enumerate . " - p. 429 ( 3d ed . ) . It will be perceived that in many respects the Roman law is identical with the laws of our Southern States ; but it will be seen also how far it exceeds them in defining the non-personality , the merely chattel condition , of the slave . In contrast with the above , the laws of our Southern States , which express the moral sense of the community at large , pro * Dc Clementia , i. 18 . Seneca in this connection announces as the received axiom , " Qnum in servum omnia liccant . " I Annal . XIV . 42. // 1861 . SLAVERY , ITS ORIGIN AND ITS REMEDY . tect the life of the slave , shield him against wanton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws , indeed , contain many provisions which are abhorrent to our own sentiment of right , and , where they would otherwise be serviceable to the cause of humanity and justice , they are often frustrated in their execution by the inadmissibility of a slave 's testimony ; but the very fact that slaves are legally recognized as the objects of punishable felony , is a noteworthy distinction between extra-Christian and Christian civilization . There can be no doubt that there are certain classes of Southern slaves that are liable to grossly inhuman treatment . Overseers under non-resident proprietors notoriously abuse their power . Masters from the Free States are proverbially severe . The poor owners of single slaves often keep them overworked and underfed . But cruelty and harshness are , we sincerely believe , the exception , not the rule ; and wherever the spirit of true religion has touched the soul of the master , it makes the slave the object of kind regard , considerate treatment , healthful moral influence , and Christian discipleship , thus giving him his share in the blessings of freedom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many are the estates and households in which the Christian master and mistress are not the tyrants , but the guardians , of those who are called their property , " ministering " with more assiduous fidelity than that with which they are " ministered unto , " so that the transfer of their domestics into the so-called area of freedom would only make them less free , that is , would give them a more restricted command of the means of subsistence , happiness , and improvement . We here speak of what we have seen ; and while we have not one word of approbation or even tolerance for slavery as a system , we know masters whose service is a privilege , and to whom ( were it not for ulterior consequences from the change of ownership ) we would with entire confidence remand a fugitive for his own benefit . While the ultimate emancipation of the enslaved is the only end which Christian philanthropy can hold in view , formal emancipation , so far from being the initial step , will probably be the last . Slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle . Its heart must be eaten out before its body dies . Right after right must be conceded to the // mutual sense of justice . The division of families by sale must cease . The restrictions upon education must be abrogated . The movable chattel must become the laborer attached to his native soil . Freedom must be gradually conferred with the growing capacity for its duties and its responsibilities . The chain must be filed away little by little , and brightened with every stroke of the file . The name will outlast its meaning , and will pass into disuse only when the now dominant and the now subject race shall have been so nurtured , that they can live side by side in mutual harmony and good offices . This is not a chimerical process . It has been actualized on a far more extended theatre than is now open for it . Christianity has once swept the civilized world clear of domestic slavery . It is claimed on the one hand , that the New Testament favors slavery , because it makes no violent onslaught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our reformers are prone to speak slightingly of the Apostles and their Divine Master , because they took no direct cognizance of the system that was a plague-spot on the whole Roman empire . Both parties are equally in the wrong . The Gospel is a dispensation of freedom . Christ laid the axe at the root of the tree . " Where the spirit of the Lord is , there is liberty . " The principles of Christianity , as its Founder and its first preachers well knew , could not but perform a benign mission to the captive and the bondman . But how ? First , as in the case of Onesimus , while leaving the external relation unchanged , by making him who had been mere property " a brother beloved . " Thus was it in numerous individual households , while the new religion remained powerless in the state . As it gained converts in the imperial court , its influence began to be felt in a series of rescripts restraining the more odious forms of wanton cruelty . From the first Christian Emperor came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the master who , under the color of correction , occasioned the death of a slave by torture or barbarous treatment , was made amenable to the laws as an assassin ( sicari*s ) . From that time privilege after privilege was granted to those in bondage , and restriction upon restriction was laid on their masters , till in the twelfth or thirteenth century , when ecclesiastical legislation was at its // height , emancipation was complete , and for several centuries , though villanage and vassalage continued , domestic slavery , properly so called , had no existence in any part of Christendom . The practical question will arise in the minds of many of our readers , - " What shall we do ? We abhor slavery ; we feel our responsibility as citizens of our republic for this foul blot on our national character ; we can not acquit our own consciences , unless we are active in our endeavors for its removal . How can we perform our part in this philanthropic labor ? " We reply that , if by agitation that should shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rend the Union into infinitesimal fragments , we could make the enslaved freemen worthy of the name , the end would be cheaply purchased by the dire confusion and calamity by which it was effected . But it is manifest at a glance that denunciation , fierce strife , bitter words , inflammatory missives , have accomplished nothing or worse than nothing . In no one respect is the condition of the African slaves the better , or the prospect of their emancipation the nearer , for all that has been said and done at the North . But had the energy and zeal that have been thus fruitless been expended on the forms of slavery that exist unrebuked within our own borders , they would have been felt beneficently through the whole land . The strongest possible anti-slavery influence would go forth from communities , in which the rights of labor were held sacred , the full dues of labor discharged , the laboring classes constantly brought , in privilege , intelligence , and virtue , ever nearer to the level of their employers . Our first duties are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depressed and unprivileged among our own citizens . The spectacle of such relations as ought to subsist and might subsist among all classes and conditions of men in our Free States would be an anti-slavery gospel , which would need no preacher , but would be known and read of all . Such an example could not but awaken into sympathy and kindred movement all that there is of Christian faith and fervor among our Southern brethren , and start them on the same career . It is because we have not chosen to enter on this , the only legitimate mode of warfare , but have fought 43 * // against national ordinances , which are but facts put into words , and by local laws which serve no purpose except to annoy , irritate , and alienate our Southern fellow-citizens , that these days of terror lower over our national destiny . Our Union , so far as it can be preserved , or if it can be restored , is of incalculable Value in its bearing on the future of slavery . So long or so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the healthful circulation through the whole body politic of whatever there is of high moral and Christian principle and feeling in any part ; but not so when we stand as mutually hostile and defiant States , - not so , when the demon of civil war is let loose . We need trouble ourselves little in regard to laws . They will never precede , but will steadily follow , the progress of the people . Enactments that express the preponderant sentiment of the nation will of necessity be engrossed on the statute-book . When they cease to express that sentiment , they will be repealed , or become a dead letter . Our concern is with the general sentiment , and , as we have said , our action upon it is the most sure and efficient , when we apply ourselves , hand , mind , heart , and soul , to correcting the evils , righting the wrongs , and performing the charities which lie close to our own doors . We have placed at the head of this article the titles of several recent publications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to press . Mr. Hitler 's treatise is the expansion of a chapter designed for a work entitled " God Manifest , " is in great part speculatively theological , and has too much the air of a special plea for Providence in the premises ; but , on the other hand , it is equally devout and humane in sentiment , hopeful in its tone and spirit , kindly in its appreciation of the difficulties that beset the slaveholders , and singularly unimpassioned and candid in the opinions expressed concering the various classes of men that pass under review as connected with or QppOsed to slavery . The author is a zealous Colonizationist . He believes the African inferior to the Caucasian race in intellectual grasp and power , but superior in moral susceptibilities , He thinks that the design of Infinite Wisdom in permitting the slave-trade was to provide agencies for the ultimate Christianization of Africa , and that the negro // population of these United States will be liberated by gradual processes of emancipation , and sent home to regenerate the birth-land of their race . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the clear-sighted faith which can discern so certain and happy a solution of so fearful a problem ; and we have felt like one resting under " the shadow of a great rock in a weary land , " as we have turned from the rumors and forebodings of our daily papers to these utterances of a loyal Christian heart . Yet we confess that , like the African race of which it treats , the book has more heart than intellect , and it will rather edify those who are withdrawn from the heat and dust of the great strife , than instruct or inspirit those who bear an active part in public counsels or affairs . Widely different in its intellectual staple is the essay on " The Laws of Race . " As a specimen of condensed and vigorous thought , and of stringently close reasoning , it can hardly be surpassed . Its conclusions can be evaded only by doubting its premises . The author maintains the native and essential inferiority of the negro race as the basis of his argument . That inferiority we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our knowledge of the Africans , and their proportionately small cerebral development plainly indicates their relative incapacity . But other races have been known to degenerate physically under influences unfavorable to the free use and enlarged culture of the mental powers . The modern Greeks have , probably , smaller brains than the contemporaries of Pericles ; yet a few generations of freedom and progress may reproduce " a line Such as the Done mothers hone . " Under a condition of privilege , who shall say that the African brain may not acquire a fuller frontal development , and the African mind take its place with the now more favored nations in art , taste , and literature ? Or , if this be denied , yet may not Mr. Huller be right in his view of the negro 's superior susceptibility of moral and religious sentiment and principle ? If this be so , the question between the races is one of equivalents ; and it is easy to conceive that in all the elements of civilization and power , certainly in all that constitutes a capacity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowments can not remain permanently behind that which has the better intellectual gifts . Our author does not enter into these considerations , but , assuming that the negro is in structure and ability inferior to the white man , he draws from this postulate the following conclusions - " The white race must of necessity , by reason of its superiority , govern the negro , wherever the two live together . " The two races can never amalgamate , and form a new species of man , but must remain forever distinct ; though mulattoes and other grades always exist , because constantly renewed . " Each race has a tendency to occupy exclusively that portion of the country suited to its nature . " - p. 11 . The writer believes that the southernmost section of our country - we are unwilling to discontinue the collective name - will ultimately be in the hands of the Africans , either by their successful rebellion , or by the wearing out of the soil to such a degree as to destroy the profits of agriculture by slavelabor . Meanwhile he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation of the Africans to the present owners of the soil . But he vindicates the slave 's personal rights , and the adoption of the principles which he lays down would mark an advanced stage in the progress toward freedom . We quote the following paragraphs , to which , especially in the legal opinion which they express , the author 's name , would lie print it , would add no little weight . " Slavery is servitude established by law ; servitude during life , for one who can not aspire to a higher lot ; servitude of a race , fitted by nature for that lot . It provides for the negro the guidance and support through life that he needs , and expresses the relation which his nature bears to that of the white man . Slavery , moreover , performs the duty of magistrates , police , prisons , poor-houses , and hospitals , for the negro race in the South , without expense to government , and far more efficiently than any government could perform them . Slavery is not in itself a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , and bears fruit according to its nature . But we have the negro , and therefore we must have slavery . Our system of slavery , doubtless , is far from perfect . Its chief defects arise from the predominance given to the mercenary element of the relation over the benevolent , in the laws of the Southern // States . These laws declare , that a slave is a mere chattel , and the Supreme Court of the United States has declared so too . " But the laws of nature say , servitude is the natural relation between the negro and the white race ; that a slave is a man , and not a thing , and therefore entitled to justice and humanity ; that he has rights which impose duties on the master , and that the dominant race , having power over the negro , is responsible for his well-being . The laws of the South , and the decision in the case of Dred Scott , contradict these truths ; but they are affirmed by the general sentiment and practice of the Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slave as a person held to service or labor , ' using this language emphatically , as is well known , for the express purpose of denying that slaves are property , - a doctrine worthy only of slave-traders and African tribes , from whom it was derived . " - pp. 48 , 49 . The Premium Questions , to the number of 282 , are in retaliation for one question proposed to the Observer by the Evangelist , and eight by the Independent , the latter offering , in case of an answer by yes or no to each , to pay two hundred dollars into the treasury of the Board of Foreign Missions . The Observer , or rather its late editor , promises a gift of two hundred dollars to the Southern Aid Society , in case of an answer to each of his questions by either of the antagonist journals . The questions are worded with very great skill . They are such as admit of only one answer , and that always a seemingly pro-slavery answer . They are framed by collecting all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts in its history that can present Southern States and statesmen in a favorable light , and throwing them into an interrogative shape ; while the reverse side is left entirely unrepresented . The effect of the whole is an ingenious but an utterly fallacious plea , if not for slavery in the abstract , for the complacent tolerance of American slavery as it is . The next pamphlet on our list was written before the secession of South Carolina . It divides the Southern States into the slave-producing , the slave-using , and the slave-consuming States , and represents it as probable that the last class will secede , while it will be for the acknowledged interest of the first two classes to adhere to the Union . It admits the right of secession , and maintains the coercive policy to be equally inexpedient and wrong . It denies alike the honesty and the efficacy // of concession by the Free States to the demands of the South for the sake of the Union , and argues strongly against the repeal of the Personal-Liberty Bills . Its closing paragraph represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written - " The course of the Free States is plain ; their path is as a shining light ; their duties , and those of their chosen President , are manifest , - fairness , coolness , kindness , no concession of principle , but determination in doing their duty to the Union and the country . This course will unite all parties in their support ; and we shall soon see an overwhelming North restoring the peace of the land , and enabling even the Slave States , if they will , to retrace their steps , and share once more in our great prosperity . " - pp. 47 , 48 . The Letter which stands next on our list is by Hon. Benjamin F. Thomas , late one of the Justices of our Supreme Court , whose well-known sagacity , learning , and wisdom as a jurist would claim profound respect for his opinions , even without the compact and stringent reasoning by which he defends them . He identifies secession with rebellion , and regards the South Carolina declaration of independence as a declaration of civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States government to execute its revenue laws , and to keep jurisdiction over the places ceded to it in the seceding States , - peaceably if it can , forcibly if it must . " Upon the simple issue , whether the laws of the Union are to be maintained , and its flag upheld , nine tenths of the freemen of this country are with us . The opinion of the civilized world is with us . Moreover , God governs in the affairs of men , and will be with us as he was with our fathers . " With reference to the FugitiveSlave Law of 1850 , Judge Thomas expresses with great clearness and force what we conceive to be the almost universal opinion of those unbiassed by interest or party feeling . " You have known , my dear sir , that I fully sympathize with the people of Massachusetts in their just and righteous aversion to the Fugitive-Slave Law of 1850 . It was industriously meant to be offensive . I have never seen the man in this Commonwealth , who , whatever his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessarily harsh and rigorous . It fails of effect from its great severity . Nay , I should go further , and should not hesitate to say , were I not concluded // by judicial authority , that the law , in many of its essential features , is in conflict with the Constitution of the United States . Never has a constitutional provision been so tortured by judicial construction as that clause in relation to fugitives from service . But the law has been held valid by those who had the rightful power to pass upon its validity ; and , as a good citizen , I must bow to its authority . My oath does not restrict me to the support of the Constitution as I understand it . ' " With these feelings and convictions in relation to the Fugitive-Slave Law of 1850 , I have , nevertheless , always been of the opinion , that every attempt to soften the rigor of the law , to supply its defects , to relieve its injustice , or to obstruct its operation , by State legislation , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pricks . The wise and prudent thing would have been , to have waited until we had power to soften the rigors of the law on the spot of its origin , in the place of its birth . In that effort we should have had the aid of wise and good men in all parts of the country . " - pp. 5 , 6 . As may be inferred from the above extract , Judge Thomas favors the immediate repeal of what remains of the Massachusetts Personal-Liberty Bill of 1855 - " The best thing that can be done with the remains of the statute of 1855 is to lay them upon the altar of the country . It does not require a great sacrifice ; and it is our country . " Incapable of substantial legal good , they do much political and moral evil . " They are not , in their spirit , loyal to the Union . They te*id to bring into conflict our relations to the State and the United States , to which we are alike bound , and must be alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , who feel that they must obey the laws of the United States , and that the State can not fairly subject them to any disability , or distrust even , for such fidelity . " They disturb the friendly relations which would otherwise exist between us and the friends of the Union in the Southern States . " They strengthen the hands , they encourage the hearts , of the enemies of the Union . They are made the occasion , if not the cause , the pretence , if not the reason , for the attempts to sever that Union . They furnish a pretext , a seeming apology , for treason . " The ground of objection to these statutes is their apparent design to obstruct a law of the United States , - an iron law it may be , but a law . Their real and humane purpose was to give to the rights of the feeble and humble the protection which the law of the United States // failed to give . They can legally effect neither the apparent design nor their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is intrinsic , and results from the fact , that a law of the United States , held to be valid by the judiciary of the United States , is the supreme law of the courts of Massachusetts ; and no State law can either get over it or around it . " The only place to seek the modification of the Fugitive-Slave Law is on the floor of Congress ; and we need not despair of such a result . The just and reasonable modifications to be effected are , that the alleged fugitive shall , from the time of his arrest , be in the custody of the courts of the United States , both in the State where he is seized and that to which he is returned ; that , before he shall be delivered into the custody of the claimant , he shall have the right to trial by jury , freely and without purchase , under rules of evidence to be prescribed by Congress ; the most essential of which would be the presumption of freedom , and the right to meet the witnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 14 . Professor Fisher 's Sermon is devoted , as it should have been , chiefly to the religious aspects of the present crisis . It is guarded in its statements , sound and wise in its counsels . We are struck with the judicious discrimination manifested in his statement of the defects and faults of the more recent school of Abolitionists , and are glad to find that , at the same time , he has done them the justice to exonerate them from the charge of effecting a revolution in the anti-slavery feeling of the South . The simple history of that revolution is , we believe , to be read in the history of the cotton-culture . While cotton was an insignificant item in the production and commerce of the nation , slave labor was attended with little profit , and the States that raised slaves for a more southern market had but a slow and scantily remunerative sale for their human merchandise . Most naturally the public mind in the slaveholding States was then open to the moral considerations bearing on their peculiar description of property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legislation , were heard anti-slavery utterances as vehement and uncompromising as are ever uttered now in the Music Hall . But when , on the invention of the cotton-gin , cotton grew to be the great staple of the South , slavery rapidly became a source of immense profit alike to the slave-raising and the slave-consuming States , and // interest , which with sad frequency modifies principle at the North , produced a seemingly sudden revulsion in the antislavery sentiment at the South . This revulsion was synchronous with the development of the Abolition party in the Free States , but too closely syncbronous for the latter to have been the cause of the former . That the exasperation of feeling which has led to recent political movements on the part of the Southern States is to be largely attributed to Northern Abolitionism , we have no doubt ; but the settled opinions which underlie and energize those movements are of indigenous origin and growth . We quote the portion of Professor Fisher 's Sermon which covers this ground . " In reference to the recent school of Abolitionists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the lead of Mr. Garrison , it is too early , perhaps , to decide what upon the whole has been the effect of their proceedings . That they have been guilty of grave faults , both in the measures they have adopted and in the spirit which has characterized their movement , it is impossible to deny . In the first place , they have not risen to a comprehension of the great problem presented by the co-existence of two diverse races on the same soil , of the relative numbers and character in which they are found at the South . They have insisted , or seemed to insist , upon an instant and indiscriminate emancipation of the servile class from all restraint , if not upon their elevation to participation in political power . They have supported their cause by metaphysical propositions upon the sinfulness of slaveholding , the terms of which are so indefinite as to render a difference of opinion unavoidable , and to involve a great practical question in needless subtilties . They have forgotten the fable of the eagle and the lamb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the upper sky . But suddenly he sees the injustice and the cruelty of his procedure . Shall he , therefore , drop the lamb from his clutches ? That would be to commit a still greater wrong . In short , the reform* ers to whom I refer have been unpractical in the bad sense of the word . So far as I know , no scheme of emancipation , such as might be safely and beneficially adopted , and no plan of legislation looking towards that end , which is entitled to consideration , have emanated from them . In the second place , they have made almost no appeal to the masters ; made no effort to engage their co-operation ; but have spent their energies in the endeavor to arouse a feeling of indignation and hatred against them at the North . They have exhausted upon them the vo // cabulary of abuse . The effect must be , so far as any effect is produced , that they whom it is most desirable to move and enlist in the good work , disgusted and embittered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them upon the subject . It is not against the slave masters alone that the reformers to whom I refer have directed the artillery of their wrath . Upon all who , though cordially sympathizing with the end they have in view , have not fallen in with their method in every particular and approved of their spirit , they have poured forth a filthy stream of vituperation , charging upon them the basest motives . They have the merit , if merit it be , to have attained to a surpassing proficiency in defamatory rhetoric . " It is not , however , the imprudence of this handful of people which has produced the great change in the public opinion of the South upon the character of slavery ; for a total change of feeling has taken place there , within the memory of the generation now living . Formerly , the institution was commonly declared to be an evil , by their preachers , by the judges on the bench , in private conversation , and through every mode of utterance by which the general opinion can be ascertained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public feeling ! Slavery is defended as normal , scriptural , beneficent , as parallel in sacredness with the family institution , as the palladium of liberty to the white race , as a practice to be cherished and perpetuated . The pulpit , the press , the bench , all the organs and guides of public feeling , with united voice , are engaged in praising the system of human , slavery . Physiology is appealed to , the Bible is ransacked , antiquity is pleaded , in defence of a system which the Christian world , with almost entire unanimity , had come to regard as a wrong and a curse . This remarkable revolution of opinion has taken place in coincidence with the greatly increased profitableness of slave labor . Not that men are consciously swayed by this consideration . But when , for a variety of causes , a community concludes that a thing can not be dispensed with , they are under a powerful latent bias to seek for a theory to justify it . Thus it is that the old doctrine of human rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspired the heroes of American history and the founders of our government , has been abandoned ; and a confused , flimsy theory , founded on ethnological distinctions , set up in its place . And the concurrent judgment of the Christian Church is attempted to be set aside , which had condemned the enslaving of man , and had brought to pass emancipation wherever Christianity had full sway . " - pp. 16-18. // deed , humane in its phraseology ; and were all slave-holders Christians worthy of the name , and disposed to receive in full his construction of their duties , slavery would not be the evil that it is to both parties . But in justifying slavery under his definition , and with restrictions which would make it comparatively harmless , the author is virtually apologizThg for slavery as it is , with all its enormities and abuses . Moreover , in defending American slavery as " justified by the law of nature , " he tacitly defends the slave-trade ; for no " law of nature " brought the Africans to our shores . Had we received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given it an extended criticism ; but there is little need of it , for it is too late in the day to justify slavery to any minds but those whose interest has already furnished them with satisfying arguments .
