APRIL 3 , 1865. - Thank God ! February TO , 1867. - As I sit and look at those two words , there comes back to me the vivid recollection of how and when I wrote them . I remember tbe surge of feeling which swelled my heart almost to pain as I heard the great news that day brought ; as I realized that the long doubt and agony and struggle were over ; that the awful human sacrifice was ended ; that the physical coi*sciousnessof blood-which , like Lady Macbeth , I had bad incessantly upon me , its horrible smell in my nostrils and stain upon my hands-might now pass away . If I had been a praying man , I should have gone down upon my knees ; being what I am , I came home and sat quietly down in this room until the inner tide should ebb to a controllable level . Partly from habit and partly from a desire to steady myself , I took out my note-book to glance at my engagements for the next day . The front of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am apt to scribble down scraps of poetry , quotations , anything and everything that comes into my head , until I often think that , taken altogether , it is a truer representation of my real self than my photograph would be . Turninb presently to this blank space , I wrote that date , as the most momentous I should ever chronicle . And then , from the depths of my heart and soul , there sprang those two words , as the faint , irrepressible echo of the unutterable . I do n't know why I have turned to that entry to-night-yes I do ; why should I shrink from acknowledging the truth to this blank page and myself . It is because I have almost the same feeling at my heart , the same impulse to write those words again . And all because I have seen a woman of whose existence in the flesh I was unconscious but a few hours ago . Yet now that I sit here I do not dare to carry out my purpose . It seems like tempting Providence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or mar my whole life . If I were a really heroic soul , I suppose the simple fact that such a woman lives in the world would make me sing hymns of rejoicing ; but I am only a man , with great , hungry needs and wants in my nature , and I must wait to give thanks for my fate until I know that they are to be satisfied . It was by the merest chance that I met ber . After the day 's work is over , I up to the club to dine ; and then , if I have an engagement in the evenino I go like to drop into John Conway 's cosy home , and smoke anet chat until it is time for me to go . John and I have been friends all our lives . In the race of life I have always outrun him , at school , at college , and now in the courtroom ; and yet he is the only man whom I sincerely envy . As I see all shadow of the cares of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he turns it homeward , as I watch that light spring up in the depths of his wife 's eyes at the mere sound of his coming , I recognize , with a curious pang , which of us has been really wise and successful ; I comprehend that the man who is all the world to the woman he loves can well afford to let the rest of creation wag as it will . // JUNE , I strolled around to John 's as usual about twilight ; and , finding the front door unclosed , entered and walked to the parlor , expecting to find Mrs. Conway there . As I stood noiselessly upon the threshold , I saw straight before me , seated by the window , the figure of a woman , the outline of whose head and face seemed cut like a cameo upon the outer light . At her feet , half kneeling , half sitting , was the smaller figure of John 's wife . I was hesitating whether to speak or to go away while I was still unobserved , when ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention that I ceased to think of myself at all . The figure at the windoxv was speaking ; I could see the lips move , though for a second I failed to catch the words . A moment later I found they were perfectly known to me . How came she to gravitate to the truest poem in Christina Rossetti 's book , to the only verses among them all which have unconsciously clung to my memory word for word . I like people with memories ; especially women with that form of the faculty which is more truly such a natural congeniality with beauty and harmony , that music and poetry seem to adhere to them without their volition . This was evidently the case with her ; for the lines seemed to fall almost involuntarily from her lips , with as little effort as another woman would have sung some low , sad tune . I thought I knew that poem of " Uphill perfectly ; and yet , as I listened , I could scarcely believe I had ever read it . As I write it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same feeling of absolute revelation is upon me . Does the road wind uphill all the way ? Yes , lo Ihe very end . Will tlse day 's journey take the whole long day ? From morn liii nzg-JzI , myfriend . But is there for the night a resting place ? A roe/for whe Ike dark , slow hours begke . May not the darkness hide it from my face ? You cannel naPes Ihal inn . Shall I meet other wayfarers at night ? Those who have gone before . Then usust I knock or call when just in sight ? They will noIhee*you si adeng al Ihul door , Shall I find comfort , travel-sore and weak ? Of inkoryon shailfind Ike sum . Will there he heds for me and all who seek ? Yea , kedefor all who come . I had heard famous actors and singers made great simply by what is termed the " sympathetic " voice-that which made Rubini the " king of tenors , " which gives Gazzaniga ability to sing through your very heart  --  but I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its low , murmurous sound , the way in which her voice passed from the wistful , pleading accents of a weary , half hoping , half despairing soul , to the infinite calmness and quietude of Fate itself speaking , thrilled me like a miracle wrought there in my presence . In the shadowy room and semi-solitude that woman was half unconsciously laying bare her soul ; and I , standing there unseen and unknown , read and recognized it . I comprehended her nature more thoroughly , I seemed to really know her better than any other human being I had ever seen , even through long years of companionship . A woman with a Past , who stands upon the edge of the Present , and looks straight on to th' end ; whose eyes , in gazing forward , see nothing further in life for her but its conclusion . It may be that some great sorrow or disappointment has // UPON THE 01 ! LIGH AT HER F NT , HALF ENEELHSO , HALF S TTINO , VAS THE SMALLER FIGURE OF JOHN 'S WIFE.PAGE 734. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause , hut my knowledge of the result is a certainty . It was scarcely more than two or three moments of time before she finished the verses and the word-music died away into silence ; but as I stepped hack into the hail , another man with another soul seemed walking away from the one who had entered such a little while before . I had just reached the front door when John opened it . " Ah , Randolph , is it you , " he exclaimed , in his pleasant , cheery fashion , taking it for granted that I had just come in . " I am very glad you came , I wanted to see you particularly . Come into the parlor . " And he led the way . His wife sprang up to welcome us , then there was a momentary pause as John lighted the shaded burner upon the table , and then Mrs. Conway said , " Miss Glenn , Mr. Dulaney . " The figure at the window had turned and was looking quietly at me . I bowed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full effect . I confess it startled me . It was a brilliant society lady who calmly returned my salute . There was not a wave of her hair , not a fold of her dress that was not thoroughly 2 l**z mode , that did not tell of a life and habits of fashion . At the first glance , anything more unlike what had I expected to see , it would be impossible to imagine . But , as I looked eagerly in her face , I recognized her again beneath this mere surface ; and took shame to myself that I should have doubted even for a second . She was even more stylish than handsome ; more beautiful than either , for those who had eyes to see it ; with a clear gravity in the depths of the *uminous brown eyes , which was like the tone of her voice in another form . She kept her place at the window , as she was still within our little circle , and only spoke when John or his wife casually addressed her . But , whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock , for the voice had changed to simply the refined sweetness of any cultivated lady ! There was little chance , though , for any one but John and myself to talk ; for he plunged headlong into the discussion of some minor points of politics about which we differed , and upon which he was the more anxious to convert me , as he imagined I might have some influence upon their approaching decision . I was too honestly interested in the subject not to have talked earnestly upon it , had we been alone . As it was , I never in my life , before bench or bar , chose my words so carefully , tried to make my sen*ences and meaning so clear and telling , as I did for the hearing of one of those listeners . She gave small outward sign of its having any effect upon her ; she scarcely looked up more than once . I suspect she disagreed both with my premises and my conclusions ; and yet , when I stopped , it was with a sure sense that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subject and been perfectly understood . Then I found my time was up ; and went away , taking with me only those two slight bows , at meeting and parting , as all she had voluntarily given me . I suppose I went through the business of the evening in an ordinarily rational way , for no one stared at me or seemed to notice any change in my manner . But I recollected very little about it until I sat down here and opened my notebook , which is the only thing in the world to which I really talk freely . For the last year or two I have had a growing consciousness of my want of motive and aim in life , but I have never felt it so keenly as to-night . I try to do what I can for those around me , for humanity in general ; but , as for myself , my days go by with no controlling influence to bind them together , with no connecting link beyond the customary routine of business . In each I try to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher result than the winning of my own bread // and butter . The other night I met a day-laborer coming home , with his kettle in his hand , and I fell a-thinking wherein my life was really superior to his . We both toil for our dinners ; mine is a better one than his , but that seems the only difference . Perhaps , even , he is utterly beyond me , in having something to love and live for . As I think of it , I am ready to hold up my right hand and swear that such mere existence shall not long run on . Ah , this dull , wearing harness of business would seem strangely different to me , if ; by its means , I could feed my heart and soul as well as my body ; my day-laborer life , which is now so paltry and irksome , would have a wondrous charm if my real payment met me as I crossed my threshold at eventide , as I see John Conway 's come to him . February I3th. -I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning , when , glancing down the street , I was conscious of a great rush of blood through my frame , and an intense , cowardly impulse to disappear instantly . The next moment I took my courage in both hands and turned to meet her . She was but a yard or two distant when I lifted my hat . For a second she looked at me rather wonderingly . Then I saw full recognition dawn in her face , and she bowed , with a slight slowness , which served to accentuate the perfect appr*hension of my individuality which the salutation contained . She passed on , and I went into my office and sat down to write business letters . But there was a faint , void feeling round my heart , as from strong physical reaction , which made everything an effort , and rendered Work with either brain or hand very difficult . The same sensation has clung to me all day-has sent me home at this early hour , feeling that I suited my usual associates as little as they suited me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in this room ; and yet it was certainly not a light motive which led me to it . I have deliberately gazed in the glass for full five minutes , and , perhaps for the first time for years , really looked at myself . I saw a man to whom , if it were any one else , I should apply the general term , medium , both in size and in coloring , with neither sufficient beauty nor ugliness to strike at first sight , with nothing peculiar about him except a certain squareness about the forehead and chin , and something which , for lack of a better term , I am forced to call womanliness , in the eyes . I have no recollection of my mother , and yet there are times when I know I am like her , both spiritually and physically ; as again I can trace in myself such a strong resemblance to my stern-faced , well-remembered father . My hard , busy life has left little chance for the softer element to develop . But it has kept itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every form of poetry , whichthough I usually mentally diet on Shakespeare and Robert Browning-makes me keep the run of the latest rhymester as closely as some girlish frequenter of a circulating library ; by the femininely delicate appointments with which I have kept myself surrounded in this room  --  the only place I can call home . To-night it seems to have taken possession of my entire being , and to melt and sway all the strong , rebellious nature which has hitherto held it in subjection . Thinking of that picture in the glass , there are at least two things which I believe I can say for myself : I do not look like a fool , and I do look like a gentleman . At least I feel like a gentleman , and I know that woman would never have so saluted the soul or body of a clown , however skilfully disguised . February 2oth. - It is well that I have been in the habit of dropping into John 's so constantly ; otherwise , I am afraid the way in which I have haunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lead Mrs. Conway , at least , to suspect // the cause . It has been to little purpose though , for I have never happened to meet Miss Glenn , although I have had the aggravation of coming in a few moments after she had left . From casual remarks of Mrs. Conway 's , I have learned something of her history , and how it happens that I have never before met her . She and Mrs. Conway are cousins , brought up together like sisters ; though a year or two ago , just after John 's marriage , she left this city , and has but recently returred . " She is so witty and brilliant , and is always so much admired and courted , that when she goes away I can never divest myself of a fear that she will come back altered , " Mrs. Con*vay said ; " yet I ought to know that she never changes to those she loves . " " No , " I answered , slowly ; " Miss Glenn does not seem to me a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conway looked at me with a pleasant smile of surprise in her bright eyes . " I did not think any one could read her so correctly at sight , " she ? xclaimed . " I thought only those who loved Esther could comprehend her . " I made no reply , and the conversation changed its course ; but I sat wondering whether , if that were the qualification , there could exist in the wide world another being so fitted to know and understand her as I. So her name is Esther . A more unsuitable appellation I can not imagine . Why , it would have been far better to have called her Vashti ; for she must always have gained men 's devotion , not by kneeling to them until they extended the royal sceptre , but by making them glory in bowing before her . February 21st-John came into my office this morning , on his way down town , and asked me to dine with him . A rather famous Englishman was in the city , with letters of introduction to him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertain him , " he continued , " though , to be sure , Esther Glenn is quite equal to that . " I said I would certainly be there , though my assent arose from a rather different motive from the mingled friendship and curiosity for which John gave me credit . Unavoidably , I came in rather late , and found that the half score of guests which were to compose the company had arrived . In the centre sat Miss Glenn , radiant with animation , and seeming about as far from me as one of the fixed stars . She had evidently donned her society garments , both of mind and body , and I was fain to confess from my sore heart that both became her marveilously . She was amusing the whole company , though addressing her conversation chiefly to the English gentleman . The man was fifty , and had been married for probably half his life ; but as I watched the gay , easy courtesy with which she drew him out , the grace and piquancy with which she roused and warmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the table , we were so placed that he sat on one side of her , and I on the other . I am not an easy subject for social manipulation ; yet she absorbed me into the conversation , and kept us both talking our very best , with a skill which amazed me . I had never before realized what manner of woman art and nature can produce when they join hands for a united triumph . We were wonderfully merry and witty , the number of good things said was quite startling ; but I have sufficient benevolence left to hope that no other member of that party went through that dinner with such a sickening , unsatisfied aching at his heart as I did . My sense of distance from her seemed to deepen and increase with every flash and scintillation of her brilliancy . Looking at her nature from this light , to attempt to gain any hold upon it must be like striving to sustain your weight by grasping ice , from which you must not only slip helplessly and hopelessly away , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her brightness was like the glittering // JUNE , sunshine upon a winter 's day-it seemed only to intensify the cold . I held out to the end . I kept mental step with her until the ladies left us . Then I pleaded a headache to John , making him excuse me , and went away with a chill , weary , torturing sense of depression , which would have made actual pain a relief . March 1st-It is more than a week since I have turned to the latter part of this book , since I have made any entry apart from business . Not because I had so little to say , but because I had so much . My days have h*id a charm upon them that I could not reduce to words . I have lived in a dreamy , glamourous happiness from which I had little wish to rouse myself sufficiently to try to write it down . Now , that I fear the ebb-tide has slightly set in ; now , that I have not seen her for a day or two , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The evening after that dinner party , I went up to John 's , ostensibly to inquire how he and his wife were after their little dissipation ; but really because I was so hungry to hear something of her that I could not keep away . It was a cold , blustering evening , for March was literally coming in like a lion . As I came into the parlor , I noticed a vast easy-chair drawn up to the glowing grate , and a moment after there came from its depths a sweet , halfsleepy voice that said , rather slowly , " If you will shut the door very closely , Mr. Dulaney , and show sufficient perception of comfort in your selection of an arm-chair , I will be so very good as to give you half the warmth and light of my beautiful fire . " Miss Glenn herself ! And in such a mood as I had almost despaired that I should ever be permitted to see her . Had my outer man correctly represented my inner one at that moment , I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am afraid the resemblance was rather evident as I went round the room inspecting the chairs until I found one which suited me ; she indicating her approval of my choice merely by an odd little movement of her eyelids . I wheeled up the seat to the grate , and sat down ; and , as Miss Glenn 's gifts and attentions seemed to have exhausted themselves in bestowing upon me my share of the fire , I occupied myself in looking at her . The transformations of this woman are absolutely magical . Her body seems to be a mere covering for her soul , and to take its temporary form and hue with a chameleon-like power . To think of her as I had seen her the night before , required a force of imagination of which I was actually incapable . Perhaps her dress had something to do with her changed effect . That pale sea-green silk , with silvery , shimmering reflections , which she had worn upon the previous night , gave subtle suggestions of a mermaid ; while this night she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clung to her close and warm . If a few lazy sentences , dropped at irregular intervals , a careless questiop now and then asked and answered , can be called a conversation , we carried on one for the next half hour . I suppose if I were to write down what we said and not how we said it , it would appear ineffably stupid ; and yet it struck me then , and indeed , strikes me now , as not only the perfection of entertainment , but , under the circumstances , of good sense . To me , the feeling of having overstepped the outworks of fashion and society and reached the real woman I so coveted , the sense of being permitted to enter and rest within the doors of the inner sanctuary , filled me for that hour with blissful content . She was not performing upon the social stage for my benefit ; she was not getting up a dazzling exhibition as upon the night previous ; but she was paying me the infinitely higher compliment of being simply herself before me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its originality and delicacy would have charmed me ; coming from her // it fed something far deeper than my vanity . The first interruption came from the servant . " Miss Esther , the carriage is waiting for you at the door . " " Miss Esther , " raised her eyes , and that was about all . " Tell him he may go , I shall not want him , " she answered , after a moment 's pause , as though it were against her xviii that she roused even her voice sufficiently to speak . " I intended to go home in time to dress for the opera , " she presently explained , after apparently resting from the exertion of her previous sentence ; " but I find now that I would rather stay where I am . " The throb of triumphant delight which went over me at her words must have found it , s way into my eyes ; for I saw her give a quick , startled movement , and suddenly she flushed in a manner which , I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreated still further into the soft depths of her chair , and was absolutely silent . In a few moments though , Mrs. Conxvay came from upstairs , and John from the outer world ; and we had hot coffee around the fire , which waked us up and set us all talking . Miss Glenn 's rest seemed to have refreshed her to just a delicious degree of strength and spirits , for she began bantering John with the mischievous glee of a child , until , in answering his call for aid against the enemy , I happened to stumble over one of her pet theories . Then she xvarmed up into honest seriousness ; and , losing all self-consciousness as we stoutly fought over the whole ground , rose into almost bitter earnestness . So the hours went by until nearly midnight . Just as I was leaving , that delightful Mrs. Conway said . " Mr. Dulaney , Esther and I will be here alone to-morrow morning ( Esther ' looked up with a slight astonishment in her face at hearing her time thus disposed of but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lunch with us , and bring that novel you promised ? " " With all my heart , Mrs. Conway , " I answered , with the utmost sincerity , although a consciousness had flashed upon me that in this very note-book there was a memorandum of an important business engagement at that hour . I went through a swift mental calculation of how I could put the man oft which chiefly resulted in a determination to disappoint him downrightly if I could do no better , and then I again warmly accepted Mrs. Conway 's invitation . It was with considerable trepidation that I rang that bell next morning . I knew that a solitary man , thrown with a greater number of women ( even so small a predominance as two ) , finds his position intensely agreeable or intensely disagreeable . There is no medium possible . They either band against him voluntarily or involuntarily , until he is overwhelmed with a sense of being a wretched outsider , totally unequal to the circumstances , or they make a centre of him , round which they gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of his stronger sex . He either gets nothing , or he gets all . Which my lot was to be I was afraid to predict , even to myself . The servant asked me straight into the dining-room . Mrs. Conway was standing by the fire , while Miss Glenn sat at the table , gravely mixing something in a dish . The married lady said " Good morning , " hut the other did not even look up . " Mr. Dulaney , " she said , instead , speaking precisely as though the night before were the moment before , and she were finishing some remark which had then been interrupted , " Nelly and I have come to the conclusion that when a man , with something to really do in the world , wastes his time for the benefit of two idle women , he deserves to be rewarded ; so I have made you a positively celestial dressing for your oysters . " I gave her merry thanks in return , complimenting her upon her admirable sense of justice , and sat down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gods had vouchsafed me that day . Mrs. Conway took her place , and then began a repast which I can only term paradisiacal ; not that coffee and oysters were ever partaken of in the garden of Eden , but because that which really fed me must have been as well known to the first created man , to the earliest fully developed human being , as to me . " Miss Glenn , " I said , laughingly , when , at last , I was obliged to go , " I can only use your own word , and say that this entire meal has been celestial . ' " " So you enjoy being made much ofi , " she returned , with a gay mockery in her tone , which had no unpleasant element in it . " I could ask nothing better than that it might continue forever , " I rejoined , with perhaps more earnestness than she expected , with certainly more truth than she understood . " Yes , " she replied , " most persons enjoy petting . I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is of the kind which suits me , " she added , quickly , with a sudden weariness in her face , which was like disgust . She has evidently learned that in this , ns in most things , it is not quantity , but quality , which is difficult to obtain . Ab , I might lavish my all of love and devotion upon her , and , if it were not what her nature demands , I know it could be but as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal : it could profit me nothing . The second morning after this , as I walked down the street , there was such a brightness , almost softness , in the yet cold air , such an indefinable sense of the coming spring , that my blood stirred like the sap in the trees . Hour after hour , as I sat hard at work , the smell of pine trees and of moist earth and leaves kept coming and going to my senses , and carrying my wandering thoughts with it , back to the woods around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come bursting in but that dear old John . He caught up my hat , and then laid violent hands on me ; and , before I could quite understand what it all meant , I found myself , first in the street , and then seated in a phaeton with Mrs. Conway and Miss Glenn , while John was driving us toward the very woods I had been seeing and feeling as in a dream . I began to comprehend how some persons consider life a boon . I said something of the kind to Miss Glenn . She had been laughing the moment before ; but as she beard my words she turned and looked steadily at me , with a wistful , sorrowful envy in her eyes , which literally reproduced the first moment I had ever seen and heard her . " Why do you look at me so ? " I asked . " You remind me , " she replied , rather hesitatingly , " that there was a time when I , too , held that erroneous opinion . This is not the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment showed me so unmistakably , has reappeared upon the bright surface , called up unexpectedly and involuntarily . On Saturday night there was a lecture , or something of the kind , going on ; and our little party was in attendance ; except mysel* I absolutely could not get off in time . My work has rather gone to the wall lately ; but , good heavens ! I have toiled long enough and hard enough to deserve a little rest and play . There were letters and papers , though , which no one but I could write , and which must be finished with the week . However , I managed to catch the party as they were leaving the ball , and secured the chance of seeing Miss Glenn home . As we walked through the quiet streets we imperceptibly glided into an almost confidential talk . I said then how keenly I regretted not being able to be with them during the whole evening . " I sometimes think , " she answered , " that in small things , as in great ones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to have that which we really * ri for . I used to struggle hard against it , but I have ceased now to kick against the pricks. " // I am beginning to understand her . Having been given the keynote almost miraculously at the outset , I can trace the inner harmony of all her words and actions . This chronic hopelessness has not come , as I at first supposed , from any one event or cause . She has known no great sorrow ; her heart is strangely fresh , I had almost said dormant , for a woman of her life and years ; I do not believe the grand passion has ever touched her , and she is far too high and proud for mere flirtations I have no haunting shade of a lover , dead or living , to perpetually strive against . I think it is the gradual dying out of delusions , which has reduced her to this mere acceptancy of existence . She must have begun life full of beautiful dreams , and hopes , and enthusiasms-she has seen them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to believe in their worth or possible fulfilment . She is always secretly reverting to those days when she could believe and hope , brooding over their memory , counting them as lost treasures . As I knew from the first , a woman with a Past . She is vainly striving to exist upon it ; but her life contains no really satisfying element , and she is actually dying out from spiritual inanition . She is always looking backward . My God , shall I ever be able to make her look forward ! If He will grant me that prayer He may take away all other success , and I shall still hold myself His richly favored child . Sunday-It is two weeks since I have written down any of my inner life . But this Sunday morning finds me so much fuller of love to woman than to God , so much more intent upon the highest of earth than of Heaven , that I choose te write of her rather than to take my part with the church-goers . And yet I can scarcely call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her is to me like a holy service . I have seen her three times lately ; and , by some chance , we have always fallen into serious argument on the gravest subjects , upon which we both hold very fixed opinions . We almost always differ . And yet it is singular , that though we think apart , we invariably feel together . Our brains work in opposite Qirections ; but in questions of honor , of emotion or sentiment , in everything superior to mere intellect , our instincts are identical . I am conscious , thoubh , that the expression of my ideas and beliefs often shocks and repels her . It is far more painful to me than to her , and yet I can not act otherwise . I want to stand as clearly before her as I stand before my God . I think it would kill me to lose her , but I know it would kill me ever to look in her face and read there that I had won her upon false pretences . Perhaps I have grown a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fear I have run rather roughly against some romantic , time-honored idea which I think it quite natural she should hold , my words find a happier reception than I expect . The other night John quoted King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table in connection with something *t the present day . " I can not perceive the application , " I said ; " the only chivalry I have any faith in for this the year of our Lord 1867 , is to pay your debts , to face your social current at need , to vote up to your conscience , and to remember your poor neighbor . " I had spoken almost involuntarily , and the next second glanced nervously at her to catch the effect I feared my sentence would have . I fully expected to see her flame up with the entire " Idyls of the King " upon her lips . I thought she would rise into superb indignation at what would strike her as rudely stripping that word , so beloved of women , of its halo of beauty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me , with a singular glow , which was light , not color , in her face . " Yes , " she answered , // rather slowly , " chivalry always consists in doing whatever is most difficult . In those days , that was to overcome some outside antagonist ; now , it is to conquer yourself . " March i8th. -I have actually been to an evening party . It is full five years since I last did such a thing . It was at the house of one of my legal cronies ; but as his urgent invitations have previously had no effect upon me , I scarcely think I should have accepted this one had not Miss Glenn happened to say , " I have made Nelly and John promise to go with me , Mr. Dulaney , and you must come too . All the world will he there , and it is well to look at your fellowbeings occasionally . " I told her that was the very reason I never went to such places ; viewed under those conditions , people failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was chiefly conscious of a great want of natural connection with them . " That only proves , " she answered , laughingly , " that your recognition of the claims of a common humanity is not so strong in a parallel as in a downward direction . You are willing enough to make allowances for the human frailties of those utterly beneath you , ca n't you spare some of the same long-suffering for those upon your own level . It is very curious to me that the more cultivated and refined a man is himself the more he seems to regard poverty and ignorance as the essential qualities of a man and a brother . Your forbearance needs cultivation in a social straight line . " I am afraid I flushed a little ; first , because there was some truth in the remark , and second , because it was a sidehit at many of our former discussions . " I simply hold persons accountable in proportion to their opportunities , " I replied . " However , I shall be most happy to begin the recognition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidance . " I had another motive for my assent . I was very anxious to see her among her usual associates ; to watch her under the circumstances and in the position to which she was most accustomed . I knew that her life was a gay one ; that , except when she stole away to John 's home for the quiet which contrast rendered piquant , her existence was a round of excitement . I had heard Mrs. Conway say that " Esther 's " rooms were almost always filled with callers , and had , consequently , never attempted to visit her . I should now have a chance to see who and what they were , and what degree of influence they were likely to exert over her . It was quite late when we arrived , hut Miss Glenn was soon so *surrounded that I lost my place at her side . I knew all the men in the room , and most of the ladies who had been " out " any length of time , and managed to get through the evening by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was , evidently , one of the most admired women present . The effect of her physical beauty and grace upon others roused me to a vivid perception of their extent . Generally , they are to me like fresh air and sunshine , whose sweet influences I take in almost unconsciously . Her soul holds mine in such utter bondage , or , rather , in such sure keeping , that it is only at times I become keenly conscious of that wherein , for most men , lies her chief power . I know , if she were to lose her mere external charms to-morrow , she could be none the less essential to me , as I know that the long years , through which they must surely wane , could only perfect our spiritual unity and fitness . I soon singled out the men who were most devoted to her . They were all of more than average intellect , all good talkers-some even thinkers-who knew the world and its ways thoroughly . But there were those among them from // whom she would have recoiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet I defy the boldest of them to look into her eyes and say one word which he would not have spoken before his own mother . If they visit her , they must leave their worse natures outside , like their outer coverings , and only bring their better selves into her presence . I did not find witnessing all this flattery and devotion a very cheerful occupation . If she were actually mine , if I knew my place in her heart and life to be absolutely secure and unapproachable , the social homage she wins might strike me differently ; then , indeed , might " the dogs eat of the crumbs which fell from the rich man 's table . " But now , if we are bidden on an equality to the same board , I must decline to share the feast . I was thinking of all this , when the man to whom I was talking upon some indifferent subject , followed the direction of my eyes , and said , idly : " That Miss Glenn is very handsome , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gods she worships ; and yet I suppose some of those poor fellows imagine it possible she might marry them for love . " The contrast between his words and the truth , as I knew it , concerning her , started out before me so vividly as I listened , that I turned to him , stimulated and strengthened through my whole nature . I may never win her , but there came to me a glorious , glad certainty , that , if she ever accepts me , it will be as truly for my simple manhood as when Eve gave herself to Adam . She was seemingly in her brightest and gayest mood , and I was thinking how natural it was she should find the moments delightful , when she looked round and called me to her with a little movement of her eyes . " Is n't it time to go ? " she asked . " I am so tired of all this . Suppose you find Nelly , and see if she is *villing to leave . " I went away on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were delayed a moment or two on the front steps , waiting for the carriage , and I was drawing her wrappings more closely around her , to shield her from the night-air , when she said , looking back into the crowded hall , " How much pleasanter it is around John 's fire than in all that noise , and light , and confusion . " " John 's fireside , " I answered , eagerly , " has , of late , been to me the pleasantest place on earth . " And , carrying the memory of her sentence with me , I went home with a far lighter , happier heart than an hour before I had imagined possible . May 15th-I have had no heart to keep any chronicle of the last month . Ever since that evening party there has been a gradual change in her . All the easy brightness with which she used to greet me has died out of her manner , and in its place has come constrained abruptness . She avoids me so systematically that I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are alone , she will talk in a nervous , hurried fashion , and , if any one else comes in , will turn to them with evident relief . And then I go away , too utterly wretched to do anything but torture myself with vain attempts to discover what mistake or fault of mine has produced the alteration . And yet I have had moments of a happiness so exquisite , so transcendent , that I can not put it into words . At single seconds , there has come into her eyes and voice a softness ( if I dared I should call it a tenderness ) which has stopped the very beating of my heart . Thinking of these flashes of divine light in my dark night of trouble , there sometimes comes to me a faint dream , rather than a hope , that there may be a meaning in this change other than I have put upon it . When I was almost a boy , I once spent a summer in the country with a great leader of society , a social sovereign * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her own hands , and in the habit of talking for her own entertainment rather than that of her listener , she condescended to give me the benefit of some of her experience . She was quite candid about it . " It is great folly in me to waste sense upon you at your age ; but I fancy it is in you to really love a woman one of these days , and then , perhaps , you may appreciate it . When a proud , sensitive woman  --  and it is such you will surely worship-begins to really love you , she will first show it by acting as though she hated you . Unless it arises from righteous indignation , rudeness from a thoroughbred lady is , next to irrepressible tenderness , the surest proof of love . They may not be equally delightful , but they are equally flattering ; for , in each case , she is giving you what she gives no one else . " As I think of those words , I xvonder-I more than wonder , I almost hope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered the better part , I went to church . Verily , I had my reward . On my way hack , I met Miss Glenn returning alone from her service . As I walked at her side , she said very little , and I saw that her face wore the old " uphill " look . I asked her what had been the subject of the sermon she had heard . " The joys of Heaven , " she said . " And yet , as sermons often do , it has only depressed me . " I looked straight into her eyes . If I said what was on my lips , I might he deciding the course of my whole life . If I were a mere acquaintance , in saying it I should commit the unpardonable sin-that of intruding into the deepest recesses of her spiritual nature . But there is a unity which knows no intrusion , in which the subtlest reading is welcomed as love 's sacred recognition . I determined to speak . " There is one text from which I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw you- ' Remember Lot 's wife . ' " She started faintly and turned perceptibly paler . Then she looked straight down the street ; and I walked on until we reached her home , not knowing whether I had not forever shut the gates of the temple upon myself . When we reached the steps , she said , quietly , " V/ill you come in ? " " Is this mere courtesy , or do you really wish it ? " I asked , abruptly , determined to make her speak out . A quiver of indignant pain went over her face as she said , with that low concentration of voice which feeling always produces with her , " I did not expect that from you . " " Ca n't you understand , " I broke out , in her own tone , but with a man 's fire and passion added , " that there might be something so precious to me that I should grow morbidly suspicious as to whether it could be given me in truth and reality ? " I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment after , she said , with shy eyes that refused to meet mine , " Will you come in ? " I went in . May 27th-Since that Sunday morning I have seen Esther Glenn repeatedly in her own home . I choose times when no one is likely to be there , and we have long , quiet talks , from which I take away a sense , not only of happiness , but completeness , which does not fade away , but only sinks deeper into my nature , as I come into contact with the harsh , discordant world of men and business . Her manner has almost lost its nervous constraint and returned to its early charm and brightness  --  but " with a difference . " I can not define it , but it thrills to my very heart . June I3th. -I thought I had grown reasonable enough , had cooled off sufticiently , to write down intelligibly what has happened ; but I am afraid I was mistaken . My entire life and consci8usness appear to date from two days ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the beginning " seems to me to
