ARTICLE VII. - GOVERNMENT IN THE UNITED STATES . POPULAR elections in the United States , and the discussions incident thereto , keep the public mind in a state of vigilant attention to the political issues of the day , and diffuse a general intelligence of which we justly boast . Among the many advantages of our system , we count it not the least , that it is educational . As a school , however , for acquiring true and just views of government , it has one very great defect . Nearly all our political discussions relate to some pending election , where the whole question practically turns on the success of a particular candidate for office . In this wa5* , the true principle in issue becomes mixed up with so many extraneous influences , that it is in danger of being wholly lost sight of , or , at least , of being so perverted , as to lose the sym*n. metry which properly belongs to it . In Theology , we have a perfect standard which we hold up to men , whether they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have an inflexible standard , which courts guard with jealous care from every extraneous influence . We separate the law from the fact and bring it to the test of a fixed and established standard . But the only standard in a popular election is the majority of votes . Personal prejudice agaii*st , and personal partiality for a candidate , largely influence the canvass . In the discussions which precede an election , no candidate is likely to come before the people with any unwelcome truth . He can hardly be expected to combat popular errors , or to breast the current of popular prejndice . The temptation to fall in with the current  --  to increase it-  --  and to take advantage of it , is too strong for candidates to resist . Now , if there be a science of government-if government has its true philosophy founded in iinniutable principles , are we not in danger of having these principles perverted by the loose philosophies manufactured in our popular elections ? The statement of the simplest elementary truths ,  --  as that // wherever there is government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human authority over the people , and that the people are under it-would fall too harshly on the ear , to be ever spoken by any candidate soliciting votes . All our forms of expression have been so framed , as to convey the idea , that in these free United States , the people are not under the government , but over it . The people rule . The people are sovereign . The will of the people is supreme . We call the government an agent , thereby implying that its powers may be revoked at pleasure and controlled during their continuance . We call the government a compact , thereby implying that it is only an agreement and not an authority . If ever we venture to call it a government , we are careful to qualify the expression by large reservations of sovereignty to the people . We have had the doctrine of popular sovereignty in many forms . We have had the great popular sovereignty of the people of the United States . We have had the lesser popular sovereignty of the people of the respective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty of the people of the territories ; and , last of all , we had confederate popular sovereignty , or that the people within the limits of the attempted Southern confederacy were sovereign . And then came the contest between the government of the United States , the only true sovereignty known to the Constitution , and all these false forms of popular sovereignty . Then came the trial which was to test not only the strength of our political fabric , but the soundness of current political theories . The government established by the Constitution in immutable principles , acting on its right of self-preservation by force , and steadily refusing to abdicate its authority by concession or negotiation , asserted its supremacy over all the false sovereignties arrayed against it , and , at the end of the conflict , stood forth , not only victorious in arms , but stronger in the respect , confidence , and affection of the American people than it ever was before . During the war , we witnessed the singular spectacle of inemi in numberless instances volunteering to fight against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will be a still more singular spectacle , // if ' Southern rebels shall renounce the political theories for which they have always declared they were ready to die , and shall acquiesce in principles they have always professed to abhor , it is safe for us to act on the belieg that God has so made men that they will submit to a just government . We call the government of the United States the best ever made . Our sacrifices in maintaining and preserving it have been costly . The past has its lessons for the people . They may learn that it is not safe to make government their plaything . They may learn that liberty without its just restraints becomes anarchy . They may learn that false doctrines long inculcated will in the end be acted on , and surely lead to disorder . There is , as it seems to us. no need in the future of our talking so much about liberty . The real danger to liberty is through popular license and insubordination . There is need of more talk about the paramount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular sovereignty , and the popular will . Because this is the freest and best government in the world , we hold that for that very reason it ought to be the best obeyed . Government is instituted among men to secure certain great ends . For this purpose it must have an artificial machinery . It is a machine . We call it a machine , and speak of its wheels and their revolutions . Like all machines , it must operate on its own principles of construction . We have seen that demonstrated . Our machine of government was constructed to move on the principles of justice and liberty 1 All the wit of man could not make it run on slavery . Like all machines , it must be so constructed as to restrain , regulate , and apply the motive power . A water wheel erected on a river , so as to revolve with the current , but having no provision for restraining the motive power of the river , and applying it to a proposed end , would not be a machine . So a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no provision for restraining and regulating the popular will , and applying it to a proposed end , would not be a government . In constructing machines , we first ascertain the laws which the Creator has imposed on matter , and conforming our work // to these laws , rely for success on their uniform operation . So in government , true statesmanship consists in ascertaining the laws which the Creator has imposed on man , and acting in conformity with them . If we violate these great laws , we can no more expect success in the one case than in the other . It has been a favorite theory with political writers , that government is founded on compact . A compact binds those who make it , but nobody else . On what principle can a majority bind the minority by a compact or agreement ? And how can one generation of men bind their posterity by a compact ? The Declaration of Independence has been supposed to assert the doctrine of compact , when it declares that " governments derive their just powers from the consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? All natural persons , men , women , and children , a large part of whom are incapable of any other than an implied or presumed consent . The Declaration of Independence says that all these " are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights , and that to secure these rights governments are instituted . " Here is an express declaration that men can not alienate their own natural rights , much less the natural rights of others , by any compact . The consent spoken of is that implied consent which every person is justly presumed to give to a government so instituted as to secure to all their just rights . It is a current American idea , that government is founded in the will of the people . This is one of the many loose phrases which have grown out of our popular elections . There is but one Being in the Universe whose will is law . Human will is no standard of right and no basis of authority . The very object , use , and necessity of government , is to restrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any satisfactory philosophy of government which does not recognize the relations of man to his Maker . The Declaration of Independence begins with man as a created being , and asserts the rights with which he is endowed by his Creator . These natural rights imply natural obligations , for no one could enjoy his own rights , if others were not bound to respect them . Government is the enforce // inent of natural obligations , and in this way the protection of , natural rights . The moral restraints of reason , affection , and conscience not being adequate , human government comes in aid of them . Being a necessity , we find arrangements made by the Creator for its institution . We find , in the first place , the family relation , which is clearly established in nature . Mankind are created male and female , and about an equal number of each , with desires which bring them together as man and with . There is given to them the strongest affections for their offspring , and the family is thus constituted with the husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , communities , consisting of a great number of families , have their guardians in nature clearly indicated as the proper persons to make and enforce rules necessary for the common protection and welfare of all . The husband naturally represents the wife ; the father , his children ; and competent persons , those who are incompetent . As communities grow and expand into nations , many artificial rights and obligations spring into existence , but the great principle remains unchanged . Superficial readers have sometimes failed to find in the Constitution of the United States a recognition of man 's relations to God , and in their haste have called it an atheistic instrument . To say nothing of the oath or solemn appeal to God which it requires of all its officers , executive , legislative , and judicial , let us look at that great opening declaration , in which the ends and principles of our government are set forth . " To form a more perfect union . " Harmony and orderheaven 's first law . " To establish justice . " Justice , that great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general welfare . " He careth for all and his tender mercies are over all his works . " To secure the blessings of liberty . " Religious liberty or the right to worship God according to conscience . Civil liberty or the enjoyment of the rights which God has given to every human being . These are the pillars of the temple which our fathers built for themselves and their posterity . In the name of these great and immutable principles ; in the name of the people of whose rights and obligations these principles are the measure and the guaranty ; in the // name not of those merely who acted in its formation , but of all the people , the Constitution was ordained and established . It is but a poor conception of the meaning of those celebrated words- " we , the people of the United States , " to construe them merely as the majority of voters , by which the Constitution was ratified . This majority bore no comparison to that by which the imperial crown was placed on the head of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ours is a people 's government , not because it was ratified by a majority of those who voted on its adoption , but because it is founded in the protection of the rights of the people . The Declaration of Independence has sometimes been regarded as the commencement of a new era in government . But the seeds of civil liberty and just government were sown long before , and had already germinated into a vigorous growth . The great truths , that man was endowed by his Creator with an absolute and inalienable right to life , liberty , and the products of his labor , and that the true end of government was to protect and secure the rights which man thus received from his Maker , had been enunciated long before , and with more precision than they are stated by Mr. Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence . Many of our principles of civil liberty are as old as Magna Charts , and every one of them is of English origin . They grew up during the long struggle between the arbitrary power of the Crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty against the king , the aristocracy , and an unfriendly social system . They were transplanted here by men who came to what was then the new world , that they might enjoy the rights which God had given them , and here in a virgin soil where no unfriendly institutions or traditions of the past had taken root , constitutional liberty , for the first time , had a fair chance for a full and complete development . In the British constitution , the security of civil liberty rests entirely on what is called the balance of power . The supreme authority or sovereignty is in Parliament , which is composed of three constituent parts , the King , the Lords , and the House of Commons . All these three constituent parts must concur // in every Act of Parliament . When they thus concur , there is no other power in the Realm that can question or resist the Act or Order . So complete is the omnipotence of Parliament , that Lord Coke says , Parliament can do anything but make a main a woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true English law ; for if Parliament should declare a man to be a woman , every Court in the kingdom must hold that he is a woman . The only security is in the check which each constituent part of Parliament has on the other parts , and in the extreme improbability , or , as the English writers say , moral impossibility , that all the three parts will ever combine to subvert the liberties of the people . This is the boasted balance of the British constitution ; and while it may furnish sufficient security against oppressive legislation , it makes no adequate provision for getting rid of old abuses which have already become incorporated in their system . The King holds by hereditary right . He is not accountable for his acts . He can not be impeached , for the fundamental maxim is  --  the King can do no wrong . The Lords hold by hereditary right , and act on their personal honor as peers of the Realm , but without accountability . Both the King and Lords , by the natural instinct of preserving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the laws , even where the changes and progress of the world have made such innovations just and beneficial . The Constitution of the United States supplies the defects in that of England in two ways . 1 . By making more divisions of power , and in this way providing more checks against its abuse . 2 . By subjecting all who are entrusted with power to a rigid accountability . The most striking feature in our government is the division of powers into State and National . When slavery and its attendant heresy of State sovereignty shall disappear , no longer to disturb the harmonious workings of this double machinery , so that each part shall move in its proper sphere without hindrance or obstruction , the wisdom of this admirable arrangement will be universally seen and admitted . We shall best comprehend the relations of the State and National // governments by looking to the history of their f'ormation , and seeing how they came into existence . At the time of the Declaration of Independence , the American Colonies were mere dependencies of the British crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realiri , but the king claimed and exercised the right to suspend or abrogate at pleasure the laws of the colonial legislatures , and to subject the Colonies to the laws of Parliament , in which they had no voice or representation . This was the precise issue between the Colonies and the king . The Colonies did not , like our Southern rebels , claim to overthrow a government of which they were a constituent part , and in which they had even more than an equal representation ; but they claimed that taxation and representation ought to go together , and that they ought to be placed on the same footing a British subjects . The abettors of anarchy and wild revolution can find nothing in the teaching or example of our fathers to justity their mad schemes . The United Colonies became , by the Declaration of Independence , United States , and , by an instinct of nationality , drew closer together to meet the impending contest . The articles of confederation were the incipient and imperfect construction which they had time and opl ) ortunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great war , which taxed their energies to the utmost . On the termination of the struggle , the first idea which possessed the minds of men , was to finish what was only begun , and to perfect a government for the great nation foreseen in the future . The whole period from the Declaration of Independence to the final adoption of the Constitution , may properly be regarded as one forming period , or period of gestation preceding the birth of a nation . The government of the United States , thus gradually formed , is one with a double machinery . At the time of the adoption of the Constitution , the S tates had already perfected their separate organizations , and all that remained was to arrange them in their appropriate spheres , so as to revolve in harmony around a common centre . The great architects who were called to the work of construction , were not ignorant of the necessity of a supreme regulating power , without which , on the first collision , the machine // would stop , and their work be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were submitted to the convention-one by Edmund Randolph of Virginia , one by Charles Pinckney of South Carolina , one by Alexander Hamilton of New York , and one by Mr. Patterson of New Jersey . The plan submitted by Gov . Randolph contained the following provision : *b That the national legislature ought to be empowered to negative all laws passed by the several States contravening , in the opinion of the national legislature , the articles of union , and to call forth the force of the Union against any member of the Union failing to fulfill its duties under the articles thereof . " The plan submitted by Charles Pickney , had a provision in these words : " The Legislature of the United States shall have the power to revise the laws of the several states that may be supposed to infringe the powers exclusively delegated by this Convention to Congress , and to negative such as do . " Alexander Hamilton 's plan had the following provision : " All laws of the particular states contrary to the Constitution or the laws of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such laws being passed , the governor or the president of each state , shall be appointed by the general government and shall have a negative upon the laws about to be passed in the state 9f which he is governor or president . " The plan of Mr. Patterson was one for correcting , revising , and enlarging the Articles of Confederation , and it provided " that all acts of the United States in Congress assembled , made by virtue and in pursuance of the powers hereby vested in them , and by the Articles of Confederation , shall be the supreme law of the respective States ; and if any state , or any body of men in any state , shall oppose or prevent the carrying into execution such acts , the federal executive shall be authorized to call forth the powers of the Confederated States , or so much thereof as may be necessary , to enfirce and compel an obedience to such acts . " We thus see that the necessity of a supreme authority with power to enforce obedience was clearly comnprehended , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , however , of giving , as was first proposed , an express power to the national government to negative any state law , and coerce any // state by force of arms , which seemed to the Convention an unnecessarily harsh provision , there was substituted that emphatic declaration " that the Constitution and the laws of the United States made in pursuance thereof , shall be . the supreme law of the land . " Not " the supreme law of the respective States , " as provided in the plan of Mr. Patterson , already referred to , but " the supreme law of the land . " The Constitution and the laws of Congress are thus made national and paramount , and all cases arising under either are in express terms subjected to the judicial power of the National Government . The States are assigned their spheres of exclusive local legislation , and no considerate person would wish to see them disturbed in these . But by an irreversible law , there can be but one sovereignty in the same nation . The States can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exercise any of the powers denominated sovereign . They are suI ) ordinated to the National Government and made amenable to its judicial power . By the Constitution as originally made , any citizen of the United States might sue a state before the Courts of the United States  --  a provision very significant of the subordinated position of the States . It is not necessary to discuss at greater length the doctrine of state sovereignty . The events of the last four years have , as we hope , forever rid the country of this dangerous heresy . In the future , the state governments will be regarded with just favor , as an admirable contrivance for bringing local legislation in close sympathy with the wants of the people , and as furnishing a great and salutary check on the abuse of power . The powers of the national government are divided into three coordinate branches , the legislative* executive , and judicial . The legislative power is vested in Congress , consisting of the Senate , composed of two senators from each state , chosen by the legislatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electors in each state . These two bodies , by the different modes of their election , form a check on each other . The Senate is a check on the popular majority , and is also the especial guardian of the rights of the States . The executive power is vested in the president , chosen by electors appointed // by the several States , and each state has as many electors as the number of senators and representatives to which it is entitled in the Congress , under which provision it might easily happen that a candidate , who in fact received a majority in the popular vote , would not have a majority of the presidential electors . This is an intentional check upon the popular majority . Every law , order , or resolution , proposed by Congress must be approved by the President , or in case of his disapproval can be repassed only by two-thirds of each branch . Thus we see , that while the Senate and House of iRepresentatives are a check on each other , the veto of the President is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Courts of the United States , whose judges hold their offices for life , subject only to impeachment , and their compensation can not be diminished during their continuance in office . The judicial power thus made independent and carefully guarded from every nudue influence was designed to be a bulwark to withstand the currents of popular excitenient on the one hand , and the encroachments of the executive and legislative powers on the other . It is worthy of notice how the terms of office are arranged to hold in check the popular majority . The louse of Representatives is elected for two years . The President for four years . The Senate for six years . The judges of the Supreme Court for life . At no one time can the majority of votes ever act on all the branches of the government . Behind all these checks , and guards , and barriers , so carefully con* structed for its protection , our Fathers deposited the treasure of civil liberty . But the powers conferred upon the government of the United States , though guarded with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms are concise and for that reason , comprehensive . " The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes . " " To borrow money on the credit of the United States . " " To regulate commerce . " " To coin money , ' and " regulate the value thereof . " " To establish post offices and post roads . " " To declare war . " " To raise and support armies . " " To provide and maintain a navy . " " To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into // execution the foregoing powers , and all other powers vesi5ed in the government of the United States . " We quote these provisions of the Constitution to show in what general and comprehensive terms the great powers of Congress are granted . And so of the powers granted to the President . " He is to take care that the laws be faithfully executed . " That solemn oath so definitely framed and prescribed , " to preserve , protect . and defend the Constitution , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government of the United States has , it is true , its limitations , its prohibitions , its duties imposed , and its l ) rinciples of action defined , but these do not take away its sovereignty . The sovereign of the universe has His principles of action , from which lie will not , and we may without irreverence say , can not depart . We have already seen , that the elements of representative government are to be found in nature . As in the family the husband and father is the natural guardian and representative , so in society there are natural guardians and representatives clearly indicated as the proper persons to form a government and to be the primary representatives of the people in its administration . Our political system is founded on this arrangement in nature . The primary representatives in nature of the rights and welfare of the people , are made electors , or voters . We are in the habit of denominating these electors who vote as " the people . " But four fifths of the people having equal civil rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ franchise is political power , and those entrusted with it are trustees and representatives . They are admitted on qualification . They take an oath to support the Constitution and to vote for the general welfare . Bribery and other undue influence are punished . They are not permitted to vote on measures of government , but only to elect those who may . In the election of the President they are only *rimar*y electors to vote for the secondary electors , which last are to choose the President . The nomination of a presidential candidate is properly only a recommendation , though it has gradually come to be imperative , and in this respect has practically changed the Constitution . The tendency has been to give to the // majority of votes a greater effect than was originally designed . The object of the Constitution in making offices elective was to subject them to accountability , and bring them in contact and sympathy with the wants of the people . It was not intended that the majority of voters should dictate the measures of government . All officers when elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their own convictiots of duty . A great deal has been said and written about the reserved sovereignty of the people ,  --  a phrase conveying , as it it seems to us , very loose and dangerous ideas of government . The tenth article of the amendment to the Constitution has been much relied on to support this doctrine of reserved sovereignty . It declares that " the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively or to the people . " If this amendment is to be construed to be a reservation of sovereignty , then there is one sovereignty reserved to the States , and another sovereignty to the people ; or if but one sovereignty is reserved , it is either in the States or in the people . and nobody can tell in which . The amendment has in this way so puzzled the political theorists , that some have declared it to be a vague generality , meaning nothing in particular . In common sense , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a limnitatio n of the powers of the national government to the uses for which they were granted al ) d a prohibition of their being perverted to the infraction of the just rights of the States or of the civil liberty of the people . It is one of a large number of amendments which were passed to meet the attacks made on the Constitution , and quiet the fears created by these attacks , that the government of the United States would absorb all power , and becoming a consolidated despotism would overthrow the State organizations , and subvert the liberties of the people . These amendments were intended to furnish a rule of construction , being specific declarations that power should not be assumed nor enlarged by any construction to take away the rights of the States or the rights of the people . The tenth article is of the same general import as the other // amendments , which declare " the right of the people peaceably to asseinide and to petition the government for a redress of grievances , " " the right of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , " " the enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not he construed to deny , or disparage others retained by the people . " These are all manifestly limitations of power in favor of civil liberty , not reservations of sovereignty . The government of the United States is one of limitations , prohibitions , and duties imposed , for the observance of which the Constitution has provided every possible security . But any doctrine suggesting remedies outside of its provisions is dangerous and revolution arv . The Constitution was made to be perpetual . It was ordained and established by its makers for themselves and their posterity . It is founded in immutable principles . There is no reserved power in states , or people , to abrogate it , or any of its fundamental provisions . It is true that it provides for amendments , so that a fault in its arlificial workings may be corrected , or an obstruction like that of slavery may be removed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They can be proposed only in two ways . 1 . By two-thirds of both Houses of Congress . 2 . On the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the States , it is made the duty of Congress to call a convention for proposing amendments . The power of calling the convention is vested in Congress , which carries with it the power of deciding whether the application is in due form . Amendments proposed in either mode must be ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States , or by conventions in three-fourths thereof ; as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by Congress , and there is added the significant words that when so ratified they " shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part cf this Constitution . " It would be a perversion of the meaning of these words , as well as the meaning of the word " amendment , " to construe them so as to give a power to abrogate the Constitution or any of its fundamental parts . In government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme // Being to find the standard of perfection . He has infinite goodness to choose the best ends , infinite wisdom to choose the best means , and infinite power to carry these means into execution . But His immut ability is what gives security to the Universe . While in humble imitation of the Divine Original , we seek to give to human government the attributes of goodne*s , wisdom , and power , we shall fail , if we do not also imitate the immutability which crowns all the other attributes of God . We conclude by quoting from the first Inaugural of Abraham Lincoln , whose words spoken for liberty and the Constitution are now forever consecrated : " I hold that in the contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution , the union of these States is perpetual . Perpetuity is implied , if not expressed , in the fundamental law of all national governments . It is safe to assert , that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination . Continue to execute all the express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endure for ever , it being impossible to destroy it , except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself . "
