txt Congress failed to pass the law we suggested and urged , to prevent the importation into this country of released convicts and ruffians from the prisons of Great Britain ; but in the absence of a general law prohibiting the immigration , under any circumstances , of foreign criminals , we are glad to observe that the local authorities are exercising vigilance to prevent our being overrun by " ticket-ofleave " men , at lbast . Still another batch of these men arrived here yesterday from London in the ship Plymouth Rock  --  Ede Englishmen , two Irishmen , one German  --  four of them under conviction of felony , one of larceny , one for receiving stolen goods , and two for other crimes . They were all , on their arrival , promptly sent to Police Headquarters , and , it is understood , will be sent back to England . It is difficult to tell what proportion of these emigrant criminals are discovered on their arrival here ; but we should judge only a very limited proportion , from the fact that though small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years past , the " London Prison Aid Society " continues steadily at its work of exporting them to our city . If they did not meet with great success , they would not so persistently continue their efforts . Since Congress was too much occupied with its mighty debates to attend to this matter , we do not know but some regulation of it would be within the purview of the State Legislature now in session . The question is one really of national jurisdiction and legislation ; but it is to this city that nearly all the ticket-of-leave men and other criminals are sent ; and the authorities of the State might very properly exercise some power in the premises . We hope some member from this suffering city will take the matter up .
