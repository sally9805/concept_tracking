txt An English stock operator , dependent for success on his knowledge of American affairs , is certainly to be pitied . He reads the London Times  --  especially the City Article  --  with implicit confidence ; he studies carefully the letters of the " special correspondent , " and then makes his ventures . About six weeks ago he was duly instructed - by ' these trustworthy informants , that a grand conspiracy was being contrived by which a Convention of all the States of our Union was to be called , and the Peace Democrats of the North were to unite with the whilom rebels of the South , and together they were to take possession , by force and fraud , of the Government at Washington , oust Mr. LINCOLN and disband the armies  --  forming a new Union founded on Revolution . This terrible revelation of a bloody conspiracy was devoutly believed in England , and discussed by all the journals which follow the information of the Times . It of course . affected all stock operations . The return rumor of it has produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt whether one-tenth of our readers ever heard even the report of it . The whole story was probably a concoction of the prolific brain of the Times ' correspondent and his secessionist friends at the Clifton House . Now , close after this , comes the first action of the Chicago platform ? of an " armistice " and " a convention of all the States . " The readers of the Times , having been duly prepared by previous imaginary accounts of public sentiment here , of course at once accept the Resolutions of Chicago as the voice of the country , and believe peace is near at hand . A vision of the Southern ports opened ? of three millions of bales of cotton pouring into the factories of Great Britain ? of a starved and half-nalred nation suddenly calling , and able to pay , for unlimited commodities ? of the Confederate Loan become a first-class European investment , and a vast demand for English gold to pay for all the South will offer ? at once convulses the business-world of England . The consols are depressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune in stocks or in hoards of cotton is no doubt lost ; the Bank of England even is obliged to raise its rate of discount to 9 per cent , and the whole financial system of Great Britain is rudely shaken . To us , looking at events as they are now , or even remembering public opinion four weeks since , the English panic seems ludicrous ; and we can not but rejoice at it , as a suitable retribution for what should be an unpardonable sin in commercial papers  --  untrustworthy information about foreign countries . If the London Times will continue to employ such correspondents as it has here ? men who draw upon their imaginations for facts , and tell without scruple the most atrocious falsehoods about this country  --  its readers must remain in ignorance of the true condition of affairs here ; and if they-make com mercial ventures on their information , they must come to grief . A trustworthy correspondent would have explained that the American see , of politics throws everything to the surface , but that the great prevailing currents are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country are the agriculturists  --  the farmers  --  who are now furnishing volunteers by the hundred thousand for this war ; that these stubborn men have never despaired of the Republic , and least of all , when corrupt politicians held out the coward 's proffer of an armistice at the Chicago Convention . Any Sensible man could have told the Times ' correspondent , the day after that platform was published , that it would utterly ruin the party which promulgated it , and that no candidate would dare go into an election on it . He could have informed him that not a tithe of the lowest dregs of this people were ready yet to give up the Union , and accept the slaveholders ' Confederacy . He might , indeed , have shown him that argument must be used ; that such is the character of our people , that in every great election , fundamental questions must be discussed , and , no doubt , the sophistical offer of an- armistice would come before the popular judgment this Autumn . But no sane man in these States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not such utter idiots as to risk all the gains of a four years ' fearful struggle by a pretended truce . Even if we had never believed in a future reunion , we should yet have continued the war for territory , if nothing else . We do not believe a single stock operator in America made one venture on the idea of even the possibility of peace . A candid and well-informed correspondent , giving the l3ritiajt public facts , and not fancies or prejudices , would have prepared their minds for the true state of things , and saved them this foolish panto and convulsion . Wftnt of truth and reality , even in a successful journal , must eventually bring its stinging retribution , and we are glad that 111 this ease it has been made manifest to the world . Defeo , tive as American journalism may be , we are confident that our business public would never have endured an American journal , furnishing such garbled and false information , as has the London Times during the last four years .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
