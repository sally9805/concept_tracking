txt The year that is drawing toward its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies . To these bounties , which are so constoutly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the Source from which they come , others have been added , which are of so extraordinary a nature that they can not fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever-watchful providence of Almighty God . In the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity , which has sometimes seemed to invite and provoke the aggressions of foreign States , peace has been preserved with all nations , order has been maintained , the laws have been respectea and obeyed , and harmony has prevailed everywhere , except in the theatre of military conflict , while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union . The needful diversion of wealth and strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defence have not attested the plow , the shuttle or the shin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the mines , as well of iron and coal as g the precious metals , have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore . Population has steadily increased , notwithstandihg the waste that has been made in the camp , the siege and the battle-field ; and the country , rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor , is permitted to expect a continuance of years with large increase of freedom . No human counsel hath devised , nor bath any mortal hand worked out these great things . They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God , who , while dealing with us in anger for our sins , hath nevertheless remembered mercy . It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly , reverently and gratefully acknowledged , as with one heart and voice , by the whole American people . I do . therefore , invite my fellow-citizens in every part of the United States , and also those who are at sea , and these who are sojourning in foreign lands , to set apart and observe the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer to our beneficent Father , who dwelleth in the heavens . And I recommend to them that , while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Hun for such singular deliverances and blessings , they do also with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience commend to their tender care all those who have become widows , orphans , mourners , or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably enreage , l , and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty hand to heal the wounds of the nation , and to restore it , as soon as may be consistent with he divine purposes , to the full enjoyment of peace , harmony , tranquility and Ur ion , In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed . Done at the City of Washington , this third day of October , in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three , and of the Independence of the United States the eighty-eighth.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
