Scene Scene .  --  The Consulting Apartment at Dr. Savage 's  --  doors , L. C. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , R. ; sofa , L. Enter Pinchbeck , C. Pinchbeck . Pinchbeck The Doctor not down yet . Now for my studies . A medical practitioner I am resolved to be , somehow or other , it only wants a tolerable share of impudence , and a few of the regular phrases ; half the capital I know that I possess already  --  the other half I 'm picking up daily . Ah , here are a couple of stray prescriptions to add to my stock . ( picks up prescriptions , and puts them in pocket-book ) I wonder how my other profession gets on . Let 's see if there 's any chance of a nibble this morning . Hallo ! my advertisement not in ?  --  yes , here it is. ( reads ) " Matrimonial.  --  A professional gentleman , of good social position , knowing how many people are deterred by an unconquerable timidity from avowing their preferences , and , instigated by a spirit of humanity , has established a secret agency , through which the happy union of congenial temperaments can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &c."; My correspondence has not been voluminous as yet . Ah , here 's another bite from a cautious kind of fish , who has been nibbling at the hook recently . ( reads ) " Romeo will be at W. 's office , to-morrow , at twelve . " Hurrah ! this looks like a capture , I think ; the Doctor always makes his calls at that time , and the coast will be clear for my operations . Meanwhile , I must read up for my medical character . ( takes book and reads ) " Diagnosis of diphtheria : palate hard and dry , throat parched "  --  how very singular , I feel these symptoms every day , just about this time  --  " remedy : a strong dilution "  --  nothing like prevention ; I shall prescribe for myself , at once  --  strong dilution ; I do n't know anything stronger than brandy . ( goes to cupboard , and mixes some brandy and water ) Enter Perkins , door , L. C. Perkins . Perkins My gracious , what are you doing Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little practical knowledge in physics , my dear  --  manufacturing the brass for my professional door-plate by-and-bye. ( kisses her ) Perk . Perkins ( L. ) You do n't seem to lack the raw material , Mr. Impudence . Pinch . Pinchbeck Fortunately , no  --  most essential ingredient in the professional mixture ; but how do we find ourselves this morning  --  is our pulse regular , have we had a quiet night ?  --  let me see . ( feels her pulse ) Where the deuce is it ? Ah ! I have it now  --  low , torpid , system wants invigorating . Allow me  --  slight tonic . ( mixing glass of brandy and water ) Perk . Perkins ( L. ) I could n't touch it for the world . Pinch . Pinchbeck Pooh , pooh  --  must n't disobey your medical attendant  --  case urgent  --  do you good  --  nauseous , I know , but necessary . Perk . Perkins ( drinks ) I never could  --  that 's not so hard to take  --  what a capital doctor you would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched them closely , dear  --  good deal of humbug among the medicals ! Most ailments you see are imaginary  --  we have to humour those patients , study their characters , not their complaints  --  that 's the principle  --  tickle them up with cordials , alcoholic balsams , and palatable medicated confections . Perk . Perkins But if they should be really ill ? Pinch . Pinchbeck Then we have nothing to do but consult , and shift the responsibility . Perk . Perkins Why , I declare you seem to be quite fit to go into the doctory line yourself . Pinch . Pinchbeck I should think so , indeed . You do n't suppose that I have swept a doctor 's office , and dusted his clothes and books a whole year for nothing . Now , I have something else to say to you  --  I 've got a wonderful nibble at my matrimonial hook . You promised to assist me and go halves in the plunder , so you 'll have to represent the eligible party to all the male gudgeons . I can manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do just what you say , for I do believe you are clever enough to make both our fortunes . Pinch . Pinchbeck That 's right ; now embrace me with respectful energy , and go attend to your business . ( they embrace ) Enter Doctor Savage , door , L. C. Dr. S. Doctor Savage Hollo ! what are you about there ? Perkins runs off . Pinch . Pinchbeck Singular and sudden attack , sir  --  sort of what- you-call-em dance  --  beg your pardon for taking the liberty , sir  --  I was just looking at the book to see what it meant . Dr. S. Doctor Savage I think I might see a walking volume of rascality without straining my eye-sight much , Master Pinchbeck ; but you 're a useful scamp enough , and so , until you make it too apparent , I suppose I must continue partially blind . Pinch . Pinchbeck Always glad of your good opinion , sir . Dr. S. Doctor Savage That will do  --  be off . Pinch . Pinchbeck Real professional tone  --  I must practice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Savage ( looks at slate ) No calls to make for an hour . I hope I shall be allowed to enjoy my newspaper ; if there is one thing worries me more than another , it is to be interrupted in the middle of an interesting paragraph  --  anything new to-day . ( bell rings ) Now , is n't that provoking . Pinchbeck  --  Robert  --  not at home  --  not at home to anybody , mind ! Enter Herbert , L. Herb . Herbert Waverly All right , I 'm nobody  --  door open ; knew you would n't mind me  --  Julia 's gone up stairs to your wife . Dr. S. Doctor Savage My dear boy , of course , you are privileged always , but you must confess , that when a man who loves to devour his daily , is stopped at the very first mouthful  --  Herb . Herbert Waverly Yes  --  I know  --  irritating , very  --  but it ca n't be helped now  --  no loss , however  --  I 've read it all  --  nothing in it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear friend  --  dull  --  money-grubbing , unromantic , unendurable ! ( crosses R. to L. ) Dr. S. Doctor Savage Hollo ! Herbert , how 's this  --  touch of the blues  --  eh ? Herb . Herbert Waverly Touch !  --  an avalanche  --  overwhelming , destructive ! Dr. S. Doctor Savage Indigestion . Herb . Herbert Waverly Pshaw  --  feel my pulse . Dr. S. Doctor Savage  --  Regular as clock-work . Herb . Herbert Waverly Indeed  --  anatomical mockery  --  sanguineous deception . Look in my eye . Dr. S. Doctor Savage I do  --  clear , bright and placid as a summer lake . Herb . Herbert Waverly But with an under-current of despair . Dr. S. Doctor Savage Good gracious ! you alarm me . What 's the matter ? Herb . Herbert Waverly I do n't know  --  that 's the misery . I 'm a physiological cheat  --  an animated subterfuge . This calm and passionless exterior covers a heart tortured by anxiety . I 'm a sort of Spartan boy , with a continually gnawing fox  --  a modern Prometheus , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sofa , L. ) Dr. S. Doctor Savage On pate de fois gras  --  your liver 's out of order . Herb . Herbert Waverly Do n't laugh ; ( rises ) there 's a good fellow . I 'm serious  --  like Othello , perplexed in the extreme . Dr. S. Doctor Savage Not from the same cause , I hope . Herb . Herbert Waverly No , no  --  I almost wish it were . Dr. S. Doctor Savage The deuce , you do . Pray , explain yourself . Herb . Herbert Waverly I will , if I can . Hark ! is n't that Julia 's voice ?  --  no . I would n't have her hear me for worlds . Dr. S. Doctor Savage A secret , eh ? Herb . Herbert Waverly Yes  --  a most embarassing one . Dr. S. Doctor Savage Aha , I understand . Herb . Herbert Waverly No , you do n't . Dr. S. Doctor Savage Yes , I do . You married young . Herb . Herbert Waverly Well ? Dr. S. Doctor Savage Nearly six years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savage And you have seen some one  --  Herb . Herbert Waverly Stop ! I wo n't allow your tongue to utter such a sacrilegious thought . You know nothing about it . I love my wife more truly , more devotedly than ever . Dr. S. Doctor Savage Oh , then , perhaps she  --  Herb . Herbert Waverly No ; I tell you  --  no  --  that 's not it at all . Dr. S. Doctor Savage Well , what is it , for mercy 's sake  --  is she in bad health ? Herb . Herbert Waverly On the contrary , fresh and fair and beautiful as Hebe . Dr. S. Doctor Savage And her spirits ? Herb . Herbert Waverly ( L. ) Ah ! Dr. S. Doctor Savage ( R. ) Now we 're coming at it . Herb . Herbert Waverly Are we ! perhaps . William , I think I can count upon your friendship . ( goes up , and brings down chair and sits ) Dr. S. Doctor Savage In any extremity . Herb . Herbert Waverly Then listen to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the victim of some concealed sorrow , the cause of which I ca n't divine . Since our marriage we have lived only for each other , as you know ; the years flew by in calm tranquillity , happy in our mutual confidence , happy in our entwined affection . Dr. S. Doctor Savage But surely  --  Herb . Herbert Waverly Wait ; not long since , only a few months ago , it smote upon my heart like a sudden stab that there was a something , I knew not what , wanting in our perfect understanding of each other . I could accuse myself of no concealment except of that one shadow of surmise ; hour by hour , however , my suspicions grew to certainty ; I could perceive that her gaiety was unreal , assumed , constrained , put on while we were together , only to be abandoned when she was alone . Well , one day I had just quitted her , and urged almost to desperation by the cruel doubts that oppressed me , I  --  I listened at her door , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William , I did ; the hot blood sears my cheek for it , now , but I was that abject , cowardly thing , that miserably mean eavesdropper . Once , only once , upon my honour  --  honour ?  --  my honour ? Well , I was punished for it , amply , deservedly , when I saw the lie pass from her brow , and the truth , the terrible truth reveal itself : she had deceived me , the echo of the merry laugh with which she parted from me had scarcely died away , before I saw her gaze with a sad , painful expression upon the door I had passed through , and she wept  --  wept , I tell you , man , a flood of silent , agonizing tears , and I , who but a few moments before would have faced her lightest sorrow , at the peril of my life , my soul , felt a curse spring upward from my heart ; but my great love compelled it back , and changed it to a grief . Oh , William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child . Dr. S. Doctor Savage And from as small a cause , no doubt . Herb . Herbert Waverly You can not question the sincerity of my suffering , or do you wish to deceive me also with a feigned indifference ; in either case I  --  ( rising ) Dr. S. Doctor Savage Stop ; do n't be hasty ; I 'm afraid you have been so already , conjuring up a spectre which may seem very hideous , and be nothing but vapour after all ; let us look the phantom boldly in the face : how long is it since you made this grim discovery ? Herb . Herbert Waverly Three months and five days . Dr. S. Doctor Savage There 's nothing like being particular in dates , I presume you have n't hinted to your wife  --  Herb . Herbert Waverly Of course not ; do you think me insane ? Dr. S. Doctor Savage Not yet ; nor given any indication by change of feature , or coolness of manner , that might suggest a suspicion to her . Herb . Herbert Waverly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Savage But by accident ? they breathe hard who wear masks always . Herb . Herbert Waverly I ca n't tell , I believe not . Dr. S. Doctor Savage At all events , she still plays the same part ? Herb . Herbert Waverly Yes , plays it , oh , how skilfully ! Dr. S. Doctor Savage You ca n't think of any reason springing from yourself  --  any slight jealousy or misconception ? Herb . Herbert Waverly None whatever . Dr. S. Doctor Savage It 's reasonable to conclude then , that the cause , whatever it be , must rest with her alone ? Herb . Herbert Waverly It must , it must ! Dr. S. Doctor Savage Bah , bah ! hold your tongue , and above all , be reasonable ; the cause of her uneasiness must be either real or imaginary  --  if imaginary , it must be dispersed for her sake  --  if real , it must be met manfully for your own . You 've been a great deal in each other 's society ? Herb . Herbert Waverly Necessarily  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps not ! Well , I confess I 'm puzzled . Herb . Herbert Waverly I made an excuse for calling that you might watch her closely without exciting her suspicion , there may be some lurking illness that your experienced eye would detect . ( Mrs. Herbert and Mrs. Savage laugh without ) Hark , she comes ! ( crosses to R. , behind table , Mrs. Herbert laughs outside ) Ah , that laugh  --  how it chills me  --  silence and discretion ! Dr. S. Doctor Savage Pooh , I 'm a physician ! Enter Mrs. Savage and Mrs. Herbert , L. 2 . E. Mrs. S. Mrs. Doctor Savage ( speaking as they enter , L. ) It 's not true , my dear , for the newspapers say that the Empress wore them at the last ball , and I suppose that settles the question . Mrs. H. Mrs. Herbert Waverly ( joyously , L. C. ) Good morning , my dear Doctor , I hope you 'll pardon me for not paying my respects sooner , but when women meet you know they have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( R. C. ) Do n't mention it , my dear madam , I 'm delighted to see you looking so well . Herb . Herbert Waverly Pale , is n't she ? Dr. S. Doctor Savage No . Mrs. H. Mrs. Herbert Waverly ( to Herbert ) Did I detain you love ? Herb . Herbert Waverly ( R. , gaily ) Not at all , darling  --  had a glorious chat with my old friend William  --  is n't that flush hectic ? Dr. S. Doctor Savage Hectic ? nonsense ! Mrs. H. Mrs. Herbert Waverly ( to Mrs. Savage ) Do n't you see a sad expression in his eye . Mrs. S. Mrs. Doctor Savage ( L. ) Not a bit ; I suppose I must introduce myself . ( crosses to him ) I believe I have the honour of addressing the celebrated Dr. Savage ? Dr. S. Doctor Savage Eh , who 's that ? Mrs. S. Mrs. Doctor Savage I 'm your wife , if you please , Doctor . Dr. S. Doctor Savage Oh , little woman , is that you ? Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take no more notice of me than if I were any other article of household furniture . Dr. S. Doctor Savage Ah , you little humbug , you want to give your friends an idea that you are terribly neglected , do n't you ? Mrs. S. Mrs. Doctor Savage Well , and am I not , when I 've hardly seen you for a week . Herb . Herbert Waverly What ? Mrs. H. Mrs. Herbert Waverly Is it possible ? Mrs. S. Mrs. Doctor Savage It 's a melancholy fact ; what with calls out , consultations  --  very convenient excuses , and that odious club , ah , how I 'd like to strangle it . I have n't set eyes upon him only for a minute or two , for  --  for  --  oh , ever so long . ( retires up stage and sits on sofa ) Dr. S. Doctor Savage But did n't I come at last to comfort you as the other tyrant said , you perverse little pet grumbling domestic dictator . ( Mrs. Herbert laughs , sitting on sofa ) Herb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Herbert Waverly Very good , Doctor ; did you hear that , Herbert dear ? Herb . Herbert Waverly Oh , yes , my love , capital ! ( laughs and turns up stage ) The mask , the mask , how evident it is . Dr. S. Doctor Savage I know better than to let you have too much of my company , my duck . Mrs. S. Mrs. Doctor Savage Indeed , sir , and why , may I ask ? Dr. S. Doctor Savage Precautionally , my darling ; I 'm out of spirits sometimes , and dullness is contagious . Mrs. S. Mrs. Doctor Savage I 'm much obliged to you for your consideration . Dr. S. Doctor Savage Oh , you 're very welcome . Mrs. S. Mrs. Doctor Savage But I think it more professional than polite ; do n't you agree with me , Mr. Waverly ? Herb . Herbert Waverly Yes , perfectly  --  I beg your pardon , I did n't exactly catch the  --  Mrs. H. Mrs. Herbert Waverly Why , Herbert , dear , you seem out of spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my darling , what could induce you to suppose so ? ( to Dr. Savage ) She has been crying . ( Mrs. Herbert turns to Mrs. Savage ) Dr. S. Doctor Savage I would n't be surprised , women frequently cry about trifles  --  seldom about troubles . Mrs. S. Mrs. Doctor Savage ( L. ) It 's very evident , my dear , that their high mightinesses our respective lords and masters , have not finished their confidential chat . Herb . Herbert Waverly I assure you there 's no particular conference , we have nothing to consult about , have we , William ? Dr. S. Doctor Savage Nothing but the state of the weather . Herb . Herbert Waverly you do n't imagine that I have , Julia ? Mrs. H. Mrs. Herbert Waverly ( laughing , L. C. ) Why should I , dear , to judge by your merry laugh , you must be as free from care as I am. ( goes , L. ) Mrs. S. Mrs. Doctor Savage Come , love , I want to shew you my new aviary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglect reduces me to the old maidenish resource of pets , poodles , and parrots  --  did you hear what I said , sir ? Dr. S. Doctor Savage No . Mrs. S. Mrs. Doctor Savage You 're a bear , and I hate you ! Dr. S. Doctor Savage Thank you , I 'm very much obliged to you . Mrs. H. Mrs. Herbert Waverly Oh , do n't say that , dear , even in jest . Dr. S. Doctor Savage You would n't have her say it in earnest , would you ? Mrs. H. Mrs. Herbert Waverly How amusing you are , doctor ; wo n't you wait a little longer , Herbert ? Herb . Herbert Waverly Certainly , my love , as long as you please , I 'm not in a hurry . ( crossing , L. ) Mrs. H. Mrs. Herbert Waverly Au revoir , then . ( Mrs. Savage hits the Doctor sharply on the shoulder , and as she goes off , turns round and makes faces at him ) Exeunt Ladies , L. 2 E. Herb . Herbert Waverly ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Well ! Herb . Herbert Waverly What do you think ? Dr. S. Doctor Savage Think ? you 'll pardon the force of the expression , I think you 're a pair of fools , not having taken the wise precaution to economise your domestic felicity , the natural consequence has been a surfeit . Herb . Herbert Waverly What do you mean ? Dr. S. Doctor Savage Simply that your sky of happiness has been a little too serene  --  " Shining on , shining on , by no shadow made tender , Till love falls asleep in its sameness of splendour . " Herb . Herbert Waverly Are you in earnest ? Dr. S. Doctor Savage Profoundly ! Herb . Herbert Waverly And the remedy ? Dr. S. Doctor Savage Establish a shadow . Herb . Herbert Waverly As if it had not been all cloud . Dr. S. Doctor Savage I grant you plenty of cloud , but no storm . Herb . Herbert Waverly Storm . Dr. S. Doctor Savage Yes , storm , the air never gets clear without one ; there have been enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll , the lighting play , the rains descend . Herb . Herbert Waverly You surely would n't advise a quarrel ? Dr. S. Doctor Savage By no means . Herb . Herbert Waverly What then ? do for pity 's sake let me understand you at once . Dr. S. Doctor Savage ( R. ) Desperate cases demand desperate remedies . We must stimulate the organic system , the action of the heart is sluggish . You have every confidence in your wife 's affection ? Herb . Herbert Waverly Unbounded ! Dr. S. Doctor Savage Would n't be afraid to put it to any proof ? Herb . Herbert Waverly Certainly not ! Dr. S. Doctor Savage Then could n't you get some good-looking friend in whose honour and discretion you have reliance , to pay her just sufficient attention to excite an interest ? Herb . Herbert Waverly ( very loudly ) What ? Dr. S. Doctor Savage An indignant one , of course , anything to put an end to this torpidity of soul . Herb . Herbert Waverly ( walks about ) Phew ! you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood galloping through my veins at a stinging pace . ( crosses to R. , and back to L. ) Dr. S. Doctor Savage Yes , I know , it will do you good , too  --  vitalize your inertness , and fill you with wholesome anxieties in spite of yourself ; wake up your slumbering energies , and pepper your flavourless existence with a little appetizing excitement . Herb . Herbert Waverly What folly ! I dare not resort to such an unworthy experiment . Dr. S. Doctor Savage Are you afraid ? Herb . Herbert Waverly No , a thousand times , no . Dr. S. Doctor Savage Then where 's the danger ? Herb . Herbert Waverly The idea is so singular , but if I were to consent to such an extraordinary proceeding , where am I to find the friend ? Dr. S. Doctor Savage Oh , plenty of them floating about , who have nothing else to do . Herb . Herbert Waverly Unless you were to undertake it yourself . Dr. S. Doctor Savage What are you talking about ?  --  good gracious ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of person  --  why , I never made a complimentary speech to a woman in my life  --  I do n't know how  --  it 's preposterous . Herb . Herbert Waverly You recommended it yourself . Dr. S. Doctor Savage Yes , but it 's rather a novelty in medical practice to ask a doctor to swallow his own prescriptions . Herb . Herbert Waverly Consider , that in you I have the completest trust  --  besides , you 'll know exactly how far it will be prudent to go . Come , come , I shall consider it unfriendly if you refuse . Dr. S. Doctor Savage Truly , a ridiculous position I have placed myself in . I 'll tell you what I 'll do , I 'll compromise the matter with you by trying to find out the cause of her disquiet , and if I find myself floating towards flirtation , why , I 'll resign myself to the current . Herb . Herbert Waverly That 's my good , kind friend . ( Ladies laugh outside ) Here they come , now you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while you are present ? Herb . Herbert Waverly Pshaw , that 's of no consequence . Dr. S. Doctor Savage Oh , I thought it was ; well , but my wife will be here too . Herb . Herbert Waverly Yes , that 's awkward . Dr. S. Doctor Savage So I should think . Herb . Herbert Waverly Never mind , I 'll pay my regards to her while you  --  Dr. S. Doctor Savage No , you wo n't do anything of the kind . Herb . Herbert Waverly What , William , are you afraid ? Dr. S. Doctor Savage No , certainly not  --  confound it , I begin to feel as if I had walked open-eyed into a nice predicament . Enter Mrs. Savage and Mrs. Herbert , door L. Mrs. S. Mrs. Doctor Savage What 's the matter , dear ? Dr. S. Doctor Savage Oh , nothing  --  I 'm afraid I 've given the wrong prescription to a patient , that is all . Mrs. H. Mrs. Herbert Waverly No danger , sir , I hope ? ( crosses to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , at present  --  upon my life , she 's remarkably pretty , I never noticed it before ; I do n't think it would be very difficult to say a few tender words to her  --  hem , Mrs. Waverly ! ( she turns suddenly ) Bless my soul , who would have thought she 'd turn on a fellow like a drawing-room tigress  --  beg your pardon , but did you  --  Mrs. H. Mrs. Herbert Waverly No , sir . Dr. S. Doctor Savage I thought not  --  did you ever read this interesting work  --  I do n't mean that  --  if you would only grant me a private interview . Mrs. H. Mrs. Herbert Waverly Sir ! Dr. S. Doctor Savage No , not private  --  public , I mean  --  oh lord ! I do n't know what I mean ; see what it is to be unused to a thing  --  that 's as far as I can go at present . Enter Pinchbeck , with coat , door , L. C. Pinchbeck . Pinchbeck Cab 's at the door , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sure  --  dear me , I had almost forgotten my visits . ( going ) Mrs. S. Mrs. Doctor Savage You 're not going out in that coat ? Dr. S. Doctor Savage Bless me , no  --  excuse me  --  a little absent this morning . ( Pinchbeck puts coat on Doctor  --  business  --  all laugh  --  Doctor runs off  --  Drop quick ) END OF ACT THE FIRST . ACT II . Scene Scene .  --  Drawing Room at Waverley 's . Enter Mary Anne , followed by Uncle Timothy , C. Mary . Mary Anne What name shall I say , sir ? Uncle T. Uncle Timothy Oh , ah ! yes  --  nobody  --  anybody . Just say he 's wanted , that 's all . Mary . Mary Anne Hem ! Gentleman from the rural districts . Exit , R. 2 E. Uncle T. Uncle Timothy Now look at this house : who could n't tell at a glance that the beautifying influence of a wife made this home a very nest of comfort and happiness ? bless my soul what a deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , how it 's generally arrived at I have n't the remotest idea ; phew , the very thought sets me in a flame ! I 'm on the road now , though ; where 's the paper ? ah , here  --  here is the fiat of my fate , the first step towards connubiality made easy . " Romeo will be at Mr. W. 's office at twelve to-morrow . " I 'm Romeo , kindly assisted in the pursuit of some anonymous Juliet by this benevolent mouthpiece of the diffident . ( takes out letter and reads ) " Dr. Savage , No. 34  --  Eh , bless me , here 's Herbert ! ( thrusts letter into his pocket ) Enter Herbert , R. 2 E. Herb . Herbert Waverly Why , Uncle Timothy , is it you ? Uncle T. Uncle Timothy ( L. ) Yes , my boy , it 's Uncle Timothy , come to town incog , like a Crown Prince . Glad to see you . How 's Julia ? Herb . Herbert Waverly In excellent health , and charming as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , happy dog . Herb . Herbert Waverly Yes , happy ; very , very happy . ( seriously ) Uncle T. Uncle Timothy Anybody can see that . Aha , it 's the only true felicity , my boy . I envy you , Herbert , upon my life I do . What 's the use of all the enjoyment the world can procure if you have to lock it up in your own chest ? It wo n't keep sweet unless it can get air , unless you can give it to somebody to take care of it for you , and even then you must take it out occasionally , like very good clothes , for fear the moth should get into it ; toss it to and fro , from one to the other  --  I do n't mean ridiculously , like overgrown children with a toy that might be lost or broken in the operation , but like a delicate gem whose lustre should only be renewed by your own hands . Why you 'll forget you ever possessed it if you stowed it away in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question ingenuously ? Herb . Herbert Waverly Yes , uncle , if I can . Uncle T. Uncle Timothy Do you think  --  now promise me that you wo n't laugh  --  do you think I  --  look at me well  --  that I 'm , hang it , I ca n't go on , that I 'm  --  I 'm too old to marry . Phew ! Herb . Herbert Waverly Certainly not , sir , if  --  Uncle T. Uncle Timothy Yes , yes , I know , if I could find anybody to marry me . Herb . Herbert Waverly I was about to say , if your inclination led you in that direction . Uncle . Uncle Timorthy It is n't likely I would , you know , unless it did . Herb . Herbert Waverly May I ask you in return , sir , have you any such inclination ? Uncle . Uncle Timorthy Well , yes  --  no  --  I mean it depends a good deal on circumstances . Herb . Herbert Waverly What circumstances ? Uncle . Uncle Timorthy Never you mind , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that you never thought of it before . Uncle . Uncle Timorthy How do you know I never thought of it ? I have , my boy , dozens of times . Whenever I saw a truly happy couple , I was instantly inoculated with the infection , and looked about me eagerly to find a desirable partner , but before I could call up courage enough to ask the definite question , some accidental scene of domestic disquiet would be sure to send me back into my shell like a frightened snail . Herb . Herbert Waverly This visit of yours is somewhat unexpected , uncle . Uncle . Uncle Timorthy Yes , my boy , I 'll tell you how it happened  --  Sister Patience and I were invited to a wedding about a month ago , and the delight of the young people made me feel so like a malefactor that I resolved to put a speedy end to my bachelor days . Now , our village is not an extensive place for matrimonial operations , and Patience is as watchful as a lynx , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll see what , by-and-bye. ( about to take a letter out ) Herb . Herbert Waverly Is Aunt Patience with you ? Uncle . Uncle Timorthy ( looking round ) Bless me , no ; since she lost her husband , old Crabsticke , and came to live with me , I have received the full benefit of her domestic experience . She used to worry the poor old fellow to the verge of lunacy , and now ca n't get rid of the old habit , and certainly does contrive to keep me in a blessed state of tribulation . Think of that , my boy  --  to have all the aggravating irritabilities of a duplicated existence without any of its little comforts , is n't it too bad . Why , what 's the matter with you , Herbert , you 're looking pale ? Herb . Herbert Waverly With me ?  --  nothing , sir ; never felt better in all my life . Uncle . Uncle Timorthy Anything amiss between you and Julia ? Herb . Herbert Waverly Certainly not , sir . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Timorthy I do n't know  --  partly on my own account ; for , if my present resolution could be shaken , that , I think , would demolish it effectually . Enter Mrs. Herbert , L. 2 E. Herb . Herbert Waverly Apropos ! here she comes to answer for herself . ( aside ) This state of dissimulation and suspense is maddening . Mrs. H. Mrs. Herbert Waverly ( on seeing Herbert , changes her manner ) Herbert here still ! Why , I thought you had gone out , dear . Herb . Herbert Waverly No , my love ; Uncle Timothy here , intercepted me . Mrs. H. Mrs. Herbert Waverly My dear uncle , I 'm glad to see you ! Uncle . Uncle Timorthy ( crosses to her ) As I am , my little darling pet , to see you , believe me .

There 's something wrong between you two . Mrs. H. Mrs. Herbert Waverly Together My dear uncle , no , no . Herb . Herbert Waverly Together Not at all ; you 're in error , sir . Uncle T.

Herbert Waverly ( sits ) What , my dear uncle , would you rather live a clockwork life , using your heart 's machinery for no better purpose than to tick off the passing hours . Give me the extremes of joy and grief instead : and I wo n't allow you to mock your kindly disposition so far as to speak harshly of a state whose very anxieties spring often from an excess of happiness . Uncle T. Uncle Timothy I think I could contrive to do without the surplus . Herb .

Uncle Timothy And then if it should turn out counterfeit , it would be too late for anything but the pleasant consciousness of having cheated yourself  --  doomed , moreover to have the consequence of your rashness tied about your neck  --  a heap of spurious coin that you can neither change nor fling away . Herb . Herbert Waverly Ah , believe me sir , the real prize , though rare , if once obtained , is worth the risk . Uncle T. Uncle Timothy ( coming to Herbert ) Do you really think so , Herbert ?

Herbert Waverly Oh , do n't look absurdly indignant at me ! it 's the usual part played by the wily profligate  --  the hectoring bluster , which is the only resource left to the discovered traitor .

Pinchbeck Yes ; I expect the carriage at the end of the street shortly . She is quietly to steal out of the house , then off we are all together on the road to happiness . Uncle T.

The bearer of this not knowing you , I , following an irresistible impulse , told him I was Dr. Savage , in the hope of averting so great a calamity , if necessary , by the sacrifice of myself . Dr. S. Doctor Savage You have been very considerate , I must say ; but , do n't be alarmed , there will be no necessity for any such exhibition of disinterested bravery  --  all will be settled when I see Herbert .

Fanny is suffering under a savage attack of jealousy , and to appease her I must now inform this poor woman , who has , heaven knows how , conceived so violent a passion for me , that she must be content to pine in misery , as , of course , she will  --  ah , here they both come ; stern duty triumphs over delicacy  --  phychologic surgery should be sharp and decided .

Never , sir , can I banish that beloved image from my heart . Mrs. S. Mrs. Doctor Savage There , sir . Dr. S. Doctor Savage What , madam , when I tell you emphatically that this ridiculous passion is not in the remotest degree reciprocated ? Mrs. H. Mrs. Herbert Waverly It well becomes you , my husband 's friend , to tell me that . Dr. S. Doctor Savage Confound it , madam , it 's because I am his friend I 'm forced to be thus explicit . Mrs. H.

Mrs. Herbert Waverly Very well , sir , be it so  --  you shall find that I have sufficient pride to sustain me  --  even in this trial of my fortitude and temper  --  and however my husband 's alienated love may fill my after life with sorrow , it can not equal the contempt and scorn with which I shall remember one who , dead to every principle of honor or humanity , adds thus the crowning grief to my great misery .

Doctor Savage Hurrah , it 's all serene  --  the clouds are clearing away rapidly , I must insist upon embracing you both . Listen : in an unlucky moment , it was agreed between Herbert and me  --  agitated and distressed at a sorrow which , I must say , you very clumsily endeavoured to conceal , that I should try the self-same mode of treatment suggested by my little woman . I ought to have foreseen the inevitable result , for we always think alike , do n't we , dear ? Mrs. S. Mrs. Doctor Savage I think you 've been a very great fool . Dr. S.

Exeunt all into room , R. , but Timothy . Enter Pinchbeck and Widow Crabsticke , C. Pinch . Pinchbeck Ah , sir ! arrived before me , I perceive . Uncle T.
