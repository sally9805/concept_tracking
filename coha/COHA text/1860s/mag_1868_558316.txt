txt ART . VI . - Essays on a Liberal Education . Edited by REV . F. W. FARRAR , M. A. , F. R. S. London : Macmillan &amp; Co. 186T . EARLY in the last century Sir William Temple declared that literature is constantly degenerating , and that the oldest books are always the best . Not only is Homer the greatest of poets and ? sop the wittiest of fabulists , but Phalaris was a letter-writer with whom Pascal and Madame S6vign6 are not fit to be compared . Thus wrote Sir W. Temple , much to his own satisfaction and to the edification of many of his contemporaries . But lapse of time and change of circumstance brings about signal alterations in the opinions of men . The other day Dr. J. W. Draper - in a book entitled " Civil Policy of America , " and made up chiefly of disconnected statements about physical geography , Arabian chemists , and Jewish physicians - told us that " the grand depositories // of human knowledge are not the ancient , but the modern tongues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing that are to be exclusively obtained by a knowledge of Latin and Greek . " And doubtless this amusing statement will in some quarters meet with as much applause as the loose assertions of Temple met with in their time . For this old controversy about the comparative merits of the ancients and the moderns has been lately resuscitated , though in somewhat altered shape . Times have changed ; and what in the eighteenth century was considered good meat for strong men we should now regard as but indifferent milk for babes . We therefore no longer idly argue about the comparative amount of genius possessed by ancient and by modern writers ; but we dispute quite zealously , and with sufficient one-sidedness , over the comparative value of ancient literature and modern science as means of mental discipline and branches of liberal education . University reform is a favorite subject of discussion . And among the multiplicity of things that may be taught under a reformed scheme of education , the problem of what must be taught is pressing ever more strongly for a definite solution . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable prejudices of the inquirers . One of the main obstacles in the way of a speedy and amicable settlement of the question arises from the fact that physical investigators as a class have no well-defined idea of the benefits to be derived from classical studies , while classical scholars and literary men are too generally ignorant of the value of physical science as a means of training the intellect . Our opinions reflect our experience with tolerable accuracy , and we can hardly be expected to have a very lively sense of the worth of pursuits in which we have never heartily engaged . So deep-seated at present is the incapacity of our " ancients " and " moderns " to understand each other , that when a man of catholic culture like Mr. Mill presents both sides of the case with equal force , we find either party disposed to rely upon one half of his argument , while ignoring or disparaging the other half . Dr. Youmans , for example , in the Introduction to his valuable collection of essays on " Modern Culture , " having quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks // it but fair to add that the same discourse contains a vigorous argument for the classics . " But while , " says Dr. Youmans , " Mr. Mill urges the importance of scientific studies for all , an examination of his argument for the classics will show that it is applicable only to those who , like himself , are professional scholars , and devote their lives to philological , historical , or critical studies . " Now , possibly Mr. Mill ought to have limited his argument in this way ; but he certainly has not done so . He makes no such distinction : nowhere does he even faintly intimate that he is not putting one class of studies upon the same footing as the other .. His whole magnificent Discourse is devoted to showing the urgent necessity which exists for a well-planned scheme of education in which both kinds of learning shall be recognized . He believes that there is no reason , except the stupidity of instructors , why classics and the sciences should not both be taught ; and he holds that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind us to the claims of the other . In view of this , it is pleasant to meet with a book , written chiefly by classical scholars who have taken university honors , in which the just claims of physical science and the shortcomings of a merely fiterary education are adequately recognized . The writers of the nine essays forming the volume now under consideration are all graduates of Cambridge , and all but one have at one time or another obtained fellowships in that University . Most of them , therefore , may be presumed to be moderately acquainted with ancient lit.rature , and to some extent sensible of the advantages attending the study of it . The editor , Mr. Farrar , has devoted a large part of his time to philological studies , and has written a treatise on Greek syntax , besides two volumes on the origin and development of language , all of which are works of considerable philosophical merit , though not perhaps of the highest and most accurate scholarship . Of the other writers , two at least - Professor Seeley and Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture and trained judgment . The opinions of such men upon the subject of classical education are entitled to respectful consideration ; and when we find among them the most complete unanimity in the decla // ration that a large part of the classical instruction now given in English universities is utterly worthless , and ought to be replaced by a course in physical science , we can not set aside the judgment on the plea of ignorant prejudice . Let not Philistinism clap its hands too hastily , however ; for the object of this Cambridge book is , not to supersede , but to complement , classical studies . It declares , not against the study of antiquity ( Altert/iurnswissenschaft ) , but against the pedantry with which that study is now carried on ; and one of the ablest essays in the volume is devoted to showing that physical science is habitually taught with quite as much pedantry as any branch of ancient learning . The long career of irrational stultification , through defect in the method of instruction , is usually begun in our schooldays . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elementary geography , we are expected duly to learn their *ourses . Many countries are intersected , or are parted from their neighbors , by chains of mountains ; and this second class of facts we are likewise called upon to master . But we are not told that the two sets of phenomena are inseparably related . We are not told that , since all rivers must run down hill , therefore their positions and courses must depend upon the position of mountains , so that by knowing the latter we may be helped to the knowledge of the former . We are required to learn these facts as they stand in the elementary text-books , in " godlike isolation . " We are compelled to take in a host of details by a sheer effort of unintelligent memory , while the process of association , by appealing to which alone is memory made serviceable , is appealed to as little as possible . So in grammar , when by dint of irksome mechanical repetition we have become able to state that " a verb must agree with its nominative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bare fact , which , apart from its explanation , is a useless fact ; and that it has or admits of any explanation we are rarely led to suspect . In approaching foreign languages we become immersed still deeper in the mire of elementary unintelligibility . We commit to memory scores of intricate paradigms , containing all possible forms of the noun or verb , before we have been introduced to a // 1868 . Liberal Education . single sentence in which these forms are presented . In mute dismay we contemplate ingeniously framed rules of syntax , before we have been shown a glimpse of the facts upon which these rules depend . We get . the generalization before the particulars , the abstract before the concrete ; we learn to repeat formulas before we have the notions needful for filling them . As a natural result , our Latin and Greek seem very difficult . To euhanc* our perplexity , the same thing is generally introduced to us under different names , or , quite as often , different things under the same name . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next that it likewise denotes origin , and again that it denotes separation . We are informed that the Latin genitive , primarily denoting possession , may however , if of the first or second declension and singular number , be used to signify place , an idea conveyed by the ablative also , which for the time being kindly neglects its proper function of expressing removal . The genitive , moreover , may express one kind of resemblance , another kind being , by a mysterious dispensation of Providence , indicated by the dative . Even if all these cumbrous rules for learning ancient languages were correct , instead of being many of them inaccurate , and nearly all of them antiquated , they would still be worse than useless to the young student . Thrust into his mind as they are , before he has had concrete examples of them , they are utterly meaningless . He knows not how or where to apply them . They serve only to confuse and discourage him . Nor are matters mended much when we begin to do what we should all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read . We read a few sentences each day , parsing as we go along , according to the inexplicable rules just referred to , and paying little or no attention to the meaning of our author . Seldom do we read a sufficient mass of matter consecutively to have the language take any hold upon us . Thus we read Aristophanes , and hardly suspect his consummate and irresistible humor . We read Pemosthenes , and remain ignorant of Athenian politics . And a few years after leaving college we are able , by dint of much thumbing of the dictionary , and with occasional reference to the grammar , to pick out the meaning of Latin and Greek sentences . This is too often the sorry result which is dignified by the name of a classical education . // Yet perhaps our scientific education , as at present carried on by means of text-books , is not much better . We take up a book on physics , and are told that the Newtonian theory is still one of the great ri ' *al theories of light , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cei*tury . We take up a book on astronomy , and are told that the earth is 95,000,000 miles distant from the sun , although the researches of M. Foucault have shown that the distance is only 91,000,000 . We take up a book on physiology , and read about " a vital principle which suspends natural laws , " although every competent physiologist well knows that any such " principle " is as much a distorted figment of the fancy as the basilisks which in old times were supposed to haunt secluded cellars . We hear grave lectures on psychology , in which the systems of Locke or Kant are laboriously expounded , while of the recent innovations made by writers like Bain and Maudsley we get not the slightest hint . So in history and philology we are too often taught as if Mommsen and Grote had never written . Grimm 's magnificent researches , throwing light upon the whole structure of language , and presenting the history of human thought under an entirely new aspect , are non-existent to the mind of the student . He pursues the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. C. Lewis , and sees no absurdity in the mythological theories of Euhemeros . Now it seems to us that the reform which is most urgently needed in our system of liberal education consists not in the substitution of one branch of studies for another so much as in the more liberal , rational , and intelligent pursuit of various branches . In the main , fairness of mind , accuracy of judgment , and shrewdness of perception are to be secured as much by one kind of research as by another kind . The alleged narrowness and torpidity - the " Kronian " characteristics ( to use an Aristophanic word ) - of classical scholars are due far more to the irrational method in which they have pursued their studies than to those studies themselves . Let the student really fathom who Julius Caesar was , what he thought , what he did , wherein he differed from Cato or Pompey , why his policy succeeded , and what its effects have been upon all subsequent generations down to our time , - let him duly fathom all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good a political education as a man needs to have . Let him , again , justly estimate the value of ancient chronology ; let him once have critically examined the works of Bunsen and Lepsius until he has fairly detected their weak points , and he will be as little likely to surrender himself to any current delusion as the man who has studied astronomy or chemistry . The real difficulty is , that our schenie of classical education does not provide for any adequate knowledge , even of classical subjects . Its energies are entirely devoted , during eight or ten years , to the imperfect acquirement of two languages which ought to be very well learned in four or five ; and then no time is left for anything else . Our system of classical education his come down to us from the close of the Middle Ages , - from a time when nearly all that was valuable in literature was to be found in the writings of ancient authors . Until toward their close , the Middle Ages had accomplished little in literature worthy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antiquity . And when , in the fifteenth century , the expulsion of Greeks from Constantinople and the invention of printing brought about the rapid dissemination of ancient literature among people at last socially prepared to welcome it , the effect was as if a new continent had been opened to view in the mental world as vast and inviting as that discovered by Columbus beyond the Atlantic . The exploration of the one was carried on as keenly as that of the other . For a long time there could be no better or more profitable study than that of ancient literature . Before a new career of progress could be inaugurated , old forgotten acquisitions must be recovered and earnestly studied in the light of new political , social , and intellectual circumstances . Accordingly in those days there were classical scholars of gigantic calibre . From the fifteenth to the seventeenth century we have the names of Erasmus , Buda3us , the Scaligers , Gro*ius , Reuchlin , Salmasius , Casaubon , Lipsius , Selden , Bentley , and iluet , representatives of a mighty and astonishing style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper social conditions , will never be seen again . Phi* losophers , like Bacon , Descartes , and Leibnitz , bent upon mas // tering the sum of human knowledge , could do no better than to read with critical eyes the writings of Plato and Aristotle . In light literature , as represented by Rabelais , Montaigne , Ben Jonson , and Burton , classical learning was equally conspicuous . And in social intercourse Latin , and to some extent Greek , held the place since usurped by French and other modern tongues . While modern languages were but little studied , the common dialect of educated Europeans was formed by the tongues of antiquity . These languages were therefore learned to be written and spoken , not to be dozed over , dabbled in , and forgotten . They were learned in the natural way , by concrete examples , and by assiduous practice , not out of grammars bristling with inexplicable abstractions . Homer and Virgil were read for their literary interest , not as the text for monotonous parsing-lessons and useless disquisitions on syllabic quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrated by Mr. Parker in the first essay contained in the volume before us . We have not space to rehearse the interesting details which are there given , but must call attention to the striking remarks of Mr. Farrar and Professor Seeley upon the method of teaching the classics now prevalent in the English universities . Mr. Farrar 's essay is devoted to exposing the worthlessness of Greek and Latin versemaking as a means of culture . If there be in our day , says Mr. Farrar , any kind of achievement which is at once impossible to do and useless when done , it is the writing of good Latin or Greek verses . Our American universities , so far as we know , do not require it to be done : Once ' in a while they encourage students to attempt these nugce d*fficiles , in the hope of obtaining prize* or a college reputation , in case of success . But in our best colleges any student can graduate , and most do graduate , without ever having written Latin or Greek except in more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many quarters a queer superstition , that the chief end of classical education is to enable its votaries to beguile their leisure hours by stringing together hexameters . As the result of this system , we have some pretty poems in the " Arundines Cami , " Mr. D'Arcy // 1868 . Liberal Education . Thompson 's " Prolusiones llomeric* , " Lord Lyttelton 's " Samson Agonistes , " and many hundred reams of detestable trash , written dohbtless in a dialect such as Aristophanes would hardly have thought fit for the silliest geese and cockatoos of his Cloudcuckooville . In the time now wasted in verse composition in each college career , the methods and leading results of several physical sciences might easily be learned . This is the kind of " instruction " which our essayists would be glad to see done away with . They hold that the chief end of classical education is , beside affording scope for the exercise of sagacity in reasoning , to enlarge our minds by making us acquainted with the ideas , feelings , and customs of a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . The man who thoroughly knows Altertltumswissenschaft , or the science of Greek and Roman antiquity , differs from the man who does not , in much the same way that the man who has travelled all over the world with his eyes open differs from the man whose knowledge of the world is limited to what is going on in his own village . But how a knowledge of ancient civilization is to be got by vain attempts to imitate the diction of Ovid or Theokritos it would be difficult to say . The proposal to study the life of modern Germany , to get an accurate idea of its political and social condition , its literature , its domestic habits , its contributions to human improvement , and the predominant sentiments which actuate its people , by writing quatrains in imitation of the hymns in " Faust , " would be saluted with peals of inextinguishable laughter . Yet it would be about as sensible as the method of studying antiquity adopted by the verse-makers . The subject of verse-making , as we have said , does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , England being alone among civilized nations in the importance which it attaches to this pursuit . But though our schools and colleges do not require the writing of verses , they , often waste a great deal of time and energy in teaching the rules of prosody , as well as by the cumbrous and inefficient method in which they conduct classical instruction in general , and particularly by their habit of beginning at the wrong end . We learn French and German with ease , because we begin with concrete examples . In studying // Latin and Greek , on the other hand , we begin with abstract rules , and are not seldom compelled to memorize what we can not understand . Hence the difficulties under which we labor are so great that , by the time they are conquered , we have too often neither leisure nor interest left for other studies . By this process the mind is in many cases stupefied rather than quickened ; and the system , far from producing liberally educated men , fails even to produce good classical scholars . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ancient or modern , is to learn them as we learn our own in childhood . We can not indeed have Greek and Roman nurses , but we can at least have the living phenomena of language presented to our minds , instead of the dead formulas of grammar . If this natural method were to be duly inaugurated , we believe that Greek and Latin might be thoroughly learned in one third of the time now spent in learning them superficially . We should again have excellent ilellenists and Latinists , - not , perhaps , scholars like Erasmus and Scaliger , for we no longer need them , and Donaldson 's notion that learned works should still be written in Latin may safely be pronounced a chimera , - but we should have men among us capable of reading ancient literature with ease and pleasure , men capable of extracting from it an amount of historical and philosophical knowledge to which the great scholars of the Renaissance were utter strangers . The scholarship of the present day is necessarily of a quite different type from that of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , political , and historical science . Its ideal consists in the thorough knowledge of ancient life , manners , moral ideas , and superstitions , as an essential part of the whole history of mankind . Its representatives are men like Grote , Littr6 , and Mommsen . Properly pursued , it enlarges our sympathies , shows us the people of bygone times as men like ourselves , alike yet different , actuated by like passions , but guided by different opinions and different conceptions . It forbids us to judge of them by the standard of our own age ; it corrects the prejudices inseparable from ignorance of history ; it gives us lessons in political conduct ; it makes us cosmopolitan and hospitable in mind . These are reasons why classical learning should not be given up . They // are reasons why it will never be given up , but will be rationalized in its method and extended in its province . To illustrate more fully what is meant by saying that the proper way to teach is to begin with the concrete , we shall take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been skilfully treated by Mr. Wilson , in his contribution to the present volume . His essay shows that science is often quite as cumbrously taught as the classics ; but it also shows how it ought to be taught . Botany and experimental physics , according to Mr. Wilson , are of all branches of science the most interesting and the most intellectually profitable to children . Let us suppose , then , that we have a class of moderately intelligent children to start in botany : how shall we begin the subject in order that it may be made at once interesting and intellectually profitable ? Text-books will not help us much . For instance , Dr. Gray 's excellent little book , " How Plants Grow , " begins as follows : - " Plants are chiefly made up of three parts , namely , of root , stem , and leaves . These are called the plant 's organs ; that is , its instruments . And as these parts are all that any plant needs for its growth , or vegetation , they are ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers , from which comes the fruit , and from this the seed . These take no part in nourishing the plant . Their use is to enable it to give rise to new individuals , which increase the numbers of that kind of plant , to take the place of the parent in due time , and keep up the stock ; that is , to reproduce and perpetuate the species . So the flower , with its parts , the fruit and the seed , are called the plant 's ORGANS OF REPRODUCTION . " Now this is very pleasant reading for grown people , who know something about the subject , are slightly familiar with the conceptions of nutrition , heredity , and genesis , and have learned , however rudely , to classify their notions . But for boys and girls who begin botany at the age when it ought to be begun , this would be neither pleasant nor p#ofitable . If set to learn the above passage by rote , in the ordinary way , they would be likely to find it irksome , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expressions employed // in it . And , above all , those who learned their lesson would have taken the first step towards acquiring the pernicious habit of accepting statements upon authority . If questioned concerning their grounds for believing that the organs of vegetation in a plant are its root , stem , and leaves , they would perforce reply that they believed it because it was so written in the book . Here is the fatal vice of our common methods of education . They appeal to faith , and not to reason . It is supposed that children are properly instructed if they are told that certain things are so and so , and understand what is told them sufficiently to repeat the words of it . Nothing can be more erroneous . No. mental discipline , worthy of the name , can be secured in this way . We are benefited , not by the truths which we passively accept , but by those which we actively find out . It makes little difference whether a child is told that " a plant consists of root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a verb must agree with its nominative case in number and person . " The former proposition is the more intelligible ; but in either case the child is taught to accept on authority a generalization which lie should be taught to make for himself from a due comparison of instances . With the traditional let us now contrast the rational method of studyiiig botany . We can not possibly do this better than in Mr. Wilson 's own words : - " Suppose , then , your class of thirty or forty boys before you , as they sit at their first botanical lesson : some curious to know what is going to happen , some resigned to anything , some convinced that it is all a folly . You hand round to each boy several specimens , say of the herb Robert ; and taking one of the flowers , you ask one of them to describe the parts of it . Some pink leaves , ' is the reply . How many ? Five . ' Any other parts ? Some little things inside . ' Anything outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Five . ' Very good . Now pull off the five green leaves outside , and lay them side by side ; next pull off the five pink leaves , and lay them side by side ; and now examine the little things inside : what do you find ? ' A lot of little stalks or things . ' Pull them off , and count them . ' They find ten . Then show them the little dust-bags at the top , and finally the curiously constructed central column , and the carefully concealed seeds . By this time , all are on the alert . Then we re*iime : The parts in that flower are , outer green envelope , inner colored envel . S // ope , the little stalks with dust-bags , and the central column with the seeds . Then you give them all wall-flowers r and they are to write down what they find . By the end of the hour they have learned one great lesson ,  --  the existence of the four floral whorls , though they have not yet heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the students are making their own way . They are not told that a flower consists of four whorls , but they find it out for themselves , and know it henceforth on the evidence of their own senses . If they were to see or hear the fact disputed , they would be incredulous ; they would no longer bow to authority . In the next place , they are gaining ideas before they are dosed with words . They are not wasting their energies in conning half-understood formulas about sepals , petals , stamens , and pistils ; but they take note of the green leaves , the pink leaves , the stems with dust-bags , and the column with seeds in it ; and by and by they find it convenient to describe these things by one word for each , thus avoiding circumlocution and waste of breath . In this way the terms calyx , corolla , etc. , come to have a definite meaning ; and are in no danger of being used emptily , without reference to the ideas which they ought to convey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words without regard to their full connotation and exact meaning ; and for this our systems of early education are in part responsible . It should be recognized as an inflexible rule , that the student is not to be taught to use a word until he feels the need of it in order to express his ideas more readily . Next , Mr. Wilson would let his pupils guess about the uses of the parts of the flower , - what the green leaves are for , what the central column is for , what the dust-bags are for ; and would tell them just enough to help them to hit upon the answer . Then he would give them an unsymmetrical flower , like the pelargonium or the garden geranium , which , on picking to pieces , they would discover to be formed on the same general plan . Then would come the daisy and dandelion , where the outer green envelope and the little dust-bags are not so easy to find . Then he would call attention to the spiral arrangement ef leaves ; the overlapping of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and from this to Goethe 's // magnificent generalizations there would be but , a step , and that a step easy to be taken . " Taught in this way , whatever flower a boy sees , after a few lessons , he looks at with interest , as modifying the view of flowers he has attained to . He is tempted by his discoveries : he is on the verge of the unknown , and perpetually transferring to the known . All that he sees finds a place in his theories , and in turn reacts upon them , for his theories are growing . He is fairly committed to the struggle in the vast field of observation , and he learns that the test of a theory is its power of including facts . He learns that he must use his eyes and his reason , and that then he is equipped with all that is necessary for discovering truth . He learns that he is capable of judging of other people 's views , and of forming an opinion of his own . He learns that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that he owes only temporary allegiance to the doctrines of his master , and not a perpetual faith . " Only contrast this with the common practice of loading a boy 's memory with cellules and parenchyma , protoplasm and chlorophyll , rhizomes and bulbs , endosmose and exosmose , before he has any definite and abiding conception of how a plant is put together ! Mr. Wilson 's method carries with it its own recommendation ; and his method of teaching botany is the method upon which all teaching , if it is to discipline the intelligence , should be conducted . First the facts , then the generalization , lastly the nomenclature . All the knowledge which in the conduct of life we are able to use to any good purpose is necessarily acquired in this way . If we had no knowledge of human nature save what might be gained by the memorizing of abstract ethical formulas , we should never acquire the knack of dealing sensibly with our fellow-creatures . But we notice how men act under given circumstances : day by day , and year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation into general opinions , crude indeed as compared with the exhaustive generalizations of physical science , yet as far as they go embodying the results of genuine experience . Thus our knowledge of men gradually acquires the accuracy and precision needful , in order that we may act upon it securely . In gathering such knowledge , - in learning how to // live rightly , - our early education ought to help us . Reasoning is reasoning , and its canons are substantially the same , whether flowers , or triangles , or participles , or human nature constitute the matter reasoned about . By reasoning out what we know , we make knowledge lead to wisdom ; we become civilized as we grow older . If the vast body of truths constituting modern science could have been miraculously told to our medieval ancestors , an imposing quantity of pretentious scholarship might have been called into existence , but the world would not have become civilized much the sooner . It is the conscious effort put forth in making all these discoveries which has worked the profound modification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after toilfully elaborating the laws of gravitation and chemical affinity , remain as barbarous and untutored as before . This was in part what Lessing had in his mind , when he said that if God were to hold in his right hand perfect truth , and in his left hand the untiring search for truth , he would unhesitatingly choose the latter . It is upon discovery , not upon rote-learning , that humanity has thrived . And if- to adopt another idea of that incompara ble man - civilization is but the education of the race , it is after the course of civilization that a rational course of education should in miniature be patterned . To Professor Seeley 's excellent essay on Competitive Tests we can only briefly allude . The state of things at Cambridge which it describes is exceedingly instructive . At Cambridge , if anywhere in the world , the system of competition has been put to a crucial test . The examinations are formidable , alike from their severity and from their rigid accuracy . Immense rewards await the successful scholar , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disposal of the ambitious student . Yet the results thus far obtained from the competitive system are by no means brilliant . It does not apparently increase the number of eminent scholars , or even of thoroughly educated men , produced by the University . The complaint is even made that England has ceased to produce great scholars ; that in point of erudition she is falling behind the Continental nations ; and it is frequently remarked as a significant fact , that the most learned of Englishmen in the // present age - men like Garnett and Grote - have not been educated at the universities . But this accusation is exaggerated and somewhat irrelevant ; for the competitive system is a very modern institution , and the great scholars just mentioned are in no way the contemporaries of those brought up under it . Yet , if we are to reason in this way , it must be said that England has no cause to be ashamed of the array of illustrious scholars which she has to show for the nineteenth century . And most of them have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at least with credit . It is not so much , however , by the number of great scholars which it turns out , as by the general standard of intelligence among its graduates , that the system of a university is to be judged . A man who lives to edit Lucretius or Aristotle , as Mr. Munro and Sir A. Grant have done , will most likely in his college days study for the sake of study , and the competitive or any other system can exert but a transient effect upon him . The English universities afford great facilities to a young man who desires to study in earnest , and is already a scholar in embryo . But the question which here especially concerns us is , What is the worth of the competitive system now in use as a wholesome incentive to the average young man who does nut passionately love knowledge for its own sake ? - does it tend to widen and render more thorough the education which he will get at the university ? Experience is beginning to tell us plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men in the English universities is narrowed and rendered more superficial by the competitive system . Whatever results may be brought forth by comparing the lists of great scholars which England and the Continental nations can respectively furnish , there can be no doubt that the average college graduate in France or Germany attains to a far higher degree of knowledge and culture than the average graduate of Oxford or Cambridge . He does not ordinarily manifest that preternatural ignorance of everything except the classics which characterizes the English student . And his study of the classics has usually enriched him with a more or less valuable stock of literary , critical , and philosophical ideas , which the Englishman , absorbed in verse-writing and prize-getting , has never caught // sight of . He knows a greater number of authors , and he knows them to more profit . Now for this superficiality and narrowness of English education the competitive system is directly responsible . It transforms the means into the end . It makes the student think more of winning the prize than of mastering the subject in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is all the difference in the world between mastering a subject and making a brilliant show with it at an examination every scholar well knows . Professor Seeley has graphically described the results of the system at Cambridge . The object of the tripos examinations being to distinguish accurately the merit of the students , it follows that those subjects in which attainments can be tested with precision take precedence of subjects in which they can not . These latter subjects , " however important they may be , gradually cease to be valued or taught or learned , while the former come into repute , and acquire an artificial value . This can not take place without an extraordinary perversion of views both in the taught and the teachers . They learn to weigh the sciences in a perfectly new scale , and one which gives perfectly new results . They reject as worthless for educational purposes the greatest questions which can occupy the human mind , and attach unbounded importance to some of the least . " Philosophy , for instance , is rejected , while the useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the one hand , young men may graduate with signal honor , and yet never know what great principles were at stake in the Peloponnesian War ; while , on the other hand , these same young men are taught to be " ashamed of falling short of perfect knowledge in the genders of Latin nouns , which involve no principles at all , and in which a minute accuracy can hardly be attained without a certain frivolity or eccentricity of mem- , ory * " Still worse , the competitive system vulgarizes the mind of the student . Scholarly enthusiasm , an exalted opinion of the value of knowledge , faith in culture as such , - " divine curiosity , " in a word , - should be the student 's incentives to labor . These are the only motives which can ever lead to any culture worthy of the name . The competitive system tends to destroy // these motives , replacing them by the vulgar desire to outshine one 's companions . " Instead of ' enlarging the range of ' the student 's anticipations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future life , rega rdle*s of his higher interests , and concentrates all his thoughts upon the paltry examination upon which perh4s a fellowship depends , or success in some profession is supposed to depend . It is well known that any one who asks himself the question , Is this course of study good for me ? does it favor my real progress , my ultimate success ? ' is not fit for the tripos . Thinking of any kind is regarded as dangerous . It is the well-known saying of a Cambridge private tutor : If So-and-so did not think so much , he might do very well . ' I may content myself with remarking , that the particular student who did think too much , and who , perhaps asa consequence , was beaten in the tripos , now stands in scientific reputation above all his contemporaries . " An adequate examination of Professor Seeley 's arguments , and especially of the practical expedients by which he would do away with the evils just mentioned , would carry us far beyond our limits . The volume before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished with a running commen* tary . So many suggestions are made , and questions opened , in it , that any attempt to treat it thus thoroughly would end in the production of a companion volume rather than of a brief article . But from what has been said it will be seen that our essayists do not belong to the number of those who disparage classical studies as unfit for the needs of our time . The Philistinism which regards everything as useless that is not utilitarian need seek for no encouragement in this book . The claims of physical science are urged from considerations of general culture , and not of narrow utility . And for this we heartily commend the writers . There is no reason whatever why Philistinism should be allowed the exclusive protectorship of physical science . To assail or defend the study of it , while taking into account only its utilitarian aspects , is wholly to ignore the true state of the question . It is to commit a mistake like that committed by Macaulay in his eloquent but superficial essay on Bacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means subservient to objects of narrow utility . The utilitarian point of view , in the limited sense of the word , is // not at all apparent in Laplace 's explanation of the perturbed motions of the planets , in Gerhardt 's theory of atomicity , in Cuvier 's classification of animals , or in Darwin 's investigations into the principles of , variation . Indeed , that profound but somewhat chimerical writer , Auguste Comte , expressly finds fault with contemporary followers of science because they do not sufficiently confine themselves to investigations which have a perceptible bearing upon the interests of society . In his pontifical fashion , he authoritatively warns us against pursuing such useless inquiries as those which concern stellar astronomy , the cellular structure of organic beings , the origin of species , etc . But we have no fear that the investigating world will take heed of his misapplied caution . That inborn curiosity which , according to the Semitic myth , has already made us " like gods , knowing good and evil , " will continue to inspire us until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless in the untiring search we shall uncover many priceless jewels in places where we least expect to find them . The legitimate claim which science makes is , that , while drawing the mind toward investigation and activity for its own sake , it confers upon humanity unlooked-for rewards . But in order that either a literary or a scientific education shall produce worthy results , it must be rationally conducted , with a single eye to the greatest possible perfection of culture . Nothing will be gained by giving up Greek composition , and studying botany or chemistry as a mere collection of " useful " details . The adversaries of a classical and literary culture will do well to bear this in mind . It is not by throwing overboard a valuable portion of the cargo , but by adopting improved methods of navigating the ship , that we shall make a successful voyage .
