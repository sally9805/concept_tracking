txt ART . VIII . -1 . Annual Report of the Western Sanitary Cornmission for the Years ending July , 1862 , and July , 1863 . St. Louis , Mo . 2 . Circular of Mississippi Valley Sanitary Fair , to be held in St. Louis , May 17th , 1864 . Major-General W. S. RosECRANS , President . IN the article on the Sanitary Commission in our January number , our readers will have observed that the name of St. Louis , Missouri , does not appear on the roll of honor . The State is referred to , in a single line , as being the only loyal State out of the circle of sanitary allegiance . By what cause it has been thus left out does not appear . Nor is it said whether that State and city , which have been so prominent in the war for liberty , have done or attempted anything whatever in the work of humanity . Those of our readers who know nothing of the facts have probably concluded that the circumstances of peculiar difficulty under which Missouri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devastation of her territory by the Confederate invaders and guerilla bands of robbers , the destruction of her trade , the social dissensions among her own people , the prevailing " sympathy " of the wealthier classes for the Southern cause or trade , her rapid transition from slavery to freedom , changing all the relations and conduct of industrial pursuits , and the extraordinary demands upon her , // especially at the commercial metropolis , in the prosecution of civil war upon a scale of unequalled magnitude , while her resources were nearly all cut off , - that these and other causes furnish a sufficient apology for her exceptional position , which is to be regretted , but not too severely blamed . To others it is known that such apology is not needed . But probably very few are prepared to learn that St. Louis , so far from being delinquent , has stood among the foremost cities of the loyal States in the sanitary and relief departments of the war . The fact is , that , if we estimate the whole amount done by the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large central cities named in our last number , New York , Boston , Philadelphia , Baltimore , Washington , Cincinnati , Louisville , Chicago , Cleveland , Buffalo , Albany , Pittsburg , &amp;c. , - taking the estimate as made by Rev. Dr. II . W. Bellows ( Doc . 69 U. S. San . Com. ) ,  --  the distributions and expenditures by the organization known as the Western Sanitary Commission at St. Louis have risen to between one fifth and one fourth of the whole amount . Its cash receipts , if California is left out of the estimate , have been almost as great as those at Washington . It has had , with trifling exceptions , exclusive ( sanitary ) care of all the armies west of the Mississippi , from the beginning of the war until now . For the first year of the war , the time of greatest difficulty , it had almost a monopoly in fitting up and supplying hospital steamers and all other Western river work , including supplies to the gunboat flotilla on the Mississippi , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important point in the Western department . It has established soldiers ' homes in different places , in which six hundred guests , chiefly invalids and convalescents , are taken care of , as the daily average , provided with whatever help they need , and forwarded to their destination . It has labored indefatigably , and at great expense , particularly in the earlier half of the war , in the establishment of hospitals , and in providing all the necessary means for the comfort of the patients , and has shared the labors of medical directors and purveyors , of surgeons , nurses , and attendants , almost never coming into conflict with them , or receiving anything but their thanks . Under the commission of Miss D. L. Dix , it has had charge // of selecting and assigning to places of duty all female nurses in the Western Department , - a labor of great importance and difficulty , but which could not be declined . In two recent months , one hundred certificates to female nurses have been issued . Against all prejudices , and notwithstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of female nurses has steadily grown in favor , and the Western Coinmission regards them as an indispensable part of every good hospital , both in the sick-wards and in the special diet-department . By special orders of Generals Halleck and Schofield , this Commission has also had superintendence at St. Louis of the interests of the Union refugees from Rebel States , and has provided for many thousands of that unfortunate class . During the last few months , by what has seemed a providential necessity , the Freedmen 's cause has come under its care , with the cordial approval of the Secretaries of War and the Treasury , and by its prompt and efficient attention to the claims of the oppressed the most satisfactory results have been already attained . The outlay of the Western Sanitary Commission , for over two years , has averaged , in money and goods , fifty thousand dollars per month , the whole of which has gone to the direct prevention or relief of suffering , deducting one and a half per cent , which covers the total costs of all salaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal of the labor , especially the more responsible part , has been done gratuitously , and every facility has been afforded by government officers , by free transportation , " detached service , " and in every other practicable way . From St. Louis to New Orleans , from Pea Ridge to Chattanooga , by every commander of the Department of the Missouri and every general in the field , by the head of the Western Medical Department and the various medical directors , by quartermasters and transportation-masters , and all other officers , the Commission and its agents have been most kindly recognized , and have scarcely ever solicited a favor in vain . It has received far more credit from them than it could have claimed as its proper due . Its co-operation has often been asked , and never refused . Its representations of official neglect , and its suggestions of change , have been uniformly attended to , and , except where it has ignorantly violated rega // lations , or neglected proper official etiquette , no complaint or hard feeling has ever been expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West has been admirably managed for two years past . Before that time it was a divided management , without a general head . But since the reorganization of the Medical Department , by which the whole region west of the Alleghany Mountains was placed under direction of the Assistant Surgeon-General , Dr. R. C. Wood , everything has been well ordered . Probably no armies have ever been more amply or promptly provided with medical supplies than those of the West . The surgeons in field and hospital have been held to strict responsibility , and although many abuses and negligences have arisen , they have been corrected as soon as known . Comparatively few complaints of inefficiency have been heard at the West , and from the testimony of both officers and men we are satisfied that just cause of complaint has seldom been found . Dr. Wood has given the most ample proof both of mental and physical capacity , and we have known few men who have so perfectly united the suaviter in modo with the fortiter in re . The outlay , and of course the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the war began to the present time , has amounted to nearly the value of a million and a half of dollars , which has been distributed in hospitals and camps , for the purposes of prevention and cure , among all the armies of the West . In these distributions no sectional or State hues are recognized , and no discrimination for or against any one , on the ground of nationality , lineage , social position , or color , has ever beeui permitted . The Legislature of Missouri , from its exhausted finances , has contributed $ 75,000 for relief of Missouri troops , through the Commission ; but this sum has been used so as to accomplish the end without any practical discrimination being made . The money was passed into the general fund , and distributing agents were instructed that all soldiers should be treated alike , but to make such memoranda of supplies to Missouri soldiers , wherever found , as would enable them to show the amounts so expended . When the last estimates were given in , it appeared that already over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thus afforded // that an enlarged policy is always the best . It is the soldier of the Union whom we help , not the citizen of Missouri or Massachusetts . The means of helping come from all sources promiscuously , and in the same large and catholic spirit should they be expended . In one respect - we mean the sources of receipts and the manner of their collection - the experience of the Western Sanitary Commission has been remarkable , if not peculiar . It sprang from sudden exigency for relief of suffering , without opportunity to count the cost either of labor or money involved . At its first meeting , its members , a half-dozen in number , agreed to advance the small amount needed for office expenses , aimd to do without a clerk . They put notices in the St. Louis papers asking contributions , and sent a few lines to the Boston Transcript , requesting New England women to send " knit woollen socks . " Similar notices or appeals have been published from time to time , about once in six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of collection from first to last . There have been no auxiliary societies , no collectors , no systematic means of replenishing the treasury whatever . Once , however , in Boston , in January , 1863 , a number of gentlemen took the matter in hand , and in a fortnight 's time $ 35,000 was paid to Richard C. Greenleaf , Esq. , who acted as Treasurer , and was forwarded to St. Louis . He still continues to act in the same capacity . A similar action was also recently taken in St. Louis , and during the " frozen week " of last January , with the thermometer ranging from twenty degrees below zero to two degrees above , the sum of nearly $ 30,000 was collected . For the rest , whatever has come has been obtained by strictly individual action , without concert or definite plan . Perhaps one further exception should be made , of a New Eng* land lady , who in the beginning of the war set apart a room in her house as the " Missouri Room , " and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending articles to St. Louis , as fast as boxes could be filled up , she has received and forwarded goods to the amount of $17,000 , and in cash nearly as much more . Beyond this the Commission at St. Louis knows nothing of the modus operandi , or the moving causes , to which it is indebted for the continued , uninterrupted // stream of gifts by which their warehouses have been kept full and their treasury replenished . It has been a spontaneous and self-directing movement . No better proof could be given of the closeness of the ties which bind our people together , than this cordial sympathy and almost unsolicited generosity , which make for themselves channels to flow in , and only ask that their gifts may be freely used . Boston alone has sent over two hundred thousand dollars ; New England , five hundred thousand . And now a new tide of benevolence has begun to flow in the same direction for the suffering freedmen of the Mississippi valley . We earnestly hope that the current of relief for the sick and wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run full and strong . It is more blessed to give than to receive . No one can estimate the amount of good done , not less for patriotism than for humanity . The golden rule , to do as you would be done by , thus practised , will bind the East and West together in bonds that no secession or rebellion will ever disturb again . At this moment no two cities are nearer each other than St. Louis and Boston ; no two States , than Missouri and Massachusetts . This spontaneous method of supplies and total absence of system in collections may not be the best plan . On the contrary , it is evidently a very bad plan for continuousness of action , and is liable at any time to complete failure . That it has worked so well with the Western Commission is a matter of surprise . Nor was it ever adopted as a regular method , but at first caine of its own accord , and has continued because it has answered the purpose . Besides , no system of auxiliaries could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans of the United States Commission , at the risk of creating conflicting interests , aud perhaps unkind feeling . The most hateful of all jealousies and controversies are those among philanthropic or charitable associations , and their possibility should be avoided at almost any inconvenience or loss . The only course , therefore , for those whom a sort of destiny made " outsiders " seemed to be that which shaped itself ,  --  to let it be known from time to time that such a place as St. Louis " still lives , " and that working men and women can be found there who are willing to do the best they can , and that all contribu // tions sent there will be gratefully acknowledged and economically used . Thus far , this knowledge has brought the needful supplies . When it fails to do so , the work must cease . We wish it to be distinctly understood that our present writing is supplementary to the article in our January number , and in no respect controversial or antagonistic . We challenge no comparisons between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their accomplished results . We are conscious of a certain degree of ludicrousness in such a comparison , if made . It is to compare great things with small . We earnestly deprecate all rivalry or competition , or the seeming of it . We can say as much in praise of the United States Sanitary Commission as its best friends can reasonably desire , and are glad to do so . It has done an immense amount of good , and prevented an immense amount of evil . What , the army or the country could have done without it , is a question hard to answer just in proportion to our knowledge of the facts . It may well be proud of the largeness of its plans and the general faithfulness and success with which they have been carried out . Its history is coincident with that of the war , and its deeds of charity and loyalty will constitute one of the brightest chapters in the suppression of the great rebellion . It has supplied not only " butter ' * to the Medical Department and Coinmissariat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but bread and butter both , food and clothing , shelter and kindly care , to tens of thousands of those who were ready to perish . God bless them for it all ! In a few years it will be forgotten that the Western Commission had a separate existence , and whatever it may have done will fall into the general result , to swell the grand total of patriotic zeal . Imaginary lines of exclusion and separateness will disappear in the narrative . The one general fact will be all that anybody will care about , - that the . American people took care of the American army ; that , while the sons were fighting for their country 's freedom , the mothers and daughters , from women of fourscore years to little girls of five , were working with an equal patriotism at home ; that it was thus a " people 's war , " to which all classes brought their best offering and in which there were no exempts ; that it was a war of civilization against barbarism , // in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vindicated , and in which the women played their part not less nobly than the men . That is all that history will care about , and not for the agency by which the work was done . The origin of the Western Sanitary Commission was as follows . After the battle near Springfield , Missouri , August 18th , 1861 , which would have been a complete victory had Lyon lived , and was kept from the disasters of defeat by the gallantry of Schofield and others then unkiiown to fame , when all loyal men in St. Louis were anxious for the result and the disloyal were so exultant that their rejoicing could scarcely be repressed , after eight or ten days had elapsed , the sick and wounded began to be brought in . Absolutely nothing was ready for them . A large unfinished building , the new " House of Refuge , " four miles from the city , had been taken for hospital uses , but neither stoves , nor bedsteads , nor beds , nor bedding , nor food , nor nurses , nor anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night . They had been brought in wagons a hundred and twenty miles , over a rough road , by hurried marches , suffering for food and water , from Springfield to Rolla , and thence by rail to St. Louis to the station on Fourteenth Street . There , having had nothing to eat for ten hours , they were put into furniture-carts ( much better than those instruments of torture called ambulances ) and carried the remaining three miles . Bare walls , bare floors , and an empty kitchen received them ; but the kind-hearted surgeon , Bailley , did all he could to make kindness take the place of good fare . He obtained from the neighl*ors cooked food for their supper , and lost no time in getting together the various means of comfort . The poor fellows were so shattered and travel-worn that they were thankful enough to get eatable food , with the hard boards to sleep upon , and no word of complaint did we ever hear one of them utter . in the course of the week three or four hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly iinproviimg ; but so great was the difficulty of obtaining anything that was wanted , that many of the badly wounded men lay there in the same unchanged garments in which they had been brought from the battle-field three weeks before . Every day , however , made things better , aimd by the end of a month from // the first arrivals Dr. Bailley began to say that " it was not yet what he called a good hospital , but that the men were all comfortable . " In the earlier part of this experience , and to increase the working force of the Medical Department , it was suggested to General Fr*moiit to form a Civilian Commission , " under the direction of the Medical Director , " and to aid him in his work . A special order to that effect was prepared , which was signed on the same day that brought the telegram countermanding the Fr6mont proclamation of freedom , - the greatest mistake , in our opinion , then and now , that our freedom-loving President has ever made . The order had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was entirely acceptable to him . " Now , " said he , " the work may increase as fast as it pleases . " No young man could have worked with more humaiie or loyal heart than his , or with greater efficiency and success . The requisite orders were obtained from day to day for opening new hospitals , and fitting them up in proper manner , for the hiring of civilian nurses , for special laundry-arrangements , for burial of the dead , for hospital-cars on the railroad , for a convalescent hospital , and whatever else was needed under the extraordinary exigency of the times . The result was , that at the end of six weeks four large hospitals were well established , with over two thousand beds , all occupied , and with all the essential comforts that sick men require . We have heard a good deal , of indignant complaint about General Fr6mont 's " barricade , " and have no doubt that access to him was often made unnecessarily difficult . But the barricade always yielded to hospital demands , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever prevented such claims from being immediately heard and granted. * Under such fostering care , and with such harmony of action , it is no matter of surprise that , by the 1st of November , 1861 , the hospitals and hospital * We may be permitted to add , that General Fr*mont has not lost his interest in those who have suffered in the war . Since the discontinuance of his active service , he has regularly sent almost the whole of his " pay " to the writer of this article , to be used at discretion for " those that need , " - a fact which has been confidentially held , hut which can now without impropriety be mentioned . In this time of out country 's trial , we claim to belong to no party , but like to see justice done to alL // service were in as good condition , in and near St. Louis , and were doing as large a work , as in any department or district of the loyal States . At this juncture , the Commission at St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from beginning to end , with notice that official protest had been made to the Secretary of War , requesting him to vindicate his own authority ( infringed by the infringement of the authority of the United States Sanitary Commission ) by requiring General Fr6niont to rescind his order , and put the Western Commission in its proper place of subordination . At the same time , official statements had been made of the general inefficiency and negligence in the whole medical department at the West . Of course , this action of the United States Commission had been taken under great misapprehension of the facts ; and as soon as this was corrected , their action was materially modified . Secretary Cameron " had no objection to the Western gentlemen being as independent as they pleased , so long a they were under the Medical Department . " The President was of the same opinion , and things were permitted to remain in statu quo , and have remained so ever since ,  --  except that Secretary Stanton renewed and reaffirmed the order of General Fr6mont , establishing the Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of action to all the States west of the mountains , under direction as before . It has continued its labors under circumstances of greater or less difficulty , and with varying success , under the command of MajorGenerals Hahleck , Curtis , Schofield , and Rosecrans , and has helped to take care of the sick and wounded of every campaign and every battle-field and in every hospital within its range of action . It now enjoys , under orders of Major-Generals Grant , Sherman , and others , all the rights and privileges , that is to say , all the opportunities of service , which it can possibly desire . If its means to work with were quadrupled , the opportunity of using them is nowhere denied . It daily co-operates , wherever it can , with the United States Commission and its branches , with the Christian Commission , with the State organizations , and Ladies ' Union Aid societies . There is more than room enough for all to work , and more than work enough fur all to do . // Whether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reorganize as a " Branch** of the United States Commission is a question chiefly of personal interest , as to which " a great deal may be said on both sides . " Co-operation under some general plan is the essential point , and not subordination . Jndependence and individuality of action should always be kept if possible , and when lost , no excellence of system can take their place . The spirit of separation is a very different thing . In the present case , and as things stand now , we can see no reason why the two commissions should not harmonize , virtually if not nominally , into one , if any practical advantages can be thereby secured . But two or three years ago the case was very different . Then St. Louis and Missouri were in a turmoil of excitement and strife . Expected to do the work of a loyal community , not one fourth of its wealthy and influential classes were loyal . The head-quarters of the most important department in the conduct of the war , it was itself debatable ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for defence of the city were pointed at the city , to keep in awe the enemies within . The number of those who cared to be prominent , even in sanitary works , was not large ; and when the Ladies ' Union Aid Society was formed , it was almost a secret movement , upon which nine tenths of the citizens looked with disfavor or contempt . A small commission of well-known citizens , appointed by the commander and reporting directly to him , seemed the most feasible plan of action , and this was adopted . The work of each day needed to be done promptly and under orders . Often it was of a confidential nature , such as could be intrusted only to personal friends . Under circumstances of peculiar difficulty , St. Louis has done her part with the best , and has become the centre of a work of almost unequalled magnitude . Its Sanitary Commission , with its office in a single room sixteen feet square , claiming no authority and wishing for none , working for humanity rather than for history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for prisoners or refugees , for bond or free . Upon another topic of far deeper and more general interest our present limits will not permit us to speak . We refer to the past and present social and political relations of Missouri // with the loyal States , especially upon the great question of slavery and freedom . It is a subject upon which very incorrect ideas prevail , and its importance is not generally understood . In our opinion , it was the turning-point of the rebellion . When Missouri was saved , the rebellion was virtually crushed . If Missouri had been lost , even temporarily , to the Union , Kentucky would have gone too , and the plans of the Confederacy would have been completely accomplished . European recognitioii would have followed , and the whole face of affairs been changed . But we must leave this subject to a future number and to abler hands .
