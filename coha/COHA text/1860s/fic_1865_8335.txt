Child , Lydia Maria Francis , 1802-1880 : JOHN BROWN AND THE COLORED CHILD . from John Brown and the colored child ( 1865 ) Footnote : 1Kb A winter sunshine , still and bright , The Blue Hills bathed with golden light , And earth was smiling to the sky , When calmly he went forth to die . Infernal passions festered there , Where peaceful Nature looked so fair ; And fiercely , in the morning sun , Flashed glitt'ring bayonet and gun . The old man met no friendly eye , When last he looked on earth and sky ; But one small child , with timid air , Was gazing on his hoary hair . As that dark brow to his upturned , The tender heart within him yearned ; And , fondly stooping o'er her face , He kissed her for her injured race . The little one she knew not why That kind old man went forth to die ; Nor why , ' mid all that pomp and stir , He stooped to give a kiss to her . But Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did it unto me . " The golden harps then sweetly rung , And this the song the angels sung : " Who loves the poor doth love the Lord ; Earth can not dim thy bright reward : We hover o'er yon gallows high , And wait to bear thee to the sky . "
