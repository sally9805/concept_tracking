Washington City . Time  --  The night before the Battle of Manassas . Mrs. Lincoln and her son , Robert . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lincoln Robert , my darling , pray where have you been ? Robt . Robert Lincoln In fun , dear mother , chock up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw two western members have a fight ; A real gouge ; one knock 'd the other dumb ; This , tho ' he could n't speak , bit t ' other 's thumb ! The members stood around upon their chairs ; And many of them call 'd each other , liars ! Bull-headed Lovejoy banter 'd for a butt , And old Thad . Stevens shook his cloven foot ! Mrs. L. Mrs. Lincoln Oh ! scandalous ! and was your father there ? Robt . Robert Lincoln Of course he was  --  do n't he go every where ? Mrs. L. Mrs. Lincoln But what induced these men to show their spunk ? Robt . Robert Lincoln The truth is , mother , they were very drunk . Anticipating a great victory . The Representatives got on a spree ; And such a rumpus then was kick 'd up there  --  The Springfield doggeries ai n't anywhere ! Mrs. L. Mrs. Lincoln What 's the state coming to ? If this carouse Should get into the papers  --  that our House Got on a spree and fought like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democrats ! Robt . Robert Lincoln Oh ! never fear ; on whiskey they are sound ; They 're always in when liquor goes around . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lincoln Well , tell me all about it : who got hurt ? Robt . Robert Lincoln Bingham got lots of blood upon his shirt ; Lean Hickman , in the scramble , got his nose Mash 'd into jelly by some random blows ; The Speaker , Grow , express 'd his great surprise  --  ( And tried to lighten up his fallow eyes , But failed in this ) that any men should so Forget their dignity , and sink so low . At that , some fellow , with a monstrous shout Cried : " Grow insults us , we must turn him out : " Then such a scene we had ! The roaring sea , The dash of cataracts were mere mimicry To this cruption ! Until Dad , at last , Rose in the scene , like some sky-piercing mast ! His eyes so blazed , I thought they 'd burn his face ! When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thundering tones that shook the dome , he cried : " Dry up , dry up , ye slaves ! " and so , they dried ! Cromwell himself could not have done it better ! It seemed as if a universal fetter Clamp 'd every arm , while silence reigned supreme ! Each look 'd , as if awaken 'd from a dream , He was rejoiced to see the phantoms gone ! Mrs. L. Mrs. Lincoln Tell me , what follow 'd next , my darling son ? Robt . Robert Lincoln Then came the merriest scene of all , I think : They went with Mr. Grow , to get a drink ! Mrs. L. Mrs. Lincoln So ends the matter : Robert , run up stairs And go to bed  --  be sure you say your prayers . Exit Robert . I 'll wait awhile for Lincoln : he 's a bird , To quell these tempests at a single word ! So all his actions do to greatness tend ; He always plays the hero to the end ! Happy Republic ! Abram at the helm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCENE II . Chambers in the White House . Enter Robert  --  He raps at one of the chamber doors . Enter Kitty . Robt . Robert Lincoln Kitty , do n't lock your chamber door to-night ; And just at 12 o'clock , put out the light : Kitty . Kitty Oh ! Prince , be careful ! Robt . Robert Lincoln Never fear me , sweet ; I 'll creep along upon my stocking feet ! I know the ropes , and I am up to that , For I can walk much lighter than a cat . Remember , just at 12 : good bye till then . Give me a kiss ! Kitty . Kitty Take six , or eight , or ten . Exit . Robt . Robert Lincoln If I 'm a Prince , I 'll have a Prince 's fare ; And , in my four years ' princedom , take my share  --  For when that 's over , half the world will snob ;  --  And I 'll be nothing then , but simply  --  " Bob . " Raps at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln Ah ! Kate , my little witch : at one o'clock , Lower the gas ; and , that I may not knock , Just leave the door ajar ; remember , sweet , At one o'clock , precisely , we will meet . Kate . Kate At one o'clock ! ' twill be an age till then : Why not at 12 ? Robt . Robert Lincoln Dad has n't yet come in ; And he might stumble on us , in the rout ; He is so very apt to be about . Kate . Kate Well , feed your little bird , before you go . Offering her mouth . Robt . Robert Lincoln I love to feed a pouting bird , you know . Kisses her with a ringing smack , and runs off . Enter Lincoln suddenly . Lin . Mr. Lincoln Ho ! Kate , my gentle wench , what trick is this ? Kate . Kate He smells a rat . Aside . Lin . Mr. Lincoln I think I heard a kiss , Or something very like it . Kate . Kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in the wind . Listen ! I hear it : do n't you hear it too ? Lin . Mr. Lincoln Well , I believe it was the blind ; I do . But , Kate , ( approaches and talks low ) is Mrs. Lincoln gone to bed ? Kate . Kate I 'll run and see , sir . Lin . Mr. Lincoln Never mind  --  your tread Might wake her . Kate , your eyes are very blue ! And blue eyes always pierce me through and through ! I had a dream of you ! Kate . Kate A dream of me ? Ah ! Mr. President , what flattery ! Lin . Mr. Lincoln No flattery at all ; I tell you , Kate , The dream revealed that I had lost my mate , And some how , or some other how , it seemed That , out of Heaven , your face upon me beam 'd ! Kate , could you love me ? Takes her hand . Kate . Kate I already do . There 's nobody I love as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you when I say my prayers ! My father taught me to revere gray hairs ! Lincoln drops her hand and retires hastily . He 's very easy bluff 'd ! He takes a hint Almost as easy as he takes a pint ! I should have teazed him some ! I wish I had : But then how could I ? He 's the Prince 's dad ! Ah ! silly Kate , you 've made a sad mistake ; You should have push 'd your bark upon that lake ! He was in good time to make vows and pledges ; His watery lips ran over at the edges ; His eyes were lit with torches of desire , And he had work 'd his blood up into fire ! A little teazing would have saved , perhaps , This royal engine from complete collapse . But let this pass : if he 's like other men . He 'll certainly be after me again : An old man 's love is ever on the wing : I 'll pet the Prince  --  the Queen may pet the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson 's Chamber . Wilson and Ely . Wilson . Mr. Wilson So it is settled that the grand attack Comes off to day . Ely . Mr. Ely The army sleeps in harness . Patterson is expected with his forces To join McDowell : but if he should fail , We shall be able still to whip the rebels . It is well ascertained , we have more troops , By three to one , than Beauregard . Should Johnston Baffle old Patterson , and bring his army To Bull Run , we have yet a double number . Should our advance be overthrown , we follow With fresh divisions . Scott is confident . The word is , " On to Richmond . " Wilson . Mr. Wilson We must be present to enjoy the sport . Rings , and waiter enters . ' T is now past three o'clock , be ready , Robert , We leave at daylight . Ely . Mr. Ely The morning dawns , And I am all impatience to behold This coming conflict , and to take a spree In Richmond . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We should have abundance ; For if we take a score of Generals , I 'd show them how a prince in overthrow Should , by his conquerors , be entertained : I 'd burn him up with sparkles of rich wine . Wilson . Mr. Wilson I 'd fill his guts with whiskey , strongly mixed With his own native turpentine . Ely . Mr. Ely Too savage , man , too savage . Wilson . Mr. Wilson I drink no wine with rebels . I confess I do not like to hear you speak of it . The wine I sent is for more loyal lips : A grand carousal of the conquerors . McDowell is advised of our intent To dine with him to-day at his Head Quarters . Ely . Mr. Ely What is this ? Inspecting Wilson 's walking cane . Wilson . Mr. Wilson Simply an air-gun . ' T is the only weapon That goes with me to-day . It kills with whispers . See how it works : set up that piece of wood There in the grate . Ely sets up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cane : a noise , like the fall of a pistol hammer , is heard , and the wood falls out . Ely . Mr. Ely Oh ! marvelous ! most marvelous ! It is completely shattered ! Wilson . Mr. Wilson Who knows , but , on this great eventful day , This may be useful , in the coming fray ? Ely . Mr. Ely I do not go to kill or to be kill 'd : My heels are all the weapons that I carry . I shall keep out of danger , in the rear . Wilson . Mr. Wilson Then you 'll see nothing , and in dust be covered . Ely . Mr. Ely Have you a good glass ? Wilson . Mr. Wilson Yes , a noble one  --  It draws the moon down so that you can see The pismires working . Ely . Mr. Ely There is the carriage , let 's be off . Wilson . Mr. Wilson I 'll be with you directly . Exit Ely . It is not that I love the slaves so well , But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do assume all excellence , Both for their persons and localities . Their men are demi-gods , their women , angels ; Their slaves are better than the Northern poor man ! This is their haughty boast ; and entertained With such a strong belief , that it has fallen Into a common maxim . These men talk Sarcastical of Northern slavery ; And point , illustrating , to some poor girl . Scrubbing the marble sills of an huge palace , At three shillings a month . Fools , arrogant  --  They little think what armies can be raised Out of this pauper horde . Let Southern trade , Which is their livelihood , be once withdrawn , And every factory that shuts its doors Turns out a regiment of armed soldiers ; For every man that drives a peg , or flings A shuttle ; every man that swings a carriage , Will grow at once into a grenadier To smite these fattening fools : even he that fixes , With most ingenious mechanism , the fingers That touch the musical pulses of the organ To minister to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostility Will take the place of friendly intercourse , And this up-heaving of the Northern world Will overwhelm and desolate the homes Of these presuming braggarts . They are learned ! They are all orators , and wits and poets ! They deem the quick intemperance of blood , The flashing fires of genuine eloquence , To them peculiar , and denied to us Of the cold Northern clime ! This plants a devil To stand forever betwixt me and them . I wonder if these Ciceros will fight Better than him of old in Csar 's day ? The hour is coming that will test their mettle , And I 'll be near to see how matters settle . Exit . SCENE IV . United States Senate . Time  --  About daylight in the morning of the Battle of Manassas . Some Senators sleeping at the desks. 1st Senator . 1st Senator I do protest against the utterance Of counsels whose timidity should cause A manly cheek to burn with feverish blushes . Precautions such as these are but the plans Suggested by the over-heated brain Of Senators whose faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never ! never ! To move one inch from this old Capitol . Is the first fatal step towards a surrender . No pillar in this edifice shall stand Firmer than I. 2d Senator . 2d Senator Nor than I. 3d Senator . 3d Senator Nor than I. 4th Senator . 4th Senator Nor than I. Distant roar of cannon ; sleeping Senators start up amazed . 5th Senator . 5th Senator My thoughts are not of adamantine growth ; Nor do I feel the overwhelming power , Or the sagacity , or yet the courage Of the impetuous language of the Senator . If you will feel the agitated pulse Now of the gentleman , whose lofty tone A moment since so moved some Senators , You 'll find , perhaps , that he admits the force Of that strong argument , a cannon 's throat . It is the part of wisdom , not of fear , To save the archives of the Government . And it may be important that the Senate Should hold its meetings in some other place . I 'm not so much a Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gaul With impious hand shall pluck me by the whiskers . And I am not alone in this resolve . I look around upon the vacant seats Of many Senators . Where 's Charley Sumner ? I venture he has gone to pack his trunks ! Where 's that colossal intellect , his colleague , Immortal Wilson with his rifle-stick ? That pillar of the state , the hope of Boston ; The pride and boast of hoary Massachusetts , Fitly the occupant of Webster 's boots ! And where is Tom Thumb Wade  --  Oh tell me , where ! I do not mean by any means to hint That they have shirked their duty ; but they have The instincts of a Puritan sagacity. 6th Senator . 6th Senator I do entreat the Senate to observe A decent fortitude . Can we believe Aught but success will crown our enterprises ? Gentlemen show a needless apprehension When they suppose the archives of the state Are not completely safe . The iron wheels Of many hundred cars have groaned already Beneath the transportation . There is little Left of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpet bag Is not a great incumbrance . Let us wait To learn the issue of the impending battle ; Sure , if defeated , there is ample time , For each and all to make a safe retreat . 1st Senator . 1st Senator I am not , as the Senator supposes , Changed in my sentiments , or from my thoughts Turned in the least by that strong argument , The cannon 's throat , which seems to move the joints Of his great knees , to judge him by his quaking . This imputation , from so foul a source , I only use to hurl back in his teeth : The Senator may breakfast on his vomit ! Great sensation in the Senate . The Vice President Vice President ( in the Chair ) . Order ! such utterances ill befit So grave a body in so grave a time . Now , when rebellion lifts its radiant arm , And with satanic insolence so threatens The holy precincts of the Capitol ; Now , when the enemy united bring Their concentrated forces towards our gates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being wasted on each other , Should be directed ' gainst the common foe . 1st Senator . 1st Senator The Senate will reflect how insolently The Senator provoked me. 5th Senator . 5th Senator I recall What I too late perceive is misconstrued . I did not mean , sir , to offend my friend . If in the hurry of debate I uttered Aught that is thought to bear a touch unkind , It should be charged to the intemperance Of these disjointed times . 1st Senator . 1st Senator As it becomes me , I do accept this prompt apology ; And cheerfully recall th ' unpleasant phrases , I used here in the presence of the Senate . But the great question of this solemn hour . To which th ' attention of this noble Senate At once should be directed  --  has been slurr 'd . Nay , overslaughed , for things of lesser import . The question for the Senate to decide , Is , whether , when these rebel chiefs are taken , To them be meted out a traitor 's doom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be permitted to remain alive , To crowd our prisons and help breed a famine ? 2d Senator . 2d Senator That 's the question . I go in for hanging . 3d Senator . 3d Senator By all means , there must be a general hanging . 4th Senator . 4th Senator To hanging I incline , as high as Haman ! 5th Senator . 5th Senator ' T is better to beware who builds the gallows ; The builders have been known to swing thereon ! I am opposed to these extreme resolves . There be such things as double-edged swords , And this is one . The fortunes of a war , If history speaks truly , are uncertain . To-day the battle may decide for us , And victory may mount his crimson car , And roll triumphant through the ranks of death . To-morrow may present another scene , When routed armies , banners torn , rent squadrons , Seattered battalions , batteries dismounted , And generals led to Richmond , may appall The hardest Senators ! Put off this question . If these grave Senators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open ; Bring Haman on the stage , John Rogers to the stake , But have no real hangings , for Abe Lincoln 's sake ! 1st Senator . 1st Senator There 's treason in the Senate , rank as hell ! 2d Senator . 2d Senator Ranker than hell  --  as rank as sour crout ! There 's treason in the Senate  --  turn him out . Amidst great consternation , the 5th Senator is arrested by the Sergeant-at-Arms , and the scene closes . ACT II . SCENE I. The White House . Mrs. Lincoln and Robert . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lincoln Robert , my gentle hoosier , where 's your " dad , " When last I saw him he was wondrous sad . He roll 'd and tumbled in the bed all night , And kick 'd the cover off with all his might . He never was in such a fix before ; Not even when full of buckeye , running o'er . He called on Seward in his sleep , and Chase , And murmured something of a " lost , lost , race . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tall ! Cried , " Bob , you rascal , bring your father 's maul ! " I caught him by the shirt and pull 'd him down , And ask 'd him if he wish 'd to raise the town ? At that , he rush 'd all furious through the hall , And cried , " A maul , my kingdom for a maul ! " Robt . Robert Lincoln The old man 's mad ! I thought as much just now ! There 's something awful hanging on his brow ; A tempest seems to gather in his head ! The hollow earth gives answer to his tread ! He makes long speeches to himself  --  will stare Like tragic actors when they pull their hair ; He shakes like Mr. Forrest when he sees A ghost , and has a weakness in his knees ! He saws the air as Hamlet 's player did , And rolls his tongue as if he lack 'd a quid ; Then pauses and looks down upon the ground . As if he listened to some far off sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamps his foot , as if to crush a foe ! These melancholy signs proclaim his fate : He could not bear the burthens of the state . No Hercules is nigh to help him tote The mortal load . Is Stanton worth a groat ? Old Scott , himself , is quiet as a lamb , And pale Bill Seward is n't worth a d  --  . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lincoln Ah ! Bob , my son , I can not think it so , Your father 's greatness just begins to show ; ' T is genius with the exigence in glow ! Not crazed , ah ! no , that never shall be writ ; I tell you , Bob , your dad 's a man of grit . At Springfield when the Gipsey women came , And read my hand , they traced long lines to fame : Before the fire of Heaven had lit your eyes ; Before I felt the gladness of surprise That cheer 'd my heart and fill 'd my soul with joy To be the mother of so bright a boy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That Lincoln 's star should culminate and blaze , A beacon fire where history 's torch should be Lit with great records for posterity ! Robt . Robert Lincoln Well . ma , it may be so ; I hope it is ; You know that dad has always been a quiz ; These anties , let us hope , are only jokes ; Mahomet fainted just to gull the folks ; And men , I reckon , who are meant to be Great leaders , must be clothed in mystery ; And these strange starts and unexplained things , Are but the utterings and visitings Of some Egerias of the grove , some elves Who do not condescend to show themselves , When wandering from their mystical abodes , To any but the favored of the Gods ! Mrs. L. Mrs. Lincoln My son , thy bright discourse delights mine car ; Thy classic future through thy lips appear ! Thy budding genius now begins to shine ; The learned links will lengthen out the line Of Lincoln 's lineage , whose ancestral tree Shall toss its branches o'er posterity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scholar ; Here , buy some candy with this green back dollar ! Exit Robert . Now what a quaint and gentle use he makes Of these fine thoughts ! I 'll give another ball In honor of his teacher ! Did he say , " Mahomet fainted just to gull the folks . " An apt comparison ! Mahomet faints , And therefore Lincoln has a right to rave ! And these strange starts and wild ejaculations Which so disturb me , simply are the answers That favored mortals are allowed to give Responsive to Egerian revelations ! Exit . SCENE II . The Green-Room in the White House . Lincoln Mr. Lincoln ( solus ) . I saw the glittering columns in their march , And felt an honest pride in the display ; While , in the murmurs and confused sounds That came up from the marshal 'd multitude , I recognized too well the mingled jest And merry laugh of men unused to war . Resolves on victory or death are solemn , And nurse themselves in silent meditation . I do not like this merriment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , An empty eagerness to win the fight , Anticipating victory as of course . I can not , for my soul , disperse the clouds That hang these walls with gloomy apprehensions ; For well I know the stubbornness of will , The soul of adamant , the iron nerve In which this rebel host is panoplied . And yet , why should I doubt ? The measured tread Of those long columns , with this grand array Of gleaming banners and of glistening steel , Courting the eye of the delighted sun With scenes so gorgeous and magnificent , Fixes assurance that the art of war This day will mark the map of discipline , With triumphs yet unknown to veterans ! Pauses . If I believed in dreams ! But what are dreams ? Not revelations of the future  --  rather The forms fantastic of the buried past ; Mere panoramic phantoms , memoried Out of the half-forgotten  --  imps . in shadows , Intended to delight the innocent , And fright the wicked in their enterprises : Yet , if I did believe in dreams ! Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen. Scott Bring me a Bible ! let me take the oath ! The times are fitting such solemnities : My soul , expanding with the exigence , Rises in grandeur , and I feel the growth Of its immense proportions ! Looking towards Lincoln . Abraham ! Not the first patriarch of thy name alone Shall be immortal ; thou shalt share with him A patriarch 's heritage . Lift thou thine eyes : Turn towards the " Sunny South ! " Behold the land Far stretching from the smooth Potomac 's bed , Over the mountains to the rugged shores Of murky Louisiana , where the zone Of a great continent unbinds itself In dalliance to meet the lucid clasp Of Mexico 's invigorating waters ; Countless the wealth , immense the population Of that vast region ; loyal in their hearts And easily reclaimed : even further still , Behold the giant empire lately added To these domains from Mexico  --  the fruits Of victories achieved by these old arms , Now feeble grown , but nerved with loyalty : This realm of wealth and beauty  --  these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowned with groves And wildernesses in their primal freshness  --  These thy inheritance ! The deeds to-day To be recorded in the blood of thousands , Proclaim thee conqueror ! Lin . Mr. Lincoln Not I , great chief , But thou shalt have the glories of this day . Thy genius plans the battle , and should wear The laurels . Scott . Lieut . Gen. Scott ' T is not in the power of man To count his honors , or to say he will Or will not take his portion of the glories That cluster in the age when he is Ruler . The warrior plucks the blossom of renown And lays it , flowering . at his monarch 's feet , Whence it is quick transplanted to his crown , To shed its fragrance through his gilded court . Superb Justinian 's brow was garlanded By Belisarius : Augustus lives . The pet and idol of posterity , With few achievements of his own ; he lives , The radiant centre of a golden age ! I tell you Abram , you are fortunate ! The Fates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may fashion a colossus Even out of Lincoln ! Lin . Mr. Lincoln This is no time . Immortal man , to play the harlequin . If Nero fiddled while his empire blazed , I do not choose to follow his example . Amid the solemn grandeur of this hour , When death makes ready for its carnival ; Now , when the distant cannon shakes the vales , And rocks the towering mountains in its thunder , It ill befits the chief to play the jester . If honors come , let him who wins them wear them ; You shall have yours : and if disasters come , Let him who brings them be responsible To me and to the country for his failure ! Scott . Lieut . Gen. Scott I gladly take responsibility . The country will be satisfied to-night . Better appointed legions never marched , And they will act the part of veterans . Lin . Mr. Lincoln This may be true , and still may come disaster . I am not hopeful , and I fear defeat . Scott . Lieut . Gen. Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln In person , never  --  but you are not there ; Your absence may be cause of a defeat . Scott . Lieut . Gen. Scott You know my deep anxiety to be there . Ev'n now , if you consent , I gladly go . The sun is not yet risen : I will travel Fleet as his beams if you vouchsafe permission . Lin . Mr. Lincoln It is determined best that you remain . We can not risk the loss of such a man Now , in our great emergence . One thing , I do confess , annoys me much , And in all candor , I will tell it you : In the unbroken round of your successes , ' T is understood that , in your plans , you never Stoop to provide for a Retreat . Your orders , For which you are renowned throughout the world , Furnish but plans for an advancing army , Assuming the achievement of success . The " On to Richmond , " General , may not be As easy as the " On to Mexico . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden crest of Cerro Gordo , Were Lilliputians ; those are Brobdignags  --  Those men that crowd the gorges of Manassas ! Scott . Lieut . Gen. Scott Well said ! a critic should be classical ! Both Gulliver and Xenophon are quoted ! A rebel could not muster softer phrases To lard a speech with  --  or sublimer fancies ! Lincoln Mr. Lincoln ( in a rage ) . Old man ! you do presume upon my patience . Scott Lieut . Gen. Scott ( shaking his feathers ) . Young man ! you do presume upon my science ! Enter the President 's Private Secretary . Secretary . Secretary The Senate still continues its long session , And a Committee waits your Excellency . Exit . Lincoln . Mr. Lincoln We will not part in anger , General Scott . I do recall whatever I have said Offensive . You have all my confidence . And if my speech appear disconsolate , I owe it to the temper of my mind , Which is bewildered and o'ershadowed With undefined but powerful misgivings . To tell the truth , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Scott . Lieut . Gen. Scott Pray do not tell it me ! Lincoln . Mr. Lincoln No , I will keep these curious fancies hid  --  But still , there may be something in a dream ! Exit . Scott . Lieut . Gen. Scott Send out the heralds ! let the army know That Lincoln 's had a dream ! Pauses . I am not , as I should be  --  I am not The real chief , but simply secondary To Lincoln and his crusty Cabinet : Men of mere figures ; polishers of tropes ; Smoothers of sentences and rhetoric rounders . Seward 's a pedant  --  a slim pedagogue , Gifted with patience and the art of teaching . Chase , a compounder of his interest , Doth reckon well enough to save his money ; But let the marble of the Treasury On which he builds his columns , be as thick As the deep-rooted Alleghany , still ' twill crack Beneath the mighty weight . If I were given To hunting phrases of description , To characterize the Secretary of War . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more lengthy in its meaning Than in its letters : Idiot ! Its echo breathes a solemn symphony , Wound in the hollow of an empty skull ! After a pause . No , no ; I am not chief : if I were so , I might concentrate all my energies , And plant with a solidity of purpose That , in a matter of such magnitude As war , is reckon 'd , of itself , success ! This purpose , being frittered by division , Loses its strength , betrays the pithy timber Wherein the wedges of the enemy May rive the very heart of enterprise . Am I not , like a straggling autumn cloud , When winter screams from far as he advances , Driven about by the diurnal blasts Of raving politicians ? All my plans Are freely criticized ; half finished diagrams Are ventilated by the morning winds That fan the paper sails of every mail craft . After a pause . I should not laugh at Lincoln for his dream ! The chaste Calphurnia dreamed , and warned her lord , The noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he declined to yield ! Brutus had visions in his battle tent , Beclouding his immortal intellect ; Touching the pulse of confidence , and shaking The startled nerves of faltering resolution ! So the inebriate Sardanapalus Beheld the finger of th ' invisible God Tracing his fate ! At Babylon , ' t is said , The mighty Alexander so forgot That he was Jupiter 's immediate son , As to have dreams presaging the decay Of all his glories  --  mountains did spring up , Piercing the sky , ' twixt him and Macedon ! I am , myself , beset with strange misgivings : Should I lay off the cover of my mind , The thick disguises of my inmost thoughts , It would betray my weakness to mankind : For I have felt a growing excrescence About my throat , as if despair had planted A polypus to herald suffocation ! After a pause . O ! if I had a country , as I once had ! But I have now no country ! And my eyes Do strain their nerves to find a spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native State , Where I did hope to lay my weary body , After this lengthened travel , will deny Proximity ' twixt me and Washington ! Mountains will sunder us ; no summer sighs Through sweet Potomac 's lucid throat will breathe A requiem for me ! Roar of distant cannon heard . Still I am caged ! That voice betrays me , for I should be nearer  --  That , in the loss of victory , I might find A grave where I most covet one ! Cannon still roars . Again ! Patience , my heart ! impatiently I teach Thy pulses patience ! ' T is in man alone That nature thus compounds her contradictions . Enter the President 's Private Secretary . Secretary . Secretary The last despatch proclaims the enemy Gives ground , but stubbornly ; that we advance As steadily upon him ! Scott . Lieut . Gen. Scott Should this hold Till noon , we will be victors , if my plans Are not abandoned . Let the lightning tell McDowell to adhere to every line And letter of the plan ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Senate 's Committee . 1st Committee Man . 1st Committee Man We can not , Mr. President , but feel A deep solicitude in the events Of this important day . The Senate , earnestly , Bearing most bravely ( you will pardon me ) Its burthens and responsibilities , Begs of your Excellence to let them know What are your plans if any accident Of serious import should befall our army ? Lin . Mr. Lincoln ' T is wisdom to provide beforehand , friends , For such calamities as war entails . I sent the archieves , deeming it expedient , Some days ago , to Philadelphia ; Not apprehending the necessity Of moving thither with the Government , But to secure , beyond contingency And possible destruction , the state papers . I do not think we 'll have to run for safety . ' T is thought impossible that any thing Should create the extrement emergency Of sudden flight . The total overthrow Of our great army in the fight impending , Would leave us ample force to guard the city . 1st Com . Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Giving the President authority , If it should be expedient , to cause That body to assemble at such place As he might designate , in case the enemy Should occupy the present Capitol . 2nd Com . Man . 2nd Committee Man I like not that ; ' t is true , to legislate Under the frowning guns of a beseiger , Amid the tempest and continuous roar Of battle , would not be agreeable ; But yet I would not move the Government , Nor stir an inch until enforced to go . The Gauls , within the Capitol of Rome Were yet unable to drive out the Romans , Who in the citadel maintained a foothold . Lin . Mr. Lincoln the rebels are not Gauls , nor are we Romans ; We are but common people  --  so God help us ! Was it the Senate held the citadel ? Not so . A few old dotards , patiently Folded their arms and perished in the Forum . It was the military held the citadel !

I 'll not despair ; I am as whole as I could wish to be ; And yet , I wish I had a little wound , Just deep enough to bring the surface blood ; For then I could fall down to be pick 'd up ; And so create a general sympathy To swallow my discomfiture ! A thought ! I have a thought for this emergency ; A trick of the imagination : I 'll cut a gash ! a terribly deep gash , Being very careful not to break the skull , Over my temple , and then go to bed , Amongst these leaves , and sleep till some one find me !

Seasons there are in war as well as peace ; And after the fatigues of such a battle , Ajax himself , and even Menelaus , Would not have scorned a little recreation : For these old heroes , if there 's faith in Homer , Were fond of wrestling , boxing , gambling , running ! Did not great Hector from Achilles run ? Even Mars himself did fly from Diomede ! After a pause . If I had time and leisure , I could plan Such an oration as would pacify The anger of the President himself : For history is full of such examples As show that it is oft the hero 's duty To save himself for future usefulness ! We will make merry , laugh our shame away , And go to Richmond on some other day : Gull the home-people with a thousand jokes , And treat this thing as a tremendous hoax .

Give up your sword : you may retain the scabbard ! No mouthing about ceremony . If I could aught behold about your person , Betokening a gallant officer , You might retain your sword and wear it Into the presence of our General . But you 're a military specimen ; Just such a Colonel as should lay aside His rigging , and surrender to a private . Off with it !

And once again I " do remember me , " as Shakspeare somewhere philosophically says ; when I was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives , it again came into my head that I was not Galusha A. Grow ; for when I stood for the first time in my ante-room , and measured myself in front of my tall mirror , it did seem impossible that I could be Galusha A.

Now I do n't want to be Galusha A. Grow , and so , if I bite again , it will be with a negative hope . Let 's see ; if it hurts , I am Galusha ; if it do n't hurt . I am not Galusha . I am afraid to test the experiment  --  for last night , in my dreams , remembering that I had made a most notable speech against Rebeldom , I thought I saw that furious South Carolinian , Lawrence M.

Scott Hasten to stop the train . Lay my commands On the Conductor ; take a troop with you ; Arrest all disobedient officers ; Exit Courier . ' T is felly to accumulate disgraces . After a pause . There be diseases common to mankind , That spread from limb to limb , obscening all The goodly outside of humanity ; Innumerous the scabby family Of poxes , fevers , leprosies and sores , That itch their way unseen from tribe to tribe , Involving nations in contagion ; Yet they are slow to prostrate and confound . A rosy pimple takes a day to grow Umbilical ; and yet a weck to fester ; And yet another week to slough its scales . Diseases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortal malady of thought , As instantaneous as combustion , fires The agitated heart with consternation ; And cities then , grown tremulous at shadows , Disjointed , swing dismayed . This Capital Vibrates at Terror 's touch ! Not Athens thus Trembled at Xerxes ; not , Almighty Rome At Pyrrhus or the swarthy Hannibal ; For where the Carthaginian army lay Encamp 'd in eye-shot of the Eternal City , The very soil grew duplicate in value , As if the foot-prints of the enemy Enriched it .

I burn , pray fan me with a thousand wings ! My bowels will be par-boiled chitterlings ; Here , take my knife and cut the infernal strings . Feels for his knife . Where is my pocket ? Lifts up his skirt to find his pocket . Kitty . Kitty Fie ! that 's not the way ! Kate . Kate How lucky that it is n't open day ! Robert opens his knife and the girls cut the strings of his corset . Robt . Robert Lincoln I feel much better . I am nearly well ; Now let me take a long , long breathing spell ! Pull off my bonnet ; let me feel the rain Come cooling on me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another hack  --  hey , driver , come , And take us to the White House ; we are some . Driver . Driver Some what ?
