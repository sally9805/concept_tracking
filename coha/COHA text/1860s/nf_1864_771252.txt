txt //s from them to be made . These requests I invariably declined , as I desired the publication , if made at all , to be entire , as well as accurate . As time passed , these appeals became more frequent and pressing , and claims were made in relation to the course of several of the members which could only be sustained or refuted by a publication of their remarks . At length I was earnestly requested to write out one of these speeches , and after some weeks of delay consented to do so . After the publication of this speech , which took place about the time of the fall elections of 1863 , previous to which the action of the Conference had been much discussed , the desire to see a full report of the proceedings of that body appeared to be excited anew . Letters and personal interviews upon this subject became very numerous . I finally determined to take the advice of a number of gentlemen who were prominent in the convention and the country , as to the propriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it . I did so , and found among them a remarkable unanimity of expression in favor of making the history of the Conference public . When this question was settled , I desired to avail myself of every opportunity to secure the highest degree of accuracy and fidelity . I addressed notes to such of the members as were accessible , asking them to transmit to me such memoranda of the proceedings of the Conference as they had preserved . The response to these letters was very gratifying ; not because the materials furnished were very full , but because so general a purpose was shown by all the members thus addressed , to furnish me every facility and aid in their power . I have found much difficulty in determining what control each member ought to be permitted to exercise over his own remarks . The most agreeable course to me would have been , to have written out each speech and submitted it to its author for correction or revision ; but to this there was a decisive objection . It would have depreciated , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not believe that any gentleman would have been tempted to change the tenor of his remarks by subsequent events , the view of the public might not have been so charitable . I have therefore made my own notes the standard of authority , and have admitted nothing into the report which has not been justified by them aided by my own recollection . The manuscript has not been changed or added to , except by my own hands . The few instances in which I have availed myself of the materials furnished by others , are distinctly stated either in the notes or the appendix . During the sessions of the Conference I was able to secure but little practical assistance from the members . Although many of them desired that my purpose should be accomplished , and some were taking brief and general notes , I soon discovered that an accurate report of a speech required an amount of labor and a degree of attention to the subject , which few gentlemen were inclined to give . The work , therefore , was thrown almost exclusively upon myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed when it is stated , that the sessions usually commenced at about ten o'clock in the morning , and with a brief intermission were continued late in the evening , in one instance as late as the hour of two o'clock , A.M. The necessity of these long daily sessions , arose from the fact , that the Congress then in existence terminated on the fourth of March , and but few days remained in which to discuss and perfect the report , and to submit it to that body for its action . I do not claim to have furnished a verbatim report of the speeches delivered in the Conference of 1861 , but I insist that I have given an accurate account of all its official proceedings , and the substance of the remarks made in the course of those proceedings . I think , also , that I have preserved nearly all the propositions made in the course of the debate , and generally have presented the ideas in the very language used . The gentlemen who have critically examined the report , all concur upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this respect to rely upon their testimony . I have suggested these considerations simply by way of explanation , and not for the purpose of avoiding criticism . I have endeavored to follow , so far as was in my power , the example of the illustrious Reporter of the Constitutional Convention of 1787 ; and while my notes lack the beauty and felicity which characterize his , I trust they are not less full and accurate . I submit them to the country as the best contribution which I can make to its history , at a most important and interesting period of our national existence . The three short years which have passed since the Conference of 1861 , have witnessed singular vicissitudes among its members . Many of them have entered into the military or civil service of the country , or of the rebellion which it was the avowed purpose of some members of that Conference to nourish into vigorous life . Death , also , has been busy with the roll . BALDWIN , BRONSON , SMITH , WOLCOTT , TYLER , and CLAY , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rebel army . HACKLEMAN sealed with his blood his devotion to the principles he advocated upon the field of Corinth , and now , while I am writing these pages in a morning of beautiful spring , when tree , and shrub , and grass , and flower , are bursting into life and beauty ; from the roar of cannon , the rattle of musketry , and the deadly storm of lead and iron , which bearing destruction upon its wings is waking the echoes of the " Wilderness , " comes the mournful tidings that WADSWORTH has fallen . In that Conference or in the world , there was never a purer or a more ardent patriot . Those of us who were associated with him politically , had learned to love and respect him . His opponents admired his unflinching devotion to his country , and his manly frankness and candor . He was the type of a true American , able , unselfish , prudent , unambitious , and good . Other pens will do justice to his memory , but I thought as I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the rebel lines , his face wearing that calm serenity which grew more beautiful the nearer death approached , after having given so abundantly of his goods , now yielding his life to his country in the hour of her trial , that hereafter the good and true men of the nation would emulate the illustrious example of his patriotism , and would prize the blessings of a free government the more highly , as they remembered that it could only be maintained and perpetuated by such expensive sacrifices . L.E.C. May , 1864 . PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCE , Washington , D.C. MONDAY , February 4th , 1861 . Commissioners representing a number of the States , assembled at Willard 's Hall , in the City of Washington , D.C. , on the fourth day of February , A.D. 1861 , at 12 o'clock M. , in pursuance of the following preamble and resolutions , adopted by the General Assembly of the State of Virginia , on the nineteenth day of January , A.D. 1861 : Whereas , It is the deliberate opinion of the General Assembly of Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States of this confederacy , shall be satisfactorily adjusted , a permanent dissolution of Union is inevitable ; and the General Assembly , representing the wishes of the people of the commonwealth , is desirous of employing every reasonable means to avert so dire a calamity , and determined to make a final effort to restore the Union and the Constitution , in the spirit in which they were established by the fathers of the Republic : Therefore , Resolved , That on behalf of the commonwealth of Virginia , an invitation is hereby extended to all such States , whether slaveholding or non-slaveholding , as are willing to unite with Virginia in an earnest effort to adjust the present unhappy controversies , in the spirit in which the Constitution was originally formed , and consistently with its principles , so as to afford to the people of the slaveholding States adequate guarantees for the security of their rights , to appoint commissioners to meet on the fourth day of February next , in the City of Washington , similar commissioners appointed by Virginia , to consider , and if practicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-President JOHN TYLER , WILLIAM C. RIVES , Judge JOHN W. BROCKENBROUGH , GEORGE W. SUMMERS , and JAMES A. SEDDON are hereby appointed commissioners , whose duty it shall be to repair to the City of Washington , on the day designated in the foregoing resolution , to meet such commissioners as may be appointed by any of said States , in accordance with the foregoing resolution . Resolved , That if said commissioners , after full and free conference , shall agree upon any plan of adjustment requiring amendments to the Federal Constitution , for the further security of the rights of the people of the slaveholding States , they be requested to communicate the proposed amendments to Congress , for the purpose of having the same submitted by that body , according to the forms of the Constitution , to the several States for ratification . Resolved , That if said commissioners can not agree on such adjustment , or if agreeing , Congress shall refuse to submit for ratification , such amendments as may be proposed , then the commissioners of this State shall immediately communicate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by him laid before the convention of the people of Virginia and the General Assembly : Provided , That the said commissioners be subject at all times to the control of the General Assembly , or if in session , to that of the State convention . Resolved , That in the opinion of the General Assembly of Virginia , the propositions embraced in the resolutions presented to the Senate of the United States by the Hon. JOHN J. CRITTENDEN , so modified as that the first article proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States , shall apply to all the territory of the United States now held or hereafter acquired south of latitude thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes , and provide that slavery of the African race shall be effectually protected as property therein during the continuance of the territorial government , and the fourth article shall secure to the owners of slaves the right of transit with their slaves between and through the non-slaveholding States and territories , constitute the basis of such an adjustment of the unhappy controversy which now divides the States of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this commonwealth . Resolved , That ex-President JOHN TYLER is hereby appointed , by the concurrent vote of each branch of the General Assembly , a commissioner to the President of the United States , and Judge JOHN ROBERTSON is hereby appointed , by a like vote , a commissioner to the State of South Carolina , and the other States that have seceded or shall secede , with instructions respectfully to request the President of the United States and authorities of such States to agree to abstain , pending the proceedings contemplated by the action of this General Assembly , from any and all acts calculated to produce a collision of arms between the States and the Government of the United States . Resolved , That copies of the foregoing resolutions be forthwith telegraphed to the executives of the several States , and also to the President of the United States , and the Governor be requested to inform , without delay , the commissioners of their appointment by the foregoing resolutions . A copy from the rolls . WM . F. GORDON , JR. , C.H.D. and K.R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. MOREHEAD , of Kentucky , who proposed the name of the honorable JOHN C. WRIGHT , of Ohio , as temporary Chairman . The motion of Mr. MOREHEAD was unanimously adopted . Mr. WRIGHT was conducted to the Chair by Mr. MEREDITH , of Pennsylvania , and Mr. CHASE , of Ohio , and proceeded to address the Conference as follows : My warmest thanks are due to you , Gentlemen , for the undeserved honor which you have conferred upon me , in selecting me for the purpose of temporarily presiding over your deliberations . We have come together to secure a common and at the same time a most important object  --  to agree if we can upon some plan for adjusting the unhappy differences which distract the country , which will be satisfactory to ourselves and those we represent . We have assembled as friends , as brothers , each , I doubt not , animated by the most friendly sentiments . If we enter upon , and with these sentiments carry through , a patient examination of the difficulties which now surround the Government , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , earnestly hoped for by every lover of his country ; a result which will establish the Union according to the spirit of the Constitution . For myself , I may say that I have come here with the earnest purpose of doing justice to all sections of the Union . I will hear with a patient and impartial mind all that may be said in favor of , or against such amendments of the Constitution as may be proposed . Such of them as will give to the Government permanence , strength , and stability , as will tend to secure to any State , or any number of States , the quiet and unmolested enjoyment of their rights under it , shall receive my cordial support . My confidence in republican institutions , in the capacity of the people for self-government , has been increased with every year of a life which has been protracted beyond the term usually allotted to man . That life is now drawing to a close , and I hope , when it ends , I may leave the Government more firmly established in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To this end I have always labored , and shall continue to labor while I live . I pray GOD that He will be with us during our deliberations , and that He may guide them to a happy and wise conclusion . Mr. BENJAMIN C. HOWARD , a commissioner from the State of Maryland , was unanimously appointed temporary Secretary . The Roll of the States was then called over , and commissioners representing the following were found to be present : New Hampshire , Rhode Island , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Delaware , Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina , Kentucky , Ohio , Indiana . Mr. PRICE , of New Jersey :  --  I am informed that a number of Reporters for the press are at the door of the hall , desiring admittance to this Conference , for the purpose of reporting our proceedings . Whatever may be the ultimate action of the Conference in this respect , I can see no objection to the admission of reporters to-day , for our business will relate wholly to organization . I hope we shall admit them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Virginia :  --  I hope this motion will not prevail . I do not see that any good can possibly come of giving publicity now , to our proceedings . On the contrary , in the present excited condition of the country , I can see how much harm might result from that publicity . It is not unlikely that wide differences of opinion will be found to exist among us at the outset . These we shall attempt to harmonize , and if we succeed , it will only be by mutual concessions and compromises . Every one should be left free to make these concessions , and not subject himself to unfavorable public criticism by doing so . If our deliberations are to attain the successful conclusion we so much desire , it certainly is the course of wisdom that we should follow the illustrious example of the framers of the present Constitution , and sit with closed doors . The motion was thereupon , by viva voce vote , decided in the negative . Mr. MEREDITH :  --  I move the appointment of a committee to consist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named by the delegation and appointed by the President , who shall recommend permanent officers of this , body , and also report rules for its government . Which motion was agreed to . The following gentlemen were then appointed such Committee on Rules and Organization : Kentucky , Charles A. Wickliffe , Chairman ; New Hampshire , Amos Tuck ; Rhode Island , William W. Hoppin ; New Jersey , Joseph F. Randolph ; Pennsylvania , Thomas E. Franklin ; Delaware , George B. Rodney ; Maryland , John W. Crisfield ; Virginia , William C. Rives ; North Carolina , Thomas Ruffin ; Ohio , Reuben Hitchcock ; Indiana , Godlove S. Orth . The Conference then adjourned to meet at 12 o'clock M. to-morrow . SECOND DAY . WASHINGTON , TUESDAY , February 5th , 1861 . The Conference was called to order by the Chairman pro tem. , pursuant to adjournment , and the journal of the proceedings of the first day was read and approved . Mr. FRANKLIN , of Pennsylvania :  --  It is usual in bodies of this description to take measures to ascertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We should have the names of all the Commissioners present brought on to our records . I therefore move that a Committee of five be appointed by the Chairman , to whom all credentials of members shall be referred for examination and report . The motion of Mr. FRANKLIN was adopted unanimously , and the Chairman announced as such Committee Mr. Summers , of Virginia ; Mr. Franklin , of Pennsylvania ; Mr. Guthrie , of Kentucky ; Mr. Morehead , of North Carolina , and Mr. Smith , of Indiana . Mr. WICKLIFFE , of Kentucky :  --  I rise at this time for the purpose of making the report of the Committee on Organization . I am instructed to report that we recommend that the permanent officers of the Convention be a President and Secretary , and that the Secretary have leave to appoint assistants , not exceeding two in number , to assist him in the discharge of his duties ; and that the President of this Convention be JOHN TYLER , of Virginia , and that CRAFTS J. WRIGHT , of Ohio , be its Secretary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government of the Convention . Mr. CLAY , of Kentucky :  --  I move that the question upon accepting the report be divided , and that it be first taken on that part of the report which relates to the officers of the Convention . Which was agreed to without objection . It was then moved , and unanimously voted , that the part of the report relating to officers , be accepted , and the officers designated be appointed . The President pro tem. then appointed Mr. EWING , of Ohio , and Mr. MEREDITH , of Pennsylvania , to conduct the President elect to the chair . President TYLER upon taking his seat proceeded to address the Convention as follows : Gentlemen , I fear you have committed a great error in appointing me to the honorable position you have assigned me . A long separation from all deliberative bodies has rendered the rules of their proceedings unfamiliar to me , while I should find , in my own state of health , variable and fickle as it is , sufficient reason to decline the honor of being your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one has but little option left him . Personal considerations should weigh but lightly in the balance . The country is in danger ; it is enough ; one must take the place assigned him in the great work of reconciliation and adjustment . The voice of Virginia has invited her co-States to meet her in council . In the initiation of this Government , that same voice was heard and complied with , and the results of seventy-odd years have fully attested the wisdom of the decisions then adopted . Is the urgency of her call now less great than it was then ? Our godlike fathers created , we have to preserve . They built up , through their wisdom and patriotism , monuments which have eternized their names . You have before you , gentlemen , a task equally grand , equally sublime , quite as full of glory and immortality . You have to snatch from ruin a great and glorious Confederation , to preserve the Government , and to renew and invigorate the Constitution . If you reach the height of this great occasion , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I confess myself to be ambitious of sharing in the glory of accomplishing this grand and magnificent result . To have our names enrolled in the Capitol , to be repeated by future generations with grateful applause  --  this is an honor higher than the mountains , more enduring than the monumental alabaster . Yes , Virginia 's voice , as in the olden time , has been heard . Her sister States meet her this day at the council board . Vermont is here , bringing with her the memories of the past , and reviving in the memories of all , her Ethan Allen and his demand for the surrender of Ticonderoga , in the name of the Great Jehovah and the American Congress . New Hampshire is here , her fame illustrated by memorable annals , and still more lately as the birthplace of him who won for himself the name of defender of the Constitution , and who wrote that letter to John Taylor which has been enshrined in the hearts of his countrymen . Massachusetts is not here . ( Some member said " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. TYLER , and that she will bring with her her daughter Maine . I did not believe it could well be that the voice which in other times was so familiar to her ears had been addressed to her in vain . Connecticut is here , and she comes , I doubt not , in the spirit of ROGER SHERMAN , whose name with our very children has become a household word , and who was in life the embodiment of that sound practical sense which befits the great lawgiver and constructer of governments . Rhode Island , the land of ROGER WILLIAMS , is here , one of the two last States , in her jealousy of the public liberty , to give in her adhesion to the Constitution , and among the earliest to hasten to its rescue . The great Empire State of New York , represented thus far but by one delegate , is expected daily in fuller force to join in the great work of healing the discontents of the times and restoring the reign of fraternal feeling . New Jersey is also here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trenton and Princeton live immortal in story , the plains of the last incrimsoned with the hearts blood of Virginia 's sons . Among her delegation I rejoice to recognize a gallant son of a signer of the immortal Declaration which announced to the world that thirteen Provinces had become thirteen independent and sovereign States . And here , too , is Delaware , the land of the BAYARDS and the RODNEYS , whose soil at Brandywine was moistened by the blood of Virginia 's youthful MONROE . Here is Maryland , whose massive columns wheeled into line with those of Virginia in the contest for glory , and whose state house at Annapolis was the theatre of the spectacle of a successful Commander , who , after liberating his country , gladly ungirthed his sword , and laid it down upon the altar of that country . Then comes Pennsylvania , rich in revolutionary lore , bringing with her the deathless names of FRANKLIN and MORRIS , and , I trust , ready to renew from the belfry of Independence Hall the chimes of the old bell , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to North Carolina ! with her Mecklenberg Declaration in her hand , standing erect on the ground of her own probity and firmness in the cause of public liberty , and represented in her attributes by her MACON , and in this assembly by her distinguished son at no great distance from me . Four daughters of Virginia also cluster around the council board on the invitation of their ancient mother  --  the eldest , Kentucky , whose sons , under the intrepid warrior ANTHONY WAYNE , gave freedom of settlement to the territory of her sister , Ohio . She extends her hand daily and hourly across la belle riviere , to grasp the hand of some one of kindred blood of the noble states of Indiana , and Illinois , and Ohio , who have grown up into powerful States , already grand , potent , and almost imperial . Tennessee is not here , but is coming  --  prevented only from being here by the floods which have swollen her rivers . When she arrives , she will wear the badges on her warrior crest of victories won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain , and standards torn from the hands of the conquerors at Waterloo . Missouri , and Iowa , and Michigan , Wisconsin , and Minnesota , still linger behind , but it may be hoped that their hearts are with us in the great work we have to do . Gentlemen , the eyes of the whole country are turned to this assembly , in expectation and hope . I trust that you may prove yourselves worthy of the great occasion . Our ancestors , probably , committed a blunder in not having fixed upon every fifth decade for a call of a general convention to amend and reform the Constitution . On the contrary , they have made the difficulties next to insurmountable to accomplish amendments to an instrument which was perfect for five millions of people , but not wholly so as to thirty millions . Your patriotism will surmount the difficulties , however great , if you will but accomplish one triumph in advance , and that is , a triumph over party . And what is party , when compared to the work of rescuing one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , loud shout of joy and gladness will resound throughout the land . Mr. EWING :  --  I move that the remaining portion of the report of the Committee on Organization be postponed until to-morrow . The motion of Mr. EWING was agreed to . Mr. WICKLIFFE . I offer the following resolution : Resolved , That the Conference shall be opened with prayer , and that the clergymen of the city of Washington be requested to perform that service . The resolution offered by Mr. WICKLIFFE was adopted , and prayer was then offered by the Rev. Dr. P.D . GURLEY , of Washington . The PRESIDENT :  --  I have received a communication from the Messrs . Willard , placing the Hall in which the Conference is now sitting at the service of the Conference , while its sessions may continue ; also , a communication from the Mayor and Common Council of the City of Washington , offering police officers to attend our sittings . It was moved , and agreed to , that these offers be severally accepted . Mr. JOHNSON , of Maryland :  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to furnish a copy of his address to the Conference upon taking the Chair , that it be entered upon the journal as a part of this day 's proceedings , and that the same be published . Which motion was unanimously agreed to . Mr. GRIMES , of Iowa :  --  I have received from the Governor of the State of Iowa a communication , requesting myself and my colleague in the Senate of the United States , and also the members representing that State in the House of Representatives , to represent the State of Iowa here . I desire to present his communication , that it may be referred to the Committee on Credentials . The communication was so referred , and on motion of Mr. WRIGHT , of Ohio , the Conference adjourned . THIRD DAY . WASHINGTON , WEDNESDAY , February 6th , 1861 . The Conference met at twelve o'clock , at noon , and was called to order by the PRESIDENT . The Journal of yesterday was read , and after amendment , was approved . Mr. SUMMERS :  --  I am instructed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee has examined the credentials which have been submitted to it , and finds the following-named gentlemen duly accredited as members of this Conference : New Hampshire.  --  Amos Tuck , Levi Chamberlain , Asa Fowler .

I am advised that the Secretary can not perform his duties without assistance , and I see no objection to giving him this authority . The motion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I now desire to call up the remaining portion of the report of the Committee on Rules and Organization , and to move its adoption at the present time . These Rules are substantially the same as those which were adopted by the convention which proposed our present Constitution . The rule which we have reported securing secrecy , so far as our proceedings are concerned , has been made the subject of much discussion in the committee ; and it was at first thought best to recommend a modification of it . But upon reflection and consideration , and in view of the fact that , while the rule reported requires that secrecy should be preserved in regard to all that is said or done in this Conference , it does not prevent any member from expressing his own hopes or predictions upon the final result of our deliberations , we have thought best to let it remain as it is . Mr. SEDDON :  --  I desire to offer an amendment to this portion of the report of the committee , which I will read for the information of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , That no part of the Journal be published without the order or leave of the Conference , and that no copies of the whole or any part be furnished or allowed , except to members , who shall be privileged to communicate the same to the authorities or deliberative assemblies of their respective States , when deemed judicious or appropriate , under their instructions , and that nothing spoken in the House be printed or otherwise published ; but private communications respecting the proceedings and debates , while recommended to be with caution and reserve , are allowed at the discretion of each member . " It may be thought , that in offering this resolution , I am seeking a different end from the one I proposed yesterday , when I advocated the proposition of excluding reporters from our sessions , and insisted that our proceedings should be at all times under the seal of secrecy . Such , however , is not my purpose . But some discretion must be allowed us , in order that we may conform to and carry out the spirit of the resolutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to myself and my colleagues . The resolutions under which we are acting , require that we should from time to time communicate to the legislature of Virginia the proceedings of this body , and to express our own opinions of the prospect which may exist of the settlement of existing difficulties . The Commissioners from Virginia would be placed in a delicate , not to say an awkward position , by the adoption of a rule here which would absolutely prohibit such communications . I hope my amendment may be adopted . Mr. TUCK :  --  Would not the purpose of the gentleman from Virginia be answered by giving any delegation leave to communicate any action actually taken by the Conference , with their own opinions as to the probable result of our deliberations ? Mr. SEDDON :  --  Those opinions would possess no value , unless the facts and circumstances are communicated upon which they are founded . It is very clear to me , that the best course will be to entrust to the discretion of each member the privilege of making these communications , trusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. WICKLIFFE :  --  I hope we have all come here with an earnest desire to harmonize our conflicting opinions , and to unite upon some plan which will settle our troubles and save the union of the States . The South has spoken of the North in very severe terms , and the North has not been slow in returning the compliment . If we come finally , to any definite result satisfactory to either side , it must be by mutual concessions , by confessing our sins to each other , and endeavoring to live harmoniously together in future . In my judgment , secrecy is absolutely indispensable to successful action here . I do not wish to be precluded from abandoning a position to-morrow , if I see cause for it , which I have taken to-day . If the proceedings , and especially the debates of this Conference , are made public from day to day , they will go into the newspapers and be made the subject of comment , favorable or otherwise . The necessary result will be , that when a member is understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any special course of policy , that pride of opinion , which we all possess , will render any change of policy on his part difficult , if not impossible . I should sincerely regret the adoption of the resolution of the gentleman from Virginia . Mr. RANDOLPH :  --  I move that the portion of the committee 's report under consideration , together with the resolution of Mr. SEDDON , be recommitted to the Committee on Rules and Organization . The motion of Mr. RANDOLPH was agreed to . Mr. GUTHRIE :  --  I have an idea relating to the plan which should be adopted to carry into effect the purpose of this Conference . I wish to propose it . We have come together upon the invitation of the glorious old commonwealth of Virginia , the mother of States and Statesmen . We have come from the North and the South , from the East and the West , to see whether our wisdom can devise some means to avert the dangers which threaten to destroy this noble Republic , founded by the wisdom and patriotism of our ancestors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The storm is threatening . The horizon is covered with dark and portentous clouds . Section is arrayed against section , and already seven of our sister States have separated from us and are proceeding to establish an independent Confederation . War ! Civil War ! is impending over us . It must be averted ! Who does not know that such a war , among such a people , must be , if it comes , a war of extermination . Mr. PRESIDENT , I move the adoption of the resolution which I now send to the chair . The resolution of Mr. GUTHRIE was read as follows : Resolved , That a committee of one from each State be appointed by the Commissioners thereof , to be nominated to the President , and to be appointed by him , to whom shall be referred the resolutions of the State of Virginia , and the other States represented , and all propositions for the adjustment of existing difficulties between States , with authority to report what they may deem right , necessary , and proper to restore harmony and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Friday next . Mr. SEDDON :  --  It appears to me that the mode pointed out by the resolution introduced by the gentleman from Kentucky , is neither the one most appropriate nor expeditious for accomplishing the result desired . We are convened under the invitation of the State of Virginia ; and the same invitation that brings us here , proposes the basis for our deliberation and action . Virginia has stated what will be satisfactory to her ; not as an ultimatum , but as a basis of adjustment . It appears to me that the proper course would be , to take up the propositions of Virginia  --  propose amendments to them  --  discuss them , and in the end determine how far they shall be adopted . The adoption of the resolution proposed , transfers the labors of this Conference , not in itself too large for convenient deliberation , to a committee . That committee is to discuss the various propositions offered and report the result . What , in the mean time , is this Conference to do ? Nothing whatever ! We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one knows how long , until this committee reports , and then the discussion will commence which ought to commence now . Mr. PRESIDENT , if any thing is accomplished , it must be accomplished speedily . Events are on the wing . Already in my State the delegates are elected to a Convention , which is to meet next week , to consider the subject which now engrosses the minds of the American people . I hope my suggestion may meet with favor in the Conference . Mr. EWING :  --  I can not agree with the gentleman from Virginia , for reasons which must be obvious to all . I do not think Virginia intended to dictate the terms upon which we were to act . I am in favor of the resolution , but would make one suggestion in relation to it . By its terms the committee is to report on Friday , if it can properly do so . I suggest that the committee should have leave to sit during the sessions of the Conference . In this way our business may be greatly expedited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the modification proposed by the gentleman from Ohio . I should have incorporated it into my resolution . The resolution as modified was then adopted by the Conference without a division . The PRESIDENT :  --  I will take this occasion to announce a committee to carry into effect the determination of the Conference relating to the obtaining of the services of clergymen to open the proceedings of the Conference daily with prayer . The Chair appoints as such committee , Mr. RANDOLPH , of New Jersey , Mr. WICKLIFFE , of Kentucky , and Mr. JOHNSON , of Maryland . Mr. JOHNSON :  --  It appears to me very appropriate , in view of the occasion which has brought us together , that the members of this Conference should pay their respects in a body to the President of the United States . I therefore move that we call upon him in a body at such a time as will be most agreeable to him ; such time to be ascertained by the President of this Conference . Which motion was unanimously agreed to . Mr. CLAY :  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the report of the Committee on Rules and Organization not yet adopted was recommitted to that committee . I do this in order that the Conference may now proceed to the consideration of those rules which may be adopted without much difference of opinion . The vote was thereupon reconsidered , and the following rules were severally read and adopted . The remaining rules recommended were recommitted to the committee : RULES . I. A Convention to do business , shall consist of the Commissioners of not less than seven States ; and all questions shall be decided by the greater number of those which be fully represented . But a less number than seven may adjourn from day to day . II .

X. Committees shall be appointed by the President , unless otherwise ordered by the Convention . XI . A member may be called to order by another member , as well as by the President , and may be allowed to explain his conduct or expressions supposed to be reprehensible .

After the adoption of the foregoing Rules , the Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock to-morrow morning . FOURTH DAY . WASHINGTON , THURSDAY , February 7th , 1861 . The Conference convened , pursuant to the adjournment yesterday , at 10 o'clock A.M. It was called to order by President TYLER , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Journal of yesterday was read , and after sundry amendments , was approved . Messrs . J.H. PULESTON , JOHN STRYKER , W.W. HOPPIN , Jr. , and  --   - -  Olcott , took their places as Assistant Secretaries . President TYLER :  --  Gentlemen of the Conference , as directed by the resolution which you adopted yesterday , I addressed a note to the President of the United States , asking at what hour it would be agreeable to him that this Conference should call on him in a body . To this note I have received a reply which will be read by the Secretary . The Secretary then read the following note from the President : EXECUTIVE MANSION , February 6th , 1861 . My DEAR SIR :  --  I shall feel greatly honored to receive the gentlemen composing the Convention of Commissioners from the several States , on any day and at any hour most convenient to themselves . I shall name to-morrow ( Thursday ) at 11 or 3 o'clock , though any other time would be equally agreeable to me . I shall at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yours , very respectfully , JAMES BUCHANAN . His Excellency , JOHN TYLER . The PRESIDENT :  --  What order will the Conference take upon the subject ? Mr. GUTHRIE :  --  I move that the members of this Conference call in a body upon the President of the United States this morning , at 11 o'clock . Mr. GUTHRIE 'S motion was adopted unanimously . Mr. SUMMERS :  --  I am instructed by the Committee on Credentials further to report , that the committee have examined the credentials of the following gentlemen , and find them duly accredited as members of this body : New York.  --  William E. Dodge . Tennessee.  --  Samuel Milligan , Josiah M. Anderson , Robert L. Carruthers , Thomas Martin , Isaac R. Hawkins , R.J. McKinney , Alvin Cullom , William P. Hickerson , George W. Jones , F.K. Zollicoffer , William H. Stephens , A.W.O. Totten . Illinois.  --  John Wood , Stephen T. Logan , John M. Palmer , Burton C. Cook , Thomas J. Turner . Which report was accepted , and the names of the Commissioners were entered upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ordered , but no provision has been made for paying for it . The Committee on Rules have therefore requested me to report the following resolution : Resolved , That the Secretary procure for the use of the Convention the necessary stationery , and also provide for such printing as may be ordered . That the Journal , up to and including this day 's proceeding , as well as the Rules , be printed for the use of the members . The resolution of Mr. WICKLIFFE was agreed to . The PRESIDENT :  --  The respective delegations have recommended , and the Chair announces the names of the following gentlemen to compose the committee ordered to be raised under the resolution of Mr. GUTHRIE , which was adopted yesterday :  --  New Hampshire , Asa Fowler ; Vermont , Hiland Hall ; Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , Samuel Ames ; Connecticut , Roger S. Baldwin ; New Jersey , Joseph F. Randolph ; Pennsylvania , Thomas White ; Delaware , Daniel M. Bates ; North Carolina , Thomas Ruffin ; Kentucky , James Guthrie ; Ohio , Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen T. Logan ; Iowa , James Harlan ; Maryland , Reverdy Johnson ; Virginia , James A. Seddon . Mr. WICKLIFFE :  --  The Committee on Rules have further considered the rule relating to the secrecy of the debates and proceedings of this body , and their convictions as to the necessity and propriety of its adoption remain unchanged . The prospect of an ultimate agreement among the Commissioners composing this body , in the opinion of the committee , would be materially lessened if all or any of its debates should be made public , for reasons which have already been stated . If any gentleman should desire to communicate with the Executive or Legislative authorities of his State any facts , during the progress of our business , I apprehend little difficulty would be experienced in obtaining the leave of the Convention . We therefore recommend the following Rule : XIX . That nothing spoken in the Convention be printed , or otherwise published or communicated , without leave . Mr. SEDDON :  --  I do not desire to discuss the adoption of the rule under consideration any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State of Virginia are appointed under resolutions which make it their duty to communicate from time to time with her deliberative assemblies . We do not wish to have our right to do so subject to the action of this or any other body . It is no answer to this to say , that there is no doubt that the leave to make the necessary communications will be accorded to us when we ask it . We do not wish to ask it . We insist upon our rights in this respect , as it is our duty to the State that sent us here to do . The rule was adopted upon a count of the members voting . On motion , the Convention adjourned . After the adjournment , the Convention in a body called upon the PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES , when the several delegations were introduced by President TYLER , and the several Commissioners were presented by the chairmen of the several delegations . FIFTH DAY . WASHINGTON , FRIDAY , February 8th , 1861 . The Convention was called to order at 12 o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUTLER . After sundry amendments , the Journal was approved . Mr. SUMMERS :  --  I am directed by the Committee on Credentials to report that they find the following gentlemen duly accredited as members of the Convention : New York.  --  David Dudley Field , William Curtis Noyes , James S. Wadsworth , Erastus Corning , Amaziah B. James , James C. Smith , Addison Gardner , Greene C. Bronson , John A. King , John E. Wool . Massachusetts.  --  John Z. Goodrich , John M. Forbes , Richard P. Waters , Theophilus P. Chandler , Francis B. Crowninshield , George S. Boutwell , Charles Allen . Missouri.  --  John D. Coalter , Alexander W. Doniphan , Waldo P. Johnson , Aylett H. Buckner , Harrison Hough . On motion of the respective delegations the following gentlemen were added to the committee raised on the resolution of Mr. GUTHRIE : New York.  --  Mr. Field . Missouri.  --  Mr. Doniphan . Tennessee.  --  Mr. Zollicoffer . Mr. GUTHRIE :  --  I am instructed by the committee raised upon the resolution introduced by myself , to inform the Convention that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the suggestion made at the time they were appointed . Several States are yet unrepresented on the committee , and delegations from some of them have only arrived this morning . I am therefore directed to ask for further time to make a report , assuring the Convention , at the same time , that a report will be made at soon as a proper regard to the interests of all sections will permit it to be done . Mr. CLAY :  --  I move that the time for the report of the committee be extended until Monday next . As in the mean time there will be little business for the Convention to do , and that of a formal character , it might be as well to adjourn from this time until Monday ; and I move further , that if delegates arrive from States now unrepresented , they may present their credentials to the committee , and if no question arises on them , they may then select a member of the committee on Mr. GUTHRIE 'S resolution , and report his name to the Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adjournment until Monday . We can meet here to-morrow and do any business which may come before us . The several motions of Mr. CLAY , with the alteration suggested by Mr. SEDDON , were then agreed to without a division . Mr. ELLIS :  --  I move that the President be requested to issue cards of admission to the members and officers of this Convention . Which motion was adopted . Mr. HITCHCOCK :  --  I would like to understand whether we all construe the rule referring to the secrecy of our transactions alike . I am told that different constructions are placed upon it by different members , and would suggest the propriety of the PRESIDENT 'S giving his views of the meaning of the rule . The PRESIDENT :  --  I understand , by the correct interpretation of the rule , that nothing which is said or done in the Convention having reference to any subject of business in it , can be spoken of or disclosed to any but members . The Convention then adjourned . SIXTH DAY . WASHINGTON , SATURDAY , February 9th , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRESIDENT . Prayer was offered by Rev. Dr. BULLOCK . The Journal was read , corrected , and approved . Mr. SUMMERS :  --  I am directed by the Committee on Credentials to report as members of this Convention the names of the following gentlemen from the State of Maine :  --  William P. Fessenden , Lot M. Morrill , Daniel E. Somes , John J. Perry , Ezra B. French , Freeman H. Morse , Stephen Coburn , Stephen C. Foster . Mr. MORRILL , of Maine , and Mr. CROWNINSHIELD , of Massachusetts , were announced as members of the committee under the resolution of Mr. GUTHRIE . Mr. TUCK :  --  I offer certain resolutions , which I desire to have printed and referred to the Committee on Resolutions . The resolutions of Mr. TUCK were read , ordered to be printed , and referred . ( These resolutions will be found on a subsequent page . ) Mr. CLAY :  --  I hold in my hand the proceedings of a very large Democratic meeting recently held at New Haven , in the State of Connecticut . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotion to the Union , and expressing an anxious desire for the settlement of the difficult questions now before the country . They have been sent to me with a request that I should lay them before this Convention . Why I was selected by them for the performance of this duty , I do not know , unless it was because , from my name and associations , they thought an assurance might be found that I participated in the sentiments expressed in the resolutions . I present them with great pleasure , and ask that they may be referred to the Committee on Resolutions . The motion of Mr. CLAY was agreed to . Mr. RANDOLPH :  --  I move that the Secretary be requested to furnish for the use of the members a printed list of the delegates to and officers of this Convention . Which motion was adopted , and the Convention adjourned . SEVENTH DAY . WASHINGTON , MONDAY , February 11th , 1861 . The Convention was called to order by the PRESIDENT . Prayer was offered by Rev. Dr. GURLEY . After the reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Committee on Resolutions , asked for further time to make a general report of the matters submitted to them , which was given ; and thereupon Mr. GUTHRIE , from the same Committee , made the following report upon the resolutions of a meeting in the State of Connecticut , which were referred to that committee on motion of Mr. CLAY : The committee to whom were referred certain resolutions of the Democratic party of the State of Connecticut , report that in the opinion of the committee it is inexpedient for this Convention to act upon any resolution purporting to emanate from any political party whatever ; and that the member of the Convention by whom they were presented have leave to withdraw the same . The PRESIDENT :  --  I take this opportunity to announce to the Convention that the Door-keeper of the House of Representatives has transmitted to the Chair cards admitting members of this body on to the floor of the House . These cards will be delivered by the Secretary to such members as call for them . Mr. CHASE :  --  I move that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have considered by the Committee on Resolutions and Propositions , may be presented to the committee through the Secretary , without being presented in Convention . The motion was agreed to , and on motion the Convention adjourned until Wednesday the 13th instant , at 12 o'clock M. EIGHTH DAY . WASHINGTON , WEDNESDAY , February 13th , 1861 . The Convention was called to order by the PRESIDENT , and prayer was offered by Rev. Dr. EDWARDS . The Journal , after sundry amendments , was approved . Mr. GUTHRIE :  --  The Committee on Resolutions , &c.,; have labored diligently , and held protracted sessions , in the hope of being able to make their report to-day . This they find themselves unable to do . They are fully impressed with the necessity of immediate action , in view of the short time that will remain for Congress to consider the action of this Convention , if it shall become necessary to submit any proposition of this body to be acted upon by that . I have no doubt we shall be able to report on Friday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a report . The request of Mr. GUTHRIE was acceded to . Mr. SEDDON :  --  The time has now arrived when , as one of the Commissioners from the State of Virginia , I find it necessary to ask the leave of the Convention to communicate to the Legislative authorities of Virginia , and to her Convention now in session , the state of the proceedings before this body , and the committee . I ask for liberty to do so , and believe that a proper regard to the instructions of the Legislature of the State under which my appointment is made , requires that my request should be granted . Mr. BARRINGER offered the following resolution : Resolved , That the Commissioners of any State represented in this Convention , upon their joint application , have leave to communicate to the Legislature , Governor , or Convention of said State , the proceedings of this body , or so much thereof as they may deem expedient . Mr. SEDDON :  --  The passage of this resolution is all I ask . Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN :  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But not to communicate what has transpired in the committee , before said committee has reported to the Convention . " Mr. SEDDON :  --  I do not deem the passage of the resolution at this moment as very important . At the suggestion of several gentlemen , I will move to lay it on the table , subject to be called up after Friday . The Convention then adjourned to Friday at 12 o'clock . On the evening of February 13th , the members of the Conference were informed of the death of Hon. JOHN C. WRIGHT , of Ohio , who officiated as temporary chairman previous to the permanent organization . In view of the anxious desire of all the members to recognize their appreciation of this act of Divine Providence , in removing from the sphere of his earthly labors one of the most valued Commissioners in attendance , President TYLER was requested to summon a special meeting of the Conference . In pursuance of his invitation , all the members attended on the morning of February 14th , when the following proceedings were had : THURSDAY , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met in special session , pursuant to the call of the President . The proceedings were opened with prayer by the Rev. Dr. HALL . The following letter from the Secretary , CRAFTS J. WRIGHT , was read , and ordered to be entered upon the minutes : WILLARD 'S HOTEL , WASHINGTON CITY , February 13th , 1861 . Hon. JOHN TYLER , President of Conference Convention . DEAR SIR :  --  I grieve to communicate to you the fact , that the delegate from Ohio to this Conference Convention , the Hon. JOHN C. WRIGHT , departed this life this day , the 13th February , at half-past one o'clock . Judge WRIGHT came to this Convention with a heart filled with fear for the safety of the Union . Though at an advanced age and nearly blind , he was filled with an earnest desire to add his efforts to that of others of the Convention called by the State of Virginia , and seek to agree on some measures honorable to each and all , to effect the object . Since the arrival of my father in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect the end in view , and he has had his heart cheered with the belief that the object would be accomplished . Almost the last words that he uttered were , that he believed the Union would be preserved . He desired me to say , if the Union were preserved , he would die content . He called me to read to him , at 12 o'clock , the sections in the Constitution in regard to counting the votes , and this request , and this reading , terminated his knowledge on earth . In this desire of my father to do what he could , he pressed me to accompany him on account of his blindness . Since the Convention honored me with the appointment of Secretary , he required of me a promise that I would not leave the position . When I read the section of the Constitution to him , he required me then to leave him for the Convention . Whatever my personal feelings may be , I deem the pledge made sacred . I therefore ask that I may have leave of absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and return to my duty . Respectfully , CRAFTS J. WRIGHT . P.S.  --  J. HENRY PULESTON will act for me in my absence . The PRESIDENT informed the Convention that the request of the Secretary had been complied with . The PRESIDENT asked what action the Convention proposed to take on the subject for which they had been specially assembled . The Hon. SALMON P. CHASE , of Ohio , then said :  --  Mr. PRESIDENT , since we assembled yesterday in this Hall , it has pleased God to remove one of our number from all participation in the concerns of earth . It is my painful duty to announce to the Convention that JOHN C. WRIGHT , one of the Commissioners from Ohio , is no more . Full of years , honored by the confidence of the people , rich in large experience and ripened wisdom , and devoted in all his affections and all his powers to his country , and his whole country , he has been called from our midst at the very moment when the prudence and patriotism of his counsels seemed most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Judge WRIGHT was born in Wethersfield , Connecticut , on the 10th of August , 1784 . The death of his parents made him an orphan in infancy ; and he had little to depend upon in youth and early manhood , save his own energies and God 's blessing . He was married , while young , to a daughter of Thomas Collier , of Litchfield , and for several years after resided at Troy , New York . When about twenty-six years old he removed to Steubenville , in Ohio , where he commenced the practice of the law , and rapidly rose to distinction in the profession . In 1822 he was elected a representative in Congress , where he became the associate and friend of Clay and Webster , and proved himself , on many occasions , worthy of their association and friendship . After serving several terms in Congress , he was elected a Judge of the Supreme Court of Ohio , and , in 1834 , removed from Steubenville to the city of Cincinnati . Resigning his seat soon afterwards , he resumed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the improvement and elevation of the profession , established , in association with others , the Cincinnati law school . In 1840 , upon the dying request of CHARLES HAMMOND , the veteran editor of the " Cincinnati Gazette , " Judge WRIGHT assumed the editorial control of that Journal , and retained that position until impaired vision , in 1853 , admonished him of the necessity of withdrawing from labors too severe . Thenceforward engaged in moderate labors , surrounded by affectionate relatives , enjoying the respect and confidence of his fellow-citizens , and manifesting always the liveliest concern in whatever related to the welfare and honor of his State and his country , he lived in tranquil retirement , until called by the Governor of Ohio , with the approbation of the Senate , to take part in the deliberations of this Conference Convention . It was but a just tribute , sir , to his honored age , illustrated by abilities , by virtues , and by services , that he was unanimously selected as its temporary President . His interest in the great purpose of our assembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auspicious result of its deliberations were active and constant . And when fatal disease assailed his life , and his enfeebled powers yielded to its virulence , his last utterances were of the Constitution and the Union . Mr. PRESIDENT , Judge WRIGHT was my friend . His approval cheered and encouraged my own humble labors in the service of the State . Pardon me if I mingle private with public grief . He has gone from his last great labor . He was not permitted to witness upon earth the result of the mission upon which he and his associates , who here mourn his loss , were sent . God grant that the clouds which now darken over us may speedily disperse , and that through generous counsels and patriotic labors , guided by that good Providence which directed our fathers in its original formation , the Union of our States may be more than ever firmly cemented and established . Mr. PRESIDENT , I offer the following resolutions : Resolved , That in the death of our late venerable colleague , the Hon. JOHN C. WRIGHT , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nation at large , of one of our most sagacious statesmen and distinguished patriots ; and to the cause of Union and conciliation , one of its most illustrious supporters . Resolved , That while we deplore with saddened hearts the affliction with which an All-wise Providence has visited us , we know that no transition from life to immortality could have been more grateful to him who has fallen than this , in which his life has been offered a willing sacrifice in an effort to restore harmony to his distracted country . Resolved , That the members of this Convention tender their heartfelt sympathies to the family of the deceased in this their great affliction . Resolved , That these resolutions be spread upon the records of this body , and a copy of the same be transmitted to the family of the deceased . Mr. CHARLES A. WICKLIFFE , of Kentucky , moved the adoption of the resolutions , and said : Mr. PRESIDENT , I rise to tender my most cordial sanction and second to the resolutions which have just been read . Mr. WRIGHT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . We served together during a period when party excitement ran high upon questions more of a personal than a constitutional character . I can bear witness not only to his ability , but to his personal integrity , and his purity of political action through our term of service in the House of Representatives . I have seldom met him since we separated at the termination of his service and mine in that body , which occurred at pretty near the same period ; but whenever I have met him , I have found him the same stern advocate of the Union and of constitutional liberty . I rejoiced , therefore , when I found him in this hall on the day we first assembled here . I knew his conservative disposition and principles , and I promised myself that with his aid I could be more useful to my country and to my State than without him . In conversing with him upon the difficulties which now divide and distract our common country , I found him ready and willing , conscientiously and patriotically , to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent has a right to demand and expect of those who represent a different portion of our Union . And if my friend from Ohio ( Mr. CHASE ) and his colleagues will permit me to mingle my sorrow at the public loss , I will say nothing of the private bereavement of the family of our deceased colleague . I leave him to his country , and to you , with this testimony which I leave to his memory , his honesty of purpose and his patriotic love of country . The Hon. A.W . LOOMIS , of Pennsylvania , said : Mr. PRESIDENT , I desire to mingle my sincere regrets with those of the members of this assemblage at the sad and unexpected occurrence which deprived us of an able , experienced , and patriotic associate . My relations with the deceased were , for many years , probably more intimate than those which existed between him and any other member of this Convention . Forty years have elapsed since I first made his acquaintance . He was then in full , active , and extensive practice ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful advocate . During the succeeding year I came to the bar , and resided and practiced in the same judicial circuit with our departed friend . For many years the most kind and intimate relations existed between us  --  sometimes colleagues , but usually opponents . So kind and genial was his nature , so fair and liberal his practice , that during our entire intercourse not an unkind word was uttered , and , so far as I know or believe , not an unpleasant feeling existed in the bosom of either . Though not gifted with the highest order of eloquence , he was clear , distinct , and persuasive . His style of speaking resembled not the babbling brook or the dashing cataract , but usually the limpid stream , gliding gracefully amid fields and fruits and flowers , though sometimes assuming the power and proportions of the majestic river , cutting its sure and certain way to the mighty ocean . His professional position , his kindness of heart , and genial humor , made him an object of high respect and warm regard among his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes in review the pleasant incidents which marked our social and professional intercourse , the smitten heart shrinks in sadness and sorrow from the contemplation of our bereavement . He adorned , sir , the bar , the bench , and the halls of Legislation . He discharged , in all the relations of life , his obligations with fidelity . Of him it might be truly said : His life hath flowed a sacred stream , in whose calm depths The beautiful and pure alone are mirrored ; Which , though shapes of ill may hover o'er the surface , Glides in light , and takes no shadows from them . But , sir , the great crowning virtue and glory of his life was his acceptance of the mission which brought him here . Though whitened by the frosts of nearly eighty winters , neither lofty mountains nor intervening space could restrain his patriotic heart from a prompt response to the call of his country to mingle his influence in a sincere and sacred effort to save the Constitution and perpetuate the Union . He accepted the great trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the discharge of his duty . He has justly earned a title to the gratitude and respect of his country . May we not , sir , fondly hope that he , who was called from the discharge of such duties to the presence of his God , has passed from the sorrows of earth to the happiness of Heaven , and to the full fruition of joys pure , perfect , and eternal ? The Hon. THOMAS EWING , of Ohio , said :  --  I rise to bear my tribute of respect to the memory of the deceased . I have known him long . On my first entrance into active life , at the bar , I found him an able and distinguished member . Since that time down to the present day , he has been largely associated , in mind and person , with all the acts and progress , professional and political , of my life . I feel his loss intensely ; and I feel it with more regret , because I know that on this occasion his voice would have been potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us who labor most earnestly for the preservation of the Union . I tender my sympathies to the family of the deceased . I unite with them in their regrets and in their hopes of the happy future to which he may have attained . The Hon. WILLIAM C. RIVES , of Virginia , said :  --  Though wholly unprepared to say any thing worthy of the solemnity of this occasion , I feel that I should be wanting , sir , in that sentiment of respect which is due to the character of a distinguished citizen , if I were not to add to what has been so eloquently spoken by others , a few words of personal recollection in regard to our deceased friend Judge WRIGHT . It so happened that we entered the public councils of the country at the same moment , and continued in them for the same period of time . It is now just thirty-seven years since I had the pleasure of meeting Judge WRIGHT , for the first time , in the House of Representatives of the United States . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days . My honorable friend from Kentucky ( Governor WICKLIFFE ) , who has already so feelingly addressed the Convention , will recollect that on the roll of the House of Representatives at that time stood the names of WEBSTER and EVERETT , of OAKLEY and STORRS , of SARGEANT and of HEMPHILL , of LEWIS McLANE , of the immortal CLAY , and BARBOUR and RANDALL , and other gentlemen known to fame from the State which I have the honor to represent in this body , and LIVINGSTON of Louisiana , McDUFFIE and HAMILTON of South Carolina , and other gentlemen who , on the spur of the occasion , I am not now able to recall , but whose names will forever shine upon the rolls of their country 's glory . And yet in that body Judge WRIGHT , then in the maturity of his powers , though not previously known to the nation , vindicated an equal rank in debate with those gentlemen whose names I have mentioned . Sir , I shall never forget with what earnestness , with what manliness , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his convictions of public duty , whatever they were , in that consecrated hall . After remaining here , I think , for six years , he retired to his own State for the purpose of assuming the duties of a highly-important and dignified office , which was soon followed by his retirement into the bosom of private life , where he met a rich and ample solace for the storms of his public career . He was followed there by the respect of his fellow-citizens throughout the country , and the confidence of his own State , as we have recently seen , by his being called from that honorable retirement to take part in the grave and solemn duties of this assembly . Sir , he came among us in obedience to the solemn call of patriotic duty , at a most exigent and distressing period in our national annals . He came here on an errand of peace , in the spirit of peace and conciliation . Such was the feeling entertained toward him by the whole of this assembly , that without the slightest preconcert , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent to preside during the preliminary stages of the organization of this Convention . I had an opportunity , from time to time , of private conversation with the aged statesman . I found no member of the assembly I met here , and , indeed , I have found nowhere any citizen of this wide Republic of ours , whose heart was more deeply imbued with the spirit of conciliation and of peace  --  of that spirit which was so solemnly and impressively uttered in his last prayer , " May the Union be preserved . " Sir , it is not given to mortal man to choose the manner of his death ; but if such were the privilege accorded to any human being , what more glorious end could he , appreciating a true fame , covet , than that which has been the lot of our departed friend ? Sir , I speak what I feel , and I dare say I express a sentiment which has impressed itself upon many other bosoms in this assembly , when I say that his sudden death in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some degree to canonize  --  our labors . This manifestation of the visible hand of God among us , brings us in the immediate presence of those solemn responsibilities which attach themselves to the discharge of our duties here . I doubt not that every member of this assembly is already deeply impressed with the solemnity of those duties , and I feel convinced that there are few , if any , in this assembly , who would not lay down their fleeting and feverish existence , and follow our deceased brother to his final account , if by doing so they could restore peace and harmony to this glorious Republic of ours . It does not become me to make any professions of devotion to my country  --  to my whole country  --  but this I will say , in the spirit of the last prayer of my friend , that I should regard my poor life , such as it is , a cheap purchase  --  the cheapest imaginable purchase  --  for that great boon to our country , the restoration of its peace , of its harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glory . The question was taken , and the resolutions were unanimously adopted . The body of Judge WRIGHT was then brought into the hall , preceded by Rev. Dr. HALL , who read the impressive service of the Episcopal Church . A number of the members of the family , and of the friends of the deceased , were present during the services . The funeral cortege proceeded from the hall to the depot of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad . The following gentlemen were designated to act as pall-bearers on the occasion : Mr. Ewing , Mr. Hitchcock , Mr. Chase , Mr. Loomis , Mr. Backus , Mr. Wolcott , Mr. Sherman , Mr. Vinton , Mr. Groesbeck , Mr. Stanton , Mr. Harlan , Mr. Gurley . The proceedings upon the death of Judge WRIGHT were , by the Conference , ordered to be published , and the special session closed . NINTH DAY . WASHINGTON , FRIDAY , February 15th , 1861 . The Convention was called to order by President TYLER , and prayer was offered by Rev. Mr. RENNER . The Journals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRESIDENT :  --  I have this morning received several communications from different persons , which will be laid before the Convention . One is an invitation from HORATIO STONE , inviting the members of the Convention to visit his studio ; also , a resolution of the House of Representatives , authorizing the admission of members of this Convention to the floor of the House . Also , a letter from J.E . SANDS , offering to the Convention certain flags which possess historical interest , from the fact that they were used in the convention which adopted the present Constitution of the United States . Also , a communication from HORATIO G. WARNER . The communications were severally read and laid upon the table . Mr. SUMMERS :  --  I am instructed by the Committee on Credentials to inform the Convention that the committee has received satisfactory evidence of the appointment by the Executive of Ohio of C.P. WOLCOTT , as a delegate to this Convention , in the place of JOHN C. WRIGHT , deceased . Mr. ORTH :  --  I desire to offer the following resolutions , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convention . I have no purpose to admit spectators to seats on this floor , but in my judgment it is the right of the country to know what we are doing here . My constituents will not be satisfied with my course , unless I take means to give the public knowledge of all our transactions . I am aware that this is an invasion of the rule already adopted , requiring secrecy , but in my opinion no possible harm can come from the daily publication of our debates . It is far better that true reports of these debates should be made , than that the distorted and perverted accounts which we see daily in the New York papers should be continued . The resolutions were read , and are as follows : Resolved , That Rules Sixteen ( 16 ) and Eighteen ( 18 ) of this Convention be , and the same hereby are , rescinded . Resolved , That the President is hereby authorized to grant cards of admission to reporters of the press , not exceeding  --   --  in number , which shall entitle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of reporting its proceedings . Resolved , That no person be admitted to the floor of the Convention , except the members , officers , or reporters . Mr. WICKLIFFE :  --  I do not wish to prolong this discussion myself , nor to cause it to be prolonged by others . I am sure that if we permit our debates to be reported , we shall never reach a conclusion which will in the slightest degree benefit the country . Every member will in that event wish to make a set speech , some of them three or four . I wish to have our time used in consultation and in action , not consumed in political speech-making . I do not care what the newspapers say of us . I know their accounts are distorted ; but they would be distorted if we admitted reporters . Some of them assail us as a convention of compromisers  --  as belonging to the sandstone stratum of politics . Mr. CHASE :  --  That is the formation which supports all others . Mr. WICKLIFFE :  --  I know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stratum which supports and preserves the Union and the country . Let us go on as we have begun , preserving secrecy ; keeping our own counsels ; making no speeches for outside consumption or personal reputation . Let us all keep steadily in mind the accomplishment of the great and good purpose which brought us here , and nothing else . Mr. RANDOLPH :  --  New Jersey does not wish to have time consumed in making speeches . I think we should proceed at once to hear the report of the committee . I move that the resolutions offered be laid upon the table . Mr. ORTH :  --  I suppose this motion cuts off debate . I should much have preferred to discuss the resolutions . I hope the motion will not prevail . The motion to lay on the table passed in the affirmative by a viva voce vote . The PRESIDENT :  --  Is the General Committee upon Propositions prepared to report ? If it is , their report is now in order . Mr. GUTHRIE :  --  That committee has given earnest and careful consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time been presented to it . It has held numerous and protracted sessions , and the differences of opinion naturally existing between the members have been discussed in a spirit of candor and conciliation . The committee have not been so fortunate as to arrive at an unanimous conclusion . A majority of its members , however , have agreed upon a report which we think ought to be satisfactory to all sections of the Union , one which if adopted will , we believe , accomplish the purpose so much desired by every patriotic citizen . We think it will give peace to the country . In their behalf I have now the honor to submit , for the consideration of the Conference , the following : PROPOSALS OF AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES . ARTICLE 1 . In all the territory of the United States not embraced within the limits of the Cherokee treaty grant , north of a line from east to west on the parallel of 36 degrees 30 minutes north latitude , involuntary servitude , except in punishment of crime , is prohibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the territory south of said line , the status of persons owing service or labor , as it now exists , shall not be changed by law while such territory shall be under a Territorial government ; and neither Congress nor the Territorial government shall have power to hinder or prevent the taking to said territory of persons held to labor or involuntary service , within the United States , according to the laws or usages of the State from which such persons may be taken , nor to impair the rights arising out of said relations , which shall be subject to judicial cognizance in the federal courts , according to the common law ; and when any territory north or south of said line , within such boundary as Congress may prescribe , shall contain a population required for a member of Congress , according to the then federal ratio of representation , it shall , if its form of government be republican , be admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the original States , with or without involuntary service or labor , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . Territory shall not be acquired by the United States , unless by treaty ; nor , except for naval and commercial stations and depots , unless such treaty shall be ratified by four-fifths of all members of the Senate . ARTICLE 3 . Neither the Constitution , nor any amendment thereof , shall be construed to give Congress power to regulate , abolish , or control within any State or Territory of the United States , the relation established or recognized by the laws thereof touching persons bound to labor or involuntary service therein , nor to interfere with or abolish involuntary service in the District of Columbia without the consent of Maryland and without the consent of the owners , or making the owners who do not consent just compensation ; nor the power to interfere with or prohibit representatives and others from bringing with them to the City of Washington , retaining , and taking away , persons so bound to labor ; nor the power to interfere with or abolish involuntary service in places under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States within those States and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power to prohibit the removal or transportation , by land , sea , or river , of persons held to labor or involuntary service in any State or Territory of the United States to any other State or Territory thereof where it is established or recognized by law or usage ; and the right during transportation of touching at ports , shores , and landings , and of landing in case of distress , shall exist . Nor shall Congress have power to authorize any higher rate of taxation on persons bound to labor than on land . ARTICLE 4 . The third paragraph of the second section of the fourth article of the Constitution shall not be construed to prevent any of the States , by appropriate legislation , and through the action of their judicial and ministerial officers , from enforcing the delivery of fugitives from labor to the person to whom such service or labor is due . ARTICLE 5 . The foreign slave-trade and the importation of slaves into the United States and their Territories , from places beyond the present limits thereof , are forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third , and fifth articles , together with this article of these amendments , and the third paragraph of the second section of the first article of the Constitution , and the third paragraph of the second section of the fourth article thereof , shall not be amended or abolished without the consent of all the States . ARTICLE 7 . Congress shall provide by law that the United States shall pay to the owner the full value of his fugitive from labor , in all cases where the marshal or other officer , whose duty it was to arrest such fugitive , was prevented from so doing by violence or intimidation , or when , after arrest , such fugitive was rescued by force , and the owner thereby prevented and obstructed in the pursuit of his remedy for the recovery of such fugitive . Mr. BALDWIN :  --  I have not been able to concur in opinion with those members of the committee who have presented the propositions just submitted . I do not deem them fair or equitable to the Free States , nor do I think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one member of the minority , I have drawn up a report embodying my own views and perhaps those of some of my colleagues , which I now present for the consideration of the Conference : MR . BALDWIN 'S MINORITY REPORT . The undersigned , one of the minority of the committee of one from each State , to whom was referred the consideration of the resolutions of the State of Virginia , and the other States represented , and all propositions for the adjustment of existing differences between the States , with authority to report what they deem right , necessary , and proper to restore harmony and preserve the Union , and report thereon , entered upon the duties of the committee with an anxious desire that they might be able to unite in the recommendation of some plan which , on due deliberation , should seem best adapted to maintain the dignity and authority of the Government of the United States , and at the same time secure to the people of every section that perfect equality of right to which they are entitled . Convened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Virginia , in pursuance of the resolutions of the General Assembly of that State , with an accompanying expression of the deliberate opinion of that body that , unless the unhappy controversy which now divides the States shall be satisfactorily adjusted , a permanent dissolution of the Union is inevitable ; and , being earnestly desirous of an adjustment thereof , in concurrence with Virginia , in the spirit in which the Constitution was originally formed , and consistently with its principles , so as to afford to the people of all the States adequate security for all their rights , the attention of the undersigned was necessarily led to the consideration of the extent and equality of our powers , and to the propriety and expediency , under existing circumstances , of a recommendation by this Conference Convention of any specific action by Congress , whether of ordinary legislation , or in reference to constitutional amendments to be proposed by Congress on its own responsibility to the States . A portion of the members of this Convention are delegated by the Legislatures of their respective States , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others are the representatives only of the Executives of their States , and , having no opportunity of consulting the immediate representatives of the people , can only act on their individual responsibility . Among the resolutions and propositions suggesting modes of adjustment appropriate to this occasion which were brought to the notice of the committee , were the resolutions of the State of Kentucky recommending to her sister States to unite with her in an application to Congress for the calling of a Convention in the mode prescribed by the Constitution for proposing amendments thereto . The undersigned , for the reasons set forth in the accompanying resolution , and others which have been herein indicated , is of opinion that the mode of adjustment by a General Convention , as proposed by Kentucky , is the one which affords the best assurance of an adjustment acceptable to the people of every section , as it will afford to all the States which may desire amendments , an opportunity of preparing them with care and deliberation , and in such form as they may deem it expedient to prescribe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates duly chosen and invested with equal powers from all the States . The undersigned did not , therefore , deem it expedient that any of the measures of adjustment proposed by the majority of the committee , should be reported to this body to be discussed or acted upon by them , and he respectfully submits as a substitute for the articles of amendment to the Constitution , reported by the majority of the committee , the following preamble and resolution , and respectfully recommends the adoption thereof . ROGER S. BALDWIN . Whereas , unhappy differences exist which have alienated from each other portions of the people of the United States to such an extent as seriously to disturb the peace of the nation , and impair the regular and efficient action of the Government within the sphere of its constitutional powers and duties ; And whereas , the Legislature of the State of Kentucky has made application to Congress to call a Convention for proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United States ; And whereas , it is believed to be the opinion of the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become necessary to secure to the people of the United States , of every section , the full and equal enjoyment of their rights and liberties , so far as the same may depend for their security and protection on the powers granted to or withheld from the General Government , in pursuance of the national purposes for which it was ordained and established ; And whereas , it may be expedient that such amendments as any of the States may desire to have proposed , should be presented to the Convention in such form as the respective States desiring the same may deem proper ; This Convention does , therefore , recommend to the several States to unite with Kentucky in her application to Congress to call a convention for proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United States , to be submitted to the Legislatures of the several States , or to conventions therein , for ratification , as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by Congress , in accordance with the provision in the fifth article of the Constitution . Mr. FIELD : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of the committee have arrived . I may say that I wholly dissent from them . I have not deemed it necessary to make a separate report . At a suitable time I shall endeavor to make known to the Conference my views upon the topics which have occupied the attention of the committee . Mr. CROWNINSHIELD :  --  I occupy substantially the same position as Mr. FIELD , and shall make my views known at a proper time . Mr. SEDDON :  --  The report presented by the majority , I think , is a wide departure from the course we should have adopted . Virginia has prepared and presented a plan , and has invited this Conference to consider it . I think we ought to take up her propositions , amend and perfect them , if need be , and then adopt or reject them . To avoid all misconstruction as to my individual opinions or position , I have reduced my views to writing , which , with the leave of the Conference , I will now read . No objection being made , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SEDDON . The undersigned , acting on the recommendation of the Commissioners from the State of Virginia , as a member of the committee appointed by this Convention to consider and recommend propositions of adjustment , has not been so happy as to accord with the report submitted by the majority ; and as he more widely dissents from the opinions entertained by the other dissenting members , he feels constrained , in vindication of his position and opinions , to present on his part this brief report , recommending , as a substitute for the report of the majority , a proposition subjoined . To this course he feels the more impelled , by deference to the resolutions of the General Assembly of his State , inviting the assemblage of this Convention , and suggesting a basis of adjustment . These resolutions declare , that " in the opinion of the General Assembly of Virginia the propositions embraced in the resolutions presented to the Senate of the United States by the Hon. JOHN J. CRITTENDEN , so modified as that the first article proposed as an amendment to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory of the United States now held or hereafter acquired south of latitude 36 deg. 30 ' , and provided that slavery of the African race shall be effectually protected as property therein during the continuance of the territorial government , and the fourth article shall secure to the owners of slaves the right of transit with their slaves between and through the non-slaveholding States or Territories , constitute the basis of such an adjustment of the unhappy controversy which now divides the States of this Confederacy , as would be accepted by the people of this Commonwealth . " From this resolution , it is clear that the General Assembly , in its declared opinion of what would be acceptable to the people of Virginia , not only required the Crittenden propositions as a basis , but also held the modifications suggested in addition essential . In this the undersigned fully concurs . But , in his opinion , the propositions reported by the majority do not give , but materially weaken the Crittenden propositions themselves , and fail to accord the modifications suggested . The undersigned therefore , feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitute , the resolutions referred to , as proposed by the Hon. JOHN J. CRITTENDEN , with the incorporation of the modifications suggested by Virginia explicitly expressed , and with some alterations on points which , he is assured , would make them more acceptable to that State , and , as he hopes , to the whole Union . The propositions submitted are appended , marked No. 1 . The undersigned , while contenting himself , in the spirit of the action taken by the General Assembly of his State , with the proposal of that substitute for the majority report , would be untrue to his own convictions , shared , as he believes , by the majority of the commissioners from Virginia , and to his sense of duty , if he did not emphatically declare , as his settled and deliberate judgment , that for permanent safety in this Union , to the slaveholding States , and the restoration of integrity to the Union and harmony and peace to the country , a guarantee of actual power in the Constitution and in the working of the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such guarantee might be most wisely contrived and judiciously adjusted to the frame of the Government , the undersigned forbears now to inquire . He is not exclusively addicted to any special plan , but believing that such guarantee might be adequately afforded by a partition of power in the Senate between the two sections , and by a recognition that ours is a Union of freedom and consent , not constraint and force , he respectfully submits , for consideration by members of the Convention , the plan hereto appended , marked No. 2 . Whether he shall feel bound to invoke the action of the Convention upon it , may depend on the future manifestations of sentiment in this body . All which is respectfully submitted , JAMES A. SEDDON . Commissioner from Virginia . February 15th , 1861 . No. 1 . Joint Resolutions proposing certain amendments to the Constitution of the United States . Whereas , serious and alarming dissensions have arisen between the Northern and Southern States , concerning the rights and security of the rights of the slaveholding States , and especially their rights in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is eminently desirable and proper that those dissensions , which now threaten the very existence of this Union , should be permanently quieted and settled by constitutional provisions , which shall do equal justice to all sections , and thereby restore to the people that peace and good will which ought to prevail between all the citizens of the United States : Therefore , Resolved , by this Convention , that the following articles are hereby approved and submitted to the Congress of the United States , with the request that they may , by the requisite constitutional majority of two-thirds , be recommended to the respective States of the Union , to be , when ratified by Conventions of three-fourths of the States , valid and operative as amendments of the Constitution of the Union . ARTICLE 1 . In all the territory of the United States , now held or hereafter acquired , situate north of latitude thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes , slavery or involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime , is prohibited , while such territory shall remain under territorial government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slavery of the African race is hereby recognized as existing , and shall not be interfered with by Congress , but shall be protected as property by all the departments of the territorial government during its continuance ; and , when any territory , north or south of said line , within such boundaries as Congress may prescribe , shall contain the population requisite for a member of Congress , according to the then federal ratio of representation of the people of the United States , it shall , if its form of government be republican , be admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the original States , with or without slavery , as the Constitution of such new State may provide . ARTICLE 2 . Congress shall have no power to abolish slavery in places under its exclusive jurisdiction , and situate within the limits of States that permit the holding of slaves . ARTICLE 3 . Congress shall have no power to abolish slavery within the District of Columbia , so long as it exists in the adjoining States of Virginia and Maryland , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants , nor without just compensation first made to such owners of slaves as do not consent to such abolishment . Nor shall Congress at any time prohibit officers of the Federal Government , or members of Congress , whose duties require them to be in said District , from bringing with them their slaves , and holding them as such during the time their duties may require them to remain there , and afterwards taking them from the District . ARTICLE 4 . Congress shall have no power to prohibit or hinder the transportation of slaves from one State to another , or to a Territory in which slaves are by law permitted to be held , whether that transportation be by land , navigable rivers , or by the sea . And if such transportation be by sea , the slaves shall be protected as property by the Federal Government . And the right of transit by the owners with their slaves , in passing to or from one slaveholding State or Territory to another , between and through the non-slaveholding States and Territories , shall be protected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress shall have no power to impose on slaves a higher rate of tax than on land , according to their just value . ARTICLE 5 . That , in addition to the provisions of the third paragraph of the second section of the fourth article of the Constitution of the United States , Congress shall provide by law , that the United States shall pay to the owner who shall apply for it , the full value of his fugitive slave , in all cases , when the marshal , or other officer , whose duty it was to arrest said fugitive , was prevented from so doing by violence or intimidation , or when , after arrest , said fugitive was rescued by force , and the owner thereby prevented and obstructed in the pursuit of his remedy for the recovery of his fugitive slave , under the said clause of the Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof . And in all such cases , when the United States shall pay for such fugitive , they shall reimburse themselves by imposing and collecting a tax on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rescue was committed , equal in amount to the sum paid by them , with the addition of interest and the costs of collection ; and the said county or city , after it has paid said amount to the United States , may , for its indemnity , sue and recover from the wrong-doers , or rescuers , by whom the owner was prevented from the recovery of his fugitive slave , in like manner as the owner himself might have sued and recovered . ARTICLE 6 . No future amendment of the Constitution shall affect the five preceding articles , nor the third paragraph of the second section of the first article of the Constitution , nor the third paragraph of the second section of the fourth article of said Constitution , and no amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or give to Congress any power to abolish or interfere with slavery in any of the States , by whose laws it is or may be allowed or permitted . ARTICLE 7 , Sec. 1 . The elective franchise and the right to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ municipal , shall not be exercised by persons who are , in whole or in part , of the African race . And whereas , also , besides those causes of dissension embraced in the foregoing amendments proposed to the Constitution of the United States , there are others which come within the jurisdiction of Congress , and may be remedied by its legislative power : and whereas it is the desire of this Convention , as far its influence may extend , to remove all just cause for the popular discontent and agitation which now disturb the peace of the country , and threaten the stability of its institutions : Therefore , 1 . Resolved , That the laws now in force for the recovery of fugitive slaves are in strict pursuance of the plain and mandatory provisions of the Constitution , and have been sanctioned as valid and constitutional by the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States ; that the slaveholding States are entitled to the faithful observance and execution of those laws , and that they ought not to be repealed , or so modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws ought to be made for the punishment of those who attempt , by rescue of the slave or other illegal means , to hinder or defeat the due execution of said laws . 2 . That all State laws which conflict with the fugitive slave acts , or any other constitutional acts of Congress , or which in their operation impede , hinder , or delay the free course and due execution of any of said acts , are null and void by the plain provisions of the Constitution of the United States . Yet those State laws , void as they are , have given color to practices , and led to consequences which have obstructed the due administration and execution of acts of Congress , and especially the acts for the delivery of fugitive slaves , and have thereby contributed much to the discord and commotion now prevailing . This Convention , therefore , in the present perilous juncture , does not deem it improper , respectfully and earnestly to recommend the repeal of those laws to the several States which have enacted them , or such legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used or perverted to such mischievous purposes . 3 . That the act of the 18th of September , 1850 , commonly called the Fugitive Slave Law , ought to be so amended as to make the fee of the Commissioner , mentioned in the eighth section of the act , equal in amount , in the cases decided by him , whether his decision be in favor of or against the claimant . And to avoid misconstructions , the last clause of the fifth section , of said act , which authorizes the person holding a warrant for the arrest or detention of a fugitive slave , to summon to his aid the posse comitatus , and which declares it to be the duty of all good citizens to assist him in its execution , ought to be so amended as to expressly limit the authority and duty to cases in which there shall be resistance , or danger of resistance or rescue . 4 . That the laws for the suppression of the African slave-trade , and especially those prohibiting the importation of slaves into the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly executed , and all further enactments necessary to those ends ought to be promptly made . No. 2 . Proposed Amendments by Mr. Seddon . To secure concert and promote harmony between the slaveholding and non-slaveholding sections of the Union , the assent of the majority of the Senators from the slaveholding States , and of the majority of the Senators from the non-slaveholding States , shall be requisite to the validity of all action of the Senate , on which the ayes and noes may be called by five Senators . And on a written declaration , signed and presented for record on the Journal of the Senate by a majority of Senators from either the non-slaveholding or slaveholding States , of their want of confidence in any officer or appointee of the Executive , exercising functions exclusively or continuously within the class of States , or any of them , which the signers represent , then such officer shall be removed by the Executive ; and if not removed at the expiration of ten days from the presentation of such declaration , the office shall be deemed vacant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State with the Union is recognized as depending on the continuing assent of its people , and compulsion shall in no case , nor under any form , be attempted by the Government of the Union against a State acting in its collective or organic capacity . Any State , by the action of a convention of its people , assembled pursuant to a law of its Legislature , is held entitled to dissolve its relation to the Federal Government , and withdraw from the Union ; and , on due notice given of such withdrawal to the Executive of the Union , he shall appoint two Commissioners , to meet two Commissioners to be appointed by the Governor of the State , who , with the aid , if needed from the disagreement of the Commissioners , of an umpire , to be selected by a majority of them , shall equitably adjudicate and determine finally a partition of the rights and obligations of the withdrawing State ; and such adjudication and partition being accomplished , the withdrawal of such State shall be recognized by the Executive , and announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State shall not afterwards be readmitted into the Union without the assent of two-thirds of the States constituting the Union at the time of the proposed readmission . Mr. COALTER :  --  It is proper that I should say a word in relation to the position of Missouri in this Conference . It is expressly referred to in the resolution under which we hold our appointment , passed by the Senate and House of Representatives . It is believed by the people of Missouri that the rights and privileges of the slaveholding States are in danger , and that the time has arrived when they should be secured by additional guarantees . Those guarantees must be such as will secure the honor and equal rights of the slaveholding States . I wish to say , further , that we , as Commissioners , must act at all times under the control of the General Assembly or the State Convention of our State . Before we can act definitely upon either of the propositions submitted , I think it will be our duty to transmit them to the General Assembly for instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the Conference . I presume it will be the desire of every member to give them a careful examination . In order to prevent all unnecessary delay , I move that the several reports be laid upon the table , that they be printed at once and distributed to the members , and made the special order of the Conference for 12 o'clock to-morrow . The motion of Mr. WICKLIFFE was agreed to . Mr. WICKLIFFE :  --  I have drawn up a preamble and a resolution which I wish to offer for the consideration of the Conference . I shall not press action upon them to-day , but desire to have them laid on the table and printed . I shall call them up after the report of the General Committee is disposed of . It would gratify me much , and I think greatly tend to the peace and harmony of the country , if they could be adopted at once , and published . It is well known to most of you that there is nothing in all the legislation or action of the Free States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of the slaveholding States , as the passage of the so called " personal liberty " acts . They are regarded as deliberate infractions and breaches of the Constitution , and as attempts to nullify the operation of a constitutional enactment of Congress . But I do not wish to invite discussion upon the subject now ; I hope my motion will not meet with objection . The motion of Mr. WICKLIFFE was adopted , and the preamble and resolution were presented as follows : MR . WICKLIFFE 'S PREAMBLE AND RESOLUTION . Whereas , the second section of the fourth article of the Constitution of the United States declares , " that no person held to service or labor in one State , under the laws thereof , escaping into another , shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein , be discharged from such service or labor , but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due . " This clause is one of the compromises without which no Constitution would have been adopted . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service existed by law , that their rights should be respected and regarded by all the States ; and it is not within the competency of any State to disregard the obligation it imposes , or to render it valueless by legislative enactments . And whereas , the House of Representatives of the United States did , on the  --   --  day of February , by unanimous vote , declare that neither the Congress of the United States nor the people or government of any non-slaveholding State , has the constitutional right to legislate upon , or to interfere with slavery in any slaveholding State in the Union . This declaration is regarded by this Convention as an admission that the statutes of those States , passed for the purpose of defeating the provision of the Constitution aforesaid , and the laws of Congress made to enforce the just and proper execution of this constitutional guarantee , are in violation of the supreme law of the land . The provisions of the statutes in many of the non-slaveholding States , commonly known and called " personal liberty bills , " amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress of February 12th , 1793 , and September 18th , 1850 , and are in violation of the second section of the fourth article of the Constitution , as before stated . That the spirit of those statutes appears to be repugnant to the principles of compromise and mutual and liberal concessions which dictated the section of the Constitution in question , and which pervades every part of that instrument . It is , therefore , respectfully requested by this Convention that the several States abrogate all such obnoxious enactments . That the spirit of comity between the States , and the spirit of unity and fraternity which should actuate all the people of these United States , require that complete right and security of transit with all persons who owe them service or labor should be allowed to the citizens of each State by the laws of every other State . Resolved , That a copy of the foregoing be sent by the President of this Convention to the Governors of each of the free States , as the deliberate judgment and opinion of this Convention , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislatures . Mr. CHASE :  --  I move that all the resolutions , of the States , under which Commissioners have been appointed , or relating to subjects to come before this Conference , be printed . I think this course convenient and necessary , and one reason that I may assign is this : The opinion of the Legislature of the State of Ohio , as expressed in one of the resolutions adopted by that body , is , that it would have been wiser and better if the time for holding this Conference had been deferred until a later period . Ohio has expressly said in her resolutions that she is not prepared to assent to the terms of settlement proposed by Virginia , and has expressed the opinion that the Constitution as it now stands , if fairly interpreted and obeyed , contains ample provision for the correction of all the evils which are claimed to exist . Nevertheless she is willing to meet in a friendly spirit and consult with her sister States . But the opinion extensively prevails that this Conference ought not to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the incoming administration . We , the Commissioners from that State , are instructed in the resolutions , to which I have referred , to use our influence to procure an adjournment of this Conference , before final action is taken , to the 4th of April next . I shall feel it my duty , at some future time , to make a motion to that effect . The extent to which I shall urge its adoption will depend in some measure upon the course of events and the opinions of my colleagues . In the mean time I wish to see all the resolutions printed . The motion of Mr. CHASE was agreed to . The resolutions as printed will be found in the appendix . Mr. ALLEN , of Massachusetts :  --  Before the adjournment to-day I desire to know what will be the order of business when these various reports come up for discussion . By the general rules governing parliamentary proceedings , to which I suppose we are subject , I understand the first question will be upon the substitution of the minority report presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report of the majority ; and that , upon that question , amendments may be offered , and either accepted or rejected , both to the reports of the majority and the minority . I think it would be well to have this matter understood . Am I right in this ? The PRESIDENT :  --  The Chair understands that the gentleman from Massachusetts has correctly pointed out the manner of proceeding . On motion of Mr. HACKLEMAN , the Conference then adjourned until 12 o'clock to-morrow . TENTH DAY . WASHINGTON , SATURDAY , February 16th , 1861 . The Conference was called to order by the PRESIDENT at 12 o'clock M. Prayer was offered by Rev. Dr. SUNDERLAND . The Journal was read by the Assistant Secretary , Mr. PULESTON , and , being corrected , was approved . The PRESIDENT :  --  I have received a communication from Mr. W.C. JEWETT , which I am requested to lay before the Conference . Should any member desire to have it read , it will be presented upon motion . I am not inclined to occupy the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requests that it be read . Mr. SEDDON :  --  Let it be laid on the table without reading . The PRESIDENT :  --  That disposition will be made of it . Mr. WICKLIFFE :  --  I am instructed , by the Committee on Rules and Organization , to propose an amendment to the Eleventh Rule which has been adopted . As the Rule now stands , no appeal is allowed from the decision of the Chair upon questions of order . It is not probable that either the Chair or the Conference would wish to be bound in that way . The purpose of the resolution is to assimilate the Rule in this respect to the practice in parliamentary bodies , and to allow an appeal from the decision of the Chair to the Conference itself . I offer the following resolution : " Resolved , That the Eleventh Rule of this Convention be so amended as to allow an appeal from the decision of the PRESIDENT , which appeal shall be decided without debate . " On the passage of this resolution a division was called for , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it adopted . Mr. WICKLIFFE :  --  I now offer another resolution  --  the following : " Resolved , That in the discussions which may take place in this Convention , no member shall be allowed to speak longer than thirty minutes . " We must all by this time be impressed with the necessity of prompt , immediate , and efficient action . I do not charge any member of the body with any purpose unnecessarily to consume the time of the Convention in making speeches . I have no reason to believe that any such purpose exists . But the present Congress is rapidly drawing to a close . If any plan is adopted it will be nugatory , unless recommended by Congress . If we are to sit here until each member of the Conference has spoken upon each question presented , as many times and as long as he pleases , I fear the Congress will close its labors before we do ours . Mr. DAVIS :  --  I think thirty minutes quite too long . Our opinions are formed . Before this time probably every member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be changed by debate . I move to strike out the word " thirty , " and insert the word " ten . " Mr. HITCHCOCK :  --  I am altogether opposed to this attempt in advance to cut off or limit debate . I am sure it can not meet with favor from the Conference , for reasons so obvious that I will not occupy time in stating them . I move to lay the resolution on the table . Several gentlemen here interposed and appealed to Mr. HITCHCOCK to withdraw his motion , as it would cut off all debate upon the merits of the resolution . Mr. HITCHCOCK accordingly withdrew it . Mr. SEDDON :  --  We have one rule already which prohibits any member from speaking more than twice upon any question without special leave , and a member can not speak a second time until every other , who desires to speak , has spoken . This was the rule , I believe , in the Convention that formed our present Constitution , and no one complained of its operation there . I am as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one can be , and should be among the last to protract our sessions . But this resolution looks too much like suppressing discussion  --  like cutting off debate . I desire at the proper time to be heard upon the report which I have submitted . It will be impossible to discuss the grave questions involved in it in the space of a brief half hour . Mr. CHASE :  --  I hope Governor WICKLIFFE will consent to a postponement of his resolution for the present . It is anticipating a necessity that may not arise . As yet no one has abused the privileges of debate . It is not well to assume in advance that any one will do so . Mr. WICKLIFFE :  --  I have no wish to press this resolution upon the Convention , and it may be as well to postpone it for the present . I will move its postponement until Tuesday morning next . The motion to postpone was unanimously agreed to . Mr. CRISFIELD :  --  I move that the hour of meeting hereafter be ten o'clock in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that we shall all agree that this hour is quite too early . I wish to make all reasonable progress , but I think we shall find it difficult to secure a quorum at that hour . I move to amend by inserting eleven o'clock . Mr. EWING :  --  I think we had better let the hour of meeting remain where our rules leave it . We shall find our labors severe enough if we commence at twelve o'clock . Mr. CRISFIELD :  --  I will accept the amendment of my colleague . Let the time of meeting be eleven o'clock . The motion of Mr. CRISFIELD as amended was agreed to without a division . Mr. CHASE :  --  I have a motion which I desire to make , and as I do not wish to press it to a vote at the present time , I will move to lay it on the table . But I wish to have it before the Conference . It is apparent to me that we ought to pass it at some time , in order to give members who may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opportunity of appearing on the record as they personally wish to vote . I move to amend the first rule by inserting after the word " representing , " the words , " The yeas and nays of the delegates from each State , on any question , shall be entered on the Journal when it is desired by any delegate . " On motion of Mr. CHASE , the amendment was laid upon the table . The PRESIDENT :  --  The Conference will now proceed to the order of the day , the question being upon the several reports presented by the General Committee of one from each State . The chair was taken , at the request of the PRESIDENT , by Mr. ALEXANDER , of New Jersey . Mr. BALDWIN :  --  I move to substitute the report presented by myself for the report of the majority of the Committee . I will consent to strike out that part of it which relates to  --  Mr. TURNER :  --  Before the gentleman from Connecticut proceeds with his argument I trust he will give way for the introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come when we ought to pass such a resolution as I now offer . I am unwilling to sit here longer unless some means are taken to secure a report of our proceedings . The PRESIDENT :  --  A resolution is not now in order . Mr. TURNER :  --  I ask that the resolution may be read for the information of the Conference , and also ask the leave of the Conference for its introduction . The resolution was read . It provided for the appointment of a stenographer . The question was taken , and upon a division the leave to introduce it was refused . Mr. BALDWIN :  --  I rise for the purpose of supporting my motion to substitute the report presented by myself for that presented by the majority of the committee . As I was about to remark , when the resolution just disposed of was introduced , I will consent to strike out all that portion of my report which precedes the words " whereas unhappy differences , " &c.,; in order that the substitute offered may conform more nearly in substance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands that whatever we adopt here should be presented to Congress ; and if it receives the sanction of that body , should be by it presented to the States for their approval . My report when thus amended will be in a proper form for such a disposition . My report , it will be noticed , is based mainly upon the action of the Legislature of Kentucky . I have adopted those resolutions of Kentucky as the basis of my recommendation , on account of the short time which remains for any action at all , and because it appears to me that the kind of proceeding indicated in them is best calculated to meet with favor in the States which must approve any action taken here before it can be made effectual . The resolutions of Virginia , under which this Convention is called , were adopted on the 19th of January last . The resolutions of Kentucky to which I have referred were passed with a full knowledge of the action of Virginia , but I understand from their reading that they were adopted in consequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to favor the line of policy initiated in the resolutions of the State of Kentucky . There are two ways of presenting amendments to the Constitution provided in that instrument . By the first , by Congress whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem such amendments necessary : or by the second , the same body , upon the application of the Legislatures of two-thirds of the States , may call a convention for the purpose of proposing amendments . These two are the only modes in which , under that instrument , amendments can be proposed to the Constitution . Either of these is adequate , and it was the manifest intention of its framers to secure due consideration of any changes which might be proposed to the fundamental law of our Government . It is conceded on all hands that our action here will amount to nothing , unless it meets the approval of Congress , and such proposals of amendment as we shall agree upon are recommended by that body to the States for adoption . The session of the present Congress is drawing to a close . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can transact business . Can any one suppose that in the present state of the country , with the large number of important measures before Congress and awaiting its action , any proposition of real importance emanating from this Conference could be properly considered by either House in this short time ? I am assuming just now that this is a Convention which has the right , under the Constitution or by precedent , to make such propositions . But if we do not remember , most certainly Congress will , that however respectable this body may be , however large may be the constituency which it represents , it is , after all , one which has no existence under , and is not recognized by the Constitution . In a recent speech in the Senate , Judge COLLAMER , of Vermont , one of the ablest lawyers in that body , has more than intimated a doubt whether Congress could , under the Constitution , entertain proposals of amendment presented to it by such a body as this . But , waiving all technicalities , the substantial objection which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed by the majority of the committee is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution . When the people adopted that instrument and subjected themselves to its operation , they intended and had a right to understand that it should be amended only in the manner provided by the Constitution itself . They did not intend that amendments should be proposed under , or the existence of the Constitution endangered by any extraneous pressure whatever . They wisely provided a way in which amendments might be proposed , or rather two ways . Under either of them , due examination and consideration was secured . They would not have consented to any other way of proposing amendments . The General Government , on the adoption of the Constitution , for all national purposes , took the place of the State Governments . The people of the United States from that time , in the language of a distinguished Senator from Kentucky , owed a paramount allegiance to the General Government , and a subordinate allegiance only to the State Governments . Changes in the Constitution , then , can only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Propositions for changes in it must come from the people , or their representatives in Congress . Any attempt to coerce Congress , or to influence its action in a manner not provided by the Constitution , is a disregard of the rights of the people . Why are we assembled here to urge these amendments upon Congress ? to induce Congress to recommend them to the people for adoption ? Are we the representatives of the people of the United States ? Are we acting for them , and as their authorized agents , in this endeavor to press amendments upon the attention of Congress ? Because , if our action is to have any effect at all , it must be to induce Congress to conform to our wishes  --  to propose the very amendments which we prepare . The members of the House of Representatives were elected by the people . They were selected to perform , and they do perform , their duties and functions under the obligations of their official oaths . There is no question about their agency , or their right to act in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people . The Legislature of the State of Kentucky , well understanding and appreciating the only true method in which constitutional amendments should be proposed , with all the formality of a legislative act approved by the Executive of that State , has applied to Congress for the call of a convention for proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United States , and has requested the President to lay those resolutions immediately before Congress . She wishes other States to unite with her in the preparing and proposing of amendments to the Constitution . This is the correct , the legal , the patriotic course . This was what Kentucky had the right to ask , and this is all she has asked . Mr. BALDWIN here read the Kentucky resolutions , as follows : Resolutions recommending a call for a Convention of the United States . Whereas , The people of some of the States feel themselves deeply aggrieved by the policy and measures which have been adopted by some of the people of the other States ; and whereas an amendment of the Constitution of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grievances in the future : Therefore , Resolved , by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky , that application to Congress to call a Convention for proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United States , pursuant to the fifth article thereof , be , and the same is hereby , now made by this General Assembly of Kentucky ; and we hereby invite our sister States to unite with us , without delay , in a similar application to Congress . Resolved , That the Governor of this State forthwith communicate the foregoing resolution to the President of the United States , with the request that he immediately place the same before Congress and the Executives of the several States , with a request that they lay them before their respective Legislatures . Resolved , If the Convention be called in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing resolutions , the Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky suggest for the consideration of that Convention , as a basis for settling existing difficulties , the adoption , by way of amendments to the Constitution , of the resolutions offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHN J. CRITTENDEN . DAVID MERIWETHER , Speaker of the House of Representatives . THOMAS P. PORTER , Speaker of the Senate . Approved January 25 , 1861 . B. MAGOFFIN . By the Governor : THOMAS B. MONROE , JR. , Secretary of State . Mr. BALDWIN continued :  --  Now , what are we asked to do by the majority of the committee ? It is not to unite with Kentucky or to accede to her wishes for a convention of the States , under the Constitution , but to thwart the wishes of Kentucky , and to induce Congress itself to originate and propose amendments , or to propose those which we may originate . Kentucky asks that the people of the States themselves might elect delegates to a convention , who should carefully consider the whole subject . The Kentucky resolutions were transmitted to the President , who sent them to Congress , as he said , with great pleasure . Kentucky stated that she was in favor of the so-called Crittenden resolutions , but she did not request Congress to propose them as amendments to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its members , represent the people of the several States ? Have they had an opportunity to elect delegates , to select those in whom they had confidence and whom they could trust ? Not at all . Why should we assemble here and express our wishes to Congress in reference to the Constitution without permitting California , Oregon , or many other States not here represented , to unite in our deliberations ? I can not assent to such an unfair proceeding toward other States . Suppose one-half the States should request Congress to propose amendments , will Congress agree to it ? No , sir . The Constitution provides that Congress shall not propose amendments without the consent of two-thirds of the States . Congress has not deemed any amendments necessary , so far as we know , and yet a majority of the committee of this body ask Congress to propose the amendments on our responsibility alone . It appears to me , then , that this proceeding must be regarded not as one known to the Constitution , but as a revolutionary proceeding . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opportunity to be so represented . Some of us are acting under the appointment of the Legislatures of our States ; other delegates are simply appointed by the Executives of their States and are acting without any legal authority . We are not standing upon equal ground ; some are only acting upon their own judgment ; others are acting under instructions from their several Legislatures . If the Virginia Legislature itself were here , its action would differ materially from the present views of the delegates from that State . But how is this ? The Resolutions of the Legislature of Virginia make the statement that unless these questions are settled , and settled soon , there is danger of the disruption of the Union . Admit this to be so , and it furnishes no reason for changing the mode of proposing constitutional amendments . The Constitution knows no such danger . It is a self-sustaining Constitution , and was supposed to contain within itself the power to secure its own preservation . The Constitution ought not to be amended without the deliberate action of the people themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . I can not recognize the claim that the secession of a State , by an ordinance of its Convention , can carry either the State or its people out of the Union . There is no such thing as legal secession , for there is no power anywhere to take the people out of the protecting care of the Government , or to relieve them from their obligations to it . And where is the clause in the Constitution that authorizes the call upon Congress to do what Congress is asked to do here ? The Constitution was adopted " to form a more perfect Union . " The people were not to be allowed to alter it , except in the two modes prescribed in it . The Convention which adopted it did not propose that changes should be made in it without ample time for deliberation and discussion . We are here , then , simply as conferees from States expressing our individual opinions . We are now asked to recommend to Congress amendments to our fundamental law ; we have no more right to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere fraction of the people , propose to unite in bringing a pressure upon Congress , which shall induce it to propose these amendments . This was not one of the modes contemplated or provided by the framers of that sacred instrument . General WASHINGTON presided over the Convention which prepared our Constitution . None knew better than he the reasons which made its adoption necessary to the preservation of the Government  --  none knew better the dangers which would probably surround it in after years . In that last counsel of his to the American people  --  his Farewell Address  --  a paper drawn up with the greatest deliberation , embodying opinions which he entertained as the result of a long life of active study and reflection , he warns us against all such proceedings as those contemplated by the majority of the committee . I am sure the delegates from Virginia will not now refuse to listen to the words of that illustrious man , uttered upon the most solemn and momentous occasion of his life . Hear his words : " Here , perhaps , I ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can not end but with my life , and the apprehension of danger natural to that solicitude , urge me on an occasion like the present to offer to your solemn contemplation , and to recommend to your frequent review , some sentiments which are the result of much reflection , of no inconsiderable observation , and which appear to me all-important to the permanency of your felicity as a people . These will be offered to you with more freedom , as you can only see in them the disinterested warnings of a parting friend , who can possibly have no personal motive to bias his counsel . " Again : " But as it is easy to foresee , that from different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken , many artifices employed , to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth ; as this is the point in your political fortress , against which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly and actively ( though often covertly and insidiously ) directed , it is of infinite moment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union to your collective and individual happiness ; that you should cherish a cordial , habitual , and immovable attachment to it ; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as the Palladium of your political safety and prosperity ; watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety ; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned ; and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest , or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts . " Are not these admonitions at the present moment peculiarly worthy of our attention ? And with them before us , can we invoke the action of Congress for the alteration of the fundamental law of the Government in any other ways than those provided in the Constitution ? I earnestly hope not . If we act at all , let us act in that regular method which gives time for consultation , for consideration , and for action among the people of all the States . It appears to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of the committee , we are doing the very thing which WASHINGTON warned us not to do . He said further : " To the efficacy and permanency of your Union , a government for the whole is indispensable . No alliances , however strict , between the parts , can be an adequate substitute ; they must inevitably experience the infractions and interruptions which all alliances in all times have experienced . Sensible of this momentous truth , you have improved upon your first essay , by the adoption of a Constitution of Government better calculated than your former for an intimate union , and for the efficacious management of your common concerns . This Government , the offspring of our own choice , uninfluenced and unmoved , adopted upon full investigation and mature deliberation , completely free in its principles , in the distribution of its powers , uniting security with energy , and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment , has a just claim to your confidence and your support . Respect for its authority , compliance with its laws , acquiescence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of true liberty . The basis of our political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter their Constitutions of Government . But the Constitution which at any time exists , till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people , is sacredly obligatory upon all . " And again : " Toward the preservation of your Government , and the permanency of your present happy state , it is requisite , not only that you should steadily discountenance irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority , but also that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its principles , however specious the pretexts . One method of assault may be to affect in the forms of the Constitution alterations which will impair the energy of the system , and thus to undermine what can not be directly overthrown . In all the changes to which you may be invited , remember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true character of governments , as of other human institutions . " And still further : " If , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong , let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates . But let there be no change by usurpation ; for though this in one instance may be the instrument of good , it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed . The precedent must always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit which the use can at any time yield . " If we adopt the majority report here , we attempt to correct the Constitution by an amendment in a way which , the Constitution does not designate . WASHINGTON says if there is any thing wrong , let it be corrected in a constitutional way ; and that , sir , is just what Kentucky has said , and that is what every loyal State will say . Kentucky has inaugurated this proceeding , and it is one eminently worthy of her  --  true as she has always been to the Union . I can not disregard this action of her Legislature . I do not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am ready , and my State is ready , to confer with other States in reference to the Constitution , when asked to do so in any of the modes pointed out by that instrument . Entertaining these opinions , and with these convictions , I should be untrue to my sense of duty to the Government and the State I represent , and to the people of the United States , if I should consent to disregard the Constitution and my obligations to it . I have stated these considerations because they are powerful enough to influence and control my course . Others must act upon their own convictions . I have come to the conclusion that I ought to submit this minority report with distrust , and with distrust only , because so many of the able statesmen composing the majority of the committee have seen fit to adopt different views . My report leaves every thing to the people , where I think every such question should be left . When they consult together and decide in the constitutional way I shall bow to their decision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not propose to follow the gentleman ( Mr. BALDWIN ) through all the ramifications of his speech . I have made the Constitution my study for many years , and I have looked at the causes which give it strength and the causes which give it weakness . I believe that our fathers organized this Government in great wisdom . Its strength was in the affections of the people . It never had any other strength , and it was never intended it should have . It was not intended to be sustained by standing armies . Its strength was intended to be placed in the affections of the people , and I had hoped it would endure forever . Without the affections of the people it is the weakest Government ever established . The people ! What a spectacle do we witness now ! One portion of the people has lost confidence in the Government , and now seven States have left it . The Government can not realize that they are gone . We have established the right of revolution , and that right gave to the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will stand for all time . It will always be acted upon when the people have lost confidence in the Government . I hate that word secession , because it is a cheat ! Call things by their right names ! The Southern States have framed another Government ; they have originated a revolution . There is no warrant for it in the Constitution , but it is like the right of self-defence , which every man may exercise . The gentleman from Connecticut has forgotten that the Government made Congress the recipient of petitions . Why was this ? It was that Congress might be influenced by the wishes of the people and act upon them . We are twenty States assembled here . Congress has been in session more than two months . The Government is falling to pieces . Congress has not had the sagacity to give the necessary guarantees , the proper assurances to the slaveholding States . This session will make a shameful chapter in the history of this Government , to be hereafter written . Why should this Congress refuse to give the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled to give their people guarantees . We are assembled here to consult , and see what can be done ; to consult as representatives of the States . Is there any impropriety in our stating what would restore confidence , to our putting this in writing , and to our proposing the plan of restoration we think should be adopted to Congress , and asking Congress to submit that plan to the people ? Are we not the representatives of the people , sent here to do what we think ought to be done , and to ask Congress by way of petition to repair the foundations of the Government ? It is all legitimate , and legitimate in the most technical sense . Suppose we ask Congress to act on this proposition . We come directly from the people . We ask Congress to submit a plan which we think will save the Government , to the people . Is this taking any advantage of the States ? They can take all the time they wish for deliberation , and we can bring no pressure to bear on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ask Congress , backed by the moral force of the States we represent , to act and save the country . Two or three years hence will not answer . The foundations of the Government are undermined and growing weaker every day , and if the people who may give to it the necessary repair and strength do not do so , they will be called to a fearful account . When the building is on fire , it is no time to inquire who set it on fire . The North say the South did it , and the South say the North did it . We are all interested in this Government ; we love the Constitution ; we love the Union ; we want to repair it  --  we want to lay the foundation for bringing back the States who have left us , by reason and not by the sword . The delay which the gentleman proposes is too long ; the Constitution has provided a shorter way . In adopting that we are only recognizing the right of petition . I , sir , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come between me and the people of Kentucky . He has no right to speak for the people of that State  --  her representatives here have that right and will exercise it . Why were these resolutions passed ? Because Congress had failed to provide the means needful to our safety . The resolutions under which the Kentucky delegation came here were passed on the 29th , not the 25th of January . They were passed after the resolutions to which the gentleman refers . They ought to be regarded , as they are in fact , as the deliberate expression of the Legislature of Kentucky in favor of this Conference . In them it is stated that Kentucky heartily accepts the invitation of her old mother Virginia . She acts in no unwilling spirit , she hastens to avail herself of any opportunity to save the Government . She believes a favorable opportunity is offered by this Conference . I repeat again : Adopt the report of the majority of the committee and I will answer to Kentucky . I will go farther . I will answer that Kentucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution contained in the committee 's report . But the gentleman insists that the action proposed is not only improper but that it is revolutionary . I deny that it is revolutionary . It is no more revolutionary than any other form of petition . It is a petition sustained by the moral force of twenty States  --  a petition which Congress will not disregard . But if the report of the majority is revolutionary , what of the gentleman 's report ? Is that provided for by the Constitution ? Is that according to the forms of the Constitution ? No , sir . Every argument he has brought against the report of the majority , applies with equal force to his own . His views will answer for those who are willing to stand by and see this Government drift toward destruction  --  to see this country involved in civil war . It will answer for those who will oppose all action , and who wish to do nothing at all . His report is a new excuse for inaction . It will not answer for us . Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of every true patriot in the nation are turned toward this body . The people are awaiting our action , with anxious and painful solicitude . They know and we know that , unless the wisdom of this Conference shall devise some plan to satisfy the people of the slaveholding States  --  to quiet their apprehensions , a disruption of the Government is inevitable . If we adopt the gentleman 's views , go home and do nothing , we take the responsibility of breaking up the Government . I do not propose to discuss the merits of the majority report at the present time . I have only sought to answer the arguments of the gentleman against our acting at all . But I claim that this way of proceeding is entirely irregular . The report of the gentleman is not in order . The report of the majority was first presented , and should be first acted upon . I move to lay the report of the gentleman from Connecticut upon the table . Mr. LOGAN :  --  I would ask Mr. GUTHRIE to withdraw his motion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was expected that we were to discuss the subject to-day . It is not of much consequence which report is first acted upon . They are all before the Conference , and the merits of all of them are under discussion . Mr. GUTHRIE withdrew the motion to lay on the table . Mr. MOREHEAD , of Kentucky , took the chair . Mr. CURTIS :  --  I am a member of the present Congress ; I have faithfully attended its deliberations , and have anxiously watched its course . Mr. GUTHRIE will find that there are other and different objections to the line of policy he proposes , to which he has not alluded , and which he does not understand . But they are objections which have determined , and will determine , the action of Congress . I would ask Mr. GUTHRIE if the adoption of his propositions , previous to their action , would have prevented the States which have already seceded from going out . Mr. GUTHRIE :  --  I think it would have prevented them ; all but South Carolina . I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , personally . Mr. CURTIS :  --  I do not agree with the gentleman . We know , and the gentleman knows , that there has been for a long time a purpose , a great conspiracy in this country , to begin and carry out a revolution . That has been avowed over and over again in the halls of Congress . Can you expect a member of Congress to do more than reflect the will of his constituents , the will of his people ? Would you have him do any thing different ? There were forty or fifty different propositions before the Congressional Committee of Thirty-three . There are many here . There are many difficulties attending the solution of this question in every respect . But we may as well speak plainly . I can not go for the majority report of the committee , and among other reasons , for this reason : Their proposition makes all territory we may hereafter acquire slave territory . Mr. JOHNSON :  --  No ; such is not the fact . Mr. CURTIS :  --  I have read it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such is not the intention . Mr. CURTIS :  --  Any future territory which we acquire must be from the south ; we have extended as far as we can to the north and the northwest . Mr. WICKLIFFE :  --  Will you agree to divide all future territory ? Mr. CURTIS :  --  I will do almost any thing to save the Union . I will reflect the will of my constituents . I think it ought not to be divided equally , but the South ought to have its share . There is another trouble . Look at the difficulty of getting any proposition through Congress . Congress has only fifteen days of life . I ask you , even with general unanimity , if you can hope to pass at this session any new proposals of amendments ? If you do , you will get along faster than is generally the case . There is one proposition before Congress that I believe can pass . It is the Adams proposition , to admit all the territories south at once . It is already slave territory . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South , I will go for it . We are bound to admit it under the ordinance of 1789 . Mr. GOODRICH :  --  Do I understand my friend to claim that the ordinance of 1789 involves a proposition to divide the territory ? Mr. CURTIS :  --  I understand that in connection with the subsequent legislation it does . Mr. GOODRICH :  --  The concession of territory from North Carolina contains a prohibition from acting on the subject of slavery in the territory ceded . Mr. CURTIS :  --  I agree entirely with the gentleman . I am opposed to slavery , but we must divide the territory . Let us leave slavery where it is , and admit the territory for the purpose of settling the question . I do not agree with Mr. GUTHRIE that this Government depends on the will of the people . It is a self-supporting government ; it will support itself . There is no justification for the action of the seceded States , and I can not agree that Congress is responsible for their action . The secession plot was formed before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If our President had acted as Jackson did , there would have been an end of it . The day for hanging for treason has gone by . We must look at things as they are . Even in battle the white flag must be respected . Let this subject be frankly discussed in a conciliatory manner . If any State has the right to go out of the Union at its own volition , then this Government , in my opinion , is not worth the trouble of preserving . The President is sworn to protect and uphold the Government . So long as there is a navy , an army , and a militia , it is his sworn duty to uphold it  --  to uphold it as well against an attack from States as from individuals . The Government is one of love and affection , it is true , but it is also one of strength , and power . Where was there ever a more indulgent people than ours ? Our forts have been taken , our flag has been fired upon , our property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they will not be indulgent forever . Beware , gentlemen , how you force them further . Gentlemen talk about the inefficiency of Congress ; I wish there was some efficiency in the Executive . If there was , or had been , our present troubles would have been avoided . Mr. TURNER :  --  I do not understand that the report of the majority is applicable to future territory . I move the recommitment of the report , to have that question settled . Mr. JOHNSON :  --  It is true there are different constructions which may be placed on the report . I think if it had been understood to apply to future territory , it could not have received the support of a majority of the committee . Mr. CRITTENDEN 'S proposition applies to future territory . I submitted a proposition to the committee also intended to apply to future territory . A majority of the committee was opposed to it . Mr. EWING drew this part of the amendment , and there is some difference of opinion about it . In my opinion the amendment would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper time to offer an amendment which should make it plain , and not leave it open to construction . Personally , I should be glad to apply it to future territory , but I shall yield . I think if we can settle the question now , there will be no further trouble . I do not believe any territory will be acquired hereafter without great unanimity . It is not quite true , although it may be probable , that the future territory will be south of the line proposed . Mr. TURNER :  --  I am still more confirmed that it was the intention of the committee to have the amendment only apply to existing territory . If this is settled now , it will shorten the debate . If the gentleman will move to amend now , I will withdraw my motion . Mr. JOHNSON :  --  I move to amend by inserting the word present before the word territory in the first line of Section I. , with such other verbal amendments as may make the sense conform , and to adopt that amendment now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss these amendments , but am physically unable to speak to-day , and would prefer to have the discussion deferred . Mr. JOHNSON then moved an adjournment , which was carried on a division , and the Convention adjourned at two o'clock and fifty minutes . ELEVENTH DAY . WASHINGTON , MONDAY , February 18th , 1861 . The Convention was opened with prayer by Rev. P.D . GURLEY . The Journal of yesterday was read and approved . Mr. CHITTENDEN offered the following resolution : Resolved , That the rules of this Convention be so far modified as to require the Secretary to employ a competent stenographer , who shall write down and preserve accurate notes of the debates and other proceedings of this body , which notes shall not be communicated to any person , nor shall copies thereof be taken , nor shall the same be made public until after the final adjournment of this Convention , except in pursuance of a vote authorizing their publication . Mr. CHITTENDEN :  --  I have no desire to occupy time in debating this resolution , much less to waste it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the settled purpose of a majority of this Convention . But if this body will consider the purpose which the resolution seeks to attain , it may , perhaps , be found less objectionable than other similar ones which have been defeated . The objection heretofore made is , that a publication of what transpires here would lead to an excited criticism in the country , which would be unfavorable to the calmness and ultimate success which should attend our deliberations . While I entertain no such apprehensions , permit me to observe that this resolution contemplates no present publication of our debates , but a publication at such a time , and in such a manner , as will be unobjectionable . That time may not come till after our adjournment . I am free to say , that when we are dealing with the important issues now before us , I prefer to have our action , our words , our whole conduct , all that we do and say , open and public . We should fear no criticism when we are right ; we ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen will not consent to this , at least let the daily record of each of us be made up now : let it be full and perfect . When a question comes up hereafter which concerns the sentiments or the action of a member , let its decision depend upon no uncertain recollection , a recollection which must fade and grow dim with each one of us , as the time of this Convention recedes into the past . Such a record can injure no one ; it may be of infinite service hereafter . I could not justify myself to my conscience , or to those who have a right to hold me responsible for my acts here , if I failed to do all that lays in my power to have the true history of this Convention laid before the country . A naked journal amounts to nothing . It is a skeleton . Our discussions alone will give it form and comeliness . I have prepared this resolution upon consultation with many members , whose ideas of what should be done here agree with mine . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it fails , the responsibility of keeping our discussions from the people will not rest with us . Mr. POLLOCK :  --  I move to lay the resolution on the table . Mr. CHITTENDEN :  --  Let the vote be taken by States . The vote was so taken , and the following States voted in the affirmative : Connecticut , Rhode Island , New Jersey , Delaware , Maryland , Kentucky , Tennessee , North Carolina , Missouri , Virginia , and Pennsylvania  --  11 . The following States voted in the negative : Maine , Vermont , New Hampshire , Massachusetts , Indiana , Illinois , Iowa , and New York  --  8 . So the motion to lay on the table prevailed . When the State of Ohio was called , a member of her delegation stated that it was equally divided . Mr. TUCK :  --  I ask the unanimous consent of the Conference to introduce a proposition in the form of an address to the people of the United States . I do so after having consulted a considerable number of members ; and having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it , and will then move that it be laid on the table and printed . Mr. RANDOLPH :  --  Is the gentleman 's motion in order ? Mr. EWING :  --  I object to the reading . Mr. CLAY :  --  Certainly ; I object also . Mr. TUCK :  --  I will acquiesce with a single word . I certainly hoped no curt objection would be made to the reading of any proposition which any member might deem it his duty to offer . As gentlemen differ from me in this respect , I will hand the paper to the Chair . I hope at least it may be permitted to lay on the table . The PRESIDENT :  --  I hold it the gentleman 's undoubted right to read the paper if he chooses . Mr. TUCK :  --  Very well . He commenced reading when he was interrupted by Mr. WICKLIFFE :  --  I hope Mr. TUCK will withdraw this paper . If the Convention agrees to any result , I shall favor its submission to the people with an address . I will pledge myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee to prepare the address at the proper time . The PRESIDENT :  --  The gentleman from New Hampshire has the floor . Mr. TUCK then completed the reading of the paper , as follows : TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES : This Convention of Conference , composed in part of Commissioners appointed in accordance with the legislative action of sundry States , and in part of Commissioners appointed by the Governors of sundry other States , in compliance with an invitation by the General Assembly of Virginia , met in Washington on the 4th of February , 1861 . Although constituting a body unknown to the Constitution and laws , yet being delegated for the purpose , and having carefully considered the existing dangers and dissensions , and having brought their proceedings to a close , publish this address , and the accompanying resolutions , as the result of their deliberations . We recognize and deplore the divisions and distractions which now afflict our country , interrupt its prosperity , disturb its peace , and endanger the Union of the States ; but we repel the conclusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which justify attempts at revolution , or which the patriotism and fraternal sentiments of the people , and the interests and honor of the whole nation , will not overcome . In a country embracing the central and most important portion of a continent , among a people now numbering over thirty millions , diversities of opinion inevitably exist ; and rivalries , intensified at times by local interests and sectional attachments , must often occur ; yet we do not doubt that the theory of our Government is the best which is possible for this nation , that the Union of the States is of vital importance , and that the Constitution , which expresses the combined wisdom of the illustrious founders of the Government , is still the palladium of our liberties , adequate to every emergency , and justly entitled to the support of every good citizen . It embraces , in its provisions and spirit , all the defence and protection which any section of the country can rightfully demand , or honorably concede . Adopted with primary reference to the wants of five millions of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development , it has carried us onward with a rapid increase of numbers , an accumulation of wealth , and a degree of happiness and general prosperity never attained by any nation . Whatever branch of industry , or whatever staple production , shall become , in the possible changes of the future , the leading interest of the country , thereby creating unforeseen complications or new conflicts of opinion and interest , the Constitution of the United States , properly understood and fairly enforced , is equal to every exigency , a shield and defence to all , in every time of need . If , however , by reason of a change in circumstances , or for any cause , a portion of the people believe they ought to have their rights more exactly defined or more fully explained in the Constitution , it is their duty , in accordance with its provisions , to seek a remedy by way of amendment to that instrument ; and it is the duty of all the States to concur in such amendments as may be found necessary to insure equal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to announce to the country the sentiments of this Convention , respecting not only the remedy which should be sought for existing discontents , but also to communicate to the public what we believe to be the patriotic sentiment of the country , we adopt the following resolutions : 1st . Resolved , That this Convention recognize the well-understood proposition that the Constitution of the United States gives no power to Congress , or any branch of the Federal Government , to interfere in any manner with slavery in any of the States ; and we are assured by abundant testimony , that neither of the great political organizations existing in the country contemplates a violation of the spirit of the Constitution in this regard , or the procuring of any amendment thereof , by which Congress , or any department of the General Government , shall ever have jurisdiction over slavery in any of the States . 2d . Resolved , That the Constitution was ordained and established , as set forth in the preamble , by the people of the United States , in order to form a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide for the common defence , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity ; and when the people of any State are not in full enjoyment of all the benefits intended to be secured to them by the Constitution , or their rights under it are disregarded , their tranquillity disturbed , their prosperity retarded , or their liberty imperilled by the people of any State , full and adequate redress can and ought to be provided for such grievances . 3d . Resolved , That this Convention recommend to the Legislatures of the States of the Union to follow the example of the Legislatures of the States of Kentucky and of Illinois , in applying to Congress to call a Convention for the proposing of amendments to the Constitution of the United States , pursuant to the fifth article thereof . Mr. GUTHRIE :  --  I object to printing this paper . If that course is taken , every member may offer his disquisitions on the Constitution , and they will be printed at our expense . Mr. TUCK :  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table , and printed . The PRESIDENT :  --  There were three motions involved in one . Now the question is upon laying the paper on the table and printing it . Mr. ALEXANDER :  --  I call for a division of the question . The PRESIDENT :  --  The question will be on the motion to lay it on the table . Mr. TUCK :  --  Are we not entitled to have the question taken on the motion to print ? I supposed all these questions would be taken in a spirit of conciliation . But if not , I will withdraw the motion to lay on the table , and move that the paper be printed . Mr. MOREHEAD , of Kentucky :  --  I came here in a spirit of conciliation , and I shall act in that spirit . Let us all do so . I disagree entirely with Mr. TUCK and his proposition , but I am in favor of receiving every proposition that is offered , of printing them all , and at the proper time of considering them all . I trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The PRESIDENT then put the motion upon printing the address , and it was carried upon a division . Mr. GUTHRIE offered the following resolution , which was adopted unanimously : Resolved , That if the President shall choose to speak on any question , he may , for the occasion , call any member to preside . Mr. MEREDITH :  --  I wish to offer a proposition , and hope for the present it may lie on the table , and be considered hereafter . I do not desire to move it as an amendment to the report of the committee , but think it better to present it as a direct and independent proposition . I present it now only for the purpose of having it before the Convention . It is as follows : ARTICLE .  --  That Congress shall divide all the territory of the United States into convenient portions , each containing not less than sixty thousand square miles , and shall establish in each a territorial government ; the several territorial legislatures , whether heretofore constituted , or hereafter to be constituted , shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States of this Union ; and whenever any territory having a population sufficient , according to the ratio existing at the time , to entitle it to one member of Congress , shall form a republican constitution , and apply to Congress for admission as a State , Congress shall admit the same as a State accordingly . The proposition of Mr. MEREDITH was laid on the table without objection . Mr. WICKLIFFE :  --  There appears to be a misunderstanding between the Secretary and myself upon the question of printing the Journal . To avoid question , I move that the Journal be printed up to and including to-day . Mr. GOODRICH :  --  I move to amend by adding " and from day to day during the session . " The amendment and the motion were adopted without objection . Mr. ALEXANDER , of New Jersey , took the chair . The PRESIDENT :  --  The Convention will now proceed to the order of the day  --  the consideration of the report of the committee . Mr. REID , of North Carolina :  --  I wish to move an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to add to his the words " and future . " If adopted , the language will be " present and future territory . " Mr. EWING :  --  This will render a division of the question necessary . The gentleman had better withdraw his amendment for the time . Mr. REID :  --  I am instructed by the Legislature of North Carolina to offer it , and I think best to do so in this regular manner . Mr. CLEVELAND :  --  I think the motion of Mr. REID is out of order . I suggest that if adopted , with Mr. JOHNSON 'S amendment , the sense of the proposition as it now stands will not be changed . Mr. RUFFIN :  --  I rise merely to make a suggestion to my colleague . This motion must be made at some time , by some one , so that we may have a regular vote upon it . Now , as it is not certain how the report of the majority of the committee is to be construed , I propose at a suitable time to move an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired . If this will suit my colleague , I hope he will withdraw his motion . Mr. REID :  --  I came here not to deceive the North or the South . I intend to be plain and unambiguous . Why should we send forth a proposition that is uncertain , vague , and , as gentlemen admit , open to different constructions ? If we are to pour oil upon the troubled waters , let us do so to some purpose ; above all , let us be definite , plain , and certain . I can not consent to withdraw my motion . I must insist upon its consideration . Mr. LOGAN :  --  I had hoped the question on Mr. JOHNSON 'S amendments would have been taken on Saturday . It is an important one , and one which must be met . I would suggest that it would be best to let the question be taken on Mr. JOHNSON 'S amendments now . The subject presents itself to my mind in this way : The proposition of the majority , as it now stands , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to perfect it , to make it satisfactory to themselves . If there is a doubt about it , let us make it clear that it applies only to the present territory . Then we can have a clear and decisive vote upon it . The substance of the proposition is what I wish to arrive at , and it will be more in order if the vote is not taken till we know what that substance is . I shall not object to its application to future territory . I hope the gentleman from North Carolina will withdraw his amendment , and let the question be taken on that of Mr. JOHNSON . Mr. SEDDON :  --  One word only . I fear we are being placed in an awkward position . I am desirous to have the language of the proposition clear and not delusive . The amendment of Mr. JOHNSON embarrasses me ; I hardly know how to vote upon it . If I vote for Mr. JOHNSON 'S motion , I shall have the semblance of favoring the limitation of the proposition to present territory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on Mr. JOHNSON 'S motion he will vote one way and I the other . Mr. RUFFIN :  --  Will the gentleman allow me to explain ? I voted against the proposition in committee because , as it now stands , it applies only to existing territory . I wish to carry this proposition , but not by the vote of the South alone . I want Northern votes , and assurances that the people of the North will vote for the proposition and adopt it . Mr. SEDDON :  --  I shall feel disposed to vote against Mr. JOHNSON 'S motion . The question was here stated by the President as follows : The vote will be taken upon the motion of Mr. REID to amend the amendment offered by Mr. JOHNSON . Mr. REID :  --  It strikes me that the question is this : My proposition is to add the words " and future , " but Mr. JOHNSON 'S amendment is to add the word " present . " Can this be treated as an amendment to his motion ? I must say that my duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposition as he proposes to limit it . Mr. COALTER :  --  I think the committee ought to be permitted to amend and complete their report . Let us , by general consent , agree to have the word " present " inserted . Mr. REID :  --  I object to that all the time . Mr. TURNER :  --  I move that the report be recommitted for amendment . Mr. COALTER :  --  Shall we adjourn over simply for this ? That will use up another day . Mr. GUTHRIE :  --  I hope it will not be recommitted . We can settle the question here in a moment . The PRESIDENT :  --  The vote will now be taken . Mr. McCURDY :  --  I call for the individual names of members voting . The PRESIDENT :  --  The call is not in order . The question was then taken on the amendment of Mr. REID , and resulted as follows : AYES  --  New Jersey , Delaware , Maryland , Kentucky , Tennessee , North Carolina , Missouri , and Virginia  --  8 . NAYS  --  Vermont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhode Island , Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , Pennsylvania , New York , and Iowa  --  12 . So the amendment failed . The PRESIDENT :  --  The question now recurs on the motion of the gentleman from Maryland . Mr. JOHNSON :  --  I trust that I shall not trespass upon the time of the Conference , but the subject now before it is one of great importance , and it involves the consideration of many important questions . The amendment which I offer is for the purpose of making the proposition of the committee clear and plain . I was aware that a construction might be placed upon it different from that which the committee intended ; and it is due to the frankness which is manifested here , that the purposes of the committee should be made plain . There ought to be no ambiguity in a constitutional provision . Some of the most important constitutional questions decided by the Supreme Court have been questions of construction . Lawyers would differ about the construction to be given the committee 's proposition . I think the Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would be conclusive . A similar question arose in the Dred Scott case . There the question was upon that article in the Constitution which confers on Congress the power " to dispose of and to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territories or other property belonging to the United States . " The Court in that case decided that the provision had no bearing on the controversy in that case , because the power given by that provision , whatever it might be , was confined , and was intended to be confined , to the territory which , upon the adoption of the Constitution , belonged to or was claimed by the United States , and was within their boundaries , as settled by the treaty with Great Britain . With this clause in the Constitution , therefore , it could have no influence upon the territory afterward acquired from a foreign government . I think this decision conclusive , and that the proposition , if incorporated into the Constitution , would refer only to the territory now owned by the United States . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee that the word " future " should be inserted in the report . I was opposed to it : it was so odious to me to put words into the Constitution , or to propose to do so , which should go forth to the world as an indication that this Government proposes to acquire new territory in any way . I have said that the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case decided that the words " the territories " in the Constitution only applied to the then existing territory . I think they decided wrong in this respect , though I agree to the correctness of the decision in that case in the main ; but such as it is , the decision is binding upon this Conference and the people . Mr. JOHNSON here read a portion of the opinion of Judge TANEY delivered in the Dred Scott case , and continued : You perceive that Judge TANEY turns the question upon the construction of the word " the . " Had the word " any " been used in its place , he must have held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the then existing territory . Knowing that it was the purpose of the majority of the committee to exclude future territory from the operation of this proposition , and that it was due to the committee and the Convention that their purposes should be carried out , I offer my amendment as applicable to the sixth line of the proposition as well as the first . In discussing the merits of this report , in its application to the existing condition of the country , I have to say a word to my Southern friends . You have sought to extend this provision to territory which shall be hereafter acquired . You have had a decisive vote and have been beaten in this Conference . The fight has been a fair one ; the question has been thoroughly understood . We ought to acquiesce in the decision of the majority . We can not change this decision if we would ; and if we could change it , the proposition amended as you would prefer to have it , would never pass Congress . The repeated action of that body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this decision then , as definitive , can we not settle the question with reference to existing territory ? Shall we settle it ? Settle it fairly  --  recognizing and acknowledging the rights of all , and remain brethren forever with the Free States ! From my very heart , I say yes . ( Applause . ) The proposition as it now stands covers all the territory we have . The whole ground , the whole trouble , which has brought this country into its present lamentable condition  --  has arisen over this question . I believe if it had been disposed of or settled in some way before , many States would have been kept in the Union that have now gone out . And why should we not settle it ? We have now a territory extensive enough to sustain two hundred millions of people  --  embracing almost every climate , fruitful in almost every species of production  --  rich in all the elements of national wealth , and governed by a Constitution that has raised us to an elevation of grandeur that the world has never before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a Government , on account of territory we have not got , and territory that we do not want , is not , I believe , the patriotic sense of the South . But this proposition does not stand by itself alone . It is connected , and must be construed , with the provision relating to the acquisition of future territory . The second section of the committee 's proposition provides that territory shall not be acquired by the United States , unless by treaty , nor , with unimportant exceptions , unless such treaty shall be ratified by four-fifths of all the members of the Senate . Is not that guaranty enough for us ? Should we not act unreasonably if we required further guaranty in this respect ? For myself , I should have preferred that the consent of two-thirds of the Senate only should be required , and that that two-thirds should comprise a majority both from the free and slave States . Mr. RUFFIN :  --  At the proper time I shall move such an amendment . Mr. JOHNSON :  --  If such an amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be objections raised to it , but they will be far outweighed by the advantages it will give to the South . But the objection of Mr. BALDWIN is opposed here , and it is one which must be answered . He says this is the wrong way to propose amendments to the Constitution  --  that our action is inconsistent with that instrument . He does not claim that it is prohibited by the letter , but by the spirit of the Constitution . Where does he get the spirit but from the letter ? There are two methods of proposing amendments to the Constitution provided by that instrument . Let us see what they are . Mr. JOHNSON here read the article of the Constitution providing for amendments , and continued : One is where two-thirds of Congress deem it advisable to propose amendments ; the other is where the States themselves propose them . My learned brother would have us believe that the members of Congress , acting under their official oaths , must each be satisfied that each amendment proposed is proper to be incorporated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he maintains that there is a difference , in fact , in the two methods prescribed . What right has this body , if there is any force in this objection , to submit his proposition to the States ? If what we propose is revolutionary , then what he proposes is revolutionary . I reply to him , with all respect for his legal ability , and with all the humility which becomes me , and insist that he is wrong . He refers to the opinion of Judge COLLAMER . I hold Judge COLLAMER in much respect , and his opinion in great honor here , but his statements are at war with the objections made by the gentleman from Connecticut . Judge COLLAMER maintains that it is the duty of Congress to propose amendments , not to recommend them . It would be entirely proper , according to his opinion , for Congress to propose amendments which they would not adopt themselves . I go somewhat farther , and insist that it is the duty of Congress to propose amendments whenever desired by any State or any considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suggest a line of action to Congress , no right to petition Congress , no right to ask Congress to propose amendments , as the gentleman insists , we had better go home , or rather , I should say , we should never have come here . There are twenty States represented in this Conference . I have no doubt other States would have been here , but for the shortness of the time . But how and why are we here ? We have come here on the invitation of Virginia ; her resolutions are our constitution . We have come here at her instance . For what purpose did she ask us to come here ? under what circumstances did she pass these resolutions ? Virginia saw that the country was going to ruin  --  that one State had already seceded , and several others were about to follow . She saw there were circumstances affecting the condition of the South which aroused her to frenzy  --  not madness , but the frenzy which falls on every patriotic mind when it witnesses a country going to destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid steps , and that its ruin must be accomplished unless her friends in the free States would come forward , and consent to put into the Constitution additional guarantees which would satisfy the people of the slave States that their rights were secure . See what she did  --  what she said . She expresses it as her deliberate opinion , " that unless the unhappy controversy which now divides the States of this Confederacy shall be satisfactorily adjusted , a permanent dissolution of the Union is inevitable ; and the General Assembly , representing the wishes of the people of the Commonwealth , is desirous of employing every reasonable means to avert so dire a calamity , and determined to make a final effort to restore the Union and the Constitution , in the spirit in which they were established by the fathers of the Republic . " Therefore she invites all States , whether slaveholding or non-slaveholding , who were willing to unite with her in an earnest effort to adjust the unhappy controversies in the spirit of the Constitution , to come together to secure that adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She does not leave us to suggest what that adjustment shall be . She tells us herself . She requests us to adopt it , and to submit it to Congress . She does not ask that Congress should call a convention , for Congress could not . Try , if we can , says Virginia , to come to some settlement of these unhappy controversies , and send that settlement to Congress , that Congress may submit it to the country . Virginia invited you here . She told you just what she wanted . She says if you can not consent to that , then let her commissioners come home and report the result . If this can not be done , if the mode of adjustment indicated by her can not be substantially carried out , then our whole authority is at an end . This matter of amending the Constitution is not as intricate and difficult a work as gentlemen imagine . Are there not twelve amendments to the Constitution already ? Were they submitted to the people by each member of Congress acting under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the gentleman would avoid ? Were they not brought into the Constitution by outside pressure ? The Constitution has been amended . I wish to mark how it was done , and then note why it was done . There was a time when fears were entertained that wrongs might be done to different sections of the Union under the Constitution as it then stood . Congress listened to those fears , and did not hesitate to propose amendments suggested from outside its own body  --  to submit them to the people for adoption . It was necessary , in the judgment of Congress , to do this , in order to restore confidence . It was done , and confidence was restored . Is not that precisely our case now ? Is not confidence lost in the North and in the South ?  --  not exactly lost , perhaps , but shaken . The credit of the Government is gone . Even our naval commanders are unable to negotiate Government bills abroad  --  are reduced to the degrading alternative of asking the endorsement of foreign States , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have already become so poor that our widows and wives must bring out their stockings . Our last loan was negotiated at twelve per cent . discount . The present loan is not to be taken at any rate , unless the Government descends to the humiliating alternative of securing State endorsements . Our credit is going lower and lower every day , and it will soon come to the point where our bonds will be worth no more than Continental money was . Suppose we do nothing here . Are gentlemen blind to the consequences ? Gentlemen , honest and patriotic as I know you are , have you no love for this Union ?  --  have you no care for the preservation of this Government ? God forbid that I should say you have none ! I know you too well . My relations have been too intimate with you , and have existed too long , for me to suppose it . You do love the Union . I speak for the South and to the South . I know that we can still labor to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our judgment , any other course would be impossible . The Virginia Convention is even now in session , and what a convention it is ! Disguise as we may , deceive ourselves as we will , it is a convention which proposes to consider the question of withdrawing the State from the Union . Kentucky and Missouri , if we do nothing , will soon follow . If there ever was a time in the history of the Government for conciliation , for patriotic concession , that time is now . The time has come when parties must be forgotten . Let not the word party be mentioned here . It is not worthy of us . Representatives of the States , you are above party  --  high above . The cords that bind you together are a hundred times as strong as those which ever bound any party . Unless we do something , and something very quickly , before the incoming President is inaugurated , in all human probability he will have only the States north of Mason and Dixon to govern  --  that is , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no right of secession ; such is my individual opinion . But there is a right higher than all these  --  the right of self-defence , the right of revolution . It is recognized by the Constitution itself . The Constitution was adopted by nine of the States only . What right had those nine States to separate from the other four ? Mr. SEDDON :  --  The right of secession . Mr. JOHNSON :  --  I wo n't dispute about terms . In all such discussions , Heaven save me from a Virginia politician ! The opinions of Mr. MADISON upon the Constitution are certainly entitled to value . He had more to do with making it than any other statesman of the time . I desire to read an opinion of his , which will be found in number forty-two of the Federalist : " Two questions of a very delicate nature present themselves on this occasion :  --  1 . On what principle the Confederation , which stands in the solemn form of a compact among the States , can be superseded without the unanimous consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to subsist between the nine or more States ratifying the Constitution , and the remaining few who do not become parties to it ? " The first question is answered at once by recurring to the absolute necessity of the case , to the great principle of self-preservation , to the transcendent law of nature and of nature 's God , which declares that the safety and happiness of society are the objects at which all political institutions aim , and to which all such institutions must be sacrificed . " Now , apply these principles to the present condition of the country . The cases are exactly parallel . Mr. MADISON says in substance , that if one section of the Union refuses to recognize and protect the rights of another  --  in other words , if the free States now refuse to guarantee the rights of the South , that there is a right of self-preservation , a law of nature and nature 's God , which is above all Constitutions . I am not here to inquire whether the South has a right to go out if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I will not argue . Some of the States have already gone . I hold that to be a fact established . Now , I put it to my friends of the North : Do you want us to go out ? You are a great people , a great country  --  a powerful people , a rich country . No threat or intimidation shall ever come from me to such a people . I ask you in all sadness whether , in the light of all our glory , of all our happiness and prosperity , whether you will , by withholding a thing that it will not harm you to grant , suffer us , compel us to depart ? Let me read what was said by the same great man of Virginia , in anticipation of the existence of the present state of things : " I submit to you , my fellow-citizens , these considerations , in full confidence that the good sense which has so often marked your decisions will allow them their due weight and effect ; and that you will never suffer difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error on which they may be founded , to drive you into the gloomy and perilous scene into which the advocates for disunion would conduct you . Hearken not to the unnatural voice , which tells you that the people of America , knit together as they are by so many cords of affection , can no longer live together as members of the same family ; can no longer continue the mutual guardians of their mutual happiness ; can no longer be fellow-citizens of one great , respectable , and flourishing empire . Hearken not to the voice which petulantly tells you that the form of government recommended for your adoption is a novelty in the political world ; that it has never yet had a place in the theories of the wildest projectors ; that it rashly attempts what it is impossible to accomplish . No , my countrymen , shut your ears against this unhallowed language . Shut your hearts against the poison which it conveys . The kindred blood which flows in the veins of American citizens , the mingled blood which they have shed in defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excite horror at the idea of their becoming aliens , rivals , enemies . And if novelties are to be shunned , believe me , the most alarming of all novelties , the most wild of all projects , the most rash of all attempts , is that of rending us in pieces , in order to preserve our liberties , and promote our happiness . " Grant us then , gentlemen of the North , what we are willing to stand upon  --  what we will try to stand upon , and what we believe we can . At least , this will save the rest of the States to yourselves and to us . The States that are now in the Union will continue there . What is it we ask you to do ? It is to settle this question as to our present territory . To settle it  --  how ? By dividing it . And how by dividing it ? By the line of 36 deg. 30 ' . Apparently , you think we are asking the North to yield something . I tell you it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court we have the right to go North of this line with our slaves . Now , all we ask you to give us here is the territory south of that line ; and even as to that , we give you the right to destroy slavery there whenever a State organized out of it chooses to do so . We are , in fact , yielding to you . We abandon our rights North . Will you not let us retain what is already ours , South ? Is it quite certain that the territory south of the line will be slave territory ? Those who repealed the Missouri Compromise , believed that Kansas would be a slave State . It did not turn out so . All we ask is , that you should leave the territory south of the line where it has been left by the decision of the Supreme Court . We freely yield you all the rest . I do not propose to discuss all the amendments proposed . I confine myself to the single one which , if satisfactorily disposed of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask , oppressed by a consciousness which almost overmasters me  --  which renders me unfit to do any thing but feel  --  will you not settle this question here ? I feel , and I can not escape the feeling , that on your decision hangs the question , whether we shall be preserved an united people , or be broken to atoms . The States now remaining in the Union may possibly get on for a few years with something like prosperity ; but if this question is not settled in some way , man must change his nature or war in the end will come . War ! What a word to be used here ! War between whom ? There is not a family at the South which has not its associations with the North  --  not a Northern family which has not its Southern ties ! War in the midst of such a people ! God grant that the future , that the events which must inevitably follow dissension here , may at least spare this agony to ourselves , our families , and our posterity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I ought not to make a prolonged address upon a question which I favor . The only question now before us is : Shall this amendment be made plain ? We should deal honestly among ourselves ; there should be no cheat  --  no uncertainty  --  no delusion here . Our language should be so clear that it will breed no new nests of trouble . But the address of the gentleman from Maryland requires a brief notice from me . I listened with sadness to many parts of it . I bemoan that tones so patriotic could not rise to the level of the high ground of equality and right upon which we all ought to stand . I appeal not to forbearance  --  I ask not for pity . I feel proud to represent the grand old commonwealth of Virginia here , and prouder still that I only come here to demand right and justice in her behalf . Aye ! and it is more complimentary to you to have it so . I ask for such guarantees only as Virginia needs , and as she has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to appeal to your sense of justice , to your sense of right , than to your forbearance or pity . Virginia comes forward in a great national crisis . When support after support of this glorious temple of our Government has been torn away , she comes  --  proud of her memories of the past  --  happy in the part she had in the construction of this great system  --  she comes to present to you , calmly and plainly , the question , whether new and additional guarantees are not needed for her rights ; and she tells you what those guarantees ought to be . Nor does she stand alone . She is supported by all her border sisters . The propositions she makes are familiar to the country . They were made by a patriot of the olden time , a time near to that of the foundation of our Government . They were such as he thought suited to the exigencies of his time . They have since then received a larger meed of approval , north and south , than any other plan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a basis for our action here , with certain modifications acceptable to her people . One of these modifications has since been accepted by the mover of these resolutions himself . Most important among them is the provision as to future territory . The gentleman seems to think that Virginia would not insist on this provision as applicable to territory we may never have . It behooves not me to answer such a momentous question . I am only the mouthpiece of Virginia . She insists on the provision for future territory . She and her sister States plant themselves upon it . What right have I to strike out a clause which she makes specific ? What right have I to esteem it of so little weight that it may be thrown aside and disregarded ? I do not propose to give my reasons , though they would not be troublesome to give . It was an element in the Missouri Compromise that it should apply to future as well as to existing territory . Does not the gentleman assert that under the laws as they now stand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line with our slaves ? What , then , is our position ? Under the decision of the Supreme Court we are entitled to participate in all the territory of the United States . We are offering to give up the great part and the best part of it , and in payment we are to take the naked chance of getting a little piece of the worthless territory south of the proposed line ! Such an idea was never entertained by those who made the Compromise . The idea which governed their action was , beyond all doubt , not that present territory alone should be thus divided , but that the question should be removed from doubt and difficulty for all time , and to give us at the South a chance whatever change might come . Shall we be rewarded for all we give up , and find full compensation in a clause which itself prevents the acquisition of future territory ? The statement is in itself a sufficient answer to the question . But there was another element in the propositions of the Legislature of Virginia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her great and now dominant party ; it was intended to put an end to the discussions that have convulsed the country and jeopardized our institutions . It was the policy of our fathers to settle these questions . They determined to make a final and decisive line of demarkation , and to let that be conclusive . But this young people could not be restrained , and when new territory was acquired the same question arose again . It now comes up once more . Virginia early saw the seeds of trouble in it , because she saw that the tide of emigration would continue to press toward the fertile lands of the South . She saw and she acted . In consequence of her action we are here . Would it not be wise and well as statesmen and as patriots , that you should do what you can for adjustment ? do what you can to bring back your sisters of the South who have departed ? It is the part of wisdom to settle . Virginia was wise to ask it . There is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North that is determined to exclude the institution of slavery , not only from all future , but from all present territory . We know that in all ways this party has declared that it would not consent to let slavery go where it does not now exist . More heated zealots , also animated and sustained by this same party , have determined that this natural and patriarchal institution of the South should be surrounded by a cordon of free States , and in the end be extinguished altogether . Is it not wise in Virginia , that she should see that this project of surrounding the South with free States should be guarded against  --  most effectually guarded against now and in time to come , and so preserve her dignity and power ? This amendment adopted , and the proposition to Virginia will be a farce . Gentlemen , we hold that as the soul is to man , so is honor to a nation . Honor is the soul of nations . Without it , no nation can have a place in history or among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position of an equal . Equal in dignity  --  equal in right . In the Congress of the States of this Union , we insist on this as our right . We must have the same protection as the States of the North . Otherwise we are a dishonored people . We might live for a time otherwise , but we should be unworthy a place among the nations . We hold property , yes , our property in slaves , as rightful and as honorable as any property to be found in the broad expanse between ocean and ocean . We feel that in the existence , the perpetuity , the protection of the African race , we have a mission to perform , and not a mission only , but a right and a duty . Upon this subject I have a word to say in all seriousness . Think not , gentlemen of the North , that we propose to deceive or mislead you . We of the South are earnest in what we say . This is a question which we answer to ourselves . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country of native barbarism , and under the benignant influence of a Christian rule , of a Christian civilization , have been elevated , yes , elevated to a standing and position which they could never have otherwise secured . In respect to the colored race we challenge comparison with San Domingo , with the freed regions of Jamaica , with those who have been transferred to the coast of Africa . Ask the travellers who have visited those distant shores to contrast the condition of the colored people there with that of those on our Southern plantations , and they will give you but one answer  --  they will say , we have redeemed and kept well our high and our holy trust . But this is a matter with our own consciences , not with yours . We appeal to you to leave it where it is , to leave the colored people where they are . Why should you undertake to interfere with the policy of a neighboring State concerning a people about which you know nothing ? We feel , we know that we have done that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this feeling penetrated . For scores of years we have been laboring earnestly in our mission . In all this time we have contributed far more to the greatness of the North than to our own . Yet all this time we have been assailed , attacked , vilified and defamed , by the people of the North , from the cradle to the grave , and you have educated your children to believe us monsters of brutality , lust and iniquity . I tell you , that from the time the abolition societies aroused the latent anti-slavery spirit of the North until now , nothing but evil has come of the excitement and discussion . It has spread a horrid influence far and wide ; it has for years distilled , and is now distilling its poison and venom all over the land . It was under English , yes , British , Anglo-Saxon instigation that it first commenced . By this instigation it has been fed , been given life , continuity and power . Think you the English authors of this instigation had any purpose but to disrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil and a sin . The fruits of their action were first manifested in religious societies  --  first in the largest churches in New England , in the Presbyterian or Congregational churches , next the Methodist , then the Baptist , and finally , the venom spread so widely , its influence separated other churches . What has the moral influence of this power done ? It has made the abstraction of our slaves a virtue . Societies have been formed for that very purpose , inciting their members and others , by the vilest motives , to steal our slaves , to destroy our property . Nor have they been sufficiently modest to cloak their designs under the veil of secrecy . These people advocated their pernicious doctrines openly in your leading cities , even within the consecrated walls of Fanueil Hall . Openly among your people , in the very light of day , these efforts were carried on for the destruction of your sister States . There has not been an effort of the law nor an exertion of public opinion to put them down . These efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State , and your people thought they were doing GOD service in signing a petition to our authorities for mercy to John Brown and his ruffian invaders of our soil . And when these men met the just reward of their crime , there was , throughout the North , in your meetings and your public prints , expressions of sympathy for these robbers and murderers . They were looked upon as the victims of oppression , as martyrs to a holy and righteous cause . Gentlemen , consider these things , and tell me , is there not to-day reason for suspicion ; on the part of the South for grave apprehension ? But the half is yet to be told ; I have looked only at the moral aspect of the question . Dangerous enough hitherto , it becomes far more dangerous when it culminates on the arena of politics , and asks , with the powerful aid of a majority , the interference and the aid of the Government . As soon as it became the party of one idea it began to draw to it , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It went on securing the assistance of one after another until it demoralized , until it brought each to ruin . It destroyed the grand old Whig party . Fanatic enough before , when it had brought that party to its grave , it thrust upon the arena of politics this question of slavery in the territories . Then for the first time it raised the cry of " Free Soil , " and brought to its support the hearts of a majority of the people of the northern States . The people of the North and Northwest have long been noted for their acquisitive disposition , especially for the acquisition of lands . This has been manifested in every form . Carried into effect it has made them powerful , until , not long since , they thought they might get entire dominion at no distant day . Then arose in their hearts a desire greater than the greed of land  --  the greed of office and power . They then saw that perhaps the North alone might control the national government , and with it the South . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North  --  always greater at the North than at the South  --  joined with them . All these protected classes , whose advantages had been diverted from other classes to which they belonged , joined with landseekers to secure power . Influence after influence of this sort combined , until it produced your great Republican party ; in other words , your great Sectional party , which has at length come to majority and power . I do not wish to dwell upon the principles of that party , or to discuss them ; I simply assert that their principles involve all the sentiments of abolitionism . They may be summed up in this : you determine to oppose the admission of slave States in the future . You say that the whole power of the country , the whole power of the administration , shall be used in future for the final extinction of slavery . This , now , is the ruling idea of your great sectional party . It is simply the rule of one portion of the country over another . There is no difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the territories . It is only drawing a parallel around the citadel at a more remote point . Now , see how the South is placed . The South has forborne as long as it can , just as long as party organization existed , and as long as the South could keep it in existence . It was only when we saw that the whole united Government was to be turned against us , that we began to think of taking the subject into our own hands . What are we to expect now , when the power , direct and indirect , of this great Government is to be used in the most effective manner against us ? A power which claims that we shall not exercise the rights of States even , a power which seeks to coerce us , when we propose to protect ourselves against this lowering and impending danger . You of the North are descended from men who honored the scaffold for the very rights we now seek to exercise . So are we . You would deserve to be spurned by the maids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourselves against the dangers thus drawing around you . Can you expect less of us ? Do you tell me that this is an artificial crisis ? Would seven States have abandoned all the grand interest they possessed in a glorious and happy Confederacy like ours , but for more serious and vital interests , the interests of safety , security , and honor ? Think well of these things , gentlemen ! I have hastily endeavored to show you where I conceive we of the South stand . The feelings which I express are entertained likewise by the border States , by all the citizens of the South , by every householder of my State in a greater or less degree . The State to which I refer , Virginia , is now met in solemn convocation to consider whether she shall remain in the Union or go out of it ; and with the most earnest desire to secure to herself a longer connection with the American Union , a Union of so much honor and pride , and with an equally earnest desire to bring back the wandering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she , my own , my native State , comes here to ask for these guarantees . In my deliberate judgment , the Union and the Constitution , as they now stand , are unsafe for the people of the South , unsafe without other guarantees which will give them actual power instead of mere paper rights . Her stake in this controversy is too deep . In my judgment she has asked too little ; I think fuller and greater guarantees ought to be required , and that this Convention should not stand upon ceremony , but in a free and liberal spirit of concession should yield to us all that we ask . Be assured we shall ask none but adequate guarantees . But I am told that Virginia is content with the Crittenden Resolutions  --  I say this because I am instructed to say so  --  that is , if we are to treat these resolutions , not as the principles of the man who offers them , but as the principles of the great party just come into power . Gentlemen , remember that we of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our system is dislocated ; the Union is disrupted . How can you expect now to retain Virginia , to retain the border States , when they stand in the face of such a great , such an immense party ? How can you expect Virginia to remain in the Union without these added guarantees ? I told you I would make no appeals to your pity . If we are not entitled to the guarantees we ask , according to the principles of sound philosophy , of right and justice , then we do not ask them at all . Mr. BOUTWELL :  --  I have not been at all clear in my own mind as to when , and to what extent , Massachusetts should raise her voice in this Convention . She heard the voice of Virginia , expressed through her resolutions in this crisis of our country 's history . Massachusetts hesitated , not because she was unwilling to respond to the call of Virginia , but because she thought her honor touched by the manner of that call and the circumstances attending it . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She knew the result . It accorded well with her wishes . She knew that the Government whose political head for the next four years was then chosen , was based upon a Constitution which she supposed still had an existence . She saw that State after State had left that Government  --  seceded is the word used ; had gone out from this great Confederacy , and were defying the Constitution and the Union . Charge after charge has been vaguely made against the North . It is attempted here to put the North on trial . I have listened with grave attention to the gentleman from Virginia to-day , but I have heard no specification of these charges . Massachusetts hesitated I say ; she has her own opinions of the Government and the Union . I know Massachusetts ; I have been into every one of her more than three hundred towns . I have seen and conversed with her men and her women , and I know there is not a man within her borders who would not to-day gladly lay down his life for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery wherever she had the right to do it ; but much as she abhors the institution , she would sacrifice everything rather than assail it where she has not the right to assail it . Can it be denied , gentlemen , that we have elected a President in a legal and constitutional way ? It can not ; and yet you tell us in tones that can not be misunderstood , that as a precedent condition of his inauguration we must give you these guarantees . Massachusetts hesitated , not because her blood was not stirred , but because she insisted that the Government and the inauguration should go on , in the same manner they would have done had Mr. Lincoln been defeated . She felt that she was touched in a tender point when invited here under such circumstances . It is true , and I confess it frankly , that there are a few men at the North who have not yielded that support to the grand idea upon which this confederated Union stands , that they should have done ; who have been disposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North , with these exceptions , accords to you . But are you of the South free from the like imputations ? The John Brown invasion was never justified at the North . If , in the excitement of the time , there were those to be found who did not denounce it as gentlemen think they should , it was because they knew it was a matter wholly outside the Constitution  --  that it was a crime to which Virginia would give adequate punishment . Gentlemen , I believe , yes , I know , that the people of the North are as true to the Government and the Union of the States now , as our fathers were when they stood shoulder to shoulder upon the field , fighting for the principles upon which that Union rests . If I thought the time had come when it would be fit or proper to consider amendments to the Constitution at all , I should believe that we would have no trouble with you except upon this question of slavery in the territories . You can not demand of us at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless it involves a sacrifice of our principles . These we shall not sacrifice  --  these you must not ask us to abandon . I believe further , and I speak in all frankness , for I wish to delude no one , that if the Constitution and the Union can not be preserved and effectually maintained without these new guarantees for slavery , that the Union is not worth preserving . The people of the North have always submitted to the decisions of the proper constituted powers . This obedience has been unpleasant enough when they thought these powers were exercised for sectional purposes ; but it has always been implicitly yielded . I am ready , even now , to go home and say that , by the decision of the Supreme Court , slavery exists in all the territories of the United States . We submit to the decision and accept its consequences . But in view of all the circumstances attending that decision , was it quite fair  --  was it quite generous for the gentleman from Maryland to say that , under it , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every thing , the North giving up nothing ? Does he suppose the South is yielding the point in relation to any territory , which by any probability would become slave territory ? Something more than the decision of the Supreme Court is necessary to establish slavery anywhere . The decision may give the right to establish it , other influences must control the question of its actual establishment . I am opposed , further , to any restrictions on the acquisition of territory . They are unnecessary . The time may come when they would be troublesome . We may want the Canadas . The time may come when the Canadas may wish to unite with us . Shall we tie up our hands so that we can not receive them , or make it forever your interest to oppose their annexation ? Such a restriction would be , by the common consent of the people , disregarded . There are seven States out of the Union already . They have organized what they claim is an independent Government . They are not to be coerced back , you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own accord ? But they will annex territory . They are already looking to Mexico . If left to themselves they would annex her and all her neighbors , and we should lose our highway to the Pacific coast . They would acquire it , and to us it would be lost forever . The North will consider well before she consents to this  --  before she even permits it . Ever since 1820 we have pursued , in this respect , a uniform policy . The North will hesitate long before , by accepting the condition you propose , she deprives the nation of the valuable privilege , the unquestionable right , of acquiring new territory in an honorable way . I have tried to look upon these propositions of the majority of the committee , as true measures of pacification . I have listened patiently to all that has been said in their favor . But I am still unconvinced , or rather I am convinced that they will do nothing for the Union . They will prove totally inadequate ; may , perhaps , be positively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not adopt them  --  will not consent to these new endorsements of an institution which they do not like , which they believe to be injurious to the best interests of the Republic ; and if they did adopt them , as they could only do by a sacrifice of principles which you should not expect , the South would not be satisfied ; she would not fail to find pretexts for a course of action upon which I think she has already determined . I see in these propositions any thing but true measures of pacification . But the North will never consent to the separation of the States . If the South persists in the course on which she has entered we shall march our armies to the Gulf of Mexico , or you will march yours to the Great Lakes . There can be no peaceful separation . There is one way by which war may be avoided and the Union preserved . It is a plain and a constitutional way . If the slave States will abandon the design , which we must infer from the remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will faithfully abide by their constitutional obligations , and remain in the Union until their rights are in fact invaded , all will be well . But if they take the responsibility of involving the country in a civil war ; of breaking up the Government which our fathers founded and our people love , but one course remains to those who are true to that Government . They must and will defend it at every sacrifice  --  if necessary , to the sacrifice of their lives . Mr. GUTHRIE :  --  I came here with my colleagues representing a Southern State . I have had full and free communication with the people of all portions of the South , before , during , and since the election of the sixth of November , and I state here , that I have never dreamed that there was the slightest objection anywhere to the inauguration of Mr. LINCOLN . To-day is the first time I ever heard the question raised , and yet I do not believe that any such objection now exists . It is said that this is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable time to consider the questions now before us . Is there any reason why we should not consider the rights of any section of the country , whether a President is going out or coming in ? As one delegate I will not consent to postpone the action necessary to secure our rights for any such reason as this . Now , as to this question of slavery in the Territories . It is true that the Supreme Court has decided it in favor of the South . It is equally true that parties have repudiated that decision both in platforms and on the stump . When territory has been acquired by the blood and treasure of the common Union , you can not exclude one portion of the cestuis que trust from its rights . The Supreme Court so decided , and its decision was just and equitable . At the South , we ask for our rights under the Constitution . We say , let all questions which affect or concern them be decided . The gentleman from Massachusetts says he will not give them up , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so , let us go to the ballot box . If the question is decided in the gentleman 's favor there , we know how to take care of ourselves . The gentleman from Massachusetts does not understand this question . He does not understand why we of the South want it  --  why we must have it settled . There was a time when the embargo law threw our slaves out of employment . The North then contemplated a dissolution of the Union . Why ? Because she thought the Government wanted power  --  was inefficient . Now , there is a sense of insecurity felt throughout the South . Our property is depreciating , going down every day . We feel this want of security very deeply , this want of faith in the Government under which we live . The South is in agitation . Suppose some event should in some way strike down the value of your property at the North . Would you not wish to have its security restored ? Would you not call for guarantees ? If you would not , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ask for , is security . There is nothing in the territorial question that we may not settle by a fair compromise . The commonwealth of Virginia called this Conference in high patriotism . I have an earnest faith in her sincerity and her purity in doing so . She hoped to meet her sisters animated by the same patriotism  --  that they would join with her in granting the assurances , in giving the securities we need . Gentlemen , you can give us these securities  --  these assurances . We shall then go home and tell our people that we can still live on together , in security . Will it do to say that this can not be done before the inauguration of Mr. LINCOLN ? No ! No such answer should go to the people of any of the States  --  no such answer will satisfy them . Give us the guarantees here . We will satisfy the people of the whole nation as to the appropriateness of the time . There is no truth in the assertions of the gentleman from Massachusetts . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her glorious memories , willing to go before New York with her half million of voters , confident that both will do us justice . Why stand between us and the people ? At least , let us ask their judgment upon our propositions . We come here to confer , to propitiate , not to awaken old troubles and differences . If there are such existing and which must be settled , why should we not settle them here ? We all wish to bring back the seven States which have left us ; we have a common interest in them . I think they should not have deserted us ; that they should have consulted us first , and then there would have been no necessity . If they were here , their presence surely would not have weakened us , nor would their presence have disturbed the North . We come not here to widen our separation  --  to drive them further off . We come to consult together , to give and receive justice . I confess I am not much in favor of the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressive country . From four millions of people we have risen to thirty millions ! Where will we be in eighty years more ? There will be in that time a great population in our now unsettled territory  --  perhaps greater than all our present population . I thought the amendment unwise , but I consented to it , for if we would agree we must all yield something . And now I hope , and hope most earnestly , that without crimination or recrimination we shall vote in good temper and in good time , so that our proposals may in due time go before Congress and before the people . Do not let us give up to revolution anywhere , in any section of the Union ! Do not you of the North impose upon us the necessity of fleeing our country ! God knows this same necessity may come to you of the North , and sooner than you expect it . If disruption  --  if war must come , one-half your merchants , one-half your mechanics will become bankrupt . You are marching that way with hasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but must suffer if the sad conclusion comes . Our products will depreciate . Next year not one-half the fields now whitened by the rich growth of cotton will be cultivated if this unhappy contest goes on . The people of my section , the people of the South , are restless and impatient . They are already in the way of revolution  --  all these influences are leading them on . Can they remain quiet when the fortunes of one-half of them are struck down ? Can you at the North remain quiet under like provocations ? And yet harmony may even yet be restored . All these differences may be settled harmoniously . We believe they may be settled now . Mr. TUCK :  --  If we should agree to all your propositions , and Congress still should not act upon them , would not these difficulties be still more complicated ? Mr. GUTHRIE :  --  No , sir ! No ! We would then tell our people that this Conference would , but Congress would not do any thing to save the country . In such an event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress . Mr. GOODRICH :  --  Permit me one question to the gentleman from Kentucky . Would this Convention , in his opinion , have been called by Virginia , if either Mr. DOUGLAS or Mr. BRECKENRIDGE had been elected ? Mr. GUTHRIE :  --  I do not think it would have been called in that event . Let me say , however , one thing which escaped me . It is not a divided Democracy  --  not the existence of a Whig party , but it is the union of all discordant elements combined , which have brought the abolitionists into power , which has produced this sense of insecurity in the South . It is their combined power which the people of the South feel , and which they wish to guard against . Mr. CLEVELAND :  --  I feel bound to say to all here present , that unless this debate stops now , we might as well go home . I have pondered much upon the remark of my worthy friend from Kentucky , that if we could not do good here , at least we ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to aggravate these unhappy circumstances ? Let us not widen our dissensions ; let us do nothing to postpone or destroy the only hope we have for the settlement of our troubles . Let us be gentle and pleasant . Let us love one another . Let us not try to find out who is the smartest or the keenest . Let us vote soon , and without any feeling or any quarrelling . Mr. SEDDON :  --  I fear from some remarks that have been made during this discussion , that not only my motives , but the terms in which I have expressed them , have been misapprehended . I have been untrue to every purpose of my mind , if I have spoken with any bitterness or acrimony . I thought it was my duty to be plain  --  at the same time temperate though emphatic . I thought I had been so . Nothing is farther from my purpose than the irritation of any section , much less of any member here . Most assuredly I did not intend to create dissension or to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding it necessary to leave the Conference , now called Mr. ALEXANDER to the chair . Mr. CLEVELAND :  --  I did not mean to stir up anybody . I want to settle these unhappy points of difference here . I want to settle them to-day , now , this very hour . Suppose we do not settle them ! Does not border war follow ? does not civil war come ? I speak to all of you , both North and South . What becomes of your property in such a case ? Who wants to stake it all on such a hazard ? We settled this question once fairly , and , as everybody thought , finally . That was in 1850 . Why was not that settlement permitted to stand ? Nothing but the ambition that has sent so many angels down to hell could have ever brought it up again . It is too late to bring charges against either section now  --  too late to bring charges against individuals . The question now before us is ,  --  Which is the way to lead the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good works  --  these alone will do it . If these fail , we have no hope elsewhere . I am in favor of the propositions of amendment submitted . These we can stand upon throughout the land . The people will adopt them . In the name of all that is good and holy let us settle these differences here . Why talk about territory to be acquired hereafter ? We have just the same title to it that the devil had to the territory he offered our Saviour on a certain remarkable occasion  --  just the same title , at all events , no better . For Heaven 's sake , gentlemen , let us act for the good of the country ! let us give to every section its rights  --  to every man his rights , and let this be remembered through all time as the Convention of Patriots which sacrificed every selfish and personal consideration to save the country ! Mr. GOODRICH :  --  I wish to make one remark to the Conference , and especially to the gentleman from Kentucky . Much is said here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine . We believe this to be a country of equals . We went into the last Presidential contest as equals  --  and as such we elected Mr. LINCOLN . Now , when we have the right to do so , we wish to come into power as equals  --  with that superiority only which our majority gives us . When we are in power and disturb or threaten to disturb the rights of any portion of the Union , then ask us for security , for guarantees , and if need be you shall have both . How would you have treated us if we had come to you with such a request at the commencement of any Democratic administration ? Mr. LOGAN :  --  I want to refer the report of the majority , and the substitute proposed by the minority , back to the committee . I believe that it is better to have action upon all these questions at the earliest possible moment . The question now is , not which section of the Union is suffering most  --  all sections are suffering ; all are feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trembling to the future ; all desire a speedy and a peaceful conclusion of our differences . If we can not settle them here  --  if we can not induce Congress to submit our propositions of amendment to the people , then I pray from my heart , I hope and believe , that our friends in every section will wait patiently until these propositions can go before the State Legislatures and receive proper consideration there . The PRESIDENT here stated the proposition , to refer the reports of the majority and the minority of the committee back to the committee , with instructions . Several members objected to the motion , declaring it not in order . The motion was thereupon withdrawn . The PRESIDENT :  --  The question recurs upon the amendment offered by the gentleman from Maryland , to insert the word " present " before the word territories , in the first line and the fifth line of the propositions of the amendment to the Constitution submitted by the majority of the committee . The amendment was adopted without a count of the yeas and nays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the adoption of the amendment , is as follows : ARTICLE 1 . In all the present territory of the United States , not embraced within the limits of the Cherokee treaty grant , north of a line from east to west on the parallel of 36 deg. 30 ' north latitude , involuntary servitude , except in punishment of crime , is prohibited whilst it shall be under a Territorial Government ; and in all the present territory south of said line , the status of persons owing service or labor as it now exists , shall not be changed by law while such territory shall be under a Territorial Government ; and neither Congress nor the Territorial Government shall have power to hinder or prevent the taking to said territory of persons held to labor or involuntary service , within the United States , according to the laws or usages of the State from which such persons may be taken , nor to impair the rights arising out of said relations , which shall be subject to judicial cognizance in the Federal Courts , according to the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said line , within such boundary as Congress may prescribe , shall contain a population required for a member of Congress , according to the then Federal ratio of representation , it shall , if its form of government be republican , be admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the original States , with or without involuntary service or labor , as the Constitution of such new State may provide . Mr. ROMAN :  --  I move that when this Conference adjourn , it adjourn to meet at seven o'clock this evening . Mr. CHITTENDEN :  --  I move an adjournment of the Conference . Mr. ROMAN :  --  Is not my motion first in order ? The PRESIDENT :  --  The question is on the motion of the gentleman from Vermont . The motion to adjourn was put and carried . TWELFTH DAY . WASHINGTON , TUESDAY , February 19th , 1861 . The Conference was called to order by the PRESIDENT at eleven o'clock . The proceedings were opened with prayer . The Journal was read by Assistant Secretary PULESTON , and , after sundry amendments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Credentials have received and considered the credentials of Mr. FRANCIS GRANGER , of New York , appointed to fill a vacancy in the delegation from that State , occasioned by the resignation of Mr. ADDISON GARDINER . They are satisfactory , and if no objection is made , the list of delegates from New York will be altered accordingly . No objection was made , and Mr. GRANGER 'S name was added to the list of delegates from New York . Mr. WICKLIFFE :  --  I ask now that the resolution limiting the time to be occupied by each member in debate be taken up . I have become satisfied that unless we place some restrictions , in this respect , upon the discussions , we shall occupy much more time than we wish to have expended in that way . The session of the present Congress will soon terminate . Our labors will be useless , unless we submit the result of them to Congress in time to secure the approval of that body . The propositions will be debated there , and that debate must necessarily occupy time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main purpose of the Conference by delay . The resolution is as follows : Resolved , That in the discussions which may take place in this Convention upon any question , no member shall be allowed to speak more than thirty minutes . Mr. DAVIS :  --  I move to amend the resolution by inserting ten minutes instead of thirty minutes . Mr. FIELD :  --  Is it seriously contemplated now , after gentlemen upon one side have spoken two or three times , and at great length  --  after the questions involved in the committee 's reports have been thoroughly and exhaustively discussed on the part of the South  --  and when only one gentleman from the North has been heard upon the general subject , to cut us off from all opportunity of expressing our views ? Such a course will not help your propositions . Mr. BOUTWELL :  --  Massachusetts will never consent to this . Mr. WICKLIFFE :  --  If we can not get Massachusetts to help us , we will help ourselves . We got along without her in the war of 1812 ; we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation now . It is of no use , or rather it is too late to talk about the cause , we had much better try to cure the disease . Mr. FIELD :  --  New York has not occupied the time of the Conference for three minutes . Kentucky has been heard twice , her representative speaking as long as he wished . I insist upon the same right for New York . I insist upon the discussion of these questions without restriction or limitation . Mr. DODGE :  --  I wish to speak for the commercial interests of the country . I can not do them justice in ten minutes . Mr. MOREHEAD , of North Carolina :  --  I am very desirous to reach an early decision , and yet I do not quite like to restrict debate in this way . Suppose , after holding one morning session , we have another commencing at half-past seven in the evening ? Mr. CARRUTHERS :  --  We have come here for the purpose of acting ; not to hear speeches . There is no use in talking over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talking will not change them . I want to make an end of these discussions . I move that all debate shall close at three o'clock to-day , and that the Conference then proceed to vote upon the propositions before it . Mr. ALLEN :  --  The object which brought us together I presume we shall not disagree about . We came here for the purpose of consultation over the condition of the country . If this is true , nothing but harm can come from these limitations upon the liberty of speech . The questions before us are the most important that could possibly arise . Before our present Constitution was adopted it was discussed and examined in Convention for more than three months . We are now practically making a new Constitution . Though we as members differed widely when we came here , I think progress has been made toward our ultimate agreement . I think the general effect of our discussions is to bring us nearer together . I think our acquaintance and our association as members lead to the same end . The gentleman from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't quite agree with him as to the disease . I differ widely from him as to the proper method of treating it . He seems disposed to apply a plaster to the foot , to cure a disease in the head . If these debates should continue for a week , the time would not be lost , the effect would be favorable . We should have more faith in each other , a more kindly feeling would be produced . Do not let us hurry . You may force a vote to-day , but the result will satisfy none . Such a course will give good ground for dissatisfaction . You may even carry your propositions by a majority , but what weight will such a vote have in Congress or with the people ? Mr. CHITTENDEN :  --  We who represent smaller States intend to be very modest here , but you will need our votes when you seek to place new and important limitations upon a Constitution with which we are now satisfied . I will answer for one State , and tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her with a taint of suspicion about it . If you will not allow her representatives to participate in the examination and discussion of these propositions here , her people will reject them without discussion , if they are ever called to act on them . She has not occupied the time of this Conference for one minute upon the general subject . She may not wish to do so . I submit whether it is wise for you to cut off her right to be heard here , if she chooses to exercise it . Mr. RANDOLPH :  --  I agree with the gentleman from Tennessee , that we came here to act and not to talk . We have had talking enough , perhaps too much already . I have drawn up a resolution which I think covers the whole subject , I move its adoption . The resolution was read as follows : Resolved , That this Convention will hold two sessions daily , viz. , from ten o'clock , A.M. , to four o'clock , P.M. ; and from eight to ten o'clock , P.M. ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four and ten , P.M. , shall be in order , if objection be made ; and that on Thursday next , at twelve o'clock , noon , all debate shall cease , and the Convention proceed to vote upon the questions or propositions before them in their order . The PRESIDENT commenced a statement of the various propositions relating to the subject now pending , when Mr. ALEXANDER moved to lay the whole subject on the table . The motion to lay on the table was negatived by the following vote :  --  ayes , 48 ; nays , 54 . Mr. GOODRICH :  --  I call for the division of the question . The PRESIDENT :  --  So many motions have been made that it is somewhat difficult to decide , by the rules of Parliamentary law , which is in order . I will divide the questions as follows : 1st . Will the Conference hold two sessions daily ? 2d . Shall the debate be closed on Thursday at twelve o'clock ? 3d . Shall each member be limited to ten minutes in the discussion ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions will be decided affirmatively . Mr. CHASE :  --  It appears to me that we can arrange this whole subject without serious difficulty . If Mr. WICKLIFFE will adhere to his resolution , and the other proposals are withdrawn , we can then proceed . If any gentleman finds it necessary to ask for an extension of his time , it will no doubt be granted to him . Mr. RANDOLPH 'S proposition exacts too much labor . I think the Conference had better limit the time of each member . I am opposed to fixing a time for terminating the discussion . It will not be agreeable to many who may be cut off . It is contrary to the spirit of the rules we have already adopted . I hope we shall not be compelled to vote on the questions one by one , and I will suggest to Mr. RANDOLPH whether it would not be better that his resolution should be withdrawn . Mr. HOPPIN :  --  I hope the resolution will pass as it is . We have come here to act . We are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote the better . There is every necessity for prompt action . Mr. MOREHEAD :  --  If the proposition had emanated from another quarter , I should feel at liberty to urge its adoption . As it is , I would pay the highest respect to it . I regret extremely to hear the talk about sides in this Conference . I came here to act for the Union  --  the whole Union . I recognize no sides  --  no party . If any come here for a different purpose I do not wish to act with them ; they are wrong . I hope from my heart that we can all yet live together in peace ; but if we are to do so we must act , and act speedily . Mr. CHASE again stated his proposition . Mr. CRISFIELD :  --  If I understand rightly , the question should be on striking out the latter clause of the resolution , so as to perfect it and make it meet the case . I make the point and  --  Mr. RANDOLPH :  --  I think the gentleman from Maryland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask whether a resolution to supersede the motion to adjourn is in order ? The PRESIDENT :  --  I think the question should first be taken on the motion to strike out the last clause in the resolution . Mr. STOCKTON :  --  If the Conference felt as I do , it would at once establish such peremptory orders as would bring a speedy termination to this whole business . Upon what , let me ask gentlemen , does the salvation of the Union depend at this moment ? What is it alone that prevents civil war now ? I answer , it is the session of this Convention  --  this august Convention ! We stand in the presence of an awful danger ! We feel the throes of an earthquake which threatens to bring down ruin on the whole magnificent fabric of our Government ! Is it possible that we should suffer this ruin to take place ? Would it not impeach the wisdom and good sense of our day and generation to permit the edifice which our fathers constructed  --  to crumble to pieces ? No ! fellow countrymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , who guided our ancestors through the stormy vicissitudes of the Revolution , should this day resolve that the Union shall be preserved ! In the execution of that resolve let us unfold a new leaf in our national history , and write thereon words of peace . Peace or war is in our hands  --  an awful alternative ! Peace alone is the object of our mission ; to restore peace to a distracted country . I have spent my whole life in the service of my country . I love the people of every State in it . They have been under my command and I have been under theirs . I know them , and I know that this Union can never be dissolved without a struggle . Will you hasten the time when we shall begin to shed each other 's blood ? No ! gentlemen , no ! There seems to be but one question which gives us any difficulty in adjusting . That is , about the right of the South to take their slaves into the territories . Is it possible that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any difference on such a question as this ? Better that the territories were buried in the deep sea beyond the plummet 's reach , than that they should be the cause of such a deplorable result . But it is not the value of the territories which is in dispute ; it is not whether the North or the South shall colonize them , because , as the gentleman from New York has said , that though the territory south of 36 deg. 30 ' had been ten years open to Southern colonization , only twenty-four slaves had been introduced into it . No , the real question is , whether pride of opinion shall succumb to the necessities of the crisis . The Premier of the incoming administration has declared that parties and platforms are subordinate to , and must disappear in the presence of the great question of the Union . This gives me hope . Let him and his friends act upon that , and this Conference can in six hours , in conjunction with a committee of his political friends , adjust such terms of settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as a sacrifice to save Rome , when informed by the oracle that the loss of his life would save his country . We are now in greater danger than Rome was then ; but is there no Curtius for our salvation ? We are not called upon to give up life , property , or honor , but to concede justice and equal rights to our Southern brethren . We only want the courage to yield extreme opinions . What power , after victory , refuses to lower the lofty terms which were asserted on the eve of the battle for the sake of peace ? But the Republicans say , shall we surrender the fruits of victory to the vanquished ? I answer , how are you to enjoy your fruits without pacification ? You expected to govern the whole country . You aspired to the control of the whole empire . Without peace you will not succeed in establishing possession of that magnificent country which your predecessors governed , but you will govern a little more than half of it , and with that you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threatening attitude of the South by denouncing it as a rebellion  --  as treason . It is idle to disguise the danger . The revolt of a whole people , covering a territory equal to half of Europe , is a revolution . You can not dwarf the movement by stigmatizing it as treason . Its magnitude and proportions make the sword , and not the law , its arbiter . Is it possible that people can be so infatuated as to contemplate the use of the sword to conquer secession ? Will you hasten the time when we shall begin to shed each other 's blood ? Coerce ! force fifteen States ! Why , you can not force New Jersey alone ! Force the South ? They wo n't stop to count forces  --  neither side can be frightened . Do n't think of it . You can not frighten either , no more than the hero could be frightened whom the Roman poet has immortalized . Suppose after the expenditure of a thousand millions you shall have stopped dismemberment and subjugated the South , what is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the army and its chiefs who have conquered ? When the Long Parliament had murdered Charles , subdued Ireland and Scotland , and compelled the deference of all Europe , they supposed they would enjoy the fruits of their victories . They began to discuss the expenses of the army , and the expediency of its reduction . They had hardly commenced when Cromwell entered Westminster Hall and turned out the Republican party of that day . The whole country , tired of war , crouched under the iron heel of the Puritan soldier . The Republican party of England succumbed ; Cromwell died ; his son resigned the Protectorate , and the Republican party of England rose to the surface and made its last struggle for its power . General Monk and his army approached London , and Parliament with servility waited the pleasure of the army . The army declared for the King , and the King was restored . When men meet to save the country , they must be prepared to give up every thing  --  to give their lives if necessary . How can men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But will the country consent to be dragged into civil war to maintain the Chicago Platform ? It will not . That Platform was erected upon a perishable foundation . In the language of the New York Senator , it must " disappear . " I appeal to the brotherhood , to the fraternity of the North . My friends , peace or war is in your hands . You hold the keys of peace or war . You tell us not to hasten in this matter . But you do not realize the facts  --  no one does . It is said that the South challenges and invites war . No such thing . The mad action of South Carolina does not truly represent the South . There are disunionists South as well as North . It is the duty of patriotic men to checkmate the disunionists of both sections . By a proclamation of war , we shall effectually play into the hands and gratify the disunionists of both extremes . Civil war consolidates the South as a unit for disunion . The gallant southern men who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will then be overpowered and forced into the ranks of the defenders of the South . While the South will thus be undivided and stand in solid phalanx , what will be our condition here at the North ? Can it be supposed that the Union men of the Democracy of the North will stand by and see the country plunged into civil war to maintain the Chicago Platform ? Will they acquiesce in the demolition of this Union by these means , when it can be preserved by peace ? No , sir ! Do you talk here about regiments for invasion , for coercion  --  you , gentlemen of the North ? You know better ; I know better . For every regiment raised there for coercion , there will be another raised for resistance to coercion . If no other State will raise them , remember New Jersey . The Republican leaders of the North , with hot haste , have worked through the Legislatures of the several States resolutions of a belligerent character , offering the military power of those States to the Government to subdue the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislatures to make any such tenders ? Would the people of the North sanction any such nefarious policy ? I know well the enormous bribe with which the Republican leaders would seduce the North into fratricidal war . The expenditure of uncounted millions , the distribution of epaulets and military commissions for an army of half a million of men , the immense patronage involved in the letting of army contracts , the inflation of prices and the rise of property which would follow the excessive issue of paper money , made necessary by the lavish expenditure ;  --  these , indeed , are the enormous bribes which the Republican party offers . How arrogant it is for the Republican leaders to tender the military power of their States ! Who gave them or their States authority to raise armies ? For national purposes the whole militia of the Union is subject to Congress . Congress alone has power to declare war and to call out the militia , and Congress can only call upon the militia to suppress insurrection or repel invasion . Pause , gentlemen ! Stop where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to your very hearthstones  --  bloody , disheartening strife . War will be in your own homes , among your own families . Under ordinary circumstances you would hesitate . If the question was about tariff , you would hesitate and look at the awful consequences . That there is a diversity between us is very true . What of it ? It lies in a nutshell . We can fix it in a minute , if you will be calm and act like brothers . The only question , as I understand it , for I have thought and studied upon it , is this : You of the North will not yield to the South the small privilege of taking their slaves into the territories of the common Union . You will not give them a fair chance with you , even in the Government property  --  the territories . When the territories become States they will have to take care of themselves . You can not theorize slave soil into free soil , nor vice versa . Am I not right ? Does the South ask any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States ? No , gentlemen ; the South demands no such thing . It is not demanded by her , and never will be . All I ask for the South , and all she asks for herself , is this : Let us be free to come with our slaves into all your territories , and hold them there until the territory is made up into States . I have shown that if peace be not secured , the uprising of the South would be a revolution , and can not be treated as mere insurrection . The bravado , therefore , of offering armies to the Government , can only have the effect , at this crisis , of preventing a peaceful adjustment . Against all such demonstrations we must fix our faces like flint . Peace we must have . The Union can only be preserved by peace . The South asks no more than the North will concede , if the people of the North can express their sentiments . The South only asks for equal rights , and to be let alone . For thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present its cause in an authoritative shape . Their conventions will soon declare their propositions . Let the North be prepared to consider them in conventions representing their people fairly . If this is done , there is no doubt the present crisis will pass without danger . Until time for these results can be taken , let warlike demonstrations be resisted . Let the Government abstain from collision , even with South Carolina . There is as much of loyalty to the Union at the South as anywhere . It has only disappeared in the presence of danger which threatened their domestic tranquillity , their safety , and their honor . Let the hostile attitude which the North assumed at Chicago give place to the recognition of the rights of the South , and we shall see an outburst of loyalty to the Union throughout the entire South , like that which welcomed to old England its constitutional sovereign after a long and bloody civil war , forced upon the English people by the Puritans . It is the spirit of the same fanatic intolerance which has caused our present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for peace . Peace with all nations has been the master policy . It has elevated our country to its present condition of power and prosperity . Do not let us sacrifice peace , and suffer violence and discord to usurp its reign . We have a magnificent future if we can only preserve the Union as our fathers constructed it . While it lasts there is a great light in the firmament in which all may walk in security , hope , and happiness . It is a light reaching far down the depths of futurity cheering and guiding the steps of our children . It is a light shining to the remotest corner of the earth  --  raising up the down-trodden and illuminating the homes of the victims of oppression . But let that light be now eclipsed , go out in blood and darkness , and the hopes of mankind are forever blasted . Gentlemen , will you not consider ? Shall we not settle the question here , and not trouble the rest of the Union with it ? We will settle it fairly and squarely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to set about destroying the Union . Why quarrel over such a simple question ? No , gentlemen , you shall not do it . I am going to talk to you as individuals  --  as men  --  as patriots . I know too many of you and too much about you . You love your country too well to destroy her for such a cause . You are too patriotic . The North will never dissolve this Union on any such pretexts . You can not destroy your country for that . You love it too much . I call on you , WADSWORTH and KING , FIELD and CHASE and MORRILL  --  as able men , as brothers  --  as good patriots  --  to give up every thing else if it is necessary , to save your country . But we do n't ask you to give up any thing in the way of principles . Now that Chicago Platform of yours is a nice paper . It has many good things in it . But it must not control this question . You can keep that platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Shall we go into war upon this little question about the Territories . No ! No ! ! Under the most favorable circumstances possible for the experiment of self-government , with every possible inducement to preserve our country , we must not give it up . The years of civil war which will succeed dismemberment of the Union will cause true men to seek refuge and security , from military despotism , in some other country . Some Caesar or Napoleon will spring from the vortex of revolution and war , and with his sword cleave his way to supreme command . If all history is not a failure , and if mankind are now what they have always been , such will be the fate of free government in the United States , in the event of war . Shall we bring such a catastrophe upon us to vindicate the Chicago Platform ? No ! the American people will rise in their omnipotence and trample into dust the man who dared to put in jeopardy this Union , in order to maintain such demagogism . Away with parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free and patriotic efforts now making for the salvation of the Union . It shall not be destroyed . I tell you , friends , I am going to stand right in the way . You shall not go home ; you shall never see your wives and families again , until you have settled these matters , and saved your good old country , if I can help it . Spread aloft the banner of stripes and stars , let the whole country rally beneath its glorious folds , with no other slogan on their lips but the unanimous cry , THE UNION , IT MUST BE PRESERVED ! Mr. GRANGER :  --  New Jersey has addressed New York as though she supposed the delegation from that State to be united in its opinions , and its action . Let me set the gentleman himself and the Conference right on that point at the commencement . The members composing that delegation do not agree ; very far from it . The vote of that delegation hitherto has been determined by a majority only ; a majority reduced to the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may be said that New York voted at the last Presidential election against us by a majority of fifty thousand ; but let me assure you that if the noble propositions of the majority of your committee , which I read for the first time yesterday , could be submitted to them , the people of New York would adopt them by even a larger majority . These are noble propositions ; they are worthy the eminent and patriotic committee from which they have emanated . They present a fair and equitable basis for the adjustment of our difficulties ; they are a shield and a sure defence against the dangers which threaten us . They are such as the people expect and such as they want . They know that the politicians who have brought the country to the verge of ruin can be trusted no longer . The time has come when they must act for themselves . Be assured , gentlemen , they will do so . I wish to say a few words about the last election in New York , for it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that canvass ? Upon what principles was it conducted ? What representations were made ? I am one of the men who have struggled to meet and oppose this Republican party from the outset  --  to avert , if possible , the adoption of its pernicious principles by the people of New York . I took my stand upon the Compromise of 1850 , and separated myself politically from all men who could not stand with me on that platform . We struggled on until that Compromise was adopted by the Baltimore Convention . The Kansas bill was introduced at a most fatal hour . It was distasteful to the whole country ; satisfactory nowhere . In due time the Charleston Convention was assembled , and the Democratic party was broken up forever . What next ? Next came the Chicago Convention . It may have been conducted with dignity , and it nominated a candidate . I differ widely from that candidate in my principles and my policy . And yet I believe in him although I opposed his election . I would trust his Kentucky blood to the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest . I have no idea that he will permit the policy of his administration to be controlled by the hotheaded zealots who have been so conspicuous in the last canvass . I expect to see him call to his council board , cool , dispassionate , and conservative men ; not men who are driven to the verge of insanity upon this question of slavery . What next ? The Baltimore Convention was held . The tragedy was consummated ; the contest was ended . The mere scuffle to secure the control of the Convention which ended in its division , has brought the country into all its present difficulties . If that Convention had presented to the people a good conservative Democrat , there were seventy-five thousand good old line Whigs who would have buckled on their armor and would have won the battle for him . When the Southern papers began to threaten disunion because LINCOLN did not suit the South , I was not one who abused or denounced them . I knew the temper of some of the politicians in the free States . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew there was a reason for it . They said their capital was to be rendered worthless  --  their property to be destroyed , and their country made desolate . God forbid that I should chide them for thinking so ! The Northern mind is in some respects very different from the Southern . It is not started by slight scratches , but strike the rowel deep , and there is a purpose in it that nothing can conquer or restrain . The people of the North will carry that purpose into execution , with a power as fierce as that of the maddest chivalry of South Carolina . The rowel was struck deep and the consequences were not considered . Subjects have been introduced into this discussion which I should have been glad to have avoided , which it would have been better every way to have avoided . The gentleman from Virginia has referred to the JOHN BROWN invasion . That is one of those subjects . He spoke of the feeling at the North regarding insurrections . I assure you that the North regarded the invader in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrestrained  --  a terrible enemy . I would say to the gentleman from Virginia , that although too many instances among extreme men may have been found of attempts to justify that invasion , such was not the general feeling at the North . Those instances were rare exceptions ; and because they were so few and so exceptional , acquired a degree of notoriety and received a degree of attention to which they were never entitled . Such instances as these have always served to prejudice the South improperly against the North . Men are too much given to forming opinions of us from the intemperate acts of a few meddling men . How do we stand at the present moment in this respect . You will find a few men among us , even now , rash enough to say , " Let these Southern slaveholders go . The ' nigger ' will rise upon them and cut their throats ! " The action of such men , I admit , gives some color and justification to your charges and prejudices against the whole Northern people . I agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of peace or war . I believe it to be so from my very soul . The North has been much to blame in bringing it upon us . What has been the language used at the North ? Men have used such expressions as this , " The South secede ? Why , you ca n't kick out the South . " And men who knew no better believed the statement to be true . I appeal to northern men to say whether this has not been so . I myself thought four States would go , but I believed secession would stop there . We had more to hope from Louisiana than from any other Gulf State . She has gone , and has now taken up a most offensive and threatening position . Virginia to-day is in more danger of immediate secession than Louisiana was a few short months ago . My friend from New Jersey says that if this Convention does not prevent it , there must be war . I agree with him . War ! what a fearful alternative to contemplate ? War is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but always terrible . It can not come to this country without a fearful expenditure of blood and treasure . It will leave us , if it leaves us a nation at all , with an awful legacy of widows ' tears  --  of the blighted hopes of orphans  --  with a catalogue of suffering , misery , and woe , too long to be enumerated and too painful to be contemplated . For God 's sake ! let such a fate be averted at any cost , from the country . If it comes at all , it will be such a war as the world never saw . War is commonly , and almost universally , between nations foreign to each other  --  whose individuals are strangers to each other , and whose interests are widely separated . But we are a nation of brothers , of a common ancestry , and bound together by a thousand memories of the past  --  a thousand ties of interest and blood . It will be a war between brothers  --  between you who come to us in summer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war between those who have been connected in business  --  associated in pleasures , and who have met as brothers in the halls of legislation and the marts of commerce . Save us from such a war ! Let not the mad anger of such a people be aroused . And , gentlemen , if war comes it must be long and terrible . You will see both parties rise in their majesty at both ends of the line . They will slough off every other consideration and devote themselves , with terrible energy , to the work of death . Oh ye ! who bring such a calamity as this upon this once happy country ! Pause , gentlemen , before you do it , and think of the fearful accountability that awaits you in time and in eternity . But I am here to answer for the State of New York ; the Empire State and the people of the Empire State . I have never been classed with the rash men of that State who have aided in bringing about this condition of things . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Empire State and those glorious propositions of your committee . They are in the smallest possible majority even in our delegation . All I ask is , that we may have the judgment of the people upon these propositions , and I will be answerable for the rest ; and these gentlemen who rely upon the fifty thousand ( 50,000 ) majority of last November , will have a fearful waiting for of judgment . Fifty thousand majority ! Who does not know how that majority was made up ? It was not a majority upon the question of slavery at all . It came in this wise : The opposite party was divided and distracted . The Republican party united all sorts of discordant elements ; men voted for Mr. LINCOLN from a great variety of motives . Some , because they wanted the Homestead law ; some because they wanted a change in the Tariff ; and , gentlemen , let me assure you , there were more men who voted for Mr. LINCOLN  --  solely on account of the Tariff  --  than would have made up this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , and I know I can answer for them when I say , Give us these fair and noble propositions and we will accept them with an unanimity that will gratefully surprise the nation . How does the nation stand to-day ? Look at Kansas ! She is a State and yet in beggary . She is stretching out her hands to us for relief . We have relieved her for the time , but she will need more aid again . The whole country is excited and agitated . The press , North and South , is full of misrepresentation and vituperation . Sections are arrayed against each other . Men fear to trust each other . The very air is full of anxiety and apprehension . Such , gentlemen , is the miserable condition of the country . The nation is in great peril . Its interests , its institutions , its property , are all in great and common peril . Paralysis has seized upon the whole country . In vain now shall we argue about causes . The effect is upon us . Business is stagnated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But we here must do something . Mr. LINCOLN is coming , and all along the route the people are doing him honor . But that triumphal march is insignificant compared with the anxiety felt throughout the country that this Convention should agree upon some plan that will save the Government and the Union . In one thing , under other circumstances , I would agree with the gentleman ( Mr. BOUTWELL ) from Massachusetts . Had the border States elected their members of Congress , I would wait . But the elections in the border States are yet to be held . And upon what idea ? Why , sir , upon the idea that their whole interests and their whole property are in danger . Aspiring and dangerous men will go before an excited people full of anxiety and uncertainty for the future , and by them be elected instead of the sound , wise , and conservative gentlemen usually selected to represent those States . Those elections would be a mad scene of aspersion and vituperation . I can not , I will not trust them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years gone by . I say , and I am proud to declare here , that I had no association with the dominant party in the old Empire State at the last election . I struck every other name from the ticket , except those who voted for Bell and Everett . Glorious names ! which received the triumphant endorsement of the mother of Presidents  --  the grand old commonwealth of Virginia . Sometimes I meet with men who tell me what is going to be done . They talk of retaking forts now held by seceded States by force , of restoring things to their former condition , as they would about sending a vessel for a cargo of oranges to Havana . But they forget that the next administration , like the philosopher who would move the world with a lever , has no holding spot  --  no place whereon to stand . It is one thing to hold a fort where you have it , but quite another thing to take it when held by the enemy . Who can magnify the importance of this Conference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held in this country . It holds the key of peace or war . The eyes of the whole people are turned hopefully upon it . By every consideration that should move a patriot , let us agree . Let us act for the salvation of our common country . I came here very unexpectedly to myself . Long withdrawn from political circles , living in comparative retirement , at peace with the world and myself , I would have preferred to remain there ; but when I heard of my appointment as a delegate to this Conference , I felt it my duty to come here and say these few things to you . And now let me close by again assuring you , that if all you ask of New York is the adoption of the propositions which I heard here yesterday as the propositions of a majority of your committee , New York will do you justice . She will answer " YES " by a most triumphant majority  --  a majority compared with which any heretofore given will seem insignificant ! I will occupy time no farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a time for action and not for words . Mr. RUFFIN :  --  There are few members of this Conference who attend its sessions with greater interest than myself . I presume that we have come together influenced by various considerations . There are some , I have no doubt , who do not desire the preservation of the Union  --  who do not care for the safety of the Government which our fathers founded . They may not avow their purposes , they may even conceal them under specious words , but their purpose will be disclosed when we see them arrayed against all projects of settlement  --  all measures to quiet the existing excitement . Others may think there is no necessity for any action at all , may think so honestly . But let me assure them they are mistaken  --  sadly mistaken . Now , I do not care what motives influence others . It is of no consequence to me what their designs or purposes may be , I have no concealment and no deception . I came here for a purpose which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere . I will labor to carry it into execution with all the strength and ability which my advanced years and enfeebled health have left me . I came to maintain and preserve this glorious Government ! I came here for Union and peace ! ( Applause . ) My health is such that if I could avoid it , I would not mingle in this discussion . I would not say one word , if I did not know perfectly well that life or death to my part of the country was involved in the action of this Conference . If gentlemen felt as deeply as I do , they would deprecate as I do the introduction of party or politics into this discussion , or the slightest reference to them . Of what importance is party , compared with the great questions involved here ? Parties or men may go up or down , and yet our country is safe . But such Conferences as this , in such emergencies as the present , must act , if our country is to be saved . Let us discard politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A gentlemen asked yesterday whether the Convention would have been called , if a Democrat had been elected President . Certainly not . But considerations of a party character would not have prevented it . The true necessity that called us here , is that a President has been elected by a large majority , and a new and strong party is coming into power , which our people believe entertain views and designs hostile to our institutions . Do not understand me as charging the fact upon the new Government . Perhaps I might say that I do not believe it myself . But that will not answer . Our people are agitated and excited , and we have come here to tell you all , with sorrow in our hearts , that if you will not do something to restore a confidence that is shaken , we are ruined , and we must see this noble Government go down . We ask you for new constitutional guarantees ; and what are the propositions we make ? Is there any thing in them which you can not grant ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yield ? You reply to us , that you will consent to call a convention to discuss and adjust matters . That will not do . We must act on the existing state of facts . Seven States are already in rebellion  --  in revolution ! I do n't care which you call it ; either word is bad enough . Tennessee and North Carolina already form fourteen hundred miles of what is virtually a frontier . We are now the border States ; we are to be the theatre of war , if it comes . The slave property we speak of will be in still greater peril than it is now . Now think of these things , and tell us whether we can wait for all this complicated machinery of a convention to be put into operation . At the very shortest , it will take three or four years to accomplish any thing . But my friend from Massachusetts says he does not wish to do any thing at all ; that the North is under duress , and her people would despise themselves if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not true in any sense . We respect the people of the North too much to attempt to drive them , or to secure what we need by threats or intimidation . We want the aid of the people of Massachusetts , and we will appeal to their sense of right and justice . I believe that these propositions , if adopted , will not only satisfy and quiet the loyal States of the South , but that they will bring back the seven States which have gone out . I must be frank and outspoken here . We can not answer for these States . We can not say whether they will be satisfied . But we can even stand their absence . We can get on without them , if you will give us what will quiet our people , and what at the same time will not injure you . Gentlemen , we of North Carolina are not hostile to you ; we are your friends  --  brothers in a common cause  --  citizens of a common country . We are loyal to our country and to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will aid us now . As for me , I am an old man . My heart is very full when I look upon the present unhappy and distracted condition of our affairs . I was born before the present Constitution was adopted . May God grant that I do not outlive it . I can not address you on this subject without manifesting a feeling which fills my heart . Let me assure you , in terms as strong as I can make them , that we can not stand as we are ; that unless you will do something for us , our people will be drawn into that mad career of open defiance , which is now opening so widely against the Government . All I ask of you is to let these propositions go to the people  --  to submit them at once to their conventions , and not wait the action of the Legislatures of all the States . We want the popular voice  --  the decision of the people , and the whole people ; and if it is to avail us at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOYES :  --  I did not design to trespass upon the time of the Conference at this stage of the debate . But statements have been made upon this floor to-day which I can not permit for a single hour to remain unanswered . I should be recreant to my conscience , and especially to my State , if I did not answer them here and now . I came here for peace , prepared to do that justice to every section of the Union which would secure peace  --  prepared to go to the farthest limit which propriety and principle , and my obligations to the Constitution , would permit me , to satisfy our southern friends . I did not wish to commit myself to any thing , until I had patiently seen and heard all that was to be said and proposed . Even now I regret that this incidental discussion upon a subject entirely collateral has arisen . How thoroughly it shows the idleness and folly of attempting to limit , or trammel , or hamper discussion upon the general questions which are presented for our action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York of a time gone by ! Not New York of an old fossiliferous era , remembered only in some chapter of her ancient history , but young , breathing , living New York , as she exists to-day . Full of enterprise , patriotism , energy  --  her living self , with her four millions of people , among whom there is scarcely to be found a heart not beating with loyalty to the Constitution and the Government . In behalf of that New York , the one and only one alive now , I propose to reply to some of the statements made here by one of her representatives . In the name of the popular voice of that State , recently uttered in tones that I supposed any one could understand , I tell you , gentlemen of this Convention , beware of false prophets . This day , the Scripture is fulfilled among you . Pointing to Mr. GRANGER . " A prophet is not without honor save in his own country , and in his own house ! " New York must stand upon this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peer of every other State . Her representatives must have the same rights as any other  --  and they must be treated like any other . If , in her judgment , New York ought not to give her assent to these propositions , that assent shall not be given ; it can never be secured by threats or intimidations . She must have the same rights as any other State , certainly the same rights as New Jersey . Mr. STOCKTON :  --  I am sure the gentleman is mistaken ; I said nothing intended as a threat or an intimidation . Mr. NOYES :  --  Well , let me say it once for all , New York will yield nothing to intimidation . Now , what is the question which has led to this most extraordinary discussion ? It is simply whether debate shall be hampered , or practically cut off , by short limitations as to time , after one section has had an opportunity of expressing its views . Virginia has called this Conference together . We thought she had no right to do so , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we waived all considerations of that kind , and upon her invitation we came here . She asks us to consider new and important amendments to the Constitution , alterations of our fundamental law ; and in the same breath we are told that we must not discuss them  --  that we must take them as they are offered to us , without change or alteration . We take time to make treaties . We do not even enter into private contracts without taking time for consideration and reflection . We have been here a little more than a week . The greater part of that time has been occupied by the committee in preparing these propositions . The discussion has scarcely commenced . I submit to the Conference , is it kind , is it generous , is it proper to stop here ? Is it best to do so ? Mr. WICKLIFFE :  --  The gentleman seems to think my resolution was aimed at the delegation from New York . That is not true in any sense . I did not wish to cut off debate at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have debate enough to satisfy everybody . Mr. NOYES :  --  I believe I perfectly understand your proposition . Mr. CHASE :  --  I have agreed to support the resolution , and must adhere to my agreement . Mr. NOYES :  --  Personally I might be in favor of the adoption of the half-hour rule , for I think I could say all I desire to say in relation to these propositions within that time . I have certainly no desire that this discussion should be unreasonably protracted . But such limitations are always embarrassing . Other gentlemen do not wish to have them imposed . Mr. FIELD objects to them ; and if gentlemen really think they need more time , I think it ungenerous not to yield to their wishes . And I insist that such a course is least calculated to promote conciliation . The more free and full you make this discussion , the more will your results find favor elsewhere . It has been my belief from the beginning , that by careful comparison of our views , by a discussion of all our points of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an agreement . I had hoped that such sentiments would have universally prevailed , and that no desire would be shown to force the action of any delegation . I am willing to say for myself that if the thirty minute rule be adopted I will give way at once . But I must proceed to notice some statements which have been urged here as reasons why we must adopt  --  Mr. FIELD :  --  Will my colleague yield to me for one moment ? I have a communication to make which I think will make every lover of his country in this Conference rejoice . It is news from a slaveholding State . It shows that her heart beats true to the Union . Missouri has just elected delegates to a convention to consider the questions now agitating the Country . I hold in my hands a telegram , stating that a very large proportion of the delegates elected are true Union men . The PRESIDENT :  --  I will assume it to be the pleasure of the Conference that the telegram be read . Mr. FIELD then read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri had been elected by heavy majorities . The announcement was received with much applause . Mr. NOYES :  --  This news is indeed cheering . It is an additional evidence of the depth to which love for our country has struck into the hearts of its people  --  another inducement to make us agree  --  another reason why we should not be led off upon false issues . The Constitution has provided the only proper way in which amendments may be made to it . If these methods are followed , amendments will be thoroughly discussed and considered , and they will not be adopted unless the interests of the nation shall be found to require their adoption . The State of Virginia seeks to precipitate action ; to secure these vital changes in our fundamental law in a manner unknown to it , and in a manner which , in my judgment , it is not advisable to adopt . I make no complaint of Virginia . It is the right and privilege of any State to make such a request , but it is none the less unconstitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that her people are so impatient that they will not give the country time to consider these important changes in its form of Government ? Why should there be such indecent haste ? Why not wait a week  --  month , and even six months , if that time is necessary ? Be assured , gentlemen , that no substantial alteration of the fundamental law of this Government will ever be made until it has been discussed and considered by the Press and the people in all its details . The thing is impossible ! I have a few words to say for New York , as I said in the commencement  --  for the New York of the present day . Where , I ask , is the gentleman 's ( Mr. GRANGER ) warrant of attorney to speak for the people of that State ? Where is the evidence upon which he founds the assertion which he makes on this floor that New York will adopt the propositions to which he refers ? Let me assure you , gentlemen , that the political principles of the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They gave a heavy republican majority at the last Presidential election , not because they were carried away upon collateral issues , but because the principles of the Chicago Platform met their approval  --  because they thought the time had come when the destinies of this nation should no longer be left in the hands of men who would use them only to promote the interests of one section of the Union . Do not mistake , sir , the effect of that great demonstration ! The people of New York were in earnest ; they went into the election with a strong , determined purpose , and it is too late now to misconstrue or misunderstand that purpose . They were not influenced by collateral issues . Their action was upon the great principles involved . They believed that the platform of the Republican party embodied the true principles upon which the Government should be conducted , and they said so . You will find that their minds are to-day unchanged . But the gentleman says , the result of recent elections shows that a change in their minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their part for conciliation and peace . Sir , I deny that such a change has taken place . There may have been slight changes in a few cities where the whole power and strength of the Democratic party has been put forth . But the country , upon the great issues before it , is unchanged . The county of St. Lawrence has just elected every Republican candidate for supervisor . In other counties , nearly the same unanimity prevails . The great heart of the country is still loyal and Republican . And , sir , these threats of dissolution will all react against you . They operated in the Presidential election only in one way . I have no doubt that these threats gave Mr. LINCOLN five thousand votes in New York City alone . The people are sick of them . They know that if they once yielded to them , they would be forced to do so again . They do not like these insinuations against the Government involved in the propositions made here . If you wish them to be considered favorably by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free from all suspicion of duress or intimidation ; you must permit them to be examined , discussed , and dissected here , by the representatives of New York and of every other State . I am opposed decidedly to cutting off or limiting these discussions . Let all parties be heard ; give them time , and time enough , to deliberate , and the result will be peace and harmony to the country . Mr. RIVES :  --  I rise for the purpose of answering some of the observations of the gentleman from New York ; and first of all I wish to say a word about the motives and purposes of Virginia in calling this Convention . She has called this Convention together because she believed it would exert a powerful influence for the safety and honor of the country , and the perpetuity of its institutions . She is met in limine with the reproach that her action is unconstitutional . How unconstitutional ? Is not our Government based upon the sovereignty of the people ? Is not that the idea upon which this Government rests ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told that their action is unconstitutional or improper ? Can not Virginia and her people , acting through their representatives , suggest the means of amendment or improvement in our Constitution to Congress ?  --  the Congress which represents the people , and whose members are servants only of the people ? Can she not call together a convention of this kind and suggest measures to be considered by it for the purpose of saving an imperilled country ? Virginia knew well that this was to be an advisory Conference merely . She invited commissioners from all the States to come here and present their views , to compare and discuss them , to devise measures for the benefit of the country , in the same way that any assemblage of the people may lawfully do . Has the gentleman looked into the history of our present Constitution ? Virginia did the same thing previous to the adoption of that Constitution , which she is doing now . Some State must invite a Conference , if one is to be had . If it was proper that Virginia should do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eminently proper that she should do it now . There are occasions , sir , in the history of nations , when men should rise far above the rules of special pleading . This is one of them . Let the gentleman look into the history of the old articles of Confederation ; let him read the debates which arose upon their adoption . Virginia originated measures then , far more important than any before us now ; and there were gentlemen then , who took the same ground that gentlemen do now , who sought by the use of dilatory pleas , by interposing objections , temporary in their nature , to prevent and delay action upon the great national questions then under consideration . Now , in a time of great peril , when the whole country is convulsed , when the existence and perpetuity of the Government is in danger , Virginia has invoked her sister States to come here and see whether they can not devise some method to avoid the danger and save the country . In the preamble to the first ten articles of Confederation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action of the State Legislatures in initiating proposals of amendment . Every amendment that has hitherto been made to our Constitution originated with the people , and directly or indirectly through the action of State Legislatures . What purpose can gentlemen have in interposing these dilatory pleas , objections merely for delay , when we all know that Congress is now waiting for  --  actually inviting the action of this Conference ? Senator COLLAMER , in his speech already referred to , makes the distinct proposition , that when any considerable portion of the people ( certainly a much smaller portion than is here represented ) desire to have amendments submitted , it is the duty of Congress to propose them , and to do so without committing that body either for or against them . Governor CORWIN , also of the Congressional Committee of Thirty-three , having this subject in charge , is understood to have stated that the committee desire to consider the propositions which may here be adopted . Now , as I said , these dilatory objections were interposed previous to the adoption of our present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Virginia then asked for a General Convention to consider amendments to the Constitution ? Mr. RIVES :  --  No ! The Annapolis Convention met . The invitation under which that body was convened was addressed to all the States . Five only responded , and they proposed a General Convention of all the States , to meet at Philadelphia . Virginia was the first to act and to appoint her delegates . I repeat , that the same objection was then urged , that Congress or the States should propose the amendments . The first Convention was just as unconstitutional as this . The two cases were perfectly alike . The crisis is infinitely more important now than it was then . Then , there was no disintegration of the States . They still held firmly together . How are we now ? Seven States are out of the Union . The Union is dissolved ! Virginia loves the Union . She cherishes all its glorious memories . She is proud of its history and of her own connection with it . But Virginia has no apprehension as to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it . She can stand in her own strength and power if necessary . Her delegates come here in no spirit of supplication , nor do they propose to offer any intimidation . She has called you here as brothers , as friends , as patriots . If the future has suffering in store for Virginia , be assured all her sister States must suffer equally . Mr. PRESIDENT , the position of Virginia must be understood and appreciated . She is just now the neutral ground between two embattled legions , between two angry , excited , and hostile portions of the Union . To expect that her people are not to participate in the excitement by which they are surrounded ; to expect that they should not share in the apprehensions which pervade the country ; to expect that they should not begin to look after the safety of their interests and their institutions , were to expect something superhuman . Something must be done to save the country , to allay these apprehensions , to restore a broken confidence . Virginia steps in to arrest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She steps in to save the country . I am here in part to represent her . I utter no menace ; intimidation would be unworthy of Virginia , but if I perform my duty I must speak freely . The danger is imminent , very imminent . Our national affairs can not longer remain in their present condition ; it is impossible , absolutely impossible that they should . My Republican friends , will you not take warning ? Were there not pretended prophets of old , who cried , " Peace ! Peace ! when there was no peace " ? Political prophets to-day say there is no danger . Have their counsels been wise heretofore ? Can you not see that there is danger , and imminent danger in them , now ? Look , sir , at our position ! I mean the position of the loyal South . By the secession of these States we are reduced to an utterly helpless minority ; a minority of seven or eight States to stand in your national councils against an united North ! It is not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of a dominant and opposition party . Were the case reversed , you would not do it yourselves . We can not hold our rights by mere sufferance , and we will not ; we do not ask you to hold yours in that way . If the other States had kept on with us  --  had remained in the Union  --  we might have secured our rights in a fair contest . Now other paths are open to us , and one of these we must follow . I desire to say a word in answer to the propositions of my honorable friend from Connecticut . What did he tell us ? He said that this was a self-sustaining Government ; a Government that possessed the power of securing its own perpetuity , and one that must not yield or make concessions . Sir , let me say that ideas , that principles , that statements of that kind have led to the downfall of every Government on earth which has ever fallen . What but ideas and language of this kind , forced our colonies into rebellion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have had some experience in revolutions in another hemisphere  --  in revolutions produced by the same causes that are now operating among us . What causes but these led to the two revolutions in France ? One of them I saw myself , where interest was arrayed against interest , friend against friend , brother against brother . I have seen the pavements of Paris covered , and her gutters running with fraternal blood ! God forbid that I should see this horrid picture repeated in my own country ; and yet it will be , sir , if we listen to the counsels urged here ! It is too late to theorize , too late to differ theoretically . I do not believe in the constitutional right of secession . I proclaimed that , thirty years ago in Congress . I have always adhered to my opinions since . But we are not now discussing theories ; we are in the presence of a great fact . The South is in danger ; her institutions are in danger . If other excuses were necessary , she might justify her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-defence alone . I condemn the secession of States . I am not here to justify it . I detest it . But the great fact is still before us . Seven States have gone out from among us , and a President is actually inaugurated to govern the new Confederation . With this fact the nation must deal . Right or wrong , it exists . The country is divided . Wide dissensions exist . A people have separated from another people . Force will never bring them together . Coercion is not a word to be used in this connection . There must be negotiation . Virginia presents herself as a mediator to bring back those who have left us . The border States are not in revolt ; and by border States I mean States on both sides of the border . They are here , and they came here to unite with you in measures that will reunite the country , and save it from irredeemable ruin . There was one observation of the gentleman from Massachusetts that surprised me . He complained of Virginia for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not so . Mr. BOUTWELL :  --  I said that Massachusetts thought her action had that appearance . Mr. RIVES :  --  Let me say to you , Republican gentlemen , we wish to make your victory worthy of you . We wish to inaugurate your power and your administration over the whole Union . We wish to give you a nation worth governing . Do us at least the justice of supposing we are in earnest in this . We are laboring to relieve you from the difficulties that hang over you . War is impending . Do you wish to govern a country convulsed by civil war ? The country is divided . Do you wish to govern a fraction of the country ? Behold the difficulties that you must encounter . You can not carry on your Government without money . Where is the capitalist who will advance you money under existing circumstances ? Gentlemen , believe me , as one who has given no small amount of time and careful reflection to this subject , when I tell you that you can not coerce sovereign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foresight made him assert that our strength lay in the Government of the States  --  of the undivided States . Look at New York . She herself is a match for the whole army of the United States . Look at the South . She stands now almost upon an equality with you . You may spend millions of treasure , you may shed oceans of blood , but you can not conquer any five or seven States of this Union . The proposition is an utter absurdity . You must find some other way to deal with them . In the wisdom of the country some other way must be found . Several gentlemen have referred to our army and our navy . As a citizen of the United States , I am proud of both . I am proud of the country they serve . I have enjoyed at times her honors , at others endured her chastisements . I respect the power which our army and our navy give to our nation , but our army and navy are impotent in such a crisis as this . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre by rebellions in her North with which she has been forced to contend . In Paris , too , I have myself seen regiment after regiment throw down their arms and rush into the arms of the people , of their fellow-citizens , and thus oppose , by military strength , the government under which their organization was formed . Will you repeat such occurrences here ? Will you ' destroy the imperishable renown of this nation ' ? No ! I answer for you all  --  you will not . Now , we , representatives of the South and of Virginia , ask of this Convention , the only body under heaven that can do it , to interpose and save us from a repetition of the scenes of blood which some of us have witnessed . Our patriotic committee have labored for two weeks  --  have labored earnestly and zealously . Their report , though not satisfactory to Virginia in all respects , will yet receive her sanction , and the sanction of the border States . The representatives of Virginia know they are yielding much , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will do it because they will give peace to the country . Now , sir , when we are just in sight of land , when we are just entering a safe harbor , shall we turn about and circumnavigate the ocean to find an unknown shore ? No , sir ! no ! Let us enter the harbor of safety now opened before us . Mr. PRESIDENT , I know Massachusetts well . She is a powerful Commonwealth . She has added largely to the wealth , the power , and glory of this Union . I respect the gentleman who has addressed this Convention in her behalf ; but when he went out of his way and stated that he abhorred slavery , the statement grated harshly on my ears . We of the South , we of Virginia , may not and do not like many of the institutions of Massachusetts , but we can not and we will not say that we abhor them . Let me recall to the gentleman from Massachusetts who has addressed us , a fact from history . Let me show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in extending the time for the importation of slaves ! Let me tell him that his State has helped to fasten the institution of slavery upon a portion of this nation . Is it for a son of Massachusetts now to complain of the result of the acts of his own State ? Is it for him to use these reproaches , which , if not ungrateful , are at least wanting in charity ? It was a representative of Massachusetts , Mr. GORHAM , through whose motion and influence the time for the importation of slaves was extended in that period of our colonial history . Virginia ever , in every period of her colonial existence , exerted herself to close her ports against the importation of slaves . It was the veto of her Royal Master alone that rendered her efforts nugatory . It was New England that fastened this institution upon us . Shall she reproach us for its existence now ? Mr. BALDWIN :  --  At the time of the adoption of our present Constitution , it was well understood that Georgia and South Carolina would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , should slavery have an existence inside the Union or out of it . Mr. RIVES :  --  No , sir ! The gentleman is mistaken . In the Constitution , as first proposed to the Convention , an unlimited right was given to import slaves . Mr. ELLSWORTH declared that it would be an infraction of State rights to prohibit this importation . New England , engaged in commerce , found an advantage in the right of importation , and she endeavored to force it upon the South . I regard the present course of New England as very unfair . She is herself responsible for the existence of slavery  --  she is now our fiercest opponent ; and yet New Jersey and Pennsylvania , who have not this responsibility , have always stood by the South , and I believe they always will . It is not by abhorring slavery that you can put an end to the institution . You must let it alone . We are responsible for it now , and we are willing to stand responsible for it before the world . We understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attention of the wisest men of our time . In fact , it is not a question of slavery at all . It is a question of race . We know that the very best position for the African race to occupy is one of unmitigated legal subjection . We have the negroes with us ; you have not . We must deal with them as our experience and wisdom dictate ; with that you have nothing to do . The gentleman from Massachusetts may congratulate himself that there are no negroes in that Commonwealth . I ask him what he would do , if he had the race to deal with in Massachusetts as we have it in Virginia ? I said , twenty years ago , in the Senate of the United States , and my whole experience since having confirmed the truth of the statement I repeat it now , that candid minds can not differ upon this proposition , that the present position of the negroes of the United States is the best one they could occupy , both for the superior and inferior race . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say : Your ancestors were most powerful and influential in fastening slavery upon us . You are the very last who ought to reproach us for its existence now . We do not indulge reproaches toward you . It is unpleasant for us to receive them from you . Their use by either can only serve to widen the unhappy differences existing between us . Let us all drop them , and , so far as we can , let us close up every avenue through which dissensions may come . We call upon you to make no sacrifices for us . It will cost you nothing to yield what we ask . Say , and let it be said in the Constitution , that you will not interfere with slavery in the District , or in the States , or in the Territories . Permit the free transit of our slaves from one State to another , and in the language of the patriarch , " let there be peace between you and me . " Let us all agree that there shall be landmarks between us ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they shall never be removed . I think upon this point I can cite an authority that will command universal respect . I discovered it in my researches into the history of the very Constitution we are now considering . Mr. RIVES here read an extract from a letter written by Mr. MADISON after his retirement from public life . I have not a copy of this letter , but the substance of the portion read by Mr. RIVES was a statement by Mr. MADISON , that upon the passage of the Missouri Compromise , President MONROE was much embarrassed with the question of the constitutionality of the prohibition clause ; that he took counsel with Mr. MARTIN , who declared that , in his judgment , Congress had no power over the subject of slavery in the territories . Mr. JAMES :  --  Will you leave that question just where the Constitution leaves it , upon your construction of that instrument ? If so , we will agree to give you all necessary guarantees against interference . Mr. RIVES :  --  No ! I will not leave it there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I prefer to put the prohibition into the Constitution . The gentleman from Massachusetts speaks for the North . Massachusetts does not constitute the North . I venerate the Commonwealth of Massachusetts . I have many friends there . I look with pride upon her connection with the Revolution ; upon her public men , her manufactures , her public institutions . Her people who have accomplished so much , will not turn a deaf ear to our wants now . We wish to go to her people and obtain their judgment upon our propositions . But Massachusetts is not all the North . Rhode Island constitutes a part of it . She has always spoken for us . She will speak for us to-day . What does New Jersey say ? What does the great State of Pennsylvania and the greater Northwest say ? Surely they do not echo the sentiments of the gentleman from Massachusetts . They are with us , and we will trust to them . I dislike this way of answering for sections of the country . I have heard similar language from Mr. CALHOUN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  The South thinks  --  The South will do , " this or that . I did not like it then . It stirred up all the rebellious sentiments of my nature ; for I knew the statement was not true . I do not like such language better now . Let the people of Massachusetts speak . I know they will not refuse to fulfil the compact of their fathers . We are brothers . I feel we can settle this important question which portends over us like an eclipse ; we can leave this glorious country to our posterity . Once more let me refer to the noble and eloquent counsels of MADISON , and I am done . As children of the same family , as fellow-citizens of a great , glorious , and proud Republic , he invoked the kindred blood of our people to consecrate our common Union , and to banish forever the thought of our becoming aliens . Mr. EWING :  --  I have never in any manner countenanced the discussions of slavery and the questions connected with it , at the North . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those discussions . No good can possibly come from them . Is the North the censor morum of the South ? We have faults enough ourselves ; let us consider and try to correct them , before we interest ourselves so much in those of our neighbors . If there was any danger that slavery would be extended at the North , I would oppose its extension there , and I would teach my sons to oppose it . But this danger has never existed . Does any one fear that slavery will go into New York or Massachusetts ? No sane man thinks or ever thought so . But it exists , and we must deal with it as it is . As one northern man , I do not want the negroes distributed throughout the North . We have got enough of them now . I have watched the operation of this emigration of slaves to the North . Ten negroes will commit more petty thefts than one thousand white men . We can not permit them to come into Ohio . Wherever they have been permitted to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we begin to preach abolition I think we had better see what is to be done with the negroes . Thirty years ago the subject of abolishing slavery was agitated in Virginia . Some of the most eloquent speeches were made in favor of the abolition movement that I ever read . The act providing for gradual abolition , was , I believe , lost by a single vote . I thought then that the result was an unfortunate one . But there is something to be said on both sides of the question . Had the act passed , the negroes would have been sent South , and we should have had plantation slavery , instead of the humane form which now exists in Virginia . But Virginia would have had one great , one powerful advantage . Her power would have increased tenfold . Free labor would have come in to take the place of slave labor , and the banks of the Potomac and the James would have blossomed as the rose . The North has taken the business of abolition into its own hands , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abolition in Virginia . This was but the natural effect of the cause . Now , we can never coerce the Southern States into abolitionism . It is not the way to convert them to our views by saying that we abhor their institutions . But these northern men will not listen to reason . They keep on making eloquent speeches  --  their pulpits thunder against the sin of slaveholding . All grades of speech and thought are made use of , and the sickening sentimentalism of some of them is disgusting . They repeat poetry . They say : " I would not have a slave to till my ground , To watch me when I wake  --  to fan me when I sleep ; " and much more of the same stuff ! In this way false ideas are inculcated throughout the North . The whole scheme is full of falsehood . It would be far better for each man to look for the beam in his own eyes before he troubles himself about the mote in his neighbor 's . England , also , has been very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have no slavery or misery to be compared with that existing in the India provinces . It is said that in a single season two hundred thousand of her subjects were starved to death in one province of Hindostan . I might say the same thing almost of Ireland . Two millions have died there from famine , and God knows how many more would have perished but for the relief sent from this country . I say , and I have abundant reason for saying , that I never have , and I never will , favor any of these denunciations of southern slaveholders and slavery . Let us rather look at this subject as members of a common family  --  let us acknowledge our mutual faults . The slave trade was once fostered by the North . That was when it was profitable , and when large fortunes were made in that trade by northern men . When it became unprofitable the North began to denounce it , and to call it sinful . Now , we fastened this institution upon the South , can not we permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not say that there is a necessary conflict between the white and the black races , but I assert that they can not unite  --  that they can not occupy the same country upon an equality . Our free laborers of the North will not work with slaves or with blacks . I have had experience in this matter , and I know I am right . The only way we can do , is to divide the common territory  --  divide it fairly , honestly . Suppose there were two sons who succeeded to a joint inheritance of lands . One says to the other , " Your family is not so moral as mine , therefore your sons shall have none of the lands . " Would this be right or honest ? Would any one attempt to justify it ? And yet this is what extreme men of the North are practically saying to the citizens of the South . The Missouri Compromise was intended to settle the rights of the respective sections in the territories . The line adopted was not unfair to the North . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopting it and arranging this difficult subject finally . But one and another says , " Do n't let us extend slavery . " To that I answer , that our action will not make one slave more or less . There is no question of humanity involved in our propositions . I can not see what question is involved so far as the North is concerned . We need no more territory . We do not want New Mexico . We have territory enough now for one hundred and fifty millions of people , and enough for the expansion of our people for one hundred and fifty years . If gentlemen are found here who wish to make trouble , who can not see the peril we are in , and how easily we can avoid the danger which threatens us , I shall be much pained , but not half so much as I shall be , to see this Union broken up and the Government destroyed . I was surprised to hear the assertion of the gentleman from Connecticut , that this was an unconstitutional assembly . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly . If these assertions were true I would not be a member of it for one moment . If revolutionary , it is either treasonable or seditious . But it is neither . These gentlemen forget the constitutional right of petition . We have the right to meet here . We have the right to do just what we are proposing to do , and the right is to be found in the Constitution . I am surprised , too , at the assertion , that there is a wish here to limit or cut off debate  --  that this resolution would cut off New York . Would it not cut off Ohio ? I have no intention of depriving any gentleman or any State of any right . I do not believe such an intention exists in the Conference . Mr. MORRILL :  --  In my judgment many subjects have been considered here , and many things said to the North especially , that are superfluous , and much more that is useless . I have listened to the gentleman from Ohio and to some gentlemen who have preceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not choose to characterize , to the action and the opinions of the North . The gentleman from Ohio refers in strong terms to what he calls the sentimentalism of the North . He has recited poetry which he says is popular there . Now , once for all , let me ask those gentlemen who are proposing various methods of settling our differences : Do you propose to make war upon the sentiments , the principles of the North ? If you do , we may as well drop the discussion here . Our people , and we , their representatives , can not meet you upon that ground . Our principles can not be interfered with ; we carry them with us always . Our consciences approve them . We can negotiate with you , and treat with you upon subjects which do not involve their sacrifice . If it is your purpose to attack them , you may abandon all other purposes so far as this body is concerned . The people of the North will never sacrifice their principles . It is useless for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless for you to urge war upon the sentiments or opinions of the North . Again ; let me tell you there is no disloyalty in the free States . The word dissolution has not been thought of there during the last half century . In all your discussions , in all your action , remember that we are loyal to the Constitution and the Union . Strong appeals are made here to the free States . You call them by the general name of the Northern States . Gentlemen undertake to pledge different sections to this or that policy . We are told that New York  --  that Massachusetts  --  that Pennsylvania will adopt or will not adopt various propositions that are made here . Sir , in my judgment all such questions are unworthy of our consideration . We spend time to little purpose upon them . The true question here is , " What will Virginia do ? How does Virginia stand ? " She to-day holds the keys of peace or war . She stands in the gateway threatening the progress of the Government in its attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may  --  cover it as you will  --  the true question is , " What will Virginia do ? " She undertakes to dictate the terms upon which the Union is to be preserved . What will satisfy her ? Mr. CLAY :  --  Has not Virginia spoken ? Has she not already told us what she wants ? Mr. MORRILL :  --  I am coming to that point very soon . I assert again that Virginia must not be misunderstood in this matter . The peril of the time is Secession . Six States are already in revolution . A distinct confederacy , a new government , has been organized within the limits of the United States . Does Virginia to-day , frown upon this atrocious proceeding ? No ! so far from that she affirms that these States have a right to do what they have done . She boasts that she has armed her people , that she has raised five millions of money , and that she will use both to prevent the interference of the National Government with these States , now in revolution . Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such circumstances the free States will negotiate with Virginia or others in her position , I leave for others to consider . It is my opinion that the people of this country will first of all demand the recognition of the supremacy of the Government . Mr. RUFFIN :  --  No ! I do not understand such to be the position of Virginia . She appeals to both sides to refrain from violence while these negotiations are pending . Mr. SEDDON :  --  No ! A little farther than that . Virginia will not permit coercion . She has plainly declared she will not . But in the very highest spirit of patriotism , she has asked for this Convention , and she proposes to exhaust the very last means of restoring peace to the Union . This is exactly her position . She hopes , and I hope , that this Convention will interpose to preserve the peace and to save this country from war . Mr. MORRILL :  --  I thought I did not misunderstand the position of Virginia . She is armed to the teeth , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . I understand her attitude . It is an attitude of menace . It gives aid and comfort to those who trample upon the laws and defy the authority of this Government . No action of the Conference can be consummated for months : I might almost say for years . Any propositions we may make must go to the people . They must and will take time for consideration . Endeavor to force their action and you will secure the rejection of the terms proposed . While the people are acting you will have a Government and it must operate . It must operate not upon a section only , but upon the whole country . During this time , does Virginia propose to maintain the position she has assumed ? To prevent by force of arms the execution of the laws of the Union in the seceded States ? Yes , and we are told that her position is one exhibiting the highest patriotism . In my judgment her position is one of menace , and not of pacification . If I rightly understand her , nothing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if adopted . And now I wish to ask the gentleman from Virginia ( Mr. SEDDON ) a plain question , and I wish to receive a frank answer . If this Conference agrees to the amendments proposed by the majority of the committee , will Virginia sustain the Government and maintain its integrity , while the people are considering and acting on the new proposals of amendment to the Constitution ? If she will not do this , if this proposition does not meet the heart of Virginia , there is no use  --  Mr. SEDDON :  --  I can let Virginia speak for herself . She has spoken for herself in most emphatic language . She has told you what will satisfy her in the resolutions under which this body is convened . I have no right whatever to suppose that she will accept less . She is solemnly pledged to resist coercion . She will resist it to the very last extremity . She arrived at that conclusion after grave deliberation , and it was attended with every manifestation of concurrence on the part of the people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time , or that there has been any change since , or that there is any hesitation in her purpose now . Now , if the gentleman wants my private opinion , I will tell him that whether the propositions of the majority of the committee or her own be adopted here , or by the people , the purpose of Virginia to resist coercion is unchanged and unchangeable . Mr. HITCHCOCK :  --  I rise to a point of order . It appears to me that this discussion is very foreign to the subject before the Conference . It is so long since that subject has been named , that many have doubtless forgotten it . The question is upon the adoption of the resolution limiting the debate . I think we had better keep to the question . The PRESIDENT :  --  The gentleman is undoubtedly correct in his statement of the question , but the discussion of the general subject has been permitted to go on without objection by the Convention , and I do not think it would be right to stop it now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unchanged . She considers this a Government of love and not of force . She thinks there should be no force or coercion used toward any sovereign State acting in its collective capacity . She does not propose to permit such coercion to be used . And now , having answered the gentleman frankly , as he desired , I wish to ask him a question , and I wish also an explicit and frank answer . My question is this : Is it the purpose or is it the policy of the incoming administration to attempt to execute the laws of the United States in the seceded States by an armed force ? The answer to this question involves information of the utmost importance to my State and others whose interests are involved with hers . It should be at once communicated , and especially to my part of the country . I now ask the gentleman , if he knows what the purpose of the incoming administration is in this respect , to state it here , and now . His relations to some of the officers elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full and frank answer to my question . Mr. MORRILL :  --  There is a point in the gentleman 's answer which may as well be met , but I will not be diverted from the question I was discussing . I will show him in a moment why I can not answer his inquiry from any personal knowledge of my own . Sir , I was endeavoring to ascertain what was the present position of Virginia ; to find out what she would accept and be contented . I wanted her to speak emphatically . She has done so . I now understand from Mr. SEDDON , that he has no assurances to give that Virginia will accept the propositions of the committee , and that while any propositions are pending she will resist the enforcement of the laws in the seceded States . Then let it be understood that Virginia has spoken . That she makes the Crittenden resolutions her ultimatum , that she must have them and all of them , that nothing less will satisfy her . As I said at the beginning of my remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless for us to discuss the various propositions which are made here , unless we expect to satisfy Virginia . It is important for us to understand her position . I do not under-estimate her influence . When the propositions of this Conference are presented to the people of the free States , the first question they will ask is , " Will Virginia adopt them ? Will she be satisfied with them ? " If she will not , there will be no action upon them . If she will , her position will exercise a powerful influence upon the people of the North in favor of their adoption . But if Virginia puts her ancient Commonwealth across the path of the Government , if she stands between the administration and the enforcement of the laws , the execution of its official duty , its positive obligations  --  if this is the manner in which she proposes to mediate , her mediation will be accepted nowhere . Such I understand to be the position she assumes . It is a position of menace . Mr. STOCKTON :  --  If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are ready for him . He shall have enough of it right here ! I should like to know why he makes such charges against Virginia ? They are unfounded ; we do n't wish to hear them . ( There was at this point considerable confusion in the Conference , which was promptly suppressed by the PRESIDENT . ) Mr. MORRILL :  --  Gentlemen need not be disturbed or excited . I have accomplished my object . I know now what to expect from Virginia ; the North will know what the course of Virginia is to be , and we can all act understandingly . I do not propose to waste valuable time in idle discussions in this hall , when we can come to the true point at once . I do not propose to talk around this question , nor to deceive or mislead the Conference . Other gentlemen may think differently , but I now understand Virginia to say , that the Federal authority shall not be reestablished by the ordinary means , ( where it is resisted ) in certain of the States comprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of the gentleman from Virginia , in relation to the proposed policy of the incoming administration . I have no personal knowledge upon this subject . Mr. LINCOLN I never saw in my life . I know nothing of his opinions , except from his speeches ; but I will say , that if he and his administration do not use every means which the Constitution has given them to assert the authority of the Government in all the States  --  to preserve the Union , and the Union in all its integrity , the people will be disappointed . I have felt and now feel the importance of the action of Virginia , and I have done what I could to learn here what we may expect from her . In conclusion , let me say , that unless we can have the earnest concurrence of the slave States in whatever we do , and especially unless we have the heart of Virginia with us , our action will give no peace to the country . Mr. ZOLLICOFFER moved that the Conference adjourn . The motion was lost by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we have debated these matters long enough . Let us come back to the question before us . Personally I am in favor of limiting debate to the shortest time , for I feel the necessity for prompt action . I think if Mr. RANDOLPH would strike out the latter clause of his resolution , requiring the final vote to be taken on Thursday next , we should have no difficulty in agreeing to it . Its adoption in its present form might cut off some delegation or some gentlemen from speaking at all . I would not do this . Let every one speak , but let the speeches be short . I move to strike out the last clause of the resolution . Mr. WICKLIFFE :  --  I did not expect to raise such a storm by introducing this resolution . I now ask to withdraw it and stop the debate . Mr. MOREHEAD , of North Carolina :  --  The gentleman can not do that , as several motions are involved . I object to his proposal to withdraw the resolution . I move to lay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the special order for ten o'clock to-morrow . The motion of Mr. MOREHEAD was carried . Mr. SUMMERS :  --  I move that when the present session of the Conference adjourn , its next meeting be at seven o'clock this evening . A MEMBER :  --  Say eight o'clock . Mr. SUMMERS :  --  Well , then , let it be eight o'clock . But let me ask you , gentlemen , not to protract or unnecessarily delay our action here . Mr. PRESIDENT , my heart is full ! I can not approach the great issues with which we are dealing with becoming coolness and deliberation ! Sir , I love this Union . The man does not live who entertains a higher respect for this Government than I do . I know its history  --  I know how it was established . There is not an incident in its history that is not precious to me . I do not wish to survive its dissolution . My hand or voice was never raised against it . They never will be . The Union is as dear to me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , if my mind to-day could be as free from fear and anxiety about it , as the minds of other gentlemen appear to be . But , Sir , I can not shut my eyes to events which are daily transpiring among a people who are excited and anxious , who are apprehensive that their rights are in danger  --  who are solicitous for  --  who will do as much to preserve their rights as any people . They must be calmed and quieted . It is useless now to tell them they have no cause for fear . They are looking to this Conference . This Conference must act . If it does not , I almost fear to contemplate the prospect that will open before us . Sir ! this Conference has now been in session fifteen days . While I have felt reluctant to do any thing which should have the appearance of precipitating our action , of cutting off or limiting debate , I have all the time been pressed with this conviction ; that if we are to save this country we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of Virginia since I have been here . I know that this feeling of apprehension which existed when I came away , has been constantly increasing in my State since ; and even last night I received letters from members of the Convention now in session in Richmond ; gentlemen who are as true to this Union as the needle to the pole , informing me that every hour of delay in this Conference was an hour of danger . I do not agree with some of my colleagues in their construction of the resolutions of the Virginia Legislature inviting this Conference . I understand that she suggests the resolutions of Mr. CRITTENDEN as one acceptable way of settling our present difficulties . She says that she will be satisfied with a settlement on the basis of those resolutions . But she has not made them her ultimatum . She has not said she will not consent to any other plan of arrangement . Her purpose was not to draw up certain articles of pacification ; to call her sister States together , and say to them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the matter between us may be arranged . We will have these or we will not arrange at all ! " I understand her as offering no restrictions whatever . She invites a conference  --  she asks the States to confer together . She expects reasonable concessions , reasonable guarantees , and with these she will be satisfied . Nor do I know why the gentleman from Maine places Virginia in the position he described , nor upon what authority . I reply to him that he makes a grave assumption when he attributes to Virginia a dictatorial position . I have come here , and I trust my colleagues have also , animated by a single purpose :  --  that purpose is to save the Union . Virginia claims no greater rights than any other State . She would not take them if they were offered . Let me say here , that it is my purpose to carry out the wishes of the people of Virginia ; that exercising the best judgment I have I shall try to ascertain what that purpose is , and shall do all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes I shall cast my vote for the proposals of amendment offered by my colleague ( Mr. SEDDON ) ; I shall do so for several reasons . The first and most important of them all is this : The Union is our inheritance  --  it is our pride . To preserve it , what sacrifice should we not make ? Its preservation is the one single desire that animates me . Can I not be understood by my Northern friends ? Will you not yield something to our necessities  --  to our condition ? Will you not do something which will enable us to go back to our excited people and say to them , " The North is treating us fairly . See what she will do to make our Union perpetual ! " Again ; I shall vote cheerfully for Mr. SEDDON 'S propositions , because the Legislature of my State has said that such amendments will satisfy the people of Virginia . I think the Legislature is right . I think in this respect it reflects the will of the people of Virginia . Remember , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , that they have been discussed and commented upon by the public Press  --  that they will probably settle our difficulties , now and forever . They were introduced into Congress by a distinguished and an able man  --  a statesman , whose integrity and fidelity no one has ever questioned , and no one will question . It is my firm belief that the States can adopt them without any material sacrifice , and that they will adopt them if they have the opportunity . But if the CRITTENDEN resolutions  --  if the propositions of my colleague can not be recommended by this Conference  --  do not find favor with the majority here ? What then ? Shall we dissolve this body , and go home ? Shall we risk all the fearful consequences which must follow ? No , sir ! No ! We came here for peace . Virginia came here for peace . We will not be impracticable . You , representatives of the free States , will not be impracticable . Therefore , I tell you that it is my firm belief that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution as reported by the majority of the committee . I believe these propositions would be acceptable to our people . I believe if we should pass them here , that the Convention now in session in Richmond would at once adopt them and recommend them to the people of that honored member of the Federal Union . Can you not ? Will you not give us one chance to satisfy our people , and to save us from that other alternative which I almost fear to contemplate ? I feared when the result was announced , that the late election in Virginia of the delegates to the Convention now in session , would be misapprehended and misunderstood at the North : that the North would regard it as a triumph of the Union sentiment in Virginia . In one sense it was such a triumph . The advocates of immediate and unconditional secession were defeated , were defeated by a heavy majority . But the members comprising that Convention represent the true feeling of the people who elected them , and they represent the present feeling of Virginia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They fear that the new administration has designs which it will carry into execution , fatal to their rights and interests . They are for the Union , provided their rights can be secured ; provided , they can have proper and honorable guarantees . It is useless to discuss now whether they are right or wrong . Such is the condition of affairs now , and it is too late to enter into the causes which produced it . We must deal with things as they are . I have known many gentlemen who have represented the interests of New England long and well . I know what sentiments filled their hearts years ago , and I do not believe those sentiments are changed now . I appeal to Vermont . Among her representatives here , I see a gentleman with whom , for a long time , I was upon terms of peculiar intimacy . In the whole course of that intimacy I can not recall a single occurrence which did not impress me with his integrity , his ability , his justice . I appeal to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend , which can influence a patriot , which can govern the action of a statesman . I appeal to Massachusetts , to all New England , which I know possesses many like himself ; and I ask you to consider our circumstances , to consider our dangers , and not to refuse us the little boon we ask , when the consequences of that refusal must be so awful . Can you not afford to make a little sacrifice , when we make one so great ? Can you not yield to us what is a mere matter of opinion with you , but what is so vital with us ? Will you not put us in a position where we can stand with our people , and let us and you stand together in the Union ? I have no delicacy here . The importance of our action with me , transcends all other considerations . I do not hesitate to appeal to New England for help in this crisis . If New England refuses to come to our aid , it will not alter my course or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now be foreseen shall these convictions be changed . I will never give up the Union ! Clouds may hang over it , storms and tempest may assail it , the waves of dissolution may dash against it , but so far as my feeble hand can support it , that support shall be given to it while I live ! When the dark days come over this Republic , and there is nothing in the future but gloom and despondency , I will do as WASHINGTON once said he would do in similar circumstances : I will gather the last handful of faithful men , carry them to the mountains of Western Virginia , and there set up the flag of the Union . It shall be defended there against all assailants until the friends of freedom and liberty from all parts of the civilized world shall rally around it , and again establish it in triumph and glory over every portion of a restored and united country . Sir , the questions which now agitate and alarm the country do not affect the interests of all sections of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly not in the same proportion . The farther sections are removed from each other , the less do the interests and the principles of their people assimilate . Maine and Louisiana , far distant from each other , differ widely . Approaching the line between the slave and free States all these differences grow less . This is shown by the action of this Conference . The border States can settle these questions . They will settle them if you will let them alone . Pennsylvania and Virginia , Maryland and New Jersey , States along the line , whose people are most vitally interested , can have no difficulty in coming to an agreement . With all the possible political interests which you may have , not only are the relations of society , of business , and commerce , to be interrupted , but these States are to form the long frontier between two foreign nations , if that fearful contingency is to happen , so often and so confidently referred to here . Why , then , should remote sections interfere to prevent this adjustment ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone ? Let them look along the valley of the Ohio River , one of the most fertile sections of the continent , in itself great enough and fruitful enough to support a nation . It has already a large population , and that population is increasing every day . The people are attached to each other by every tie that binds society together . They now live in harmony and friendship ; their property is secure . They are prosperous and happy . Such a people can not be , must not be divided . And therefore , I say , that if we are driven to that alternative ; if the representatives of the two extremes will not give us the benefit of their counsel and assistance , the Central States , and the great Northwest , must take the matter into their own hands . North Carolina , Virginia , Kentucky , Tennessee , with Pennsylvania , New Jersey , and other States near them , must unite with Ohio and the Northwest to save the country . They have the power to do it  --  they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer to this as a last alternative . It is one to which I hope and pray we may never be driven . I can not yet give up the hope , that all we need here is patient and thorough discussion and examination of the subject ; that when the true condition is understood , we shall unite together to restore confidence to the country . It must be so . The consequences of farther disagreement are too great , the crisis is too important to permit mere sectional differences , mere pride of opinion , party shackles or party platforms to control the action of any gentleman here . The Republic shall not be divided . The nation shall not be destroyed . The patriotism of the people will yet save the country against all its enemies . Mr. RUFFIN gave notice , that at the proper time he wished to offer two amendments to the second section of the propositions reported by the committee. 1 Footnote 1 : Mr. RUFFIN stated the substance of the amendments he proposed in a voice so low , as not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not to be found in the Journal , nor in the documents printed by order of the Conference , nor were they heard by me . Mr. FIELD and Mr. DODGE rose and made motions at the same time . The floor was given to Mr. DODGE , who moved , that when the Conference adjourn , it adjourn to meet at ten o'clock to-morrow . Mr. RANDOLPH moved to amend , by inserting half-past ten o'clock . Several motions were made by different members , and much confusion arose , which was suppressed . Mr. CHITTENDEN :  --  We all , no doubt , wish to economize time as much as possible . The prevailing wish seems to be to meet about eleven o'clock to-morrow . That can be accomplished by a simple motion to adjourn , which I make , and which should take precedence of all others . The PRESIDENT put the motion to adjourn , and declared it not carried . A MEMBER :  --  I move to amend Mr. DODGE 'S motion , by inserting seven o'clock this evening . This motion did not prevail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion , which was adopted , and the Conference then adjourned . THIRTEENTH DAY . WASHINGTON , WEDNESDAY , February 20th , 1861 . The Conference was called to order by President TYLER at ten o'clock , and after prayer by the Rev. Dr. SAMPSON , the Journal of yesterday was read and approved . Mr. HARRIS :  --  I desire to call the attention of the Conference to the fact , that the time has not yet arrived when the Conference , by its rules , should commence business . The rule is , that the daily session shall commence at eleven o'clock . The PRESIDENT :  --  The Conference , previous to its adjournment yesterday , adopted the motion of Mr. DODGE , fixing this hour for the commencement of the present session . Mr. WICKLIFFE :  --  I wish to call attention to the 9th rule in the printed list . It has not been adopted by the Conference . It is in here by mistake . The Committee on Rules did not intend to recommend it . I ask now that it be stricken from the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion . Mr. WICKLIFFE :  --  Then I withdraw it . Mr. HARRIS :  --  I wish to offer a preamble and resolutions , and would like to have them read for the information of the Conference . I ask to have them printed and laid upon the table , so that I can move them as an amendment at the proper time . The resolutions were laid upon the table and ordered to be printed , and are as follows : Whereas , The Federal Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof , are the supreme law of the land , and should command the willing obedience of all good citizens ; and whereas it is alleged that sundry States have enacted laws repugnant thereto . Therefore , Resolved . That this Convention respectfully requests the several States to revise their respective enactments , and to modify or repeal any laws which may be found to be in conflict with the Constitution and laws of the United States . Resolved , That the President of this Convention is requested to send a copy of the foregoing preamble and resolutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the request that the same be communicated to the Legislature thereof . Mr. RANDOLPH :  --  I must now insist upon having my resolution , offered yesterday , considered . Congress is about adjourning , and , if we do not close our labors to-day , we can not have our propositions acted upon under the rules of the Senate and House of Representatives . They can be kept out on the objection of any member . I do not wish to debate the resolution , and I hope the debate will not be continued in the general manner it was yesterday . Mr. FIELD :  --  There seems to be a disposition to stop debate now , after nearly the whole time has been occupied by the other side . Yesterday the whole session was occupied by a general discussion of this question . It is my right to debate it as generally as other gentlemen have done . I shall avail myself of that right . I may not speak thirty minutes , but I will not submit to the imposition of a different rule upon me , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposed upon others . The first question is on striking out the last clause of the resolution . On that I have nothing to say except that I ask for a vote by States . A vote by States was then taken , and resulted as follows : AYES.  --  Connecticut , Illinois , Indiana , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Maryland , New York , New Hampshire , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Vermont  --  12 . NOES.  --  Delaware , Kentucky , Missouri , New Jersey , North Carolina , Rhode Island , Tennessee , and Virginia  --  8 . Mr. CLAY :  --  I move to lay the whole subject upon the table . It is useless to attempt to stop discussion in this way . Mr. CHASE :  --  I call for a vote by States . The motion of Mr. CLAY prevailed by the following vote . AYES.  --  Connecticut , Illinois , Indiana , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts . New York , Vermont , Virginia , and New Hampshire  --  10 . NOES.  --  Delaware , Maryland , Missouri , New Jersey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tennessee  --  9 . Mr. McCURDY :  --  There is really but one question that ought to engage the attention of this Conference . All others may be settled in half an hour . This question is a great one , and assumes a variety of forms . I wish to vote upon it understandingly , and I want some information from the committee which has had it in charge . I ask that committee whether they are not proposing a change in the Constitution , which , if adopted , will operate as a direct and effectual protection of slavery in all the territories of the United States ? This appears to me to be the true question for our consideration . I wish to know what meaning is attached by its friends to one part of the proposed article . It states that " the status of persons owing service or labor as it now exists shall not be changed by law , " &c.; and again , " that the rights arising out of said relations shall be subject to judicial cognizance in the Federal courts according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shall not be changed . By that term I suppose condition is intended . I understand that perfectly . There shall be no law to change the condition , to impair the rights of the slaveholder ; but shall there be no law to protect these rights ? Now , what is intended by this ? Why not make this provision plain , and not leave it open to any question of construction ? The ghost of the old trouble rises here , and will not down at the bidding of any man . I believe under this article the institution of slavery is to be protected by a most ingenious contrivance . The common law , administered according to the pro-slavery view , is to be called in for its protection . Now I ask the chairman of the committee reporting these propositions what he means by the common law ? The common law , as we understand it , is the law of freedom  --  not of slavery . But I do not here propose to discuss that question . I wish to know how the truth really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends of this proposition understand it ? By the common law a slave is still a man : a person , and not a personal chattel . He may owe service , as a child to its parent , an apprentice to his master , but he is still a person owing service . He is all the time recognized as a man . As such he may own and hold property , take it by inheritance and dispose of it at pleasure , by will or by contract . All these rights , all the principles on which they are founded , are in direct antagonism to slavery . The argument may be carried much farther , but this is far enough for my purpose . By the slave law , all this is reversed . The master owns the body of the slave , may sell or otherwise dispose of him , may make him the subject of inheritance . The slave loses all the attributes of a person , and becomes property as much as the horse or the ox that feeds at his master 's crib . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the master over the slave . These rights the common law , under this proposition , is to recognize , protect , and enforce . I believe I am not mistaken in this . What other construction can you give the article ? It is a distinct proposal to engraft slavery upon the common law : to declare in the Constitution that slavery is recognized and protected by the common law . Now , the North has always protested against this . She will never consent to it . She understands all the consequences as well as you . No doubt it would be a great point gained for you , to have the Constitution recognize the institution of slavery as part of the common law . For then slavery goes wherever the common law goes . Its rights under this provision are not confined to the territories . Once established , these may be enforced in a free State just as well . It is the old proposition over again , which has come before the American people so many times under so many different guises . It makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if such is the construction which it is intended this section shall receive , why not state it openly ? why leave it as a question of construction ? This construction involves other considerations . This new kind of common law is to be substituted for the old . The latter has been understood for centuries almost . Its principles have been discussed and settled . It is a system founded by experience , and adapted to the wants of the people subject to it . Its very name implies that it was not created by legislative authority . A strange common law indeed that would be which is created by the Constitution . But this is not all . Other principles of the common law are subject to change . They are adapted to the advance of civilization , to the wants of communities . Change is the universal law of nature . This new kind of common law is alone to be perpetual . It is not my purpose to enter into a general discussion of the subject . This point struck me as important , as needing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee will correct me . Mr. EWING :  --  The proposition contained in the first article of the proposed amendment , is copied from the CRITTENDEN resolutions in substance . It is true that the language is somewhat changed , but the legal effect is identical in both the propositions . The term " status " &c.,; as there used is not applicable to all the territory of the United States . It only extends to that portion of the territory south of 36 deg. 30 ' . It crushes out liberty nowhere . It changes nothing  --  no rights whatever . Again , whatever may be the status of the person in the State from which he comes , that is preserved in the territory , and that alone . It is precisely similar to the case of a contract to which the lex loci gives the construction , and the lex for its execution . I like the common law . I have made it my study . I like the use of this term here . It was a good system when not as perfect as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery until it was abolished . The colliers of the North of England were once , to all intents and purposes , as much slaves as any negro on the Southern plantations , except in the matter of separation of families . I can refer you to a precedent on this subject , which you will find in a book of no very high authority . I mean the novel , Red Gauntlet . The general principle applicable here is this : Whenever you establish the right  --  no matter how , if you establish it  --  the common law asserts the remedy . There is no crushing out about it . The simple proposition is this : Slavery exists already in that little worthless territory we own below the proposed line . Will we agree that it shall remain there just as it is now , so long as the territorial condition continues ? That is all . There is no mystery or question of construction about it . Mr. FIELD :  --  The questions now before the Conference I suppose arise upon the report presented by the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that report the propositions of the minority of the same committee . I propose to add to this report the three following propositions ; and I will read them for the information of the Conference . I. " Each State has the sole and exclusive right , according to its own judgment , to order and direct its domestic institutions , and to determine for itself what shall be the relation to each other of all persons residing or being within its limits . II . " Congress shall provide by law for securing to the citizens of each State the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States . III . " The union of the States under the Constitution is indissoluble ; and no State can secede from the Union , or nullify an act of Congress , or absolve its citizens from their paramount obligations of obedience to the Constitution and laws of the United States . " These additions would render the majority report much more acceptable to the northern people than it is in its present shape , though even then , I am bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer the substitute . In what I have now to say , I shall not confine myself to a discussion of these propositions , but availing myself of the latitude of debate hitherto allowed to gentlemen who have addressed the Conference in favor of the report of the majority of the committee , I shall endeavor to bring to the notice of this body , more fully than I have yet done , my views upon the general question presented for our consideration . For myself , I state at the outset that I am indisposed to the adoption , at the present time , of any amendment of the Constitution . To change the organic law of thirty millions of people is a measure of the greatest importance . Such a measure should never be undertaken in any case , or under any circumstances , without great deliberation and the highest moral certainty that the country will be benefited by the change . In this case , as yet , there has been no deliberation ; certainly not so far as the delegates from New York are concerned . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New York ( her Legislature being in session ) appointed her delegates on the 5th of February . We came here on the 8th . Our delegation was not full for a week . The amendments proposed were submitted on the 15th . It is now the 20th of the month . We are urged to act at once without further deliberation or delay . To found an empire , or to make a constitution for a people , on which so much of their happiness depends , requires the sublimest effort of the human intellect , the greatest impartiality in weighing opposing interests , the utmost calmness in judgment , the highest prudence in decision . It is proposed that we shall proceed to amend in essential particulars a Constitution which , since its adoption by the people of this country , has answered all its needs ; with a haste which to my mind is unnecessary , not to say indecent . Have any defects been discovered in this Constitution ? I have listened most attentively to hear those defects mentioned , if any such have been found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Judicial Department is suggested . The exercise of judicial powers under the Constitution has been satisfactory enough to the South . The Judicial Department is to be left untouched , as I think it should be . You propose no change in the form of the Executive or Legislative Departments . These you leave as they were before . What you do propose is , to place certain limitations upon the Legislative power , to prohibit legislation upon certain important subjects , to give new guarantees to slavery , and this , as you admit , before any person has been injured , before any right has been infringed . There is high authority which ought to be satisfactory to you , that of the President of the United States , now in office , for the statement that Congress never undertook to pass an unconstitutional law affecting the interests of slavery except the Missouri Compromise . Well , you have repealed that . You have also every assurance that can be given , that the administration about coming into power proposes no interference with your institutions within State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . You propose these amendments in advance . You insist upon them , and you declare that you must and will have them or certain consequences must follow . But , gentlemen of the South , what reasons do you give for entering upon this hasty , this precipitate action ? You say it is the prevailing sense of insecurity , the anxiety , the apprehension you feel lest something unlawful , something unconstitutional , may be done . Yet the gentleman from Virginia ( Mr. SEDDON ) tells us that Virginia is able to protect all who reside within her limits , and that she will do so at all hazards . Why not tell us the truth outright ? It is not action under the Constitution or in Congress that you would prevent . What is it , then ? You are determined to prevent the agitation of the subject . Let us understand each other . You have called us here to prevent future discussion of the subject of slavery . It is that you fear  --  it is that you would avoid  --  discussion in Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in popular assemblies . But will the plan you propose , the course you have marked out , accomplish your purpose ? Will it stop discussion ? Will it lessen it in the slightest degree ? Can you not profit by the experience of the past ? Can you prevent an agitation of this subject , or any other , by any constitutional provisions ? No ! Look at the details of your scheme . You propose through the Constitution to require payment for fugitive slaves : to make the North pay for them . You are thus throwing a lighted firebrand not only into Congress , but into every State Legislature , into every county , city , and village in the land . This one proposition to pay for fugitive slaves , will prove a subject for almost irrepressible agitation . You say to the State Legislatures , you shall not obstruct the rendition of fugitives from service , but you may legislate in aid of their rendition , thereby implying that the latter kind of legislation will be their duty . You thus provide a new subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Border States especially , such as Ohio and Pennsylvania , you will find this agitation fiercer than any you have hitherto witnessed ; of which you complain so much . You will add to the flame until it becomes a consuming fire . You propose to stop the discussion of these questions by the press . Do you really believe that in this age of the world you can accomplish that ? You know little of history if such is your belief . Free speech is stronger than constitutions or dynasties . You might as well put your hands over the crater of a burning volcano , and seek thus to extinguish its flames , as to attempt to stop discussion by such an amendment of the Constitution . Stop discussion of the great questions affecting the policy , strength , and prosperity of the Government ! You can not do it ! You ought not to attempt to do it ! I wish to speak kindly upon this subject . I entertain no unfriendly feelings toward any section . But while you are thus complaining of us in the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery , are you not , in a great degree , responsible for this agitation yourselves ? Do you not discuss it , and agitate it ? Do you not make slavery the subject of your speeches in the South , and in the presence of your slaves ? Do you not make charges against us , which in your cooler moments you know to be unfounded ? Do you not charge us in the hearing of your slaves with the design of interfering with slavery in the States , with a design to free them if we succeed ? You have done all this and more , and if discontent , anxiety , and mistrust exist among your people , let me say that such discussion has contributed more to produce them , than all the agitation of the slavery question at the North . But your amendments are not pointed at your discussions . That kind of agitation may go on as before . It is only the discussion on the other side you would repress ! If the condition of affairs among you is as you represent it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing for you to do ? Should you not tell your people what we have assured you upon every proper occasion , that the Republican Party has always repudiated all intention of interfering with slavery , or any other Southern institution within the States ? This you all know . Have you told your people this ? If you would explain it to them now , would they not be quieted ? Do not reply that they believe we have such a purpose . Who is responsible for that belief ? Have you not continually asserted before your people , notwithstanding every assurance we could give you to the contrary , that we are determined to interfere with your rights ? It is thus the responsibility rests with you . Although such is my conviction , supported , as I think , by all the evidence , I am still for peace . Show me now any proposition that will secure peace , and I will go for it if I can . We came here to take each other by the hand , to compare views , explain , consult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any thing that honorable men may do , we will do . We will go back to 1845 when you admitted Texas ; back to the Missouri Compromise of 1820 . You certainly can complain of nothing previous to that time . If , since then , there has been any law of Congress passed which is unjust toward you , which infringes upon your rights , which operates unfairly upon your interests , we will join you in securing its repeal . We will go farther . If you will point out any act of the Republican Party which has given you just cause for apprehension , we will give you all security against it . We will do any thing but amend the fundamental law of Government . Before we do that we must be convinced of its necessity . When you propose essential changes in the Constitution you must expect that they will be subjected to a critical examination ; if not here , certainly elsewhere . I object to those proposed by the majority of the committee  --  1st . For what they do contain . 2nd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not propose to criticize the language used in your propositions of amendment . That would be trifling . I think the language very infelicitous , and if I supposed those propositions were to become part of the Constitution , I should think many verbal changes indispensable . But I pass by all that , and come at once to the substance . I object to the propositions , sir , because they would put into the Constitution new expressions relating to slavery , which were sedulously kept out of it by the framers of that instrument ; left out of it , not accidentally , but because , as MADISON said , they did not wish posterity to know from the Constitution that the institution existed . But I object further , because the propositions contain guarantees for slavery which our fathers did not and would not give . In 1787 the convention was held at Philadelphia to establish our form of Government . WASHINGTON was its presiding officer , whose name was in itself a bond of union . It was soon after the close of a long and bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath summer suns  --  through such sufferings and sacrifices as the world had scarcely ever witnessed  --  the people of these States , under Providence , had fought and achieved their independence . Fresh from the field , their hearts full of patriotism , determined to perpetuate the liberties they had achieved , the people sent their delegates into the convention to frame a Constitution which would preserve to their posterity the blessings they had won . These delegates , under the presidence of WASHINGTON , aided by the counsels of MADISON and FRANKLIN , considered the very questions with which we are now dealing , and they refused to put into the Constitution which they were making , such guarantees to slavery as you now ask from their descendants . That is my interpretation of their action . Either these guarantees are in the Constitution , or they are not . If they are there , let them remain there . If they are not there , I can conceive of no possible state of circumstances under which I would consent to admit them . Mr. MOREHEAD :  --  Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , no ! That is my comprehensive answer . Mr. MOREHEAD :  --  Then you will let the Union slide . Mr. FIELD :  --  No , never ! I would let slavery slide , and save the Union . Greater things than this have been done . This year has seen slavery abolished in all the Russias . Mr. ROMAN :  --  Do you think it better to have the free and slave States separated , and to have the Union dissolved ? Mr. FIELD :  --  I would sacrifice all I have ; lay down my life for the Union . But I will not give these guarantees to slavery . If the Union can not be preserved without them , it can not long be preserved with them . Let me ask you , if you will recommend to the people of the southern States , in case these guarantees are conceded , to accept them , and abide by their obligations to the Union ? You answer , Yes ! Do you suppose you can induce the seceded States to return ? You answer : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if , after all , they refuse ? Your answer is , " We will go with them ! " We are to understand , then , that this is the language of the slave States , which have not seceded , toward the free States : " If you will support our amendments , we will try to induce the seceded States to return to the Union . We rather think we can induce them to return ; but if we can not , then we will go with them . " What is to be done by the Government of the United States while you are trying this experiment ? The seceded States are organizing a Government with all its departments . They are levying taxes , raising military forces , and engaging in commerce with foreign nations , in plain violation of the provisions of the Constitution . If this condition of affairs lasts six months longer , France and England will recognize theirs as a Government de facto . Do you suppose we will submit to this , that we can submit to it ? I speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but myself ; but I here assert , that an administration which fails to assert by force its authority over the whole country will be a disgrace to the nation . There is no middle ground ; we must keep this country unbroken , or we give it up to ruin ! We are told that one State has an hundred thousand men ready for the field , and that if we do not assent to these propositions she will fight us . If I believed this to be true , I would not consent to treat on any terms . From the ports of these seceded States have sailed all the fillibustering expeditions which have heretofore disgraced this land . There , have those enterprises been conceived and fitted out . Their new government will enter upon a new career of conquest unless prevented . Even if these propositions of amendment are received and submitted to the people , I see nothing but war in the future , unless those States are quickly brought back to their allegiance . I do not propose to use harsh language . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assert that this is a movement toward a revolution counter to a political revolution just accomplished by the elections . Nor will I speak of personal liberty bills , or of northern State legislation , about which so much complaint has been made . If I went into those questions , much might be said on both sides . We might ask you whether you had not thrown stones at us ? Did not the Governor of Louisiana , in his message to the Legislature of his State , recommend special legislation against the supporters of Mr. LINCOLN ? Is there not on the statute books of Maryland a law which prohibits a " black Republican " from holding certain offices in that State ? Mr. JOHNSON :  --  There was a police bill before the Legislature of Maryland , in which some provision of that kind was inserted by one who wished to defeat it . Its friends were compelled to accept the provision in order to save the bill . The courts at once held the provision unconstitutional . All that is so . Mr. FIELD :  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ancient State did place upon her statute book an act passed with all the forms of law , containing a provision so insulting to millions of American citizens . Mr. HOWARD :  --  Will Mr. FIELD permit me a single question ? I ask it for information , and because I am unable to answer it myself . I therefore rely upon his superior judgment and better means of knowledge . It appears to me that Massachusetts , Maine , and New York have gone much farther . The charge is a serious one . Maryland has never refused to submit to the decisions of the proper judicial tribunals . The Constitution has provided for the erection of a tribunal which should finally decide all questions of constitutional law . That tribunal has decided that the people of the slave States have a legal right to go into the territories with their property . The gentleman from New York tells us he is in favor of free territory , and his people are also . Now , I wish to ask , where in the Constitution he finds the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular voice ? In what clause of the Constitution is this power lodged ? Where does he find this right of appeal to the people , a right which he insists the North will not give up ? Mr. FIELD :  --  I am happy to answer the question of the gentleman from Maryland , and I reply that when once the Supreme Court has decided a question , I know of no way in which the decision can be reversed , except through an amendment of the Constitution . I have the greatest respect for the authority of the Supreme Court . I would take up arms , if necessary , to execute its decisions . I say that States , as well as persons , should respect and conform to its judgments , and I would say they must . But I am bound in candor to add , that in my view the Supreme Court has never adjudged the point to which the gentlemen refers ; it gave opinions , but no decision . I was about to state , when I was first interrupted , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Constitution is to be amended , ought to be there before any others that have been suggested . I mean those which will secure protection in the South to the citizens of the free States , and those which will protect the Union against future attempts at secession ; guarantees which are contained in the propositions that I have submitted as proper to be added to the report of the majority . But , sir , I must insist , that if amendments to the Constitution are required at all , it is better that they should be proposed and considered in a General Convention . Although I do not regard this Conference as exactly unconstitutional , it is certainly a bad precedent . It is a body nominally composed of representatives of the States , and is called to urge upon Congress propositions of amendment to the Constitution . Its recommendations will have something of force in them ; it will undoubtedly be claimed for them in Congress that they possess such force . I do not like to see an irregular body sitting by the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again , all the States are not here . Oregon and California  --  the great Pacific dominions with all their wealth and power , present and prospective  --  have not been consulted at all . Will it be replied that all the States can vote upon the amendments ? That is a very different thing from proposing them . California and Oregon may have interests of their own to protect , propositions of their own to make . Is it right for us to act without consulting them ? I will go for a convention , because I believe it is the best way to avoid civil war . Mr. WICKLIFFE :  --  If a General Convention is held , what amendments will you propose ? Mr. FIELD :  --  I have already said that I have none to propose . I am satisfied with the Constitution as it is . Mr. WICKLIFFE :  --  Then , for God 's sake , let us have no General Convention . Mr. FIELD :  --  I think the gentleman 's observation is not logical . He wants amendments , I do not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us have them through a General Convention . And I say farther , that this is the quickest way to secure them . If a General Convention is to be called , let it be held at once , just as soon as possible . If gentlemen from eight of the States in this Conference represent truly the public sentiment of their people , as I will assume they do , there is no other alternative . We must have either the arbitrament of reason or the arbitrament of the sword . The gloomy future alone can tell whether the latter is to be the one adopted . I greatly fear it is . The conviction presses upon me in my waking and my sleeping hours . Only last night I dreamed of marching armies and news from the seat of war . A laugh from the Kentucky and Virginia benches . The gentlemen laugh . I thought they , too , had fears of war . I thought their threats and prophecies were sincere . God grant that I may not hereafter have to say , " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir , I have but little more to trouble you with . In what I have said I trust there has been no expression that will be taken in ill part . I have spoken what I sincerely felt . If there has been an unkind word in my remarks I did not intend it , and am sorry for having uttered it . For my own State and for the North I have only to say that they are devoted to the Union . We have been reminded of HAMILTON 'S opinion , that the States are stronger than the Union , and that when the collision comes the Union must fall . This is a mistake . In the North the love for the Union is the strongest of political affections . New York will stand by the flag of the country while there is a star left in its folds . If the Union should be reduced to thirteen States  --  if it should be reduced to three States  --  if all should fall away but herself , she will stand alone to bear and uphold that honored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pledge and symbol . God grant that time may never come , but that New York may stand side by side with Kentucky and Virginia to the end . That we may all stand by the Union , negotiate for it , fight for it , if the necessity comes , is my wish , my hope , my prayer . The Constitution made for us by WASHINGTON , FRANKLIN , MADISON , and HAMILTON , and the wise and patriotic men who labored with them , is good enough for us . We stand for the country , for the Union , for the Constitution . I found yesterday upon my table a pamphlet bearing the title of " The Governing Race . " It contains a sublime passage from LONGFELLOW 'S poem of " The Ship , " which , as it closes the pamphlet , shall also close my observations : " Thou , too , sail on , O Ship of State ! Sail on , O UNION , strong and great ! Humanity with all its fears , With all the hopes of future years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Master laid thy keel , What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel , Who made each mast , and sail , and rope , What anvils rang , what hammers beat , In what a forge and what a heat Were shaped the anchors of thy hope ! Fear not each sudden sound and shock , ' T is of the wave and not the rock ; ' T is but the flapping of the sail , And not a rent made by the gale ! In spite of rock and tempest 's roar , In spite of false lights on the shore , Sail on , nor fear to breast the sea ! Our hearts , our hopes , are all with thee , Our hearts , our hopes , our prayers , our tears , Our faith triumphant o'er our fears , Are all with thee ,  --  are all with thee . " Mr. WHITE :  --  I shall not occupy much of the time of the Conference . All the speeches that have been made , and all the declamation that has been uttered on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all would I wish to follow the gentleman who has just taken his seat . He proposes to postpone action , asserts that we are acting without consideration , in haste , and without due deliberation . I look upon this subject from a different point of view . I believe the motive of Pennsylvania in first responding to the invitation of Virginia was to induce the States to meet here in council , and remove that peril which now threatens our common country . Pennsylvania had another reason . She is a border State ; she has a deeper and more vital interest in the present unhappy differences than New York or the North . If there is to be war ; civil , unnatural war , whose country is to be devastated , whose fields laid waste and trampled down ? They are those of the border States  --  of Ohio , Pennsylvania , Illinois , Indiana , and possibly New Jersey . These are the States that are to suffer . Gentlemen from New York and the North East , in the bosom of their families , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be as impassive as the granite rocks that bind their shores . We have a deeper , a more vital interest ; therefore we feel and speak . When Pennsylvania received the invitation of Virginia , South Carolina , Georgia , and other States had seceded . Dangers were accumulating . Then it was that the old conservative Keystone State threw herself into the breach . She sent her delegation here to save the country and not to change the Constitution  --  not to alter it , but to explain it and to give our Southern sisters the guarantees they once did not ask and did not need . We believed that the great majority of the people of the Southern States were Union loving men , who choose to sail under the flag of the Union , rather than under any piratical and treasonable banner . We knew there were rebels within those States , as there is a faction at the North composed of men as much rebels as they are . We knew , also , that there was a large body of men at the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of great anxiety and apprehension , and who might be stirred up by demagogues , through appeals to their State pride and other influences , to take a stand against the Union . The Republicans denied that they wished to interfere in any manner with the institution of slavery . We have come here to give the slave States a declaratory exposition of our views . We have come bearing the olive branch . We are met by the South in a spirit of conciliation . The delegates tell us that they hope to be able to bring back their erring sister States into the fold of the Union , if they can go to them bearing satisfactory guarantees from us . Pennsylvania is willing that we should give them that opportunity . We have lived in harmony with them : we wish to live in peace with them . If the seceded States will not come back , if the other Southern States can not bring them back , then , are we in any worse position ? No , sir ! we are not . We desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if some States will not stay in the Union , on their heads be the responsibility . Then , if any wrong has been done , if any right has been violated , Pennsylvania will not be responsible . We shall have done our duty , on them will the responsibility rest . They must answer for it before the world and before the judgment-seat . What will be the consequence of postponing action on this subject ? We are strengthening the position of the seceded States . We " Keep the word of promise to the ear , And break it to the hope . " Every rebel will rejoice at our inaction . The continuance of Virginia in the Union depends upon the action of a convention now in session in Richmond . If we send her commissioners home to say to that convention , " The North will wait two years and then consider your propositions , " what will the convention say to that ? The seceded States have at this moment commissioners at Richmond entreating Virginia to join their Confederacy , and to detach herself from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can fail to foresee the consequences ? Maryland is about calling a convention . She , too , will act , and she will go where her associations and her interests carry her . From this you can infer some of the reasons why Pennsylvania has sent her commissioners here . Her object was not delay . Her wish was for action  --  speedy action . She wishes to do all she can to accelerate action . She wishes to have some plan laid before the country at once  --  something fair to all sections  --  and then , with , the alternatives before them , let the people decide . She wishes to pour oil on the troubled waters . We are told by our friend from New York , that the amendments are badly drawn . If so , let him help us to correct them . No one can do it better . Surely there is talent enough in this Conference to remedy such defects as are suggested by him . Gentlemen say they do not wish to convert free territory into slave territory . Neither do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south of the line proposed is slave territory already . The adoption of these propositions does not extend slavery at all . The first advantage the Republican party ever obtained in Pennsylvania , was on account of the repeal of the Missouri Compromise , followed by the decision of the Supreme Court , declaring that the normal condition of the territory was a condition of slavery , and on that ground holding the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional . Such being the state of the matter , do we lose any thing by the prohibition of slavery north of 36 deg. 30 ' ? No ! All that vast territory north of the line will be dedicated to freedom . The South asks that faith shall be kept ; that slavery in the territory south of the line shall not be interfered with . This is the only material averment in the declaration . The second article contains a modification of the Constitution which was not intended . This I understand it is proper to amend . Another proposition is to put a barrier into the Constitution , which will prevent the acquisition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am sure the gentleman from New York will not object . Sir , I have read and carefully considered all the proposed amendments . To my mind they present no essential changes , or modifications , or constructions , of that instrument . I can see no injury in them to the interests of the North . I think they are rather to the advantage of the North . I believe the people of the North will hasten cheerfully to adopt them . Now , if we can adopt them  --  if we can make them a part of our organic law , and thus settle these differences , who will not be glad ? There is still a deep and abiding love of the Union in the hearts of all the people . They will hail with joy any action of yours which tends to strengthen it . Mr. TUCK :  --  I should not address the Conference at this time if I did not discover early signs of closing the debate , and I prefer to be clearly understood upon the subject of discussion before it closes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They think that one-half their number are already out of the Union . They deem themselves weakened by their defection . I well understand the inquiry of the eloquent gentleman from Virginia , when he asked , on the second day of the session , " Ca n't you understand our position ? " I have listened to appeals stronger and more eloquent than I ever expect to hear again . The representatives from the South on this floor are skilful in debate and eloquent in speech . Were there no view of the case but the one they present , I might become a convert myself . They have seen half of the slave States , acting on the theory of right claimed by the South , undertake to go out of the Union . If they love the States they represent , and the Union of all the States , they should be filled with apprehension and alarm . The venerable gentleman from North Carolina ( Judge RUFFIN ) has appealed to us with an ardor , patriotism , and eloquence which has produced an indelible impression upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Virginia , in describing parallels of attack which the North , as he said , were constructing , in the course of events , about the institution of slavery , commanded my undivided attention . Yet gentlemen greatly err in assuming that we of the North are acting under some wizard influence , and , out of pure malignity , are plotting the overthrow of slavery . There is no plot or general concert in the action of the North on this subject . We are , like the South , subject to general laws affecting mind and morals , as well as pecuniary concerns , which laws can not be disregarded . We can not act otherwise than we do . Ideas and principles control , and we and those whom we represent will act in accordance with them , whatever be the consequences . Much is said here about saving to the Union the slave States not yet gone . All I have to say on this point is , I wish to save them , and I trust we shall have less trouble with the seven than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. ALEXANDER . The people of this country , North and South alike , obey the laws of interest and morality . There is no disposition at the North to destroy slavery . Let these accusations and criminations be heard no more . What I am about to say may weigh but little , but I know something of the North , and a little of the South . I fully believe that the institution of slavery within the States should be left with them exclusively  --  that such is the prevailing sentiment of the North . I say so because there is no disposition at the North to interfere with it . Do we believe that we can manage slavery better than you ? No , sir ! I believe that we could not manage it so well . If we had been reared on your soil in the midst of slavery , we could manage it just as well . It is a mistake and a pernicious error , for the South to believe that either party at the North proposes to raise any question relating to slavery within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North who could stand up long enough to fall down , if he should take such a position . There are problems connected with slavery which we can not solve ; we do not wish to undertake their solution . We will leave them with you . What , then , should we do ? My answer is , live along as we have done before . We will live with you in the Union , under a Constitution that requires us to help you keep the peace . Where you dwell , we will dwell . Your people shall be our people , and where you die , we will die . Our Constitution is good enough for a people who are wise enough to live under it . With such a Constitution , Virginia proposes to leave the Union . Will you leave the Union because the Constitution has not been rightly construed ? No ; for it has been construed to your entire satisfaction . It has been made to speak your views . The judges of our Supreme Courts represent your opinions . There has never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Dred Scott decision protects slavery in all the territories according to your desire , though against our strong conviction of law and right . Will you leave the Union because you have not had the Government your share of the time ? You have had possession and control of it for fifty years out of seventy-two ; and during a large portion of the twenty-two years , when we have had the President from the free States , the administration has been under the control of southern sentiments , and southern interests have been in the ascendency , through the servility of northern men . Do you leave the Union in order to secure the protection of a better Constitution ? No ; for they who have left us have said that the Constitution was well enough , if the people were sufficiently enlightened to live under it . Why is it , then , with all these facts before you , that you propose to turn away from the Government of our fathers , from all the glories of the past , the blessings of the present , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and better things under a new Government ? You are going out of the Union because you say we propose to immolate you  --  to turn you over to the mercies of a Government of slaves set free . How unfounded is such a belief ! Are we not brothers still ? I doubt whether there was a better feeling between the masses of the North toward you ten or seventy years ago than there is to-day . Can you find better fortunes elsewhere ? Where do you propose to go ? To the doubtful fortunes of a Southern Confederacy ? You certainly are not acting with your accustomed prudence and forethought . You know what the teachings of history are in relation to nations in that belt of latitude . You know how they have always compared with northern nations . Together the two sections may be prosperous and powerful ; separated you can judge where the advantage must fall . Had we not better try and get along as we are ? This Conference presents some singular scenes . Although made up , so far as the North is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by a majority , it supports southern views of southern interests as earnestly and emphatically as any southern man has done . In all conflicts of the past and present you have carried your points , and you have reason to think you may do so in future . Yet you insist upon separation . Be assured , you will experience as bitter feuds among yourselves as you do in the fellowship of those you leave . You can not be reconciled to even the existence of a minority against you , but you will find you can not escape the minorities , and may fall into one yourselves . You propose to join the fortunes of the Southern Confederacy , in which , there is a contention already . You turn your backs upon the Government of the Father of his Country , whose portrait is before us , and join your fortunes to a mere southern nationality . Beware of the act . Look back over the last two thousand years , and contrast the stability of governments in southern latitudes with those more northern , under latitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South America , furnish valuable lessons on this Continent , while the Eastern Hemisphere is , in this respect , full of instruction . Will you leave a people whose character and habits are like those which have produced the permanence and power of Russia , France , and England , and ally yourselves to those more southern people who have not hitherto enjoyed stability , power , or happiness ? Is it not wiser to stay where you are , to scorn the pernicious doctrines of new teachers , and to live and die under the flag of our fathers ? The annexation of Texas opened a Pandora 's box of evil . Had not that taken place , the Missouri Compromise would not have been repealed . Had not that Compromise been repealed , the shadow of our present troubles would not have arisen . You speak of the opposition of the North to slavery . Believe us or not , it is true , nevertheless , that slavery is regarded at the North as strictly a State institution ; as such , we are content to let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But let not the North be misunderstood in its position . The North is willing to let slavery remain where it is  --  where our fathers left it ; but against its extension into the territories , the North is inflexibly and unalterably opposed . If there is any thing to pacificate I am in favor of pacification , but in favor of it according to the Constitution . The Constitution embraces all that any State can reasonably ask or honorably concede . But if from change of circumstances or other causes , the men of the South are of the opinion that their interests are overlooked or ill-defined , I , for one , will favor a call of a convention to consider amendments to the Constitution , and I will vote for such amendments as shall give as substantial protection to the South as the North ought to ask for , in the change of circumstances . I submitted an address and resolutions a few days since for adoption in this Convention , which I hope may be carefully read before being rejected . They contemplated a convention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public . I oppose the proposition for an address by the committee , to be issued to the public after our adjournment . We wish to know beforehand what we adopt , and to weigh every word . There is a northern sentiment to be regarded as well as a southern sentiment . We of the North have heard much said in denunciation of us , and have thought it political clap-trap and gasconade . But if we are made to believe in your hostility to us and the Government , we may conclude it is best to let you leave us . We have no fears in trusting ourselves , if necessary , to our industry , our habits , and enterprise , separate from the slaveholding States . Opinions are changing rapidly . I do not like the idea of maintaining the Union by force of arms . It is not in accordance with the theory of our Government . A Virginian stated only a few days ago , that there was nothing which the South could ask or that the North could give , that was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not understand it alike  --  that the two sections differ in their construction of it . Well , if that is so , we are willing to submit to the courts . You have always fared well enough there . If that is not enough we will leave the whole subject , amendments and all , to a General Convention . That we now propose . We propose it fairly , not for any purpose of delay or postponement . Call the convention as early as it can be done . We will aid you . We will go home and in good faith urge our people to go into the convention , and there patiently and fairly consider all your claims , all your complaints . We would urge them to concede all they can without a sacrifice of principle . We will do this as a party , and with all our strength . Now , this does not quite come up to what you want , but is it best for you to insist upon breaking up the Government on that ground ? That is neither sensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same skull ; one can not outlive the other . Destroy one and you destroy the other . I do not believe this Republic can stand without the Union which our fathers made . But it will stand  --  it must stand . Wise counsels will yet prevail . You will yet believe us sincere in our desires to relieve you . The end of the Union has not come  --  it is not coming . The Union will yet outlive us and our posterity . Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN :  --  In rising to express briefly my views , I feel oppressed and embarrassed in view of the magnitude of the subjects we are discussing , and in the presence of this distinguished auditory . I can not claim to represent an Empire State with its four millions of people , nor a Bay State , which we are told , with its wealth , its enterprise , and its commerce , can settle a new State every year . But with my colleagues , I represent a State which performed her part in the dark night of the Revolution  --  her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a State which has ever since been faithful in the discharge of all her constitutional obligations . In that bloody conflict , upon her own soil , New Jersey joined hands with the North and South . There is scarcely a church spire within her borders beneath whose shadows does not lay the remains of some of the entombed patriots in that great conflict from both these sections , commingled with those of her own sons ! New Jersey was true to the Union in that great struggle  --  she has always since been true ; and under the favor of Providence she always will be faithful to the Union and its memories , so inseparably connected with the glory and honor of her sons . Other States may have done as much , may have as good a record , may be entitled to equal credit with her . But in all her past history , I can point to her fidelity to the Union and her sister States with no blush of shame upon my brow . Other States might be wanting ! New Jersey never ! She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always kept  --  never sought to avoid them . With a narrow stream separating her from a slaveholding State , there were never any underground railroads in New Jersey ; she never rescued a fugitive slave from the custody of the law ; no personal liberty bill ever disgraced the pages of her statutes , nor ever will disgrace them . In 1793 she enacted a statute providing for the prompt return of fugitive slaves found within her limits . She subjected any judge required to act under it , to imprisonment , if he neglected to perform his duties . That law has ever since been in force . It was reenacted in 1836 , and again in 1846 , when some of its defects were amended . Courteous as just , she provided by another law , passed in 1820 , that any southern gentleman visiting her territory , might bring with him his household slaves , travel in , through , and out of the State , or even take up his temporary residence as securely in this respect as at home . This law was reenacted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy colleagues here was associated , upon the commission which revised this act , with that distinguished New Jersey Republican , WILLIAM L. DAYTON . In the recent unhappy political contest , New Jersey , ever anxious to do justice to all sections of the Union , and injustice to none , as if hesitating and doubtful toward which of the two parties in that struggle she ought to incline , extended her fraternal hands to North and South , by giving one-half her electoral vote to each ; thus showing that she still retains her unselfish spirit , which leads her to sacrifice her own preferences to her duty to the Union . In the same spirit to-day she bears her full share of the heavy sorrow that rests , like a pall , over the people of the whole country as they witness this glorious fabric , which our fathers erected and cemented with their blood and their prayers  --  trembling , shattered , and dismembered . In the conciliatory spirit of my State , I , as a Jerseyman , proud of the title and every thing connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South in all frankness and candor . I freely tell you that , in my opinion , you have a right to guarantees , and to constitutional guarantees . It is no answer to say that the Constitution has not been broken . That is not the question now . Reference has been made to the fact that WASHINGTON signed the present Constitution . Yes , but when he did so we had a population of but three millions , and now we have a population of upward of thirty millions . Is it surprising that some change should be required in that instrument with this great change in the nation ? The balance of power so long fluctuating between the free and the slaveholding States has at length entirely changed . It has now come to us of the free States , and therefore we are bound to respect the claims of the South , and quiet the apprehensions of its people . It is of little use to make patriotic speeches here . The South demands guarantees , and I feel under obligations to respond to that demand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right is entitled to have it guaranteed . I believe there is not a gentleman here , who , in his heart , does not think so . If it is right for them to have these guarantees at all , they should have them to-day . I do not care whether Virginia occupies a menacing attitude or not , my moral code is still the same ; it is not effected by any thing that has been done or can be done by Virginia or any other State . It is my belief that nineteen-twentieths of the people of the North to-day are in favor of giving to the South all the guarantees it asks against all interference with slavery in the territories . Some say , " We admit this , but we will do nothing until the Republican President is inaugurated on the 4th of March . " I am ready to do it now ; and my obligations to do right will not be changed by the 4th of March rolling over my head . Gentlemen have made eloquent and patriotic speeches asserting their determination not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very pleasant and very proper . But those speeches are the expressions of individuals , and they pass away . Where is the man who will consent to hold any political right at the will of any man or class of men , no matter how kindly disposed ? We all require security . The highest and grandest aim and object of government is not the stability and peace of society , but a well-grounded confidence in the minds of the people of the perpetuity of that stability and peace . The South asks the right to use and occupy a portion of the common territory of the country . As a northern man I will accept the compromise , and I believe a large majority of the people will agree with me . You , gentlemen of the South , have asked that the arrangement may be extended to territory hereafter to be acquired . New Jersey has voted in this Convention against interference with slavery in the territory , present or future , and she is the only northern State that has cast her vote in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that while slaveholding States voted against this proposition , New Jersey was the only free State that voted for it . Well , we accept the responsibility , and will bear it . New Jersey has made up her record . There it stands , and there let it stand forever . We are proud of it . If civil war is to come , if this land is to be deluged with fraternal blood , when that time comes there will not be a northern State represented here that would not give untold millions to be placed upon that record by the side of New Jersey . The fact is , sir , we have acquired our liberties too cheaply . Had we purchased them at the cost our fathers did , by coloring the snows of winter by our blood tracks , and by passing the summers in the unhealthy morass , we should have learned to prize them more highly ; we should be more patriotic and less proud , more sensible and less sensitive . A word further on the subject of extending this provision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that provision ; you do not need any provision as to future acquisitions . You are better off without it . No present rights are involved in it . You are providing for a contingency which may never , and probably never will happen . Would it not be inconsistent for a nation to commit suicide because a constitution is not made to meet an improbable contingency ? You have territory enough for the next two hundred years . You say you require it to maintain your honor , to preserve your fair equality , to maintain your lawful rights . Permit me to say you have no rights in territory which we never owned , and I hope never may . This is no question of honor or equality . But if we should acquire territory and should then exclude you from it , will it not then be time enough to resort to the expedient of national suicide as a remedy for the wrong ? Nor do you require it for any particular purpose . You have within your States room for all the increase of a century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop the wealth and advance the prosperity of your States , and not to send them to the western wilderness where one-half die in the process of acclimation . The fact that you are all in favor of placing in the Constitution new restrictions as to the acquisition of territory , proves you do not consider you need more territory . I heard it said , the other day , by a gentleman from Virginia , that the South wanted the provision for a finality , to end forever this dispute about slavery . With all my heart I sympathize with him in his desire to end this discussion forever . You think you have suffered from these discussions at the South ; so have we at the North . It has separated families and neighborhoods ; it has broken up and scattered Christian churches ; it has severed every benevolent society of the land ; it has destroyed parties ; it broke up the good old Whig party , and more recently sapped the strength and vigor from the Herculean Democracy . It now threatens the dissolution of the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us do it by restricting and defining its limits in existing territory . Suppose the word " future " had been inserted . You do not wish to destroy all probability of the adoption of this proposition at the North . These proposals could not pass Congress , with the word " future , " by the requisite vote ; and if it passed Congress , there is no hope that twenty-five out of twenty-eight States would have adopted it . With it you would have given great strength to the opposition at the North . It would have created a more powerful anti-slavery party than ever before existed . No , you are better off by confining the provisions of this compromise to present territory  --  you having , as well as the North , in the contemplated amendment a veto on the acquisition of territory . The North will want new territory before you will desire it . They will demand Mexico and Cuba for the advantages of trade . You then , having the veto power , can say to them  --  No , gentlemen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there respected ; or , if you please , you may go further and say , We will not acquiesce unless this territory comes in as a slave State so as to restore measurably the balance of power in the Government . With this veto power you would have the North in your hands , and could make your own terms . You make the provision more of a finality by letting it stand as it is . But gentlemen say , they want the amendment for another purpose , in order that they may induce States that have gone out to return . Here , again , I sympathize with you . I had rather bring back South Carolina than to secure the annexation of both the Canadas . I would give more for one American than for a regiment of John Bulls . Ungenerous as South Carolina has been , I would receive her home again . I desire the States to return . Let their place at the Federal Board remain vacant for them . Let the stars of their sovereignty on our nation 's ensign remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive them . But this provision as to future territory is not necessary for their return . The same considerations to which I have alluded , and which , will satisfy you that such provision is not requisite , will satisfy them . The guarantees which the North are ready to give as to the representation , taxation , and return of property , and the compromise as to the existing territory , will do much to satisfy them . To effect a compromise , you of the South must demand as little as you can render satisfactory to your people , and we of the North must give as much as our people will approve , and both parties must consent to avoid all objectionable phraseology . Now , a few words to my friends of the North . There is resting upon us a grave responsibility . We are bound to settle this question finally in this Convention . Talk about a convention of the people ! We who have no constitution , we who are tied up to no technicalities , must settle it . We of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , it is enough to have lived for , if we can settle this question . But one asks , Will you strike hands with treason , and enter into compacts with rebels and traitors ? Yes , sir ! I will strike hands with just such rebels and traitors as I see around me ; and I would give them what they ask as cheerfully and as freely as I would give a glass of water to a soldier returning wounded and weary from the field of battle . But it is said we must first see whether we have a Government . We must try the strength of the Government . We must know whether the Government can assert its supremacy and compel obedience to its laws . Sir , that is just what I do not want to try . What , try the strength of the Government ! and do so at the end of an administration in which corruption and treason and every evil principle have been contending for the mastery , when our ships are all away beyond sea , when our arms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasury is bankrupt , our people divided , insolvency and ruin threatening our country , and all the Gulf States defying the authority of the Government ? No , sir ! this is no time to try the strength of the Government . When we do that , let us select some more auspicious period . But another says these proposals of amendment contravene the Chicago platform . What if they do ? Is the Chicago platform a law to us ? Is it a law to any one ? It was passed upon ten minutes ' consideration in a convention of five thousand people . If it was a law , the convention should have been perpetual and never dissolved , in order that the law might have been subject to requisite modifications without a change of circumstances . A strange manner in which to enact such a law ! But things have changed since the Chicago Convention . In fifty days , fifty years of history have transpired . This is enough to release us from the obligation , if any existed . It is not a law ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the party that it undertakes to enunciate . It is not a law , because a majority of the people have never given it their sanction . Mr. Lincoln was elected by less than a majority . And in his vote how many old Whigs and Democrats may be counted who did not support him because he stood upon the Chicago platform , but because they preferred him to either of the opposing candidates . And even if it is a law , I call upon the North to support the proposals of amendment here submitted . Let us , as Republicans , be honest , and when the opportunity offers are we not bound so to change the Constitution that three-fourths of all our present territory , now open to slavery , shall be consecrated to freedom ? Yes , we are bound to relieve that three-fourths from slavery . All we need to do to secure this , is not to carry slavery where it is not , but to secure it where it is . I can go h//         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
