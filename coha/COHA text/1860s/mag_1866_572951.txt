A MONTII7LY MAGAZINE , DEVOTED TO THE PIIINCIPLES OF 1776 AND 1787 . VOLUME IV. - OCTOBER , 1866. - No . X. THE PHILADELPHIA CONVENTION . WE have heartily supported the President in his patriotic fight with the " radicals , " and we intend to do so to the last moment of the struggle . So far as the Philadelphia Convention can aid him in that great work , so far as its effect may be to combine all the elements of strength against the revolutionary disunion negro-republicans , every patriot in the land must give it his undivided support . Whether such a convention was the wisest pan to achieve the patriotic objects for which it is supposed to have been called , time will show . That the great body of the people who attended the Convention were actuated by the worthiest motives , will not be denied . That many politicians went to it from selfish and unworthy designs , will n t be denied by any who are acquainted with the character of certain of its ndhercnts . Very likely some Democratic politicians supporte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hope of permanently splitting the Republican party ; and it is quite certain that such Republicans as Seward , Weed , and their factotum , Raymond , supported it with the expectation of dividing , or swallowing up , the Democratic party . To suppose that these men are capable of a single impulse of patriotism is a childish and a foolish credulity . Hardened conspirators against the Constitution and laws Ichronic plotters of sedition and treason 1-are they to be trusted with the delicate and sacred duty of repairing the ruin wrought by their own hands ? The only difference between them and the other malignant architects of de . Mtruction is in the quickness ef their sagacity . They see the inevitable fall of the vast temple of despotism and lies which they have reared . With the infallible instinct of selfpreservation , they rush out , and seek some friendly shelter . It is a new party they want  --  a party xviich shall adept enough of their principles to save themselves , so far os possible , from the damning record of their deeds . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Henry J. Raymond is playing a double game of // fraud and deception ? In the whole course of his political career , did he ever do anything . else ? Where is the human being who has in twenty years suspected him of an honest intention ? The blood does not flow in his veins that would give pulse to an honest thought . A " radical " in grain , he even plays conservatism awkwardly . Did lie not in Congress talk for the President , and vote against him on every question vital to his general policy ? He will do the same ag* in . It is not only a great folly , it is almost a crime to trust a man like him where such great and sacred interests are at stake . Do we , therefore , advise that honest conselvatives and patriots should not permit such as him to strike palms with them in support of the President ? By no means . Let these men-nay , let the devil himself lend a hand , if lie will , to deceive his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devil or such politicians as Raymond , and Wed and Seward . Let us try to know the ground on which we stand . And the President owes it to himself and the country to fully understand the source from which his upport must come . rihe strength which must sustain him lies almost exclusively in the Democratic party . There is noth. ing for him in the Republican party . The idea that the Philadelphia Convention is going to split the Republican party is an idle dream . It may pare oft ; here and there , a shaving , hut there xvilh he no splitting done . That party is so nearly a unit against the President , that it is not worth while to count the votes which can he abstracted from it . Personally Mr. Raymond has not the power to carry LOctober* off fifty votes from the Republican party to the support of Mr. Johnson . If he ever takes his own vote to him it will he about all he can do . So of all the other so-called conservative Republicans ; they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole United States to the support of the President that would not have gone to him through the action of the Democratic party . The Democratic party will support him as a unit ; and , if the so-called conservative Republicans are really honest in their split from the " radicals , " they could not , in any event , have withheld their votes from the neminees of that party . To vote against the Democracy would be to sustain the " radicals " The floating mass of voters , who , by intimidation , bribery , fraud , and all sorts of hocns-poczts , have supported the Republican party for the last five years , are already sick of their unnatural affiliations , and were safe enough to go with the Democratic party n support of President Johnson . It did not riced the Philadelphia Convention to secure this vote against the " radicals . " Did it need the Philadelphia Convention to induce such a man as Senator Cowan , of Pennsylvania , to cast his vote with the Democracy in support of President Johnson ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest conservative R ( publican with the Democracy , for the same patriotic object ? Where else could these men vote in such an issue ? By a political necessity the Democratic party was master of all the anti-radical strength of the country . There was coming a political uprising , such as we witnessed in 1852 , when the entire conservative , anti . 578 // Abolition vote of all parties rushed in with the Democracy , and elected Gen. Pierce with such a majority as no Piesident ever received before . It did not need the Philadelphia Convention to start this patriotic popular surge , for it was already started . We pray God that the ultimate results of that Convention may not be to confuse , dis. - tract and demoralize that patriotic up . rising . While it is childish to talk of splitting the Republican party by the Convention , the true point of wisdom is to take care that the Democratic party is not divided by it . Does President Johnson require to be told that , while it is not in the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a hundred votes , it is in the power of a man like Yallandigham to bring to er take from him hundreds of thousands ? Yallandigham represents a mighty mass of people , whereas Raymond represents nothing but himself and his masters , Seward and Weed . By the foolishness of Raymond , Thilandigham was made the sole lion of that Convention . Seven-tenths of the whole vast crowd shouted for him within the walls of the wigwam , and over six thousand people called to tmike him privately by the hand , until he was so exhausted by the popular ovation that he was compelled to sit in his chair while receiving introductions . It is probable that the fuss which a few such charlatans as Raymond made against Mr. Yallandigham may please some foolish people in certain localities , but it has disgusted hundreds of thousands of honest men all over the country . God have mercy on the President if he is to receive only such support as Raymond represents , while he loses that represented by such men as Yallandigham ! If such a catastroplie falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " radicals " within twelve months . That is their sullen threat , and it is not in the power of the squad of men represented by Mr. Raymond to preveLt them from executing it . Had the Philadelphia Convention contented itself with a simple declaration of support to the President in his policy of the restoration of the Union , without attempting to lay down a political platform , and without the belligerent attitude of threatening to turn out any body who supports the President , it might have accomplished some good . And as it is , we do not wholly despair , because we rely upon the steady good sense and patriotism of the masses of the Democratic party to avoid being disgusted and turned aside by the foolishness and vice of Raymond and company . Despite of such men , the President must be sustained by the Democracy . And we wish to impress upon the honest Democratic masses that , in sustaining the President , they do not in any way involve themselves in the company of Weed , Seward and Raymond , or in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Philadelphia Convention . That address is an absurd , self-contradicting piece of patch-work , containing some o : the best and a good many of the worst doctrines ever put forth by a political body . It is a match for Raymond 's life in Congress , with his speeches all one way , and his votes all another . The first half of the address hears the ' unmistakable ear-mark of Weed and Raymond , while in portions of the last part , we think we detect the hand // 1 October , of Reverdy Johnson , with here and there a little patch from some hand more addicted to the doctrines of Jefferson than Mr. Johnson 's . But , as a whole , the address is pernicious ; and , when closely analyzed , is found to be full of principles which , if adopted , would not only overthrow Democracy , but would fix permanently upon our country the worst form of centralization and despotism . But , before we dissect the address , let us pause a moment at the resolutions . The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It says : " Second . The war just closed has maintained the anthorty of the Constitution with all the powers which it confers , and all the restrictions which it impo *es upon the General Government unabridged and unaltered , und it has preserved the Union with the equal rights , dignity and authority of the States perfect and unimpaired . " We have repeatedly shown in the columns of THE OLD GUAED , that the war was a violation of the Constitution-tlat not a single article , section or line of it can be quoted to justify the war waged by the Abolitionists . Even Lincoln did not pretend to justify his first call for seventy-five thousand men upon anything in the Constitution , but upon an old defunct act of Congress , passed in 1795 , to enable the State of Pennsylvania to put down a whiskey-rebellion , raging within its borders . Notwithstanding this act was passed to assist a State to pre . serve peace and enforce the laws within its own borders , Mr. Lincoln , with his india-rubber intellect , found no trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in breaking the peace and overthrowing the laws of sovereign States . Even though criminal enough to wage war upon States , he was not , at that early day , shameless enough to base his action upon any line found in the Constitution . The war was waged in violation of the authority of the Constitution , " and has resulted in the overthrow of that Constitution . The very meeting of the Philadelphia Convention was professedly to snatch the Constitution from the ruin which has resulted from the war That is just the struggle , and is to be the struggle for years to come , to snatch the Constitution from the fearful abyss into which it has been hurried by the war . In order to liarmonise the Constitution with the results of the war , the party which carried it on has been obliged to propose over a hundied " amendments " to it ; and we frankly confess that nearly all these proposed " amendments " are logically necessary to harnionise the instrument with the principle which justifies H*e Federal G overnment , the mere agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If hereafter the war is to be acquiesced in as having been right , then we say , let these " amendments " be made , so that the Constitution may logically agree with the centralized despotism on which the war was conducted . Either the war or the Constitution must be repudiated . Then how can we say that a war which , it is claimed , ties up once sovereign States in an irreparable destiny , against which there is no appeal , but to lie still at the mercy of the sword and bayonet of the central mastcr , which was before only the central ageNt-boxy can we say that such a war " has preserved the equal rights , dignity and authority of the States // perfect and unimpaired . " The politicians who can digest such absurdities must have stomachs like anacondas . A convention of respectable men ought to be ashamed of such contradiction and absurdity . There may be in the man who can sincerely take such a " resolution " a surplus of patriotism , but there must certainly be a great destitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , whatever posterity may say of our course , it shall not say we were a fool . Our love for the Constitution shall also bear the impress of logical consistency . The truth is , we suspect that the great body of the Convention made up their minds to swallow whole the dish cooked for them by a few politicians , who are desperately in want of a " new party ; " but it must have been a sickening dose for the more intelligent and logically inclined " southern guests " to *xvahlow . For instance , take the Iollowing sentence from the opening address " Since the meeting of the last National Convention , in the year 1860 , events have occurred which have changed the character of our politics , and given the United States a new place among the nations of the earth . Our Government has passed through the vicissitudes and the perils of civil war  --  a war which , though mainly sectional in its character , has nevertheless decided political differences that from the very beginning of the Government had threatened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impress deep and ineffaceahle upon all the interests , the sentinients , and the destiny of the liepuhlic . ' To the careless reader this sounds well , but it is full of cloven feet . Let us see ; what is the meaning of " changed the character of our internal politics ? " Why , if anything , it means that the original theory and structure of our Government have been destroyed . How destroyed , will appear in the latter part of the address . And this change , we are told , has given the Uiiited States a new place among the nations of the earth . " What does that mean ? The place of the United States among the nations of the earth was that of a confederation of soverci6u , independent and self-governing States . What is it now ? Why , we shall see that , according to this address , it is now no longer a confederation of sovereign and self-governing States , but a consolidated nation , which has swallowed up all the sovereignties which erected it , and which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a new place among the nations of the earth ? ' and , if it is true , the old Government formed by our fathers is like the dead , whose places , we are told in the wo " * of God , " shall know them no more forever . " Stripped of all disguises , the meaning of all this ilaytnondish verbiage is , that we are now what the " radicals " call us , " a new nation . " We are told that the war has " decided political differences , " &amp;c. ; but how decided them ? By the consent of the governed ? No , but by thb point of the sword . But the consent of the governed is the only way political differences can be decided in a republic , or among a free people . In a country where government is based upon the acknowledged principle of consent , a decision by force is precisely no decision at all . All people have a right to defend their life and property by the sword , but , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed by force that it is not the right and duty of those who can to // Octobcr , change them back again as speedily as possible . Why ? Because it is for the interests of all that the force principl* should not be allowed to stand as a precedent engrafted upon the country . The great anxiety of the Negro-Republicans is to fix the force principle permanently upon the country , and to settle the whole people down in the acknowledgment of the justice of the accursed work of their hands . It is seen by such cunning conspirators as Weed and Seward that the negro party has not the power to fasten the work of this war upon the country as a fixture , and hence their eager desire for a " new party , " which could absorb Democrats of the easiest political Virtue , sufficient to reduce the proud old Democratic party to a point where it will be powerless to tear up the bloody foundations of their late despotic deeds . Unless the Democratic party can be still further divided and demoralized , they know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this land will no longer afford an undisturbed grave for such as they . This is the reason why Vallandigharn is in their way . The " new party " roust be used to fasten doctrines upon the Republic which men like Vallandigham will kick against and help to make odious . These conspirators seek tools , not masters . They want men of putty , not of granite . The first portion of the following extract from the address is very significant : " In the next place , we call upon you to recognize , in their full significance , and to accept , with all their legitimate consequences , the political results of the war just closed . In two most important particulars the victory achieved hy the National Government has been final and decisive . First , it has established , beyond all further controversy , and by the highest of all human sanctions , the absolute supremacy of the National Government , as defined and limited by the Constitution of the United States . " The reader will perceive that there is an uncomfortable fear burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results of the war just closed . " The last sentence of this extract is evidently the work of two minds . The phrase " absoltde supremacy of the National Government is evidently Mr. Raymond 's , or , perhaps , Seward 's , and " as limited by the Constitution " was probably added by Reverdy Johnson or somebody else . But how , pray , can a government be absolutaly supreme which is " limited by the Constitution , " or by anything else ? A government that is limited by anything has no " absolute supremacy. ** This sentence of the address is nonsense , but it betrays th' cloven foot of the arch-conspirator , who is , more than any other , the author of all our country 's woes . The absolute supremacy of the National Government , " which was the fond dream of the old nionarchical party of our Constitutional period , but which was kicked out of the Convention by Madison , and afterwards kicked into its grave with Federalism by Jeffers an , has always been the darling thought of the enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absoluteism that the Abolition war was conducted . It could not stand a moment upon any other ground . Nor can the results of the war stand a single instant after the monarchical idea of absoluteism is repudiated , as it will be whenever the grand old principle of self-government is restored , by a return of the true Jefferson Democracy to power . // Again this address says ' " The war was carried on by the Government of the United States in maintenance of its own authority , and in defense of its own existen6e , both of which were menaced by the insurrection which it sought to suppress . " We detect three mistakes in this short sentence . First , the Federal Government did not carry on the war to maintain its own authority , " for no such authority ever belonged to it . The Convention which framed the Constitution expressly , and by a unanimous vote , refused to delegate to the Federal Government the right to carry on a war against a State for any cause whatever . It was to maintain no legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to enforce a usurped authority , that the war was carried on . Every intelligent member of the Philadelphia Convention knows this to be true . Strictly speaking , the Federal Government has no authority of its own . It has no atom of original powers . Its powers are all delegated , derived , and are the property of the " several States . " It has , under the Constitution adopted by our fathers , no independent sovereiga existence , hut is simply , in a few defined and limited matters , the general agent of independent sovereignties . Properly speaking , it is not a government at all , but is merely a Minister for several self-governing States . When you say that its powers are only delegated , you have only to ask who delegated them , to ascertain where government truly lies . Secondly , it is not true that the war was for the defence of the existence of the Federal Government . There is a wide difference between the existence and the jurisdiction of a government . A government may lose jurisdiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of States , resume their delegated powers , they only take possession of what is their own . The act of resumption does not make war upon anybody . Preparing to ( lefend their resumed powers is not a declaration of war upon anybody . When a State resumes its delegated powers , it simply refuses further jurisdiction of the Federal agency , hut it makes no assault upon the existeiwe of that agency . When South Carolina passed the act resuming the exercise of its delegated powers , it neither made war upon the Federal Goveminent , nor upon any State which wished still to remain under its jurisdiction . When all the southern States withdrew , they left the " Federal Government " entire , standing as whole and perfect in its " existence " as when first made . They went out , leaving the temple as perfect as when they werc all in , and even covering , with its acknowledged jurisdiction , a larger number of States than when it was first made . Not one principle of the Constitution was violated by the withdraxval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that was ever there . They left habeas corpus , the right of trial by jury , protection from unreasonable searches and seizures , and all the rest of the sacred charters of liberty . It was not secession which made war upon these sacred things , which constitute the real life of the nation , but it was Negro-Re publicanism . It was not Jefferson // Davis ; it was Abraham Lincoln . He led the real and the only war against the " lie of the nation . " Thirdly , it is not true , as claimed by this address , that secession was an " Imsurreetzon , " in the popular acceptation of that word . A sovereign State can not be an insurgent , or a rebel . Subjects only can rebel , and the States were never the subjects of the " Federal Government . " But listen further to this address " But we had before the war complete jurisdiction over the soil of the southern States , limited only by our own Constitution . This sentence is both untrue and foolish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch of the soil of the South . It could not even build a custom-house , a postoffice , or light-house , nor anything else , on the soil of a State without first obtaining the consent of the State . Then , what nonsense to talk of " a complete jurisdiction , which is limited by our own Constitution . " That which is limited is not complete . Gompletus is to be filled with , to be verfect This sentence of the address also completely ignores the very existence of such things as State Constitu tions . We count twelve or fifteen other points in which this address is pernicious in doctrine , but we have space left only to remark upon the following closing paragraph " We call upon you in every Congressional district of every State to secure the members who , whatever other differences may characterize their political action , will unite in recognizing the right of every State of the Union to representation in Congress , and who will admit to seats , in either branch , every loyal representative . " Strange to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just and fair terms , the truth that the war has , in no degree , enlarged the powers of the general Government , nor effected any change in the Constitution . But here , in this passage , we have " loyalty " laid down as a qualification indispensible to admission to a seat in Congress . How does this harmonize with the other parts of the address just referred to ? In what part of the Constitution is " loyalty " laid down as a qualification for members of Congress . When , and how have the powers of Congress become so enlarged that it can reject any member for his opinions , or for his political antecedents ? But it may be replied that the Constitution provides that " each house shall be the judge of the elections , returns , and qualifications of its owa members . " But surely this does not give Congress the right to sit in judgment upon the opinions and political antecedents of a member . The Constitution itself happily does not leave this matter in doubt . It expressly defines the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative must be twenty-five years of age , have been seven years a citizen oh ' the United States , and be an inh**bitant of the State in which lie is chosen . A senator must have attained to the age of thirty years , been nine years a citizen of the United States , and an inhabitant of the State for which lie is chosen . See article 1 , sections 2 and 3 . These are the only qualifications laid down by the Constitution , and it is these matters , and the truth of the election returns , in which Congress is the judge of its members . // Of the good or bad opinions of a mernher , it is not the judge . It has just as much right to refuse a member his seat for Methodism , Catholicism , Presbyterianism , Deism , or Millerism , as to reject him because he is what a political faction regards disloyal . A member is sent to represeut the people of his State , and it is to them , and them alone , he is responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The powers of Congress are legislative , and not judicial . What is the value to a State of a representation in Congress , if that body can dictate qualifications not recognized by the Constitution , and which would reject every member that truly represented his State ? According to this " loyal " qualification of the Philadelphia address , it may turn out that the southern States can be represented only by Yankee peddlers , and scoundrally adventurers , who have gone down there from the slums of the North , and who are necessarily and justly despised by a proud and virtuous people . After all , according to this loyalty rife of the Convention , the southern States can be only misrepresea/ed in Congress . Their admi*sion would be only an insult and a cheat . Better a thousand times that they should keep out of Congress until they can be fairly , honorably , and truly represented . The men in the South whom Congress recognizes as loyal are , politically , socially , morally , and intellectually srteales , who have never , as a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position of gentlemen , or even of respectability . All that the address says about the States being still in the Union , and entitled to representation , is insulting nonsense and drivel , while it , with the same breath , recognizes the " loyalty " rule of exclusion . That rule as effectually excludes true representation as any measure proposed by the negrorndical . This address has not one word to say against the illegal and infamous test-oath , which is a perfect bar to representation , as it was designed to be by the Congress which passed it . To keep this question , and qumestions like this , from being discussed , no debate was allowed . It was a dumb Convention , in all except platitudes and self glorification . It did not dare to take squarely hold of the real issues , like men . It walked slyly round them , like a fox looking for a trap . Its action was that of mere politicians , and fell far short of the greatness and manliness of statesmen and patriots . It shoxved a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its councils than it did in restoring States to their representation . We say these things because they are true , and because we believe that no amount of lying is a remedy br our woes ; because the good doctrines of the address are more than neutralized by the bad ones . Better let chaos rule to the bitter end , than to suffer to be engrafted permanently upon the country the monarchical ideas slyly hidden in the cunning verbiage of this address . But , while we utterly repudiate these doctrines of the Conve**-tion , we heartily commend its recommendation for all who are opposed to the " radicals , " to make common cause against their infamous rule . Indeed we are sure they would do so without the advice of the Convention . There is no other course left for patriots and men of honor . We do not believe that // thore is a single Democrat in the United States who will not heartily vote to sustain President Johnson 's administration ; if the so-called conservative Repubficans are honest in support of him , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the same , without seeking to establish political dogmas which are odious to every true Democrat in the land . Our advice then is to throw these dogmas of the address to the dogs , forget if possible that they were ever put forth , ond go in all together to support the President as with one heart and one hand . Our fear is , that the address put forth by the Convention may tend to dampen the hopes and enthusiasm of many of the best friends the President has in the United States . There is nothing but loss and discouragement in the assertion of known falsehoods by public bodies . What , for instance , is the good of such statements as the Jollowiiig " The Government of the United States acted throughout the war on the defensive . " Was this not requiring the southern delegates to subscribe to what they knew to be false ? Did not every northern delegate know it to be false ! From the beginning to the end of the war the South acted on the defensive . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionary traitors , which invaded the South , and forced them to fight not only in defence of their lives , hut in defense also of their spoons , libraries , pianos , jewelry , and everything else that the hand of vandalism could reach ! This is true , and t will he the inexorable record of history . In vain will Raymond and the ither managers of the Convention atempt to obliterate these immortal stains . They are not to be wiped out by resolutions and addresses ! The " little bell-ringer " would give more than his perjured soul is worth if they could . The cunning device of " getting " up a " new party " will never succeed in erasing the damning cvidences of plunder and despotism which have signalized the accession of the Negro-Republican party to power . And let not the public be deceived with false hopes . The attempted so-called conservative lead of Weed and Raymond is an embarrassment , if not an irreparable injury to the President 's cause , and to the country . They have no force to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic party , to say nothing of the impudence , is a slupendous folly . Raymond 's paper shows that he believes lie is managing the Democratic party of the State of New York at the present time , He has taken.it upon him to deny that there is to he any Democratic Convention in the State this fall . If the Negro-Re1mblicans have not another easy victory in the State , it will not be Raymond 's fault . * believe that there is not the slightest doubt that the Democracy will triumphantly carry New York this fall , if those who refused to vote last fall can be induced to act with the party . And the less done by Weed and Raymond the greater the probabilities of success . They have n* strength of their own , and they have left only the power of confusing and scattering , and disgustin* the Democratic strength . The real point to be looked at in all these northern States is , that , while fishin0 for a few phantom Republican votes , we do not lose thousands of real solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
