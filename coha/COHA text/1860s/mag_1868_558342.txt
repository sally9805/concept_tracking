ART . 111. - THE NEW YORK CONVENTION . THE Convention of the Democrats at New York was in almost every respect in marked and direct contrast with that of the Republicans at Chicago . The one , in its nomination for the Presidency , merely ratified the decision of the people , so unmistakably expressed that the action of the representative body upon it consumed barely an hour of time ; the other found itself involved in a struggle which lasted for days , and was finally terminated by a result totally unexpected by the country at large and by the delegates themselves . The one engaged in an animated contest over the Vice-Presidential nomination , which it ifually gave to the man best suited to strengthen the ticket before the people ; the other tossed the second place in its gift almost at haphazard to the first bidder , and by this means obtained a candidate of singular and exceptional weakness with the majority of those whose alliance was necessary to the success of the party . The one adopted with the greatest unanimity , and indorsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pledging support to the principles of national honesty , and denouncing all forms of repudiation ; the other wrought itself into the wildest enthusiasm over the resolutions which most openly favored every scheme that has ever been seriously proposed for defrauding the public creditor . The one , both by what it did and by what it refrained from doing , was successful as a party organization , left few vulnerable points to its opponents , and met the approval of the masses whom it represented ; the other struck a chill to the hearts of its most devoted adherents by its manifold indiscretions , and wrung from the unwilling lips of Democrats all over the country an acknowledgment that great opportunities had been sacrificed by its blunders of word and deed . The Convention met on the 4th of July , in the city of New York . The selection of that day was a curious instance of the subordination of every convenience to the supposed advantage of associating the date of meeting with the national anniversary , - a consideration which could have influence only with * very small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday , // - the day of all the week most unsuitable for beginning the work of a national convention . To this , and to the magnitude of the city chosen as the place of meeting , was due in great measure the unexpected and unprofitable length of the proceedings . Any other city in America would be engrossed for the time being by such a convention , to the , exclusion of the affairs of its every-day life ; New York is so vast that it absorbed the Convention , which was lost in its crowds as the waters of the Mississippi are lost in the Mexican Gulf . The delegates who had been for several days in the city were so scattered that they made no progress toward acquaintance with each other or each other 's views until they met in Tammany Hall . The hotels were too numerous and too widely separated to serve in the usual way as centres for the work of canvassing and consultation , which had to be mainly done during the sessions of the Convention itself . Its bulk was consequently unwieldy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow . Thus the first day 's session of the Convention did not even accomplish so much as a complete organization ; and the intense heat of the weather tending to excite quarrelsomeness among its members , the record was made up of nothing but a series of petty squabbles over the minor points of preliminary business . It soon became evident that the different factions among the delegates were exceedingly jealous and watchful of each other , lest some advantage might be taken by one or another unawares . The most trifling proposition could not be made without an objection from some one , who thought he detected in it a hidden design to effect an ulterior end ; and when , to bring some sort of order out of the confusion , an Ohio delegate moved the temporary adoption of the rules of the House of Representatives , a storm of opposition was at once raised by those who suspected the motion as designed to abrogate the requirement of a two-thirds vote to nominate a candidate , which has for many years governed Democratic conventions . If the Convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session of Saturday , it at least gave its members an opportunity to look at and confer with each other , and the public a chance to see what manner of men had been // intrusted with the destinies of the Democratic party . The benches of the delegates contained more men whose names were familiar to the people at large than the Chicago Convention of the Republicans , which was made up rather from the rank and file than from the leaders of the party . Nearly all the prominent m*n of the Democracy were gathered together . New England , it is true , sent a comparatively obscure set of delegates , and from Massachusetts neither the oldest and ablest member of the party , Mr. Cushing , nor its newest acquisition , Mr. John Quincy Adams , was present . But from the other sections of the country came men who had given their lives to politics , and in one way and another had gained a wide notoriety . The character of their various reputations , however , indicated anything but a homogeneous Convention . Ohio sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union army in the West during the war ,  --  and Mr. Vallandigham , whose extraordinarily malignant demonstrations of hostility to the national cause gained him the semblance of martyrdom by an expulsion from the Union lines . New York sent Mr. Seymour and a bevy of politicians identified with all the intricate and corrupt local intrigues of that State . South Carolina sent one of the Rhett family , which has been so intimately connected for the last forty years with every form of treason against ' the Republic , - and Wade Hampton , who carried his allegiance to the Rebellion so far that he refused to recognize the surrender of his commanding officer . Illinois sent General McClernand , who was a brave , but indiscreet , commander of Union troops in some of the Western campaigns , and who lays claim to " the brains which enabled Grant to take Yicksburg . " Tennessee sent Judge Nelson , that eccentric backwoods orator whose argument in defence of President Johnson in the impeachment trial sent terror to the hearts of the friends and delighted the enemies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army , who commanded the soldiers engaged in the atrocious massacre of prisoners at Fort Pillow , and has never disclaimed the responsibility for their acts . Maryland sent Mr. Montgomery Blair , who during a large part of the war was a member of Mr. Lincoln 's Cabinet . Generally it may be said , that the Northern delegates , with a few exceptions , as in the case of Messrs . // McCook , Blair , and MeClernand , were fair representatives of that wing of the party which during the war violently opposed every measure taken in aid of its prosecution ; and that the Southern members , with no exception , were men who entered into the Rebellion with enthusiasm , if they did not assist in creating it , and who since the close of the war have been active in resisting all efforts for the purification of Southern society from the relics of slavery . On the second day the Convention made little positive progress in its work . It listened to a speech from its chairman , Mr. Horatio Seymour , who contented himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearty laugh at the folly of a deluded champion of the Woman 's Rights movement , who , having failed of any encouragement from the Republicans , brought her cause to Tammany Hall . This lady , Miss Susan B. Anthony , was ushered in with a courtesy which raised her expectations to a high pitch ; but her address , which was simply a written request for an opportunity to be heard in person , was received with great hilarity , and then disposed of by reference to a committee ; whereupon Miss Anthony withdrew in grievous disappointment . It listened with some patience to a great mass of resolutions , which individual delegates offered for incorporation in the platform , and which were never heard of more , - and waited with a great deal of impatience for the report of its Committee on Resolutions , which must precede any action in the matter of nominations . This report , however , was a work requiring both time and labor , and did ' not make its appearance until the morning of the third day . The Committee were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amidst which they found it very difficult to come to a harmonious conclusion . On the critical point of the financial policy to be announced , the principle of the equality of States on the Committee threw the whole power into the hands of the advocates of repudiation . New York and Pennsylvania found it of little use to object , when their votes were counterbalanced by those of Nevada and Kansas ; and all the Southern members by natural affiliation // threw their weight with those who sought to discredit the debt incurred in their subjugation . Thus the resolutions were framed to cover the confiscation of the property of the creditors of the government by arbitrary taxation of the interest of their bonds , as well as its annihilation by the payment of the principal in paper promises already broken . Th* Convention showed no repugnance to this day 's degradation , however , when the resolutions were read for adoption , but greeted the repudiation clauses , unexpectedly positive and emphatic as they were , with a great outburst of enthusiasm . In this the mob of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrations of delight drowned any hope of reversing the judgment of the Committee which might have been entertained by Mr. Belmont and the handful with him in the Convention who as financial experts believed in national honesty as the best and cheapest policy . Another point in the resolutions which excited the *enthusiasm of the Convention , and which was at once recognized as a salient point of positive importance , was the reference to the work of the last two years in reconstructing the political institutions of the South as absolutely null and void . This phrase was introduced into the platform , as its author has since told his constituents and the public , by Wade Hampton of South Carolina . It meant , in his eyes , precisely what it said ; and when he proposed it , the other members of the Committee , the leading men of the party in the North , came to him and pledged their full support to all the practical inferences of the declaration , including the forcible overthrow , should the party come into power , of the State governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the law , and the destruction of all that has been done toward promoting the education of the masses , enforcing the sanctity of the marriage relation , and asserting the dignity of labor . The news that such a declaration had been embodied in the platform came into Tammany Hall before the platform itself . It was caught up as the tidings of a great triumph by the Southern delegates , and passed from mouth to mouth along their benches with expressions of the greatest delight . Against this there was no symptom of objection from any quarter ; and the platform as a whole was // promptly adopted , with a display of enthusiasm at the completion of this part of the business of the Convention which quite equalled the similar demonstration , at the same stage of the proceedings of the Republicans , six weeks before , at Chicago . The Convention then proceeded to the work of nominating a Presidential candidate . The task was complicated in the / extreme . Never before had a national convention met in this country to which so many aspirants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of that circumstance , the Convention spent more time in balloting than any of its predecessors in Democratic annals . There was hardly one of the gentlemen whose names were mentioned who did not entertain some sincere and earnest hope of success . The most acute politician did not venture to predict the result at any stage of the contest ; and those still more accurate astrologers , the betting men , hazarded their money on so many of the candidates , including some of the most obscure on the list , as to indicate still more plainly the thoroughly uncertain issue of the ballotings . The most prominent name at the outset was that of George II . Pendleton . The enthusiasm for this gentleman among the Democracy in some sections of the West was very great ; and had the Convention been held in Cincinnati or Chicago , his nomination would have been easily secured . He found favor with one class as the earliest , the boldest , and the ablest champion of repudiation ; with another as the acknowledged leader of the peace wing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that faction on the ticket of 1864 . His excellent personal character , graceful oratory , and attractive presence were minor claims to regard . But the same things which recommended him to his special partisans made him exceptionally offensive to another class of delegates , who yearned above all things for victory in the campaign , and who looked upon Mr. Pendleton 's opposition to the war and his committal to the greenback theory in reference to the national debt as insuperable obstacles to success under his leadership . Thus the Convention was naturally divided into devoted friends and earnest enemies of Pendleton , the latter including all the // adherents of the numerous other candidates in the field . The supporters of the Ohio politician , well aware of the disadvantage at which they were put by the distance of the place of meeting from their own strongholds , had brought with them to New York a small army of outside retainers , each bearing a counterfeit greenback as a badge , and all charged with the duty of keeping up a great uproar about the transcendent claims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the certainty that he would carry with ease all the States of the West . But this noisy host was at once lost to view in the noisier crowds of the New York streets ; and its presence was not of the slightest service . The firmness and confidence of the opposition to Mr. Pendleton made themselves felt in all the preliminary business of the Convention , and before the ballotings began the only thing in regard to the result which could be counted on as reasonably certain was that this gentleman , great as his strength might be for a time , would not become the nominee of the Convention . But after him no one name rose above the level of the mob of candidates . General W. S. Hancock was the first choice of a few delegates and the second choice of many more , on the ground of his supposed power to attract some of the float . ing , unattached vote which must be secured to control the election . Mr. Hendricks had no original supporters , but much latent strength in the favor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Pendleton 's force . President Johnson had some very warm friends in his own State of Tennessee , and was entirely acceptable to the Southern delegations , who threw their vote almost solid for him at the outset . His prospect of obtaining the nomination was a very slight one indeed ; but he himself did not abandon the hope easily , and his agents were busy laboring for converts and promising patronage and offices as a reward for votes in his favor , up to the very last moment . Several of the States of the East had local candidates of their own , of comparative obscurity , selected and adhered to with a view to having them in readiness for a possible compromise when the Convention should become weary of wrestling over greater names , and when they might be brought forward as successfully as Polk and Pierce // Oct. had been in closely divided conventions of the past . Connecticut presented Mr. English , and there were those in the Convention , on the last day of the balloting , as well as on the first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomination in the end . Pennsylvania put forward the name of Mr. Asa Packer , a man still less known to the people at large , with similar hopes in his behalf . New Jersey , with less confidence , but with equal pertinacity , clung to the name of Mr. Joel Parker . The demonstration of New York in favor of Mr. Sanford E. Church undoubtedly was without any sincere hope or purpose of bringing the Convention to his support , and was arranged and kept up with ulterior designs ; but this fictitious candidacy was an exception . Even the friends of Mr. Reverdy Johnson and of Judge Field had moments of coiifidence that the tide would ultimately turn in their favor . There was only one leader of the party who had emphatically and repeatedly declined to allow his name to be used in connection with the Presidency , and that was Horatio Seymour . But even the list of Democratic leaders did not include the whole number of candidates . Enrolled in their uncongenial company was the name of Chief Justice Chase , who from the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extreme radical wing of that party ; who was identified with every measure which the Democratic party were united in denouncing ; and who had made no speech and written no letter announcing the abandonment of his old views . The phenomenon of Mr. Chase 's appearance in the Democratic councils as a solicitor for the Presidential nomination at their hands , unique as it is in our political history , is not to be explained in a sentence . The advances toward it were most delicately and cautiously made , and in such a manner as to leave very few permanent traces for the guidance of the historian . So recently as during the impeachment trial of the President , the Chief Justice , though he had ceased his former habit of open and ostentatious partisanship , was claimed by most of the more moderate Republican journals as in full commuion with the party . The storm of abuse with which some organs of Republican opinion assailed the Senators who had differed from the majority in the verdict on impeachment // fell with especial violence on the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the court thus assailed , receive the visitation as a transient effect of popular excitement . From that day he began to write short and very carefully studied letters , technically called private , but promptly given to the public , and evidently intended for such a use , mdicating in unmistakable terms his willingness to accept and his desire to receive the nomination for the Presidency as the candidate of the Democratic party . Each successive letter went a little farther than the preceding in guarded expressions of a readiness to abandon , if requisite , the theories with which Mr. Chase and the Republican party were alike identified , ih regard to the necessity of guaranteeing the citizenship of both races in the conquered States of the South ; until at last the Chief Justice announced that he was willing to leave this question to the States themselves , - meaning , in Democratic interpretation of terms , that the white people of each State should decide whether the black people should be permitted to vote . Meanwhile , as Mr. Chase was making these advances on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to induce the Democratic party to accept them . The argument employed was terse and powerful . It consisted simply in the assertion that Mr. Chase 's nomination was the only one which could open to the party a reasonable prospect of success at the polls in November . The Democratic masses , it was urged , would support him in spite of the offensiveness of his record , for the sake of defeating the Republicans ; and doubtful Republicans enough would be attracted by the weight of his name to turn the scale in his favor . These considerations were pressed upon the delegates in many ways . Several Democratic newspapers acknowledged their force . One of the New York hotels was made a rallying-point for the operations of the friends of the Chief Justice , and liquor and tobacco were more freely dispensed in his name than by the adherents of any other candidate . There were plentiful hints that more substantial inducements were ready for those open to persuasion by direct methods . Mr. Chase himself at Washington was in constant telegraphic communication with his supporters in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Republican Senator , was in New York in person , in busy consultation with those leaders of the Convention who were working in her father 's interest . These leaders seemed to feel that there was need for some reticence and secrecy ; and very few of them saw fit to announce themselves at the outset as allies of a deserter from the Republican camp . Of the few who did so announce themselves , and who labored openly and freely from the first for the nomination of Mr. Chase , as the one hope for the salvation of the Democracy from renewed defeat , Mr. Horatio Seymour was the chief . On the other hand , the personal hostility against which Mr. Chase had to contend was quite as bitter as that which beset Mr. *Pendleton . The Democrats who had sincerely opposed the war as an unjust and wicked attack on the liberties of a people struggling for their rights , regarded with intense disgust the proposition to give the leadership of the party to a man who before the war had been the uncompromising enemy of slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so carrying on the contest as to make the emancipation of the negroes a result of victory , and who since the war had not hesitated even on the Supreme Bench to exert himself in every way to confer the franchise upon the freedmen . The friends of repudiation could not tolerate the idea*'of voting for a candidate who himself had created the form of the national debt , and had bound himself by every pledge of act and word for the honest fulfilment of its terms . To these men the prospect of seeing the Democracy defeated and a Republican 1*resident in the White House was not half so odious as that of a nominally friendly administration with which they could have no real sympathy , and from which they could expect no recognition , no aid , no patronage . These delegates were ready for any alternative to defeat Mr. Chase 's nomination ; and it was their determination , their numbers , and their undoubted influence with a large class of the party in the West , that made it necessary for the friends of the Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patience the opportunity which might be counted on when the Convention should be wearied with the clashings of lesser candidates , all alike predestined to defeat . // In all this labyrinth of intrigue , traversed by a score of conflicting interests , the body of the Southern delegates took little part . They yearned for success quite as ardently as any of their associates from the North , but they left to those associates the choice of means for securing it . The candidate must necessarily be a Northern man ; the election must be decided by the votes of Northern States . The gentlemen from the defeated Confederacy had got the platform ; they were willing to be guided by their friends at the North in the choice of a candidate . They cast a complimentary vote at the beginning for the only Southern man whose name could possibly be mentioned to the Convention , President Johnson ; and then they devoted themselves to the cause of harmony , throwing their votes wherever the majority from the North seemed to concentrate , for General Hancock as willingly as for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the formal nominations by the States in alphabetical order were hurried through with , and the business of balloting began . The first calling of the roll of the States , and indeed the half-dozen repetitions of the call which occupied the first day of voting , gave very little indication of the ultimate result . Mr. Pendleton , whose friends , when the canvassing began a few days before , had predicted that he would set out with a majority , had a hundred and five votes on the first ballot , - a little less than one third of the whole number , where two thirds were required for success . President Johnson stood next to him , with sixty-five votes , which speedily dwindled away in subsequent ballots , being cast almost entirely by Southern delegates . The rest of the votes were scattered about in small clusters made up from one or two States each , among the variou* local candidates , and General Hancock . Three hours of constant voting did not materially alter this first development of the state of affairs , and presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed . On the fourth roll-call , the Georgia delegation , which had been casting about among the names already mentioned without much apparent satisfaction , threw its entire vote for Horatio Seymour of New York . Mr. Seymour was not them in the chair , which indeed he left during most of the time of the // Convention to one of the vice-presidents ; and the crowd in the galleries greeted the announcement of the vote with a great shout of delight . The delegates , however , took the matter very coolly , and , had it been persisted in , it is not likely that Mr. Seymour could then have received the nomination . That gentleman at once came forward and with a good deaI. *of emphasis declared that he would not under any circumstances accept the position . He added , that he had repeatedly refused from his own choice to allow his name to be used , and that now his honor demanded that he should not permit it . The Georgia gentlemen and the Convention apparently understood this declination as final , and Mr. Seymour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballot , Indiana , which had hitherto , under instructions , voted unanimously for Mr. Pendleton , asked leave to withdraw for consultation . The reason assigned for this step , when the candidate supported by the State was still slowly gaining ground , standing now at a hundred and twenty , was , that the name of Mr. Hendricks , a citizen of Indiana , had been put forward from another quarter . But Mr. Hendricks had up to this time received less than a dozen votes ; and the action of a portion of the representatives of Indiana , in thus early indicating a defection in his favor , roused the wrath of the Pendleton men against him , and created an ill-feeling which proved fatal to his prospects . It was not until the meeting of the Convention the next morning , however , that the Indiana delegates announced the result of their conference , in giving a divided vote between Mr. Pendleton and Mr. Hendricks . In spite of this ominous break in the centre of his line , Mr. Pendleton continued to gain a little as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballot he stood at a hundred and thirtyseven , while General Hancock had only reached forty-two , and Mr. Hendricks had even a smaller number . Thus far the special local candidates , Messrs . Packer , Parker , Church , English , and Doolittle , had retained at least the votes of their own States . But at this juncture one of the number was withdrawn from the field . New York , after a brief consultation , threw her vote entire for Mr. Hendricks , raising him by this // addition of thirty-three to a higher point than had been previously reached by any of Mr. Pendleton 's opponents , and thus inducing a flocking to his standard from other quarters which speedily carried him still farther forward . The precise motive of this action on the part of the New York delegation is one of those political secrets which can never be made the subject of positive proof . It is alleged , however , and with such substantial support as to leave very little doubt , that it was part of a systematic scheme looking to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to be the choice of a majority of the New York members . His name could not prudently be brought forward until the cohesion of the strong column of Mr. Pendleton had been destroyed . The experience of seven ballots had shown that Mr. Pendleton 's followers were not to be seduced by any attraction yet offered . It was necessary to make a feint in favor of some other candidate capable of carrying away some of the Ohio gentleman 's supporters , but not likely to be inconveniently strong in his own turn . Mr. Hendricks was a Western man , and so answered the first requisite ; he had already incurred the bitter hostility of the Ohio faction , and so answered the second . The result proved , so far as it went , the wisdom of the selection . While a rapid succession of ballotings was effecting only a very gradual modification of the relative position of parties , after Mr. Pendleton had reached his highest point of very nearly half the votes in the Convention and had begun to sink again , after Mr. English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lists , another incident of some apparent significance varied the monotony of the proceedings . A single delegate from California desired his vote , counting one half by the voting standard of the Convention , to be recorded for Salmon P. Chase . At once there was a tempest of applause , not only from the spectators , but also among the delegates , quite as hearty as that which had saluted the financial resolutions of the platform . It was the tribute of the Democracy to the name and fame of the Chief Justice ; and it was the most substantial tribute he was destined to receive . The spontaneous greeting called forth by the vote in his favor showed in some // measure the deep feeling which existed in favor of his nominalion as a step toward success ; but it was also partly due to that love of the sensational and surprising among the lookers-on which regarded a vote for him simply as a bold demonstration , a defiance of precedent , and which would have paid the same tribute to a vote for Jefferson Davis or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an augury of success in the future , and used it to point their arguments as an indication of the popular wish , the managers of the Chase movement were not ready , at this stage of the proceedings , to follow the lead put forth from California . Their mine was not ready for the match . According to their judgment , a serious attempt at this time to press Mr. Chase would have still fallen short of attaining a two-thirds vote ; and the prestige of his name would have been lost by an unsuccessful effort . So they still held in reserve whatever force they ' had organized ; New York went on voting for Hendricks , by that means gradually detaching support from the waning strength of Pendleton ; and the roll of States was called again and again , with a tedious iteration that only the knowledge of some curious intrigue going on beneath the surface made endurable . After fifteen ballots , the Pennsylvania delegation abandoned its obstinate adherence to Mr. Packer , which had already called forth many expressions of disgust from the impatient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had commanded only fifty votes . The movement had something of magnetic in*uence , which the demonstration of New York in favor of Mr. Hendricks had failed to exert . There was in the name of Hancock a prestige of success , and some of the same considerations employed in support of Mr. Chase told equally well in his favor . In spite of his military record , the Southern delegates were well-disposed towards him , from his stand at New Orleans in opposition to the reconstruction acts . Nearly every Southern State cast its vote for him on the next roll-call ; and he was at once carried ahead of Mr. Hendricks , ahead of Mr. Pendleton , up to very nearly half the whole number of votes in the Convention . So strong was the impulse in his favor , that his nofriination was quite generally taken for granted . // Some of the newspapers in the lower port of the city , eager to be in advance of their rivals in enterprise , announced it as an accomplished fact ; and a salute was fired from a cannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in honor of the triumph of Hancock . Had it not been for the movement , as yet not unmasked , in the interest of Mr. Chase , it is probable that either General Hancock or Mr. Hendricks might at this moment easily have been nominated . There was a sufficient number yet remaining neutral , as between these two , to have turned the balance in favor of either . But the preference for Mr. Chase was strong and stubborn , and was yet biding its time . The manifestations of that dangerous element in popular bodies , enthusiasm , in favor of General Hancock , had b*ecome alarming ; and to stem it , a motion was made to adjourn . This proposition , so palpably inopportune at what appeared to those not in the game of intrigue the crisis of affairs , was barely defeated ; and it seemed still possible for the friends of General Hancock to push on over the little interval between their last recorded vote and victory , in spite alike of the open opposition of the Hendricks men and the hidden opposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This mishap came in the form of a somewhat comical quarrel in the Illinois delegation . The chairman of that body chose to interpret the instructions of their State Convention , to " vote as a unit for Mr. Pendleton , " as authorizing a similar vote for any other candidate whom the majority might decide upon . He therefore cast the whole vote of Illinois for Mr. Hendricks , in disregard of the wishes of several individual delegates , who preferred other candidates . One of these dissenters vigorously pressed his protest upon the Convention ; the angry chairman strove to put him down ; half the delegates in the body took sides with one or the other of the parties to the squabble , who stood confronting each other with belligerent looks and words ; until at last the danger of a more unpleasant outbreak was avoided by the only possible expeaient , an adjournment , carried by those who perceived that the Convention had no harmony to spare , and that any delay was better than a scandal which might supply ammunition to the enemy for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrificed . Indirect-. ly , by possibility , the success of the party was sacrificed , and the control of the nation for four years was given to the Republicans . A large part of the night was spent in scheming and bargaining , on the basis presented by the new aspect of affairs . Mr. Pendleton 's supporters , seeing the chances of their candidate destroyed beyond the hope of restoration , determined still to control the action of the Convention , and to bestow the nomination at least where they could support it without the loss of self-respect , and where it would not injure the prospects of their leader four years hence . The managers for Mr. Chase thought they saw their opportunity drawing near , and plied their various methods of persuasion with more activity and openness than ever . The friends of General Hancock found with dismay that the interruption of the tide of enthusiasm in favor of their candidate was fatal , and that already many who had helped to make up his last promising vote were preparing to desert him . A host of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters . The Connecticut men went back to Mr. English , seduced by promises of compromise combinations in his favor , so specious that so eminent a Democrat as Mr. John Morrissey was willing to stake money on the chance that English would after all be made the nominee . Pennsylvania men were sounded on the expediency of returning to Mr. Packer , in case Ohio would set the example of a grand rush in his favor . So many schemes of this kind were contemplated that the Convention met on Thursday morning , July 9th , the fifth day of its session , in quite as confused and uncertain a condition as at any time previous . But matters henceforward hastened to a conclusion . On the first ballot of the morning , the nineteenth of the entire series , after a formal letter from Mr. Pendleton had been read , withdrawing his name from the contest , the Ohio delegation , who were held well in hand by their leaders , and determined to lead , if they could not rule the Convention , tried their experiment of presenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , and still adhered to General Hancock . No other State followed the lead . On the next ballot Ohio took a new tack , giving a part of its strength to Mr. English ; but here // again no responsive enthusiasm in the mass of delegates was awakened , and the movement was abandoned . Something more than the stale device of putting forward an unknown politician to serve as a man of straw in the campaign and in the Presidency was evidently needed to satisfy the Convention and the party . The omission to put forward the name of Mr. Chase at this juncture , when it really might with judicious management have swept down all opposition , is to be explained only on one rational hypothesis . The nucleus of his strength lay in the support of New York . The delegation from that State had voted , in secret conference that morning , Mr. Seymour urging the decision , to give a unanimous support to Mr. Chase at the proper moment . But that moment would not be reached until Mr. Hendricks 's chances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York the day before , should begin to deeline from a falling off in some other quarter . The duty of keeping up the appearance of political honor seemed to demand this delay , since the motive of the manoeuvres of the New York managers would otherwise be too obvious , and a substantial basis would be laid for the charge of treachery which had already been made against them in the Convention . So New York went on casting her thirty-three votes again and again for Hendricks , while her delegates as individuals were busy in obtaining promises in favor of Mr. Chase . Massachusetts , although her votes had hitherto been thrown steadily for Hancock , felt no restraint from any such delicate motives ; and oii the twenty-first ballot one third of the weight of that State was transferred to Mr. Chase , giving him four votes , and calling forth again the clamorous delight of the galleries . The signal was thus given for a gradual rally around the name of the Chief Justice , which should weaken Mr. Hendricks sufficiently to justify New York in quitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole question . But if there were acute and ingenious men in control of this scheme , equally shrewd masters of political intrigue were opposed to them . From the point of view of Mr. Yallandigham and his fellow-Democrats from Ohio , there was everything to lose and nothing to gain in the nomination of Mr. Chase , which now seemed so imminent . They resolved to take the bull by the horns . The chairman of their delegation mounted // his bench in the middle of the twenty-second balloting , and , with a great display of ardor and enthusiasm intended to prove contagious , gave the whole vote of Ohio to Horatio Seymour . The Convention looked on with doubtful surprise . The galleries gave the cheers which they were ever ready to bestow upon anything novel . Mr. Seymour himself at once appeared in the chair , and addressed the Convention . His refusal was even more positive than the previous one . He thanked the gentlemen for their confidence in him , but assured them that by yielding to their wishes he should place the party and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the nomination would make him a dishonored man . Upon some occasions , he said , a man might properly yield to the pressure of others ; but on a subject like this , he must stand to his own opinion against the world . " Gentlemen , " he said in conclusion , with the most deliberate emphasis , " again I thank you ; but your candidate I can not be . " The delegates and spectators generally accepted this as conclusive . But Ohio was fully prepared for the contingency . Mr. Vallandigham himself now arose , and not only declared that his State would not withdraw her vote , but directly called upon the other delegations to indorse it , and to force the nomination on Mr. Seymour . That gentleman did not again come forward . A group of earnest men surrounded him , urging him to make no further resistance to what they represented as the wish of the whole party , and assuring him that the nomination of Mr. Chase would split the Democracy in twain . Mr. Seymour hesitated ; and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed . At first , indeed , the Convention refused to fall into the trap set for it by the delegates from Ohio . Pennsylvania repeated her vote for Hancock , and most of the States which had voted for Hendricks continued their support . When the end of the alphabet was reached , only fifty-three votes had been obtained for Mr. Seymour , nearly half of which were those of Ohio . But before the clerk could announce the footings of the columns , one of the Southern delegations changed its vote from Hancock to Seymour . The example thus set proved contagious . The Convention abandoned itself to uproar ; and while some of the delegates were yet looking in each // other 's faces in wonder and perplexity , the announcement was made that Horatio Seymour had received the votes of every State , and the cannon in the street below began to fire its second salute in his honor . The result thus attained surprised the candidate , the Convention , and the country . It disappointed many members of the party , who had been eagerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who saw little promise of it in the name of Seymour .

It was unacceptable to the more ardent advocates of repudiation , who found no*indications of sympathy with national dishonesty in any of Mr. Seymour 's utterances on financial topics . It was especially unsatisfactory to those who had thrown themselves heartily into the movement for Mr. Chase . On the other hand , it was gratifying to many Democrats , who had an aversion to going so far into the mire of the greenback heresy as a support of Mr. Pendleton would have carried them . It was unobjectionable to those who clung to the traditions of the party , and disliked to go outside its lines for a leader .

Comparatively little thought was given to the nomination for the Vice-Presidency , for which there were few aspirants . During the earlier sessions of the Democratic Convention there had also been held in New York an auxiliary gathering of veterans of the Northern army , called to counterbalance the effect of the similar gathering at Chicago . This convention of Democratic soldiers was perhaps the most turbulent assembly ever known in this country . Its sessions were little more than continuous uproar ; and the slight approach to order at last obtained was accomplished only by the novel device of appointing a sergeant-at-arms to each delegation , whose duty // it was to keep his own neighbors and colleagues quiet . Out of all this confusion proceeded little more definite action than a recommendation to the Democratic Convention to nominate General Hancock for the Presidency , or , failing in this , to give the second place on its ticket to General Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive chair , it was natural that the Convention should revert to this advice ; and geographical considerations having put Franklin , as a second Eastern man , out of the question , the name of Ewing was presented by his friends with every confidence of success . The Convention , however , treated him cavalierly , and manifested its preference so decidedly , that , before the roll had once been called , the name of Ewing was withdrawn , and General Francis P. Blair , Jr. , was nominated for Vice-President by a unanimous vote . General Blair had been a soldier ; but his name was decided on without any hope that it would attract the suifrages of any great body of his comrades of the Union army . He had been a Republican ; but there was still less expectation that his example would be productive of the conversion of any of the less steadfast of his former political allies . He was put forward almost exclusively , at the outset , by the Southern delegations ; and their favor was bestowed upon him solely and avowedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with much violence of expression , he had said that it would be the duty of a Democratic administration , forcibly and in defiance of the majority which might still exist against it in Congress , to overthrow the newly established governments of the South , and restore the old system , recognizing political rights in the white race only . Every member of the Convention who had been a general in the Rebel army spoke in favor of General Blair 's nomination , which they did not scruple to put upon this very ground ; and the Northern delegates speedily fell int* line in support of it . Thus the nomination for the Vice-Presidency was so bestowed as to strengthen the ticket , if any gain of strength in that quarter were possible , among the white men clinging to the memories of slavery and rebellion at the South , and to furnish at the same time a most powerful weapon to the opponents of the ticket at the North , who // appeal to the desire of the people for peace and quiet , and for a permanent settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the humiliating advances of Mr. Chase , although brought about under such circumstances that it can not be considered the deliberate action of the delegates , remains the central point in the history of the Convention . Had the Democratic party responded favorably and placed him at the head of its ticket , even with the incongruous platform dictated by its extreme men , the character of the campaign would have been wholly changed , and it would have been impossible to predict the result . From one point of view it may be estimated that the nation would have been the better for it , since the Chief Justice would undoubtedly have lent some dignity to the Democratic canvass , and have forced the Republicans to act with unusual prudence , while many disturbing elements would have been finally expelled from our politics . On the other hand , it may be thought that the disastrous result of Mr. Chase 's experiment will be productive of good , as teaching a lesson of fidelity to principle , and as illustrating the dangers besetting that ambition which descends to ignoble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
