txt THE author has no other apology to present for offering to the public the following work on " Popular Astronomy " than the marked favour with which his " Orbs of Heaven " has been received , both in this country and in Europe . The science of Astronomy is so rapidly progressive , that to keep the public advised of its advances new works are required almost every year . This may be offered as an additional reason for the present publication . In the preparation of the work I have availed myself of so many sources of information that it would be quite impossible for me to specify the authors or the volumes to which I am indebted . The plan and the cast is all my own . I have endeavoured to follow the path of real discovery , and in every instance to present the facts and phenomena , so as to afford to the reader and student an opportunity to exercise his own genius in their discussion and resolution , before offering the explanation reached by ancient or modern science . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is new ( so far as I know ) , may avail in exciting a greater interest in the examination of those great problems of the universe , whose successful solution constitutes the chief honour of human genius . In a few instances I have ventured to present the results of my own observations , and have occupied a short " space in exhibiting a sketch of new methods and new instruments , which have been introduced into the observatories at Cincinnati and at Albany . THE great dome of the heavens , filled with a countless multitude of stars , is beyond a doubt the most amazing spectacle revealed by the sense of sight . It has excited the admiration and curiosity of mankind in all ages of the world . The study of the stars is therefore coeval with our race , and hence we find many discoveries in the heavens of whose origin neither history nor tradition can give any account . The science of Astronomy , embracing , as it does , all the phenomena of the celestial orbs , has furnished in all ages the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primitive ages its advances were slow ; but by patient watching , and by diligent and faithful records transmitted to posterity from generation to generation , the mysteries which fill the heavens were one by one mastered , until at length , in our own age , there remains no phenomenon of motion unexplained , while the distances , magnitudes , masses , reciprocal influences , and physical constitution of the celestial orbs have been approximately revealed . In a former volume * an attempt was made to trace the career of discovery among the stars , and to exhibit the successive steps by which the genius of man finally reached the solution of the great problem of the universe . The performance of that task did not permit the special study of any one object , except so far as it was required in the march of the general investigation . It is our object now to execute what was then promised , and to examine in detail the various bodies which are allied to the sun , constituting ( as we shall find ) a delicately-organized system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stability has challenged the admiration of all thinking minds , and whose organization has furnished the most profound themes of human investigation . The plan adopted will lead us to present clearly all the facts and phenomena resulting from observation ; with these facts the student may exercise his own genius in attempting to account for the phenomena , before proceeding to accept the explanation laid down in the text . To aid the memory , and to present a systematic investigation , we shall adopt the simple order of distance from the solar orb , commencing with that grand central luminary , and proceeding outward from planet to planet , until we shall develop all the phenomena employed in the discovery of the great law of universal gravitation . With a knowledge of this law the worlds already examined cease to be isolated , and arrange themselves , under the empire of gravitation , into a complex system , the delicate relations of whose parts leads to a new discovery and to the final perfection of the system of solar satellites . Having closed our investigation of the planets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those anomalous bodies called comets , which , by the suddenness of their appearance , their rapid and eccentric motions , and the brilliant trains of light which sometimes attend them , have excited universal interest , not unattended with alarm , in all ages of the world . Before passing to the execution of this plan , we must examine , to some extent , the phenomena of the nocturnal heavens , as the stars furnish the fixed points to which all moving bodies are referred . To the eye the heavens rise as a mighty dome , a vast hollow hemisphere , on whose internal surface the glittering stars remain for ever fixed . In case we watch through an entire night , we find the groupings of stars slowly rising from the east , gradually reaching their culmination , and then gently sinking in the west . A more attentive exami- /z/ nation enables the eye to detect some of these groups of stars towards the north which ever remain visible , rising , culminating , and descending , but never sinking below the horizon . Every star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is found to describe a circle , precisely as if the concave heavens were a hollow sphere to which the stars were attached , and that this hollow globe were made to revolve about a fixed axis , passing through its centre . Indeed , we find by attentively watching , that this hypothesis of a spherical heavens , accounts for all the phenomena already presented . As the stars are situated nearer to the extremity of the axis of revolution , the circles they describe grow smaller and smaller , until , finally , we find one star which remain s fixed ; and this one must be at the point where the axis of the heavens pierces the celestial sphere . This is called the north star ; and the point in which the axis pierces the heavens is called the north pole . The opposite point is called the south pole . Only one half of the celestial sphere is visible at one time above the horizon ; but this spherical surface extends beneath the horizon , and forms a complete sphere , encompassing us on all sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . It is true that , in the daytime , the stars fade from the sight in the solar blaze ; but they are not lost ; they still fill the heavens , as we shall see hereafter , and the starry sphere sweeps unbroken entirely round the earth . These great truths , the diurnal revolution of the heavens , its spherical form , the central position of the earth , the north polar star , the axis of the heavens , the circles described by the stars , were among the discoveries of primitive antiquity , and are matters of the most simple observation . The spherical form of the heavens was soon imitated , and the artificial globe became one of the first astronomical instruments . On this artificial globe certain lines were drawn to imitate those described in the heavens by the celestial orbs ; and as these lines must henceforth form a part of our language , we proceed to give the following Definitions : /z/ A great circle is one whose plane passes through the centre of the sphere . A small circle is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sphere . The axis of the heavens is an imaginary line passing through the centre of the earth , and about which the heavens appear to revolve once in twenty-four hours . A meridian is a great circle passing through the highest point of the celestial sphere ( called the zenith ' ) and the axis of the heavens . The equator or equinoctial is a great circle , perpendicular to the axis of the heavens , and half-way between the north and south polar points . These important lines have been employed from the earliest ages in the study of the heavenly bodies ; and having thoroughly mastered their meaning and position , we are prepared to examine any changes of location which may be discovered among the vast multitude of shining bodies which go to fill up the concave of the celestial sphere . We shall proceed , then , without further delay , to the execution of the plan already laid down . /z/ THE StTN , THE CENTRAL ORB OF THE PLANETARY /z/ DISCOVERIES or THE ANCIENTS .

THE Sun is beyond comparison the grandest of all the celestial orbs of which we have any positive knowledge . The inexhaustible source of the heat which warms and vivifies the earth , and the origin of a perpetual flood of light , which , flying with incredible velocity in all directions , illumines the planets and their satellites , lights up the eccentric comets , and penetrates even to the region of the fixed stars , it is not surprising that in the early ages of the world , this mighty orb should have been regarded as the visible emblem of the Omnipotent , and as such should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the horizon in the earlj dawn , his coming is announced by the gray eastern twilight , before whose gradual increase the brightest stars , and even the planets , fade and disappear . The coming splendour grows /z/ and expands , rising higher and yet higher , until , as the first beam of sunlight darts on the world , not a star or planet remains visible in the whole heavens , and even the moon , under this flood of sunlight , shines only as a faint silver cloud . This magnificent spectacle of the sunrise , together with the equally imposing scenes which sometimes accompany the setting sun , must have excited the curiosity of the very first inhabitants of the earth . This curiosity led to a more careful examination of the phenomena attending the rising and setting sun , when it was discovered that the point at which this great orb made his appearance was iiobjLxed , but was slowly shifting on the horizon , the change being easily detected by the observation of a few days . Hence was discovered , in the primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun is observed attentively from month to month , it will be found that the point of sunrise on the horizon moves slowly , for a certain length of time , toward the south . While this motion continues , the sun , at noon , when culminating on the meridian , reaches each day a point less elevated above the horizon , and the diurnal arc or daily path described by the sun grows shorter and shorter . At length a limit is reached ; the point of sunrise ceases to advance toward the south , remaining stationary a day or two , and then slowly commences its return toward the north . This northern movement continues ; each day the sun mounts higher at his meridian passage , the diurnal arc above the horizon grows longer and longer , until , again , a northern limit is reached , beyond which the sun never passes . Here he becomes stationary for one or two days , and then commences his return toward the south . Thus does the sun appear to vibrate backward and forward between his southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest interest ; for within its limits the spring , the summer , the autumn , and the winter . have run their cycles , and by their union have wrought out the changes of the year . /z/ The length of this important period was , doubtless , first determined by counting the days which elapsed from the time when the sun rose behind some well-defined natural object in the horizon until his return in the same direction to the same point of rising . Of course , these changes in the sun 's place were studied with profound attention . They were among the first celestial phenomena discovered , and among the first demanding explanation . The stars were found never to change their points of rising , culmination , and setting . Their diurnal arc remained for ever the same , and the amount of time they remained above the horizon , depended on their distance from the north polar point . Observation having thus revealed the fact that the sun was undoubtedly moving alternately north and south , a more critical research showed the equally important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place among the fixed stars . This was not so readily determined ; but , by noting the brilliant stars which first appeared in the evening twilight , after sunset , it was soon discovered that these stars did not long remain visible . Indeed , the whole starry heavens seemed , from night to night , to be plunging downward to overtake the setting sun , or rather , that the sun himself was mounting upward to meet the stars ; and thus was discovered a solar motion in a direction opposed to the diurnal revolution of the heavens . From month to month the sun was seen to advance among the stars , and at the end of an entire year , after all the former changes of northern and southern motion had been accomplished , the sun was found to return to the same group of fixed stars from whence he set out ; and thus it became manifest that this revolution among the stars was identical in period with the changes from north to south ; and hence these phenomena had , in all probability , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for solution to the old astronomers . The facts and phenomena were carefully studied , and the reader may now exercise bis own /z/ the plane of the equinoctial. subjoined figure . This is readily seen from the Let AB represent the gnomon , A ' the shadow of the vertex at noon on the day of the summer solstice , and A " the shadow at noon on the day of the winter solstice . Then will the angle A'AA " measure the entire motion of the sun from north to south ; and as one half of this motion lies north and the other half south of the equinoctial , it follows that half the angle , A'AA " , measures the inclination of the ecliptic to the equinoctial . In the earliest ages it was assumed that the sun 's orbit was absolutely fixed among the stars , and that the points in which this circle crossed the equinoctial were in like manner invariable . These points of intersection are of the highest importance . That one through which the sun passes in going from south to north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through which the solar orb passes in going from north to south , is called the Autumnal Equinox . On the day of the equinoxes , as the sun 's centre was then on the equinoctial , the diurnal arc described by the sun would lie one half above , and the other half below the horizon , making the length of day and night precisely iqual . Among the ancient nations the day of the vernal equinox Vas an object of especial interest , as it heralded the coming vf spring ; and its approach was marked by the rising of a Mnrtain bright star in the early dawn of the morning . Now /z/ iii case the vernal and autumnal equinoxes were invariable , the same star , by its heliacal rising ( as it was called ) , would mark the crossing of the equinoctial by the sun in the spring , and the equality of day and night . After the lapse of few centuries it was discovered , by the length of the noon shadow of the gnomon , that the sun had reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make its appearance . Either the equinox or the star was in motion . It was soon decided that the vernal and autumnal equinoxes are both slowly moving backwards along the equinoctial , and thus the sun crosses this celestial circle each year a little behind the point of the preceding year . The ancient nations all seem to have attained to a knowledge of this great truth ; and some of them are said to have fixed the period in which the vernal equinox retrogrades around the entire heavens a period of nearly twentysix thousand years . As this is a matter of simple observation , and as the rate of motion can be obtained by comparing recorded observations , made at intervals of four hundred or five hundred years , we may readily credit the statement that this period became known even anterior to the commencement of authentic history . This discovery of the retrocession of the equinoxes led to a more critical examination of the sun 's apparent motion . This motion had been assumed to be uniform , and in case this hypothesis could be maintained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in passing over the two portions of its orbit north and south of the equinoctial ; that is , the number of days from the vernal to the autumnal equinox ought to be precisely equal to the number of days from the autumnal to the vernal equinox . The Greek astronomer Hipparchus * was the first to discover the important truth that an inequality existed in these two periods . He found , from his own observations , that the sun occupied eight days more in tracing the /z/ northern than it did in traversing the southern portion oi its orbit . This was a discovery of the highest importance , as it seemed to involve the then incredible fact , that the lord of the celestial sphere , the great source of life , and light , and heat , travelled among the stars with a variable velocity . In case the solar orbit was indeed a circle , this inequality of motion seemed to be impossible . The circular figure of the orbit could not be abandoned , neither was it possible , on philosophical principles , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , was presented a problem of the deepest interest , to preserve the circular figure of the solar orbit and the uniform motion of the sun , and at the same time render a satisfactory account of the inequality discovered in the periods during which the sun remained north and south of the equinoctial . This problem was solved by Hipparchus ; and before proceeding to . examine the reasoning of the old Greek , let the student exercise his own genius in an attempt to explain the ascertained facts . Hitherto it had been assumed , not only that the sun 's orbit was circular , and that his motion was uniform , but also that the earth occupied the exact centre of the circle in which the sun travelled round the heavens . By profound study , Hipparchus discovered that all the facts could be explained by giving to the earth a position , not in the centre of the sun 's orbit , but somewhat nearer to that portion of the solai orbit where his motion was most rapid . This will become evident from the figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun 's circular orbit , in which the sun is supposed to move uniformly . This motion will only appear uniform to a spectator at the centre 0 . If the observer be removed to O ' , and the line E E ' be drawn perpendicular to O O ' , the portion E ' A B E of the orbit will require a longer time for its description than the portion E C D E ' ; and hence , in the former , the sun will appear to move slower than in the latter . Indeed , it is manifest that the point V , on the line O O ' prolonged , is the place of swiftest motion , while the /z/ opposite point V is that in which the sun will appear to move slowest . Hipparchus , not satisfied with thus rendering a general explanation of the phenomenon , undertook to determine the actual place of the earth inside the solar orbit , or the value of the distance O ' , which is called the eccentricity . Here is another problem for the examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing how many days longer /z/ the sun remained north of the equinoctial than it did on the south of this circle . This quantity we have already given . By dividing the circle A B C D into as many equal parts as there are days in the year , and by drawing F F ' through the centre O , and perpendicular to V V , we have only to lay off from F to E half the excess in days , and draw E E ' parallel to F F ' , and it will give at O ' the true place of the earth , and O O ' will be the eccentricity . An observer at O ' will see all phenomena actually detected in the sun 's motion , while the circular orbit and uniform velocity are rigorously retained . Having determined the earth 's eccentricity , it was now very easy to calculate the sun 's place from day to day during his entire revolution among the fixed stars . This was actually done by the old astronomers ; and as the computed places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the rude instruments then in use , no further advance would be made in the solar motions . ECLIPSES OF THE SUN . No one has ever beheld the total disappearance of the sun in the daytime without a feeling of awe creeping through his frame ; and , even now , when modern science predicts the coming of these amazing phenomena with unerring precision , a total eclipse of the sun never fails to inspire a certain feeling of gloomy apprehension . What , then , must have been the effect in the rude ages of the world of the fading out of the sun in mid-course through the heavens ? Human genius , of course , bent all its energies to the resolution of the great problems involved in the occurrence of an eclipse of the sun . The first effort was directed to the discovery of the cause of these startling phenomena ; and , this once determined , the second great effort was put forth to so master all the circumstances as not only to explain the eclipse but to predict its coming . CAUSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which the sun might be hidden , it was at once evident that there was but one object in the heavens sufficiently large to hide the whole surface of the sun . This body was the moon . Thus attention was directed to the lunar orb , and it was soon noticed that , while the bright stars and planets became visible in the darkness attending an eclipse of the sun , yet the brightest object in the heavens after the sun , was never visible during an eclipse . The moon was found to move among the stars with a velocity far greater than that of the sun . It was , moreover , seen that the moon 's path crossed that of the sun twice during every revolution of the moon ; and examining still more closely , it was discovered that no eclipse of the sun ever occurred except at the new moon . Now this rapidly revolving globe was evidently the nearest to the earth of all the heavenly bodies . It was seen , when a silver crescent , sometimes to pass over and hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also found that the moon , though invisible during a solar eclipse , always appeared immediately after very near THE SUtf. 11 the sun and as a slender crescent of light . These facts all combined to prove beyond a question that the sun waa eclipsed by being covered by the dark " body of the moon . The cause of the eclipse was thus reached , and it now remained to rob the phenomenon of its terrors by predicting when it might be expected . To predict a solar eclipse with precision is a problem of great difficulty , even with the present extended knowledge of the laws and structure of the solar system . And yet we are informed that the old Greek astronomers succeeded in the resolution of this complex problem . This may have been done by long and persevering care in the record of these phenomena ; for in case all the eclipses visible at any given place are recorded year after year for a period of nineteen years , it will be found that for the next period of nineteen years eclipses will happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that an astronomer , whose diligence had been rewarded by the discovery of this grand truth , might acquire the highest renown among his countrymen and throughout the world by his superior wisdom in predicting the coming of an eclipse , though no special genius was put forth in the resolution of this great problem . " We are not quite certain , however , that the prediction of the first announced solar eclipse may not have been accomplished by the application of powerful thought and persevering observation . In case the effort were now made to predict a solar eclipse ; as a starting-point we know that no eclipse of the sun ever occurred except at the new moon . But at the time of a total eclipse of the sun the moon is interposed precisely between the eye of the observer and the sun , and a line joining the centres of these two great luminaries , produced to the earth , passes through the place of the observer . Hence , on the day and at the hour of an eclipse , the new moon must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun 's path to the other . To render an eclipse possible , two conditions must be fulfilled at the same time ; the moon must be new . and the moon 's centre must be ID /z/ the act of crossing the surfs orbit . If the sun 's annual route in the heavens were marked among the stars by a line of golden light , and the moon 's motion be attentively watched , it will be found that at every one of her revolutions she crosses this golden line twice . The point of her crossing from south to north is called the moon 's ascending node , while the point of crossing from north to south is the descending node . These nodes do not remain fixed , but are in comparatively rapid motion , and finally accomplish an entire revolution around the heavens , on the ecliptic . If , then , we unite all these facts , it will be seen that to produce to any observer an eclipse of the sun , the moon , at the new , must be exactly in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon , the node , and the centre of the sun , form one and the same straight line . Here , then , are the conditions precedent to a solar eclipse . It now remains to so follow these revolving orbs as to be able to anticipate the certain occurrence of these determined conditions . We follow , then , from night to night , the waning moon ; she slowly approaches the sun ; her light becomes a delicate crescent , just visible in the gray twilight of morning , before the rising of the sun ; at length the moon becomes invisible , and when she reappears , it is on the opposite side of the sun , and her silver crescent of light is just above the setting sun . There was no eclipse because this new moon did not fall on the sun 's path . It is , however , easy to mark the time of new moon , and equally easy to see and note the time when the moon is in her node , or on the ecliptic ; and by thus watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see whether the interval from the passage of the node up to new moon is growing shorter , and at what rate it decreases , till , finally , we shall perceive that on the coming of a certain new moon it must fall precisely at the node , and on the day of this computed conjunction : to him who has watched , and waited , and pondered , and computed , the sun must fade away in total eclipse . Such is the train of reasoning and observation which may have first led to the /z/ resolution of this great problem ; but to whose genius we are indebted for this grand discovery neither history nor tradition furnishes any information . In consequence of the near equality in the apparent diameters of the sun and moon , and a slight change in both , due to a change of the actual distance from the earth ( as will be shown hereafter ) , it sometimes happens that the moon 's diameter is less than that of the sun . When this obtains during a solar eclipse , there remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of solar light , and the eclipse is said to be annular . Whenever the moon 's centre , at the new , is not precisely at the node , but not so remote from it as the sum of the semi-diameters of those two orbs , there will be a partial obscuration of the sun . We have presented these facts in this place , as known to the early astronomers , and as admirable means of exercising the power of thought on the part of those who may desire to devote themselves to the real study of the great phenomena of nature . We will recur to this subject again , when we shall have mastered the laws of motion and of gravitation . Such is a rapid survey of the discoveries of the ancients in the study of that great orb , which , from its splendour , even if it be a mere phantom of light , justly commands our admiration , and deserves our best efforts to master its mysterious movements and its sublime phenomena . We now proceed to exhibit those discoveries which could only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great power and delicacy , and with a vision increased a thousand fold beyond that with which he is endowed by nature . DISCOVERIES OF THE MODERNS . The rude instruments employed by the early astronomers sufficed to fix the places of the sun and the other heavenly bodies with sufficient accuracy to give a general outline of the curves they described ; and as these curves , as determined by observation , approximated the circular form , it was concluded that the /z/ deviations from that exact figure were only errors of observation . Knowing the period in which the sun revolves round the heavens , and the distance of the observer from the centre* of his assumed circular orbit , it was easy to compute accurately the sun 's place among the stars on any day of the year . This computation being made , no instrument then in use could detect any difference between the computed place and that actually held by the sun . It was , therefore , unphilosophical to doubt the absolute truth of an hypothesis thus sustained by the best observations which could then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe roughly mere position , and any error of observation in fixing the place of the sun would , in the long run , be eliminated in its effects by taking into account a large number of revolutions . The degree of accuracy required in thus fixing the sun 's place among the stars was widely different from that demanded in the MEASUREMENT OF THE SUN 'S DISTANCE . The principles involved in the solution of this great problem were well understood by the old Greek astronomers , and were applied by them successfully in measuring the distances of inaccessible objects on the surface of the earth . These principles are so simple , that a knowledge of the very first rudiments of geometry will suffice to render intelligible the methods which are employed in obtaining the data for computing the distances of the heavenly bodies . Suppose it were required to learn the distance of the object A from , the point C. From C send to A the visual ray C A , then lay off any line from C perpendicular to A C , and measure its length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and measure the angle C B A. We have thus formed a right-angled triangle , in which the angle at C is a right angle , the base , C B , is known by measurement , and the angle B A is known in the same way ; hence may be com- /z/ , by the simplest elements of trigonometry , the length or the distance A , or the required quantity . Any error committed in the measurement of the angle C B A grows more powerful in its effect on C A , in pro- portion to the number of times B must be taken to measure C A. In our attempt to measure the sun 's distance , we are limited to a base line equal in length to the earth 's diameter ; and hence it becomes necessary to employ every refinement of art to eliminate as far as possible the errors involved in the measurement of the angle CBA , or its complement , the angle CAB , on which , in the application of these principles to the problem in question , depends the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great key which unlocks all the mysteries of the entire system . Upon it depend directly the mass , volume , and density of the sun , the distances , weights , and magnitude of all the planets , and even the masses and distances of the fixed stars . It is for this reason that modern science has spared neither time nor money , neither skill nor ingenuity , in the effort to reach an exact solution of this grand problem . THE SOLAR PARALLAX . In case an observer were located at the sun 's centre , and from his eye two visual rays were drawn , one to the centre of the earth , the other tangent to /z/ angle with each other at the eye of the observer , ana tb*k angle is called the suris horizontal parallax . Thus , S representing the sun 's centre , C the centre of the earth , C R a radius of the earth perpendicular to the visual ray SO , and S R the visual ray drawn to the extremity R of the radius , the angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case it were possible to measure that angle , as the angle SCR is a right angle , the remaining parts of the triangle R S C become known by computation . Thus it appears that the problem of measuring the sun 's distance from the earth resolves itself into obtaining the value of the surfs horizontal parallax , or the angle under which the earth 's radius would be seen from the sun 's centre . No instruments have yet been constructed sufficiently delicate to accomplish directly the measure of this important quantity with the requisite precision . But there is an indirect method , which has been employed by modern astronomers to accomplish the same object , which has been rewarded with satisfactory success . This method we shall now proceed to explain . From the most remote antiquity it has been known that there are two planets , Mercury and Venus , which appear to revolve around the sun , never receding from that orb beyond certain narrow and well-defined limits . The distances from these planets to the sun are less than the earth 's distance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their revolutions pass between the earth and sun . Modern science has confirmed these ancient discoveries , and the telescope has even shown that on certain rare occasions each of these planets actually passes between the solar disc and the eye of an observer on the earth , and appears as a round black spot on the bright surface of ' he sun . These passage ? /z/ of the planets across the solar disc are called transits , and it happens that the transits of Venus furnish an admirable means of reducing the errors involved in the direct measurement of the solar parallax , as we shall now proceed to explain . We will first present the principle involved , and then make the application . Let it be required to determine the distance of the point A from any inaccessible surface , as C D , and that A A ' is the longest base line which can possibly be employed . In case the distance of the point B ' on the surface G D be required , then the angles B'A'A and B'AA ' must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives for a remainder the angle A B ' A ' , or the angle under which the line A A ' would be seen by a spectator at B ' . Now this angle , because of its minute value , may be difficult to measure , and we desire to find some artifice by which this difficulty may be at least diminished , if not entirely removed . Suppose , then , a material point to be located at B , much nearer to A A ' than to C D , an observer at A would see the point B projected on C D at B " , while an observer at A ' would see the same point projected at B ' . Now let us suppose that the points B ' and B " can be identified and seen as round , black , permanent spots on the remote surface C D ; in case B is further from C D than from A A ' , it is clear that the visual angle subtended by B ' B " , as seen from A , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having an apparent diameter of 32 ' 1 " , must have a real diameter of no less than 882,000 miles in length , or more than 111 times longer than the diameter of our earth , as we shall hereafter see . This enables us to compare the bulk or volume of these two globes , and we find that it would require no less than 1,384,472 globes as large as the earth to fill the vast interior of a hollow globe as large as the sun . This is a comparison of bulk only j the relative weights of the earth and sun must be considered hereafter . If this wonderful globe excited our admiration by the splendour of its surface , and its floods of light and heat , how must this admiration be increased when we contemplate its great distance and its gigantic proportions ? THE PHYSICAL CONSTITUTION OF THE SUN . But for the aid derived from the telescope , man could never have passed beyond mere conjecture as to what lies on the surface of the sun . The telescope , however , magnifying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the distance separating him from the solar orb , and plants him in space within 95,000 miles of the sun 's surface , there to examine the phenomena revealed to his sight by this magic tube . We may , therefore , regard the sun 's distance as reduced to the thousandth part of its actual value ; and we should riot be suprised to find upon a globe of such grand proportions fluctuations and changes which , at this reduced distance , may become distinctly visible . This anticipation has not been disappointed .
