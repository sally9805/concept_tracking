txt Lord BROUGHAM delivered an elaborate address a t the opening of the Seventh Annual Meeting of the National Association for the promotion of Social Science at Edinburgh , on Oct . S. In the course of his speech he made the following reference to the Mexican expedition , and American topics in general ; " A great , and but for its success , a very unpopular expedition has resulted in the occupation of Mexico by the French Government , and the foundation of a monarchical regime , nearly upon the principles adoptea in France , both as regards the power of the Crown and the rights of the people . It is impassible to question the advantages derivable from the change by the Mexicans , who for so many years bad suffered all the evils of alternate anarchy and the violence and plunder of petty tyrants . Nor can any friend of humanity and of peace begrudge the influence acquired by France , or cavil at the use made of it In favor of Austria . The peace of the Continent is furthered by whatever brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * But the establishment of French influence In Mexico is likely to produce an uneasy feeling in the now unhappily dis-United States of America , and may by no remote possibility lead to an amicable intercourse with the South , not perhaps against the North , but in formal recognition of the secession , and in breach of the blockade . The friends of humanity would have good cause for lamenting anything so manifestly tending to promote the continuance of the war , ana extend its mischiefs . The term civil war Is now hardly applicable to this miserable contest . The people of the South are banded against those of the North exactly as any two European nations , differing in all respects save language , have been banded against each other  --  the Austrians and Prussians , for example . But give it what name we may , no one can doubt that it 18 a cruet calamity to the Americans themselves , and , though in a much leas degree , to the rest of the world , which with one accord , joins In reprobating their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , seeks to cast on the other the heavy blame of breaking the peace . On one side is the wicked allegation of property in human Wings ; on the other , the hollow pretext of making war to free American Slavery , ? her shame and her curse , as all except slaveowners admit it to be . Hollow we may call it , for those who proclaimed emancipation confess that it was a measure of hostility to the whites , and designed to produce slave insurrection , from which the much-enduring nature of the unhappy negro sit ' ed the country . My esteemed friend , the prelate who exalts by his eloquence and his virtues the name of WILBERFORCE which he inherits , declared that the authors of the measure cured as little for the blacks ' freedom as for the whites ' ; and now they call for extermination of the one race to liberate the other . But , whatever may have been the proximate cause of the contest , Its continuance is the result of a national vanity without example and without bounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it is an ordinary expression respecting him who is without the weakness , that he is too proud to be vain . But when a people are seizes with it , they change the name , and call it love of glory . Of the individual we often hear the remark that , despicable as the weakness is , it leads to no bad actions . Nothing can be more false . It leads to many crimes , and to that disregard of truth which is the root of all offences . Certainly it produces none of the worst crimes . The man who is a prey to vanity thirsts not for the blood of his neighbor . How fearfully otherwise Is it when a nation is its slave ! Magnifying itself beyond ail measure , and despising the rest of mankind  --  blinded and intoxicated with self-satisfaction  --  persuaded that their very crimes are proofs of greatness , and believing that they are both admired and envied , the Americans have not only not been content with the destruction of half a million but been vain of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among nations for their extent ot territory , they exulted in the wholesale bloodshed by which it must be accomplished , because others were unable to make such a sacrifice . The struggle of above two years , which loosened all the bonds which hold society together , and gave to millions the means of showing their capacity , has , produced no genius , civil or military ; while the submis3ion to every caprice of tyranny had been universal and habitual , and never interrupted by a single act of resistance to the most flagrant infractions of personal freedom . The mischiefs of mob supremacy have been constantly felt ; for the calamity of rational and respectable men keeping aloof from the management of affairs has resulted in the tvraiiny of the multitude . To this tvrant , /he nominal rulers have never withheld their submission ; and the Press , catering for the appetites of the populace , and pandering to their pusMons , has persisted in every misrepresentation which might most disguise the truth as to passng events , exaggerating each success , extenuating each defeat , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth by chance reached them , were one day sunk in despair , another elated to ecstacy , almost at the pleasure of their rulers and their guides . Nor were the falsehoods thus propagated confined to the event of the war ; they extended to all things  --  to the measures of the Government and the acts of foreign nations . The nubile feeling must not be thwarted ; the people desired to hear whatever gratified their vanity or raised their spirits ; and in this delusion must they live as long as the war lasts and the rule is in the hands of the mob . The truth they will never hear , because they desire to hear what is pleasing and not what is true . But it would be a great mistake to charge on tacit false guides the follies and the crimes which they chime in with and do their best to perpetuate . The people are determined to their course . Far from feeling shame at the cruel scenes which modern ages ? nay , which Christian times  --  have seen nothing to equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost to incredulity  --  they actually glory in it as a poet ' of their higher nature , believe themselves to be the envy as the flower of mankind , and fancy that their prowess would triumph over the most powerful States of Europe ! In such illusions their chiefs may nut practically join , hut the people are , beyond doubt , a prey to them , and will continue so to the end , Hear the just law , the . iudgment of the skies , They that hate truth shall be the dupes of lice ; And if they will be cheated to the last , Delusion strong as hell shall bind them fast . " The feeling toward England which prevails a meg the American people , though arising from the excess of national vanity , and its kindred envy , is certainly In part the remains of the old quarrel that led to the separation . We are hated and deshised ; neither eling is at all reciprocal , but e.mong our kinsfolk it lu crerls in a degree almost amounting to mental alienation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient grudge of the American war ; and it illustrates the soundness of the view taken by those who have most considered the great subject of colonial policy . that we must so govern our settlements as to prepare for a separation on friendly terms , always assuming that sooner or later their growth will bring about their independence . Some distinguished men in the literary as welt as political wort. have lately maintained the opinion that our colcnics are only a burden and that they 7ivr us no ben.lits worth the expense they entail . This is a great el ror. and it is not now for the first time that I so describe it . Sixty years ago , while residing here , I published a work in which the whole sabjf et % as lolly examaicd all its branches , and a demonstration given of the benefits  --  political , social and commercial ? of colonial establishments , % RI ; detailed sroofs that their cost falls tar ? port of their benefits , and that the wars ascribed to them had another origin . The book was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to allow a second edition . It might vow , however , pe of some use , as the information contained respecting the colonies of all nations ought to be more generally diffused . The lapse of sixty years has no doubt made great changes , and the work is to be viewed as historical with regare to the facts ; but the uteitrines have been confirmed by all that has hapote ; ed ; they are entirely applicable to the present state of affairs , and are moat worthy of attention from the promoters of social science . Ills lordship then briefly passed in review the progress made by our colonies in the last sixty years , anq what has been tone in : he way of emigration , and then turned to the consideration of topics ot general interest only .
