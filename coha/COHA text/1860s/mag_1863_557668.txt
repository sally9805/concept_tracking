Nineteen Annual Reports of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Company of Boston . 1844 - 1862. 8vo. pp. 158 . TuE business of life insurance in this country , which can hardly be said to have existed a quarter of a century ago , has suddenly assumed great extent and importance . Before 1840 , the only company in New England , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed for this purpose , was the Massachusetts Hospital Life Insurance Company , an admirably managed institution , having the control of very large fui*ds , but insuring very few lives , for the excellent reason that its charter compelled it to contribute one third of the profits derived from this source to the support of the Massachusetts Hospital , and of course very few persons were willing to pay fifty // per cent more for a policy than it was actually worth , even though the addition to the natural price was a contribution to a very deserving charity . But in 1844 the New EnglandMtitual Life Insurance Company , chartered in 1837 , commenced business in Boston ; and at about the same time several othci companies were established on similar principles in New York , New Jersey , and Connecticut . Through the activity of these companies the peculiar nature of life insurance , and the inducernents for effecting it , were made generally known ; and the consequence was , that the business immediately began to grow with astonishing rapidity , and soon far surpassed the expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly enlarged , and is even now increasing every year , in the hope of sharing this great wave of prosperity . The statistics of the husiness for the whole country have not yet been collected ; hut it appears from the Annual Report of the Insurance Commissioners of Massachusetts , dated January 1 , 1863 , that " the amount insured by the twenty-four Life Insurance Companies five chartered by Massachusetts and nineteen by other States now legally doing business in this Commonwealth , falls very little short of two hundred millions of dollars in more than seventy-five thousand policies . " " These companies hold cash funds , from premiums and interest thereon , to the amount of over $ 20,000,000 . Their cash income during the last year exceeded $6,000,000 , and they paid more than $ 2,000,000 for losses by death . Notwithstandin* the agitation of the times , their business has continued rapidly to advance during the year . The amount of policies issued by these companies , from November 1 , 1861 , to November 1 , l862 , . was over $ 38,000,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as doin business here the previous year made a net increase last year of $ 13,000,000 in the amoun* insured , against a net increase of $ 2,000,000 in the year before . " - Report , p. iv . But this great financial success is not to us the most interesting feature of the business . We look rather at its moral than at its commercial aspect . As an institution admirably adapted to develop habits of prudence , economy , and forethought among all classes in the community , and especially among those who have most need to practise these virtues , fitted // also to alleviate and to render less numerous the si*d en and distressing alternations of fortune that are unhappily so common in our community , to take away from families at least one pang caused by the death of a father , brother , or son on whom many were dependent , to promote family affection and to lessen family anxieties , to increase the willingness to *ssist by loans industrious and energetic young mcii who require a helping hand only at the outset , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and private charity , we know not ny recently organized undertaking which so richly deserves to be fostered and carefully guarded as this same business of insuring lives . Strictly speaking , it is not at all a commercial enterprise undertaken for the purpose of profit . Seldom elsewhere , and never in this country , except for a short period at its outset , and as a means of overcoming the first difficulties of its establishment , has a Life Insurance Company been based upon an independent capital , the owners of which must have their dividends . It is an association open to all , in which no one pays anything more than the exact cost of the benefit which he receives . The insured constitute the company , its accumulations are theirs , its success is theirs , and the ostensible managers and directors are only their agents and trustees , empowered to invest and protect the funds for their benefit . With a fair degree of economy and skill , as we shall have occasie. to show , even the expenses of management can be reduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common in the best-conducted Savings Banks . The comparison here suggested is an instructive one , and has been frequently pursued . A Life Insurance Company is a Savings Bank in this respect , that the sum annually paid into it by each of the insured is not so much money expended by him , but so much saved , and invested by him at cornpovnd interest , for the future benefit , generally of his family , but sometimes of himself or of his creditor . He can himself determine at the outset to which of these three the sum with all its accumulations shall ultimately be returned . Thus far , then , the two institutions are precisely on a par ; the one offers just as much encouragement to frugality and forethought as the other ; and the two are equally beneficial to the community , // in that , by bringing together many small sums , it renders their aggregate , as one large amount , practically available as capital in great commercial and manufacturing enterprises , while , if taken singly , they would be nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they economize and preserve the water which as mere drops of rain would be wasted . In every other respect , - that is , in all respects in which a Life Insurance Company differs from a Savings Bank , - the difference , both in a moral and an economical point of view , is to the advantage of the former . The savings successively deposited in the latter are , at best , varying sums , generally the results of immethodical economy , which may also all be withdrawn at any moment , as suits the caprice , the temptations , perhaps the returning disposition to extravagance , of the depositor . Hence , though the institution encourages frugality , it does not tend to form the habit of frugality , which is the greater good of the two . He who has merely put his savings into a bank can at any time become a spendthrift and waste the whole of them ; at best , there is no pressing call upon him to economize and deposit an equal sum in each succeeding year . But he who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own control ; he can not withdraw them , except at the stipulated time , and under the stipulated circumstances ; and the time and circumstances thus stipulated are precisely those in which the repayment of the accumulated sum will be most welcome to him , or to those dearest to him for whose sake he first made the investment . One can no more take back by caprice the savings thus originally devoted to a sacred purpose , than he can withdraw at pleasure the sums already laid out upon the education of his children . Many of us well remember the little closed box with a narrow slit in its cover , with which old-fashioned parents strove to cultivate the habit of frugality in their children by teaching them to deposit in it , out of their own reach , their little savings from pocket-money , the teacher secretly adding from time to time to the little hoard , and thus , after some months or years , when the treasury was forcibly opened , creating astonished delight at the magnitude of the sum disclosed , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy . The // 1863.1 lesson was a homely one , yet so wise a philanthropist as Dr. Franklin would have cordially smiled upon it , as a useful invention quite in his own way . Such a box is a Life Insurance Company , yet with this important difference . The box tended to make children frugal , but equally , it must be confessed , . did it tend to make them selfish ; the Life Insurance , when effected , as it usually is , for the sole benefit of one 's family , is almost the only purely disinterested mode of saving . It is such frugality as can benefit him who practises it only when he appears at the last great reckoning ; and as such , it may win the praise even of the Great Teacher , who applauded the poor widow when she cast her two mites into the treasury . Meanwhile , forethought and the habit of continuous and methodical frugality are best promoted by the necessity , to which every one who insures his life subjects himself , of depositing an equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forfeiting , if he fails to do so , a great part of what he has already invested . This penalty is not unreasonably severe , being in fact just enough to confirm the good resolution one has formed of practising systematic economy for the future . The liability to it is the price , and not a high price , which one pays for his admission into a fraternity of persons who re resolutely and methodically frugal , and who therefore can not afford to share the common fund of their savings equally with others who are economical only for a time , or by fits and starts . A mechanic at the age of twenty-four - just about the time when he usually thinks of marrying - can insure his life for * 2,000 by engaging to pay a net premium each year of only about twenty-six dollars . True , the actual payment required of him is nearly forty dollars ; but as we have said , he is required to pay only the cost of the insurance ; and as the experience of our largest companies , continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at present exceed twentysix dollars , the difference of fourteen dollars is sooner or later returned to him in the form of a dividend . If it be said that this young mechanic can not prudently bind himself to put aside every year , out of his own reach , even this small sum , the answer is , that he certainly can not in prudence bin himself to support a wife and children . Nay , the surest means of // really fulfilling this last obligation , of actually providing for his intended family , is to effedt this very insurance . We thus come to a consideration of that distinctive feature of Life Insurance in which consists its great superiority over all other modes of providing for future welfare by present frugality . For those who can make but moderate savings each year , what security is there that they will live long enough to accumulate a sum sufficient for their purpose ? Premature death may frustrate the best-laid plans and the firmest resolutions of economy . " Pallida Mors a*quo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas IRegumque turres Vita* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King of Terrors will not allow time enough for the litti hoard in the Savings Bank to reach an amount sufficient to protect a widow and orphan children against pinching want ; and the consciousness of his approach will be made doubly painful by the thought that distressing poverty must soon augment the sorrows of the bereaved family . Life Insurance is the means , the only means that has ever been invented , of obviating this fearful hazard , of removing LIFE , so far as pecuniary calculations for the future are concerned , from the class of contingencies , and placing it in the class of certainties . If the young mechanic should deposit his twenty-six dollars a year in a Savings Bank , and then should die within five years , his family will have , calculating at five per cent , less than $ 150 , - hardly enough to pay his funeral expenses and to support them even for the next three months ; if lie should die at the end of ten years , they will have only about $ 850 . But if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurance , then , though he should die within five years - within one year - even within a week from the time of the first payment , his family will receive $ 2,000 ; and if his death should take place only at the end of twenty years , this fixed sum of $ 2,000 , still payable at his death , will be more than twice as large as the amount which a Savings Bank could pay if it had received from him the same annual payments which we have supposed him to make for Life Insurance . The results of this comparison seem , at the first glance , // almost too favorable for belief . We can hardly see how it is possible for an association , in return for an agreement made by a person twenty-four years old to pay them twenty-six dollars a year as long as he lives , to covenant that they will give $ 2,000 to his surviving relatives immediately after his death , whether that death take place in six months or in sixty years . We should suppose that an association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become bankrupt , or find its funds exhausted , in a very few years . Yet not only the most precise calculations , but actual experience , as shown by the statistics which we have just given of the very flourishing condition of the Life Insurance Companies established here during the last twenty years , and by which seventy-five thousand similar contracts have been formed , prove that the thing can be done , and has been done . There is really no element of uncertainty in the case , provided the company can obtain business enough ; for while it is demonstrably safe for an institution to contract ten thousand such engagements , it would be extremely hazardous for it to continue operations if it could form only a few hundred of them . As this is a point of great importance , we shall recur to it afterwards . Meanwhile , our readers may accept from us on trust this aphorism , which we hereby bind ourselves subsequently to demonstrate - Among equally well-managed Life Insurance Companies , that is the safest , the cheapest , and the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing , the largest amount of business . A little reflection will show how these very favorable results are obtained . Persons who take out policies in a lUiutual Life Insurance Company really form themselves into a fraternity on this principle , - that each will contribute annually to the common fund a small fixed sum during his whole life , be it longer or shorter ; and this common fund shall be divided , in proportion to their annual payments , among their respective families , however unequal may be the terms of life which God may grant them . Suppose , for the sake of clearness , that only two persons form such a fraternity on equal terms , and that one of them survives its formation only one year , so that he makes but one of these annual payments , while the other lives // long enongh to make forty-nine annual payments ; still , asthe fund by agreement is to be divided equally , *e family of him who dies first will receive half of the whole , or twenty-five of these payments with their accumulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , will receive only the same amount , being the other half of the common fund . This is the whole secret of Life Insurance : - those who live longer than the average duration of life make up , by the consequent excess of their contributions to the common fund , for the deficiency of those who unfortunately live less than this average . It is just our Saviour 's parable acted over again , - " These last have wrought but one hour , and thou hast made them equal unto us , which have borne the burden and the heat of the day . " The members of a life-insuring fraternity make one another sure of obtaining the average duration of human life , so far , at least , as the results of their annual savings are concerned . To recur to the case of our young mechanic : - though he should die within the year , and therefore after contributing only twenty-six dollars to the fund , the Company is able to pay his heirs two thousand dollars , because experience proves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average , thirty-eight years longer ; and twenty-six dollars a year for thirty-eight years , accumulating at compound interest , even after paying liberally for expenses of management , amounts to more than two thousand dollars . Of course , many of those insured at twenty-four years old will die before they are sixtytwo years of age ; but the deficiency thus caused will be compensated by those who attain a greater age than sixty-two , so that the whole number of annual payments into the fund will be just the same as if all the insured lived to be sixty-two , and no longer . From a table in one of the volumes now before us , we learn that , out of 90,514 persons taken at the age of twentyfour years , 50,495 , or considerably more than half , lived to be more than sixty-two , and 35,816 to be more than seventy. * Observe that the probable duration of life , or the period to which just half the number of pcrsons who are alive at any given age will probably attain , differs considerably from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages of the same individuals . Thus , according to the table which we have used above , the probable duration of life for those who are now twenty-four years old will be to sixty Everything // in the science of Life Insurance evidently depends on determining with great accuracy the average duration of human life , reckoning not merely from the time of birth , but from any age at which persons may wish to become insured . It is not usually desired to effect insurances on those who are under fifteen , or on those who are over sixty years of age . Within these limits , the problem may be regarded as solved with all needful precision ; for an immense body of information has been collected , and statisticians and mathematicians have been employed in working over the data thus obtained for more than half a century . The great quarto volume by Mr. Neison , an able mathematician , who is Actuary of a Life Insurance Company in London , is filled with curious information and elaborate computations on this subject . On the whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said to have ceased to be a problem in science , and to have become only a matter of book-keeping . With the facilities that have been furnished , an ordinary clerk is able to make all the necessary calculalions , and to acquire a thorough understanding of them . But some popular fallacies on the subject need to be removed . Time average duration of life , reckoning from any given age , is usually called the Expectation of Life for all persons of that age . And so it is for a Life Insurance Company , which has insured perhaps two thousand different persons at this age . Such a company may reasonably expect - nay , may be morally sure - that the two thousand or more will , on an average , live just about the number of years that is called their " expectation of life . " But they can not expect - it would be the height of folly to imagine - that any one person out of that number will live to that " expected " age . The expectation is deduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore is worth nothing at all for any one case ; for the individual cases , which are the extremes , may five years , for then only will their number , 90,514 , be reduced to a little over 4*,000 , or just half its former amount . Up to the age of sixty , at least , the " average " will always be less than the " probable " duration , as most of the 50,000 who survive sixty-two must survive it hy a shorter period than that by which the 40,000 who die earlier fall short of sixty-two . The office which insures lives , as it must look only to the average number of annual payments , must always take for its rule the average and not the " probable duration of life . // differ from each other ever so little or ever so much ; and yet the average will remain the same . If five persons , each fifty years of age , survive that age respectively two , four , six , eight , and ten years , the mean or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and this , as determined by these few cases , would be the " expectation of life " for persons who are fifty years old . But it is obvious that no one person , now aged fifty , is any more likely , or has any better ground to expect , to live six years longer , than to live only two years or ten years . The chances are equal for either of these three contingencies . A perfectly definite and well-established rule for the mean or average of a great number of cases affords no " ground of expectation " whatever for any one of these cases . But a mean or average duration of life , as determined by a great number of cases , is a perfectly sure " ground of expectation on which a company can insure lives , provided it insures lives enough . As it is obvious that the rule , if a sound one , must be derived from a great multitude of cases , so also , in order to be safely used , it must be applied to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just given - the average duration of life at fifty years , as determined by . the best tables derived from a vast number of cases , is a little less than twenty-one years ; but though this is a perfectly good bround of expectation " for five thousand cases , it is no ground of expectation " at all for five cases , and very little ground " even for fifty cases ; for it may very well happen that any five , or even any fifty cases , may all fall far short of the average , or may all greatly exceed the average . And here is the first reason - and it is an exceedingly strong one - why persons wishing to insure their lives should go into a company that has done and is doing a very large business , rather than into one which has issued comparatively few policies . For in the latter case it is a mere lottery whether the company will be solvent or not , since it may very well happen that the few cases which it has insured will all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a severe epidemic , like that of the Asiatic cholera , would make the insolveiicy of the company morally certain , so that the insured might lose a great // 311 LT FE INSURANCE . part of their investment . But such an occurrence would have very little effect on a company that had insnred ten thousand lives ; it would not diminish its large available means more than three or four per cent . And even this contingency , as we shall see hereafter , is fully guarded against by such a company . But there is another reason for preferring a large company to a small one . Though the insured in a mutual company pay only the actual cost of their insurance , the expenses of management - such as the rent of the office , the salaries of the officers , and the compensation of the agents - form a portion , and quite a considerable portion , of this cost . Now it is evident that these expenses of management are relatively much greater for a small or young company than for a large and old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts Insurance Commissioners demonstrates this position . Taking the five largest companies therein reported , all of which have existed at least sixteen years , and which already insure on an average over fifty-four millions of dollars each , we find that the mean ratio of their expenses to their annual receipts is between nine and ten per cent . But taking the five smallest companies , which insure on an average only about three millions each , we find this mean ratio is nearly forty per cent . But as this comparison would be hardly a fair one , since most of these companies are very young , and the expenses of the first year are always disproportionately large , we will take rather the five smallest companies that have been at least ten years in operation ; and we find that their expenses of management average almost exactly twenty-five per cent of their receipts in other words , their expenses are relatively two and a half times heavier than those of the larger companies . The cost of insuring one 's life in them is fifteen per cent more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a large association . We submit that we have now fulfilled our pledge , and demonstrated that , among equally well-managed Life Insurance Companies , that which has done and is doing the largest business is at once the safest , most economical , and best . The most skilful management can not relieve the operations of a small company from great hazard ; and its expenses must be // relatively so heavy , that full one seventh of the cost of insuring lives in it is really thrown away . Moreover , the risk of mismanagement , peculation , and fraud by some of its officers or agents is relatively much greater , as its operations can not have so much publicity , and can not be overlooked by so large a number of deeply interested persons . In England , the reputation of all the old and large companies is beyond suspicion , and their operations are admitted to have been very beneficial to the public ; while the records of the courts at law and the evidence taken before Parliament afford the most painful testimony of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the younger and smaller institutions . We have thus dwelt with what some may regard as even painful minuteness on the very elements of the science of Life Insurance , because we have a profound conviction that the subdect is one of vast importance , and that the institution ought especially to be judiciously fostered in this country , as it is greatly needed , and there are already indications that it will be developed here to a larger extent than anywhere else in the world . The ease with which fortunes are gained and lost renders our people sanguine , improvident , and extravagant . Especially is this improvidence manifested in reference to the contingency of early death . Persons of fixed incomes , including those who depend upon salaries and wages , as well as those who subsist upon the revenue of an invested property in which they have only a life interest , still think that they are sufficiently economical if their expenditures do not exceed their receipts . Hence the sudden and cruel alternations of fortune which we are all so frequently obliged to witness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaccustomed to labor , and inexperienced in privation , find that the same stroke which deprives them of parent , husband , or only son also reduces them to extreme poverty . The widow must take boarders ; the daughters must seek employment as teachers the sons must beg for subordinate positions in stores or workshops , or emigrate to the Far West . Too often , even these resources can not be obtained , or prove unfruitful ; generally , the want of experience is fatal , at least for a time , to success in either of them . Debt soon comes to aggravate destitution ; // and it is well even if good principles and good habits are not soon worn away in the depressing strnggle . Self-respect is seldom preserved ; the destitute must solicit aid from friends , and this is but a euphemism for beggary . The misery thus caused is incalculable . Poverty is not so great a hardship to those who have always been poor ; the hand indurated by constant work does not blister . But the poverty which comes suddenly after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply into the flesh . It is a chronic smart , which too often gradually wears awa5* the health both of body and mind . Common observation will satisfy any one that this picture is not o erdrawn , and that it does not represent an infrequent occurrence . If it were the only merit of Life Insurance that it furnishes a means , the only sure means , of obviating these distressing calamities , the institution might well be regarded as one of the most efficient " charities " which human benevolence has ever devised . But this is only its direct result ; its indirect influence upon the habits of the people is a matter of at least equal moment . It not only encourages frugality , but makes fru*ality a habit , and removes from it the taint of selfishness ; it not only renders men provident , but it shares , though in a humble degree , with religion in extending this providence to a period beyond the life of the individual . We claim for the institution , therefore , a high place in the regards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most anxious to try all feasible means of diminishing the amount of sin and misery in the community . We claim for it even a higher place there *h*n is universally accorded to Savings Banks , Model Lodging-Houses , Provident Associations , R* gged Schools , or any other of the thousand and one philanthropic institutions of this most philanthropic age . It is an additional consideration , though of comparatively slight importance , that the large funds accumulated for Life Insurance are in great part a positive addition , which would not otherwise be made , to the available capital of the country , - to the stock which keeps in motion and renders efficient our national industry . Thus , of the twenty millions already accumulated by nineteen companies here , it is perfectly safe to say that at least ten millions have accrued from annual savings , each one of which // was so small that the sum would probably not have been saved , but spent , if the call to pay the annual premium had not rende:ed the economy necessary . Cm expectation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurance is founded not merely upon the strong intrinsic considerations in favor of it , which need only to be understood in order to be generally acknowledged and acted upon , but upon its extraordinary development within a few years , both here and in England . The first English company for insuring lives was formed only a century ago , and but two others , one in 1792 and one in 1797 , were established before 1809 . The amount of business done by these three was cornparadvely insignificant ; for they were Proprietary Companies wheh gained immense profits for their stockholders out of the high rates which they charged to the insured . Only nine other companies were founded before 1819 . It was not till the introduction of the mutual principle , by which the price of Life Ins arance was reduced to its actual cost , that the nature of the operation came to be fully understood and its importance apprcc9ted . This principle is so obviously a reasonable and proper one , that the two oldest companies , the Equitable and the Amicable , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granting a large share of their profits , in the form o boiiuses or dividends , to the insured . As soon as the low cost of he operation was thus rendered manifest , the business began to expand with astonishing rapidity , and it has now becom one of the great interests in the state . Niiiety-nine of the now existing offices were opened between 1819 and 1850 , and seventy-seven more from 1850 to 1855 . We here count those only which are still in operation , and apparently successful . Of 228 new companies founded between 1844 and 185G , one half hare already ceased to e. ist ; many of these were mere swsndles . Though the history of too many of those which are of recent origin has thus been disastrous , ignorance and fraud having presided over their birth , others have been more fortunate , and while yet in early youth are already formidable rivaL to the two veteran companies . Through the active rivalry of these numerous associations , the merits of the institution have been thoroughly canvassed and advertised ; and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood down to common artisans , manifest a daily increasing eagerness to protect their families or their creditors by Life Insurance . The life of the last Duke of York was insured to an almost fabulous amount by his desponding creditors , whose only other chance of rayment rested on the princely life-income which Parliament granted to the royal debauchee . An actuary of one of the companies recently testified before a committee of the House of Coiumons , that a vast enlargement of the business beyond its present amount is even now taking place among the laboring classes , who have become convinced , in England at least , that the best investment of their savings is in Life Insurance . In 1849 , the sums assured in English companies were estimated at one hundred and fifty millions sterling ; and , considering the enormous increase of the business since that date , it is safe to estimate that this sum is now tripled , making an aggregate of four hundred and fifty millions sterling , or about two thousand two hundred and fifty millions of dollars . Hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insured on life policies in this country is but a small fraction of what may soon be expected . Our population is as large as that of England ; and , excluding the very rich who do not need , and the very poor who are not able , to effect Life Insurance , the proportion of the remainder - who may be called the lifeinsuring class - to the whole population is much greater than in the Old World . We may reasonably expect to learn , before many years have expired , that the amount insured here is ten times as great as at present . In proportion to the merits of the institution , and to its flattering prospects of enlargement , ought to be our anxiety that it should be established in this country on a safe and well-regulated basis , with every possible security against fraud and mismanagement . In no case are a wise oversight and restraint by the legislature niore needed than in the establishment and conduct of new companies for Life Insurance . And this for an obvious reason . He who intrusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can withdraw them at almost any moment , when he sees reason to fear fraud , disaster , or even diminished profits ; he can draw out his dopc s LIFE INSURANCE . // its , or sell his stock , with no loss at all , or with only a trifling one . But he who has been deluded into once entering a wrong company for life insurance is bound to it for his whole life , under the penalty of losing all , or the greater part , of what he has already invested . Though he may clearly see his mistake and lament it , the legislature or the courts of law can do nothing to help him ; lie is still bound by his contract with many others , all of whom are as unfortunate as himself , to continue his annual payment to the company during his whole natural life , or else he must lose all that he has paid already . He may continue for a few years , in popular phrase , " to throw good money after bad " ; and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very likely to abandon all . This necessity may be a very sad one to a family in moderate circumstances , who have long looked to the Life Insurance as their only guaranty for the future against utter destitution . Such cases have been by no means infrequent in England , and , young as the institution is here , we are well aware that they are not unknown in this country . Strenuously as we have advocated the claims of Life Insurance , we would with equal earnestness press this caution : Beware what company you enter ! Choose not the youngest , nor the one which is ostensibly and for the moment the cheapest , nor that which holds out the most flattering promises , and is pressed most persistently upon your notice . The price of Life Insurance can not be below its actual cost ; and all mutual companies offer it at cost . Choose , then , that which in the long run - and the contract necessarily covers the whole of what may be a long life - is sure to afford it at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must be one of the oldest , largest , and richest companies . Fortunately , as the institution here is of more recent growth than in England , we have been able to profit by the mistakes of our predecessors ; and accordingly , the legislation on the subject , especially in Massachusetts , is wise and judicious as far as it goes , and much better than the English system , or want of system . New York has prudently followed a good example , her system being in the main a copy of the Massachusetts scheme . The credit of devising the plan , and of carrying it in great part into execution , is due , we believe , chiefly to Mr. // Elizur Wright , who has applied competent mathematical attainments , a thorough knowledge of the business , and great impartiality , to the work of suggesting the proper tests of solvency , causing the proper returns to be made under legal penalties , and founding the requisite calculations upon them , so that one of his Reports exhibits at a glance the relative standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We wish that a copy of the one now before us could be put into the hands of every person who has not already insured his life . The right and the duty of regulating by numerous and strict enactments of law the business of Life Insurance rest upen far stronger reasons than can be alleged for legislative interference in any other commercial or financial undertaking . All the funds accumulated in Life Insurance offices belong* exclusively to the insured ; Actuaries , Presidents , and Directors are merely their paid agents and trustees , accountable to them for every dollar which is paid into or out of the general fund . But because the insured are a very numerous body , widely dispersed , and each of them owning only a very small fraction of the common fund , they can exercise hardly any direct supervision over the operations of the company ; they are at the mercy of their own agents , who. are for the most part self-constituted agents , being any persons whatever who have seen fit to get up a Life Insurance Company . The insured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directors ; for unless some of these are persons of reputation and wealth , the company could not have obtained any business . But unfortunately this is only a ceming guaranty ; for the practice is too common of gentlemen " lending their names , " as it is called , to a company in which they have no interest , whose concerns they never investigate , and for which they are in no wise resuonsible . Such a practice is nothing else than a gross fraud . These persons allow their names to be blazoned in advertisements all over the country as " Directors " of an association having the control of very large trust funds , really the property and the sole dependence of many thousand widows and orphans , and yet know and care no more about its proceedings than they do for the actions of the Emperor of China . The first object of 27* // the legislature ought to be , to put a stop to so iniquitous a custorn . The number of the directors should be limited by law , never to exceed six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office unless his own life is insured by the company to the amount of several thousand dollars . Then the annual returns to the legislature should be accompanied by certificates , rendered upon oath , by each of the directors , that , thrice at least during the year , he has personally investigated its proceedings and investments , and can vouch from his own knowledge for the truth of the returns . Of course , such services could not be rendered without compensation ; but the insured , in consideration of the greater security thus afforded them , would gladly vote reasonable salaries to the directors ; for ti e duties , after all , would not require much labor or time . It is easy to be a faithful watch-dog against thieves , and yet not spend all one 's time in barking . The stringency of the legal regulations which already exist , and of those which we now advocate , would afford no cause of complaint to the conductors of large , really solvent , and wellmanaged companies . On the contrary , strict laws are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of new and weak offices , and thus to diminish a competition which is all the more injurious to the insured and to the sound institutions , because it is often unprincipled , reckless , and even fraudulent . Of course , they are welcomed by the insured , who are the real parties in interest , and therefore the only ones whose wishes ought to be consulted . This leads us to remark , that competition in Life Insurance has already been carried much too far . There is not the same reason for it as in any other business . Competition is generally for the public good , on account of its tendency to reduce the price of an article as nearly as possible to the actual cost . But here , from the nature of the case , the price is already at the cost ; and competition , when its object is merely to increase the extent , and not the profitableness , of the business , tends really to enhance the cost . The " expenses of management , " to which we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not receive back their whole investment , are heavy chiefly because the cost of obtaining new business is heavy . // 186*3 . LIFE INSURANCE . Hence it is , as we have shown , that the expenses of new and small companies are relatively so large , being two and a half times greater than those of their older and wealthier rivals . They must advertise extensively , employ soliciting agents at high prices , and adopt a thousand paltry but costly expedients to make a show before the world . There is no occasion for the larger and well-established associations to continue this degrading and profitless struggle . The basis which they have already seenred makes them really independent of any new business whatever . It will continue to come to them even if they do not offer a bribe for it ; there are steady and permanent causes at work , which must enlarge their sphere of operations , whether they will or not . Most of the new business will come to them of its own accord , and there is no need of paying a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase a little larger . The addition thus gained , - that is , the addition to the natural growth , - really costs more than it is worth ; it is a source of weakness , not of strength . On the other hand , the great reduction of the expenses of management consequent on giving up all active measures of competition , would be a soliciting agency worth all the others put together . When the ratio of expense is reduced from ten to six per cent , as it might be in all large and well-conducted offices in which new policies are not paid for , comparatively few persons would enter young or weak companies , in which this ratio must average nearly twenty-five per cent . A reasonable amount , it is true , must always be spent in advertising ; for it is important that the advantages which the company really possesses should be generally known . But well-satisfied policy-holders are the most effective soliciting agents ; they cost nothing , and they alone ought to be employed . The great danger of active rivalry is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks , including some that have already been declined by the larger establishments . A company that has but few policies can not afford to reject doubtful lives , and thus really aggravates its weakness by what seems to increase its strength . Some of the English companies which have recently closed a weak existence by an early death , have probably traced their chronic malady to this cause . It must // Oct. not be forgotten that frauds are practised against Life Offices as well as by them . Careful scrutiny at the outset is the only means of avoiding insurance of doubtful lives misrepresented as good ones ; for a sound company will rather submit to an occasional loss by fraud , than injure its reputation by a lawsuit , where the sympathies of the jury are sure to be on the side of widows and orphans against a wealthy corporation . Put a feeble company thinks it can not afford such scrutiny , and therefore finds itself involved from the beginning in a succession of lawsuits , which are none the less ruinous because justice is on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are made by the well-established companies , result from a further guaranty for the stability of the concern , which needs to be explained . The annual premiums which are now required are needlessly high , if we look only to the present exigencies of the business . Why not reduce them at once to the rate which experience shows to be sufficient , instead of retainia them at their present amount , and then , at short intervals , paying back to the insured one fourth or one third of the annual receipts as a bonus or dividend ? The answer is , that Life Insurance is necessarily a contract of long duration , extending for many of the insured to a period of forty or fifty years ; and , the annual premium being once fixed in the contract , can not be increased at any future time , even though circumstances should require such increase . Many things may happen within half a century , the occurrence of which must be guarded against , if the security of the insured is to be absolute . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be paid depends chiefly upon the rate of interest , which no averages about six per cent , but is very likely to be reduced before many years to five or four . The expenses of management are contingent on the cost of liviilg , and are thus slowly but steadily augmented . The recurrence of an epidemic , like that of the Asiatic cholera , mi ht cause a serious diminution of the fund within one or two years . Now effectual provision is secured against all these contingencies by making the rate of annual premium superfluously large , and returning at fixed intervals to the insured as much // only as actual experience has determined to be superfluous . Then , if the rate of interest should fall , or that of expense should rise , or if a pestilence should happen , the only evil will be , that the bonuses or dividends will be proportionally lessened . The cost of Life Insurance is divisible into two parts , a provision against ordinary hazards , and a provision against extraordinary risks . It is a suicidal policy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy has been adopted by soiue of the feeble companies , which endeavor to attract business by offering to insure at low premiums . Those who are silly enough to accept this offer forget that the difference between the two rates , and even more than this difference , is returned by the larger institutions in the form of dividends . The occurrence of any circumstances which might cause these to suspend their dividends , would certainly cause their rivals to stop payment even of the sums insured . There is another element of uncertainty , which can not be guarded against for the present except by this higher rate of premium , although information will be obtained in a few years , chiefly through these very operations of Life Insurance , by which it will be eliminated altogether . It can not be said that the law of mortality , or the average duration of human life , is yet determined for the people of this country , except within broad limits , or with a considerable allowance for possible error . We are still dependent in the main on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accurate for the duration of life in England , chiefly through the combined experience of the Life Insurance Companies , whose operations cover all ranks and employments , and extend in several cases over a period of more than half a century . It is very probable that the average duration of life here is less than it is in England , at least for what we have called " the insuring class - how much less can not yet be determined . Professor Wigglesworth 's tables relate to the people of this country ; but the data on which they were founded are imperfect , and are now of so old date , the habits of the people , the practice of medicine , and sanitary measures having undergone great alteration during the intervening period , that they can not be regarded as trustworthy for the present generation . Our State system // Oct. of registering births , deaths , and marriages , taken in connection with the United States decennial census , ought to afford the data for determining with great precision the law of mortality for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted with so little care and metbod , that no reliance can be placed upon their results in cases where great accuracy is required . On the whole , we must depend on the materials which the operations of Life Insurance are gradually amassing , for the final solution of this interesting problem . As yet the companies are too young to have collected a sufficient quantity of them ; but their amount is rapidly augmenting , and in the course of a dozen or twenty years more we may hope to obtain from their combined experience a great body of vital statistics , which will enable us to determine the laws of mortality for different ages , classes , localities , and employments with great precision . The calculations in Mr. Neison 's volume , which afford many curious and valuable results , are based chiefly upon data furnished by the English and Scotch Friendly Societies , which insure against sickness as well as death , by the Gotha Life Insurance Company upon the Continent , and by voluntary associations that have long existed among master mariners , medical men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of their widows and orphans . Some of the conclusions deduced from these materials , as to the relative mortality of the different classes of the people , are very different from what we had been led to expect . The circumstances in which the poor and laboring population , especially in England , are placed , bave generally been thought unfavorable to longevity . They are exposed to drudgery and toil , to impure air and undue heat and cold in their confined lodgings , are scantily clothed , and often insufficiently fed . Yet the more provident among them , who are thoughtful and frugal enough to pay a few pence every month to a Friendly Society , have a longer average du ration of life than the wealthy and high-born . Especially is this the case in the rural districts , where , though the wages are less , the employments are healthier than in cities and towns . Yet even in the city districts , where the conditions seem most unfavoral.31e to health , it is found that the expectation of life in // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society , namely , the peerage and baronetage , and very much larger than in the middle and upper classes generally , with which Life Offices have had the most experience . At the age of 30 , for instance , the expectation of life for the poorer but provident classes in the rural districts is a little over 38 years ; in town districts , it is 34* ; in city districts , nearly 83 ; while among the peerage , it is less than 31 . At the age of 50 , these proportions are as 23 , 20 , 20 , to 18 . These differences are serious enough to affect very materially the rates of Life Insurance ; and it is probably their unexpected character which has induced the English offices of late to make great efforts to extend the sphere of their operations in small sums among the laboring classes . It is evidently better for them to issue a thousand policies for one hundred pounds each to humble artisans , than to insure one hundred lives among the gentry and nobility for one thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and industrious of the laboring classes must be regarded , of course , as a consequence of their simple and uniform habits , and the more regular and natural physical exercise to which they are accustomed . There is greater equality in the distiibution of the goods of this life than is generally imagined . " It could be clearly shown , " says Mr. Neison , " by tracing the various classes of society in which there exist sufficient means of subsistence , beginning with the most humble , and passing on to the middle and upper classes , that a gradual deterioration in the duration of life takes place ; and just as life , with all its wealth , pomp , and magnificence , would seem to become more valuable and tempting , so are its opportunities and chances of enjoyment lessened . " Hitherto we have compared the effect of different localities , and of different stations of rank and wealth , on the average duration of life . If we extend the comparison to different employments , the results are still more curious . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locality on the chances of life . The rural districts are principally indebted for their supposed superior healthiness to tbe larger amount of healthy occupations which are pursued in // them ; and in cities and towns , impure air , defective sewerage , confined lodgings , and local epidemics have not so much effect as employment in unhealthy trades in shortening life . The peculiar sanitary condition of large towns has not the remarkable effect which many have supposed in shortening the duration of life . " Among various occupations , we are sorry to find that of clerks in counting-houses , a numerous and respectable class of the population of cities , peculiarly unfavorable to longevity ; and we fear that their employers , the merchants , who in the main are occupied in a similar manner , but have greater anxieties and less simple and regular habits , have a still inferior chance of long life . This is a matter which deserves attention from the Life Offices ; for a larger proportion of this class than of any other appear inclined to insure their lives , evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they are liable . The occupations of l ) lunThers , painters , and bakers are thought to be peculiarly unhealthy ; and they are so . But as compared with the business of clerks , they appear decidedly favorable to long life . Thus , at the age of 40 , a country laborer 's expectation of life is 32* years ; for the inhabitants of the rural districts , after abstracting the laborers , this expectation is but 30 years ; for bakers , it is 24 ; for plumbers and glaziers , 24*- ; but for clerks , it is less than 22 years . We have said enough to show that through the operations of Life Insurance a great amount of curious and valuable information is gradually obtained , which throws full light on some of the most difficult questions in social science . Here in America information of this sort is peculiarly desirable ; and for this reason , as well as for many others which we have noticed , we hope that the business may be firmly established and widely extended among all classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
