txt Of course FREMONT accepts . He laid the plot on purpose to accept . His griefs would run to seed if he did not accept . His " whole charge of ancients , corporals , lieutenants , gentlemen of companies , discarded unjust serving men , revolted tapsters , " would all go to the dogs if he did n't accept . It is plainly enough now but an ill venture ; yet , being in so far , there was no alternative but to stand to it . It was needful not only to accept , but to give reasons . FREMONT has given them , in the letter we published yesterday . They are very vague . Words lie so thick about them that it is not easy to make them out . But we gather that his acceptance is necessary because Mr. LINCOLN has violated personal liberty , and the liberty of the press , and especially the right of asylum ; because his foreign policy has been feeble and without principle ; and because the war has been managed with incapacity and selfishness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without its unity of action and vigor of execution . " These , every one sees at once , are Copperhead reasons , pure and simple . They consist of exactly the stuff faction has been casting at President LINCOLN for the last two or three years , only a little staler . It is evident that FREMONT had his eye on the Copperheads while penning every line of this letter . He takes good care to lull their ProSlavery instincts , by declaring that " Slavery may be considered practically destroyed , " and that " the p arty divisions created by it have disappeared . " He gratifies their sympathetic feeling for the rebels by giving out that he " does not heartily concur " in that portion of the Cleveland platform which sets forth that " the confiscation of the lands of the rebels , and their distribution among the soldiers and actual settlers , is a measure of justice . " Evidently ht. ) has ' a notion that there is a chance of his being taken up by the Chicago Convention . He does not hesitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. LINCOLN is renominated , " there will remain no alternative but to organize against him every element , of conscientious opposition , with the view to prevent the misfortune of his reelection , " Impressed with this necessity , this brilliant patriot realizes the importance of standing well with the Copperheads. elected . These facts are matters of history . Every American knows them . Yet , in the very face of them , FREMONT joins the Copperheads in abusing the President for violating " the ordinary rights secured by the Constitution and the laws of the country . " It is almost incredible impudence . Gen. FREMONT by this letter breaks definitively with the Union party . We are sorry for it . Not for the party 's sake , but for his own . The party is sure to prevail . It will not feel his loss . But it is not pleasant to reflect that a name which was once peculiarily associated with a grn lid struggle against the slave power in tile political field should now be connected will ' a movement tending only to encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , e wish of Gen. FREMONT is to draw off a portion of the Union party to his ON VII support ? in other words to divide it . No extensive division could take place without neutralizing its power , and giving the next Prestdency to the party which is opposed to the war , and in favor of negotiating with JEFF . Davis  --  the party for whose success the rebels have a special solicitude . The spirit must come either.from hostility to the aims and objects of the Union party , or from a personal feeling against Mr. Liscoefs . If the former , Jens C. FREMONT is ex anima a Copperhead . If the latter , he is a man who permits his personal spites to overrule his public duties . The special anti-Lincoln tone of his letter , his expressed willingness to support any other nominee of the Baltimore Convention , indicates that the latter branch of the alternative is the correct one . This conclusion finds an additional support in the fact that he has once proved himself capable of this same littleness of action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia , Gen. FREMONT , though in the face of the enemy , refused to retain his command in the Mountain Department , for the avowed reasons that his personal relations with Gen. POPE were such that he could not acknowledge the latter as his military superior . It was a display . of ' personal spleen of which a true soldier would be incapable . A similar grudge against President LINCOLN seems to be his ruling motive now . But whether it be this or a new-born hatred of the Union causes that impels him , he is alike dishonored . The impotence of his effort does not make it a whit the less odious . FREMONT 'S prating about the violation of " the ordinary rights secured by the Constitution and the laws of the country " is all the more absurd when his own summary arrests and suppression of newspapers , with which he began his rule in Missouri , are recalled , and particularly the famous martial law Proclamation with which he closed that memorable Summer . Without the shadow of authority , either from his military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that extraordinary edict , to confiscate all " property real and personal , of all persons in the State of Missouri who shall take up arms against the United States , or who shall be directly proven to have taken an active part with their armies in the field . " Gov . GAMBLE had previously issued a proclamation , granting amnesty to those who had been indiscreet enough to take up arms under JACKSON 'S call , and who would return to their duty as good citizens . This amnesty by the civil authority of the State was wantonly set aside . The act of Congress limited the penalty of confiscation to property actually employed in the service of the rebellion , with the knowledge and consent of its owners . FREMONT , in utter disregard of that law , proclaimed that the property of rebels , whether used in support of the rebellion or not , should be confiscated , and that all slaves should be emancipated . So arbitrary an assumption of power has not been witnessed in this war .

As respects its military bearings , it was an endeavor to arrogate the functions of the President , who , under the Constitution , is the responsible military head of the country .
