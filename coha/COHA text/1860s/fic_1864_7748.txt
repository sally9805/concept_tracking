Dodge , Mary Abigail , 1833-1896 : COMPENSATION . from Compensation ( 1864 ) All day the clash and the struggle  --  Thousands of hurrying feet Thronging to market and forum , Where lucre and lust will meet . There are blows to be given and taken , Battles to lose and to win ,  --  A man 's heart to stay the faint-hearted , A man 's arm to strike through the din . Rage on , O conflict of mammon , But through all the blare and the bray , A little bird lights amid blossoms And sings me a roundelay . Leap madly , O wild waste of waters , I reck not your wrath , for I know Where a little lake smiles in the sunshine And lilies are whiter than snow . The day charges on into twilight : Dear dreaming may follow brave deed , Now a sharp ringing heel on the pavement , A snort from my iron-shod steed , A plunge through the glittering darkness , A tramp on the white-gleaming sod , And I pass through the shadowy gateway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Malice , and Envy , Hither you can not come , Anger and base Ambition , Here must your lips be dumb . No clamor shall mar with its discord , The song of my little bird , By no fierce breath of the Northwind Shall my little lake be stirred . Eyes , are they blue , are they hazel ? Nay their color I can not see For the love-light shining through them , And shining alone for me . Lips  --  nay I limn not their curving , But once a low whisper I heard , And I thought the angels in Heaven Could utter no sweeter word . Here are flowers I have brought , my darling , Pansies for thoughts  --  of you ; Rosemary , that 's for remembrance , Violets , heaven 's own blue . Daisies that hold the spring 's sweetness  --  Ah ! fairer by far than these Is the flower I wear in my bosom , The herb that is called heart's-ease . Dear Christ ! that such grace should be given To me , beyond hope , beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angel I entertain not unaware . The lips on which her lips have rested Shall never work shame with a lie ; The breast she has leant on , I swear it , Shall be pure as her own native sky . So the fable of eld is reversed , No longer shines Merope dim , But bending to bless her earth-lover She gives a new glory to him ; Thrice happy if favored of Heaven , He enters the Beautiful Land , To know he found guidance and courage In the clasp of this little white hand .
