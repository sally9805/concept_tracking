P E T 110 L EU M. qwq its bygone scenes have passed away in their shadowy grandeur , leaving but dim footprints here and there to tell us they have been , and cause us to wonder at the mystery which veils their record , and to muse upon the evanescent glory of man 's earthly destiny . Along the valley of Oil Creek are clear traces of ancient oil operations . Over sections embracing hundreds of acres in extent , the entire surface of the land has , at some remote period of time , been excavated in the form of oblong pits , from four by six to six by eight feet in size . These pits are oftentimes from four to five feet still in depth , notwithstanding the action of rain and frost during the lapse of so many years . They are found in the oil region , and over the oil deposits , and in no other locality , affording unmistakable evidence of their design and use . The deeper pits appear to have been cribbed up at the sides with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ render them more available for the design in view . Upon the septa that divide them , and even in the pits themselves , trees have grown up more than one and a half feet in diameter , indicating an antiquity antedating the earliest records of civilized life in this region . For centuries has this treasure been affording intimations of its presence . Before Columbus had touched these western shores was it gathered here , in this valley , as an article of utility or luxury , by the processes of design and labor , and with the idea of traffic and emolument . By whom were these excavations planned and these pits fashioned , that tell of the pursuit of wealth so many centuries ago ? Let the mighty dead , that are slumbering in our valleys , and the remains of whose fortifications and cities are spread out all over the great West , in magnificence as vast and gorgeous as the ruins of Nineveh and Babylon , arise and speak , for they alone of mortals can tell ! From the fact that some of these pits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its adjustment , many have supposed that their construction was due to the French , who at one time occupied , to a certain extent , the Venango oil region . But this theory is scarcely plausible . Fort Venango was completed by the French at Franklin , seven miles below the mouth of Oil Creek , in the spring of 1754 , and this was probably about the beginning of their active operations in this region . But the construction of these pits no doubt antedates the French operations very many years . Timber placed in these oil pits , and thoroughly impregnated by its preserving properties , would be almost proof against the ravages of time . As evidence of this , petroleum in some of its forms entered largely into the ingredients used in embalming by the ancient Egyptians . These embalmed bodies remain perfect to this day . Even the cerements remain with every thread distinct and perfect as when they came from the loom , in days when Joseph was prime minister in Egypt . There is evidence , too , from the growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they claim an antiquity greater far than the occupation of their valleys by the French . Year after year , a silent , solemn record was made by the concentric circles , first in the shrub , next in the sapling , and then in the fully developed tree , that tells of the lapse of time since these mysterious works were in operation . Besides all this , where was the market for the immense quantity of petroleum that must have been produced from these excavations , on the supposition that they were constructed by the French ? Surely not at home , for neither in the misty traditions nor early records of that time do we find reference to any large quantity of this product , nor even their facilities for conveying it to the seaboard , had there been a demand for it at home . The sole object of the French at that // time was to gain military possession of the country . This is seen in the line of forts that was thrown across the country , extending from Erie , Pennsylvania , to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no evidence that they made any attempt either to cultivate the soil or develop the mineral resources of the country . There were white inhabitants , too , who were settled here quite as early as the temporary occupancy of the French . Their descendants remain unto this day . These early settlers knew nothing of French operations in petroleum . They were ignorant of its production , save in minute quantities , as it issued spontaneously from the earth ; nor could they throw any light on the origin of the excavations that were found in their midst . Another theory , that has been somewhat popular is , that these pits are due to the labors of the American Indians . But the very term labor seems absurd when used in reference to these lords of the forest . They never employed themselves in manual labor of any kind . The female portion of the community planted a little corn , and constructed rude lodges to shelter them from the wintry blast ; but they never even dreamed of trade or commerce . The Indian loved to roam through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to supply present wants , or to bring home the scalp of his enemy us a trophy of his prowess , but would scorn to bend his strength to rude toil in excavating multitudinous pits for the reception of oil , or in bearing it from place to place after it had been secured . Beyond all doubt the Indians were well acquainted with the existence and many of the properties of petroleum* That they valued it is beyond question . They used it , both for medicinal and toilette purposes . But they knew of its existence and production , just as did the early white settlers : they found it bubbling up from the bud of the stream and from low marshy places along its banks . They , no doubt , collected it in small quantities , without labor and without much forethought , and with this small supply were content . But even if a much larger supply had been desirable , and if the modern idea of traffic had found a place in their hearts , they had no facilities for conveying it from place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our improvement in the arts , the great desideratum is an appropriate vessel for carrying petroleum from place to place , or retaining it safely in any locality ; but the Indians were utterly destitute of any appliances suitable for the purpose . If they were acquainted with a rude kind of pottery , it was without glazing , and so incapable of retaining fluids , particularly petroleum ; and we have no knowledge of their ability to construct vessels of any other material that would answer the desired purpose . The inference is therefore fair , that for purposes of trade the production of oil was not desirable in so large quantities as indicated by these excavations . The same reasons would hold good in relation to its use in the religious ceremonies of the Indians . It could be used only in limited quantities , from the want of convenient receptacles for its retention . Besides , we doubt whether the Indians were sufficiently devout to resort to such labor and pains in religious worship . Reference is sometimes made to a letter said to have been written by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montcalm , describing a grand scene of fire worship on the banks of Oil Creek , where the whole surface of the creek , being coated with oil , was set on fire , producing in the night season a wonderful conflagration . But there is room for the suspicion that this account is apocryphal . Such scenes as are there described have been witnessed on Oil Creek since the beginning of the modern oil trade . During the continuance of several accidental conflagrations , the scene has been aw // fully grand and impressive . It has been strongly suggestive of the conflagration of the last day , when The lightnings , barbed , red with wrath , Sent from the quiver of Omnipotence , Cross and recross the fiery gloom , and burn Into the centre - burn without , within , And help the native fires which God awoke , And kindled with the fury of His wrath . ' But this was when thousands of barrels of petroleum had been stored up in vats , and when the combustible fluid was spouting from the wells at the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep wells were bored , oil was not produced in sufficient quantities to cause such a conflagration , and there was never seen upon the creek a stratum of the fluid of such consistency as to be inflammable . The remains of the once powerful confederacy of Indians known as the Six Nations still linger in Western Pennsylvania , in a region not very remote from Oil Creek , but they can throw no light upon the origin of these pits . In regard to their history , they can give no more information than they can concerning the mounds and fortifications , ruined castles , and dismantled cities , that tell us of a once glorious past , of a mysterious decadence , and of the utter vanity of all earthly glory . There are men still living in the oil valley , who were on terms of familiar intimacy with Coruplanter , a celebrated chief of the Seneca tribe of Indiansthe last of a noble and heroic line of chieftains that had borne sway from the Canadas to the Ohio River , and who was living at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeds and memories , and those of his fathers , who had gone to the silent hunting grounds of the spirit land , he could say nothing of early oil operations , any further than the collection of it in small quantities for medical or ornamental purposes . The only rational conclusion , therefore , at which we can arrive in regard to these early oil operations is , that they are due , not to the Indians or French or early white settlers , but to some primitive dwellers on the soil , who have long since passed away , leaving no written records to tell of their origin or history , but stamping the impress of their existence on our mountains and in our valleys , assuring us of their power and the magnificence of their operations , yet leaving us to wonder that such strength could fail , that such magnificence could perish , and that such darkness could settle over the memory of a great people . As before intimated , petroleum was found in Venango County by the earliest white settlers , and was esteemed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute quantities . It was found in particular localities along the banks of the Alleghany , issuing with the water from springs , and sometimes bubbling up from the bottom of the river in small globules , that rising to the surface , disperse themselves upon the water , and glide away in silei*t beauty . The principal oil spring , or that from which the largest quantity of petroleum was collected , was located on Oil Creek , about two miles from its mouth . From this the main supply was drawn for the wants of the earlier inhabitants . And as the demand was limited , no great amount of enterprise was called forth in its production . The modus opercrndi was most primitive , and yet withal the results were satisfactory . A point was selected where the oil appeared to bubble up most freely , a slight excavation was made , and the oil suffered to collect . When a tolerable stratum of petroleum had collected on the top of the water , a coarse blanket was thrown upon the surface , that soon became saturated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then taken out , wrung into a tub or barrel , and the operation repeated . But the demand was limited . Most families kept a supply for their own // use . Yet , for ordinary purposes , a pint bottle was sufficient for a year 's consumption . Indeed , half a dozen barrels were all that could be disposed of throughout the entire oil region of Western Pennsylvania up to a period when the researches of science were brought to bear upon its purification as an illuminator . Almost every good housewife was supposed to have a small store of Seneca oil , as it was popularly termed , laid by in case of accident , for the medication of cuts and bruises ; and not even the most popular of the nostrums of the present day is so much relied on as was this-nature 's own medicine-by the early settlers in these valleys . In the mean time a well was bored on the bank of the Alleghany , within two miles of the mouth of Oil Creek , in quest of salt water , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some forty years ago . After sinking the well through the solid rock to the depth of seventy or eighty feet , oil presented itself in such quantities , mingled with the salt water , as to fill the miners with the utmost disgust , and induce them to abandon the well altogether . They were boring for salt , not for petroleum . Salt was an article of utility and large demand ; oil was of comparatively small importance , and already a drug in the market , through the spontaneous yield of nature . Again , a well was dug in the town of Franklin , about thirty years ago , for the supply of a household with water . At the depth of thirty feet there were evident signs of petroleum , that were annoying to the workmen ; and although the water of the well was used for culinary purposes , it always bore a trace of oil , and was absolutely offensive to those unaccustomed to it . A hole has since been sunk in this well through the rock , but the yield of oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the immediate neighborhood . In the cases cited above were strong hints of the existence of the treasure concealed in the rocks beneath , and even of the manner of obtaining it . It was in fact the treasure knocking at the door , and asking to be released , in order to contribute to human wealth and enjoyment . But the time had not then arrived for the grant of this great boon . The earth was at the first made the repository of all the gifts that man should need until the end of time . But they were not all revealed at the first , nor to succeeding generations , until the fitting time arrived , and man 's necessities induced the great Giver to unlock the treasure house and dispense his rich bounty . Before man was created , the great treasure house in the earth 's bosom was filled with its minerals , and as the centuries rolled by in their slow and solemn march , such treasures were gradually brought to light . Not at once did the earth disclose her mighty resources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should tend to his own best interests . Even on the banks of the river that watered the terrestrial paradise , gold was found , but although the gold of that land was good , ' it was brought to light in limited quantities . In the same sacred locality , and at the same early day in the history of time , the bdellium and the onyx stone ' were found in their beauty ; yet were they few and rare , until God would consecrate the treasures of the earth to His own service in the construction and adornment of the tabernacle and the temple . The great treasure house of earth was then opened , until gold became common as brass , and precious stones numerous almost as the pebbles of the brook , and the riches of the earth were eternally consecrated to the service of God . And in the present century , and within our own recollection , when the world 's business seemed to be stagnated - when the sails of commerce flapped idly at the masts-when the great highways of trade and traffic were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // nation were almost exhausted , the hand of Providence unlocked the treasures of California and Australia , and every department of business has become prosperous , and every branch of industry has received a new impetus . A new lesson has been taught the world : that God 's treasures are inexhaustible , and that his hand can never be shortened . And now here , in this remote county of Western Pennsylvania , God 's treasure has been concealed for ages-locked up in the very heart of the eternal rock , awaiting the time of need , and accomplishment of the eternal purposes of Omnipotence . It has oozed forth in limited quantities during the lapse of centuries , as though to show us now that man can not lay his hand upon the houses of God 's treasure until his own appointed time . We know not where the great Chemist has his laboratory , or where he formed the mighty retorts that are distilling for us the oily treasure : most probably they were fashioned when the earth assumed its present form ; and since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down amid earth 's rocky caverns , through the revolving centuries , the stores have been accumulating that are destined to bless the world and become elements of national wealth . And now from that great laboratory , through innumerable channels , cut through the living rock by the hand of the Creator , and by paths which no fowl knoweth , and which the vulture 's eye hath not seen , ' is that treasure brought near to the earth7s surface , just in our time of need . When other supplies are failing and other resources giving way , we see God 's wisdom in opening up new channels . The great Benefactor would teach us that his resources are unlimited , and that our time of need is but the beginning of his overflowing bounty . It is really strange how slow men were to discover the abundance of this supply , and to trace it to its luxuriant deposits amid the rocks . While itwas literally forcing itself upon their observation , it was only by a roundabout process that they discovered its richness and importance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks was made known on the Alleghany River , a short distance above Pittaburg , by its interference with the salt wells ; but no dream of its future importance seems to have forced itself upon either the miner or the capitalist until within the last few years . Perhaps the first real conception of the petroleum trade was in the mind of a young physician in the Venango region . Yet it was but a dream , and , like many another dream of the past , it was in advance of the age , and resulted in nothing but speculation . In looking at the numerous slight veins of oil that oozed up along the bed of Oil Creek , the thought occurred to him that , by tracing these little veins to their source , the main artery might be reached . And as this tracing must be through the rock , the proper plan would be to bore down through it , until a large vein was reached . This was certainly professional , and , now that it has been tested , seems a very plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Columbus in regard to a new continent , entirely too bold for the times , and was rejected . There was in this physician 's theory but one link lacking in order to have anticipated the entire scheme of oil production as it was afterward generally carried on . The thought did not occur to him of leasing the lands along Oil Creek , and thus securing an interest in the entire territory : he thought only of purchas ing , and as he could not command the capital for this purpose , the scheme was lost , as far as he was concerned . The idea was however a brilliant one , and entitled its originator to be classed among the long line of those who have dreamed without realizin'g the vision , and who have sown precious seed // without being permitted to reap the harvest . In the mean time , artificial oil had begun to be produced in large quantities from different minerals , principally , however , from cannel coal , by the process of destructive distillation . This oil was refined and deodorized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inquiry and investigation was excited . It was ascertained that this artificial oil , the product of distillation , was almost identical in its properties with the natural oil of the valleys-that the latter might be purified and deodorized , and if found in sufficient quantities , prove a source of wealth to the country . The enterprise of bygone ages in the excavation of oil pits was considered by many , but the process seemed tedious , and , in addition , the finest portions of the oil were in danger of passing off by evaporation . The grand idea , however , was struggling toWard the light . If the oil , now so greatly desired , bubbled up through concealed clefts in the rocks , why might it not be discovered in large quantities by boring in supposed localities deep into the rock that was conjectured to be its home I And if found in some localities while boring for salt water , why not expect to find it more certainly in localities where there were discovered such decided surface appearances ' I The work was finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil springs on Oil Creek , by boring in the rock . But it was labor pursued under difficulties . To have announced the intention of boring for petroleum into the bowels of the earth , would have been to provoke mirth and ridicule . The enterprise would have appeared quite as visionary as that of Noah to the antediluvians in building his ark against an anticipated inundation . It was generally supposed that the search was for salt water ; and perhaps the idea was a complex one even voL. v.-13 in the mind of the proprietor . Oil was desirable , salt was within the reach of probability ; if the former failed , the latter might probably be secured ; and if neither object was attained , the search for salt would be considered neither visionary nor disreputable . But the work went forward , through good report and through evil report , particularly the latter , until August 26th , 1859 , when , at the depth of seventy feet , the drill suddenly sank into a cavity in the rock , when there was immediate evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like the cry of ' Land ho I ' amid the weary , disheartened mariners that accompanied Columbus to the Western World . The goal had been reached at last . A pathway had been opened up through the rocks , leading , not to universal empire , but to realms of wealth hitherto unknown . Providence had literally forced upon men 's attention that which should fill many dwellings with light , and many hearts with gladness . Upon withdrawing the drill from the well , the oil and water rose nearly to the surface . The question was now to be tested whether the petroleum would present itself in sufficient quantities to justify further proceedings , or whether it was , like many another dream , to vanish in darkness , or dissolve in tears . The well was tubed , and by a common hand pump yielded ten barrels per day . By means of a more powerful pump , worked by a small engine , this quantity was increased to forty barrels per day . The supply was uninterrupted , the en*ne working day and night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well immediately became the centre of attraction . It was visited by hundreds and thousands , all eager to see for themselves , and test by actual experiment , the wondrous stories that had been related concerning its enormous yield , by counting the seconds that elapsed during the yield of a single gallon . // The fortune of the valley of Oil Creek was now settled , and the prices of land throughout its whole extent immediately became fabulous . Sometimes entire farms were sold , but generally they were leased in very small lots . In some cases the operator was required to give one half and even five eighths of the product , besides a handsome bonus , to the proprietor of the soil . The work now commenced in earnest . A tide of speculators began to set in toward the oil region , that would have overpowered that of California or Australia in their palmiest days . The excitement did not stop at the valley of Oil Creek . It extended down the Alleghany to Franklin , and up the valley of French Creek , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creek . Wells were sunk at all these points , and many of them yielded from three to forty barrels per day . In the course of the summer succeeding the first successful experiment on Oil Creek , there were not less than two hundred wells in different stages of progress in the town of Franklin alone . Wells were being bored in gardens , in dooryards , and even in some cases in the bottoms of wells from which water had been procured for household purposes . So numerous were the tall derricks , ' that a profane riverman made the remark that the people of Franklin must be remarkably pious , as almost every man seemed to be building a meeting house with a tall steeple near his dwelling . At one time there were in Franklin fifteen productive wells , yielding a daily aggregate of one hundred and forty barrels . Among these were what was known as the celebrated Evans well . ' This was , in some respects , the most remarkable well in all the region . It was sunk by its proprietor mT the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household purposes . An humble house and lot constituted his entire worldly possessions . The work in the well was performed entirely by his own family . Being a blacksmith , he constructed his own boring implements , and was dependent on no outside assistance . Patiently and assiduously did the blacksmith and his two sons toll on , as they had seldom toiled before , the former guiding the drill , and the latter applying the power by hand to the simple machinery . At the depth of only forty feet in the rock they struck a crevice that promised to pour them out rivers of oil . In attempting to enlarge this , the drill broke , the fragment remaining in the cavity , and defying every effort used for its removal . The well was then tubed , and a hand pump inserted , when it was found to yield at the rate of ten or fifteen barrels per day . Speculation soon began to run wild , and the fortunate owner of this well , among other propositions , received an offer of fifty thousand dollars for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned the same reply-th*t he had bored that well for his own use , and that if others wished a well , they could do as he had done . Oil was generally obtained in the valley around Franklin at the depth of about three hundred feet from the surface , for pumping wells ; in the valley of Oil Creek the same stratum was reached at about half that depth . In all these wells , whether successful as oil wells or not , a strong body of salt water was obtained , that added greatly to the facility of separating the oil by its increased gravity . Hitherto the business had been pursued with advantage and profit to those who were engaged . The demand was steady and prices remunerative , and visions of untold wealth were looming up before the minds of thousands . Prospecting was extending far and near . Every stream and ravine that deflected toward the Alleghany or Oil Creek was leased , and in very many unpropitious localities operations were commenced . But a change now took place in the development of oil proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardent operator . In the Oil Creek region , some of the smaller wells having been exhausted , resort was had to deeper boring . One hopeful theorist imagined that if the desirable flnid came from a very great depth , it might be good policy to seek it in a stratum still nearer its rocky home . So down he penetrated , regardless of the fine show ' of oil that presented itself by the way , until at the depth of five hundred feet in the rock , a vein of mingled gas and oil was reached that literally forced the boring implements rrom the well . This sudden exodus of the implements was followed by a steady stream , of petroleum that rose to the height of sixty or seventy feet above the surface , and was occasionally accompanied by a roaring noise like the Geysers of Iceland . Here was a new feature in oil operations . The idea of flowing wells for the production of petroleum , once inaugurated , was seized upon with avidity . There was not only a spontaneous yield , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was voted a slow institution , and all parties on Oil Creek renewed the operation of boring , and , at about the depth of the first flowing well , obtained almost uniformly like success . These flowing wells were almost as difficult to govern and regulate as was Pegasus of old . They played fantastic tricks ' when least expected , throwing the oil over the workmen , and in one case , when the vein of petroleum was suddenly opened , setting fire to the machinery , and destroying the lives of those in the vicinity . The enormous yield of these wells had the effect of bringing down the price of petroleum to so low a figure that pumping wells were at once closed . They could not be worked with profit . Hence almost the entire oil business has , for the present at least , been confined to the valley of Oil Creek . The yield from the flowing wells varies from fifty to two thousand barrels per day . This , as may readily be supposed , involves the loss by wastage of immense quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs into the creek . So great is this waste at times , that the oil is gathered in quantities on the surface of the Alleghany for a distance of eight or ten miles below the mouth of Oil Creek , in the eddies , and along the still water of the shore , and is distinctly perceptible at Pittsburg , a distance of one hundred and forty miles from the wells . Notwithstanding these wells are confined to a very narrow valley , and in many instances in very close proximity , it is very rare that they interfere with each other . In fact cases are known where two wells have been bored within forty feet of each other , with the discovery of oil at different depths , and even of different qualities , as regards color and gravity . In some instances the well has all the characteristics of an intermittent spring . One in particular may be specified for the regularity of its operations . It would remain quiescent for about fifteen minutes , when there would be heard the sound as of fearful agitation far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then appear to approach the surface for a few moments , when the petroleum would rush forth from the orifice , mingled with gas and foam , almost with the fury of a round shot from a rifled cannon . This furious flow would continue for fifteen or twenty minutes , when it would suddenly subside , and all would be peace again . This alternate rest and motion would continue with great regularity day and night , yielding perhaps one hundred and fifty barrels per day . In other instances , there are interruptions of days and even weeks , when the flow will be continued as before . In others still , the yield is steady and uninterrupted , yielding with unvarying regularity from week to week . The oil region of Venango County , as far as has been explored , is confined to // the creek and river bottoms . In conx*ection with wells that have been opened , there is a superincumbent stratum of earth , varying from ten to sixty feet in thickness : underlying this is a stratum of argillaceous shale , generally about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stratum of white sandstone . Sometimes this sandstone is intermingled with red , presenting a ruddy appearance as the sand is withdrawn from the well in the process of boring . Occasionally in passing through the shale , small fissures in the rock are passed throirgh , with circumstances indicating the presence of a stratum or vein of water , as at such times the sand accumulated in boring all disappears , leaving the bits clean and bright . At other times small veins or cavities of petroleum are pierced , the product of which rises to the surface of the well , and indicates its presence by appearing in the sand pump . In the earlier stages of the business this show of oil , ' as it was termed , was considered most favorable to ultimate success ; but latterly it is not regarded as essential , as many first-class wells have been discovered without the intermediate show ; and on the other hand , there has been many a brilliant show that has resulted in failure and disappointment . The presence of surface oil is not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Oftentimes very fine wells are opened in localities where no oil has been found on the surface , and no appearance of oil having been obtained at any previous time in the neighborhood . Perhaps the most unsuccessful operations in the whole Oil Creek valley have been in the midst of the ancient pits that have already been alluded to . Wells have been bored in the bottom of these pits without the least success . At a point near the bank of the Alleghany , some two miles above Franklin , there was a wellknown oil spring some forty years ago . It supplied the family that lived near it as well as the surrounding neighborhood with petroleum for medical and other domestic purposes to the extent of their wants . For many years the supply has entirely failed . During a recent excavation , at the precise spot where it was known formerly to exist , for the purpose of laying the abutment of a bridge , no trace of oil was found - not even a discoloration of the earth . Of course the boring of wells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is carried on with great system . After selecting a site , the first thing in order is the erection of a derrick . This is a frame in the form of a truncated pyramid , about ten feet square at the bottom , and five at the top , having one of its four posts pierced with rounds to answer the purpose of a ladder , by means of which the workmen can ascend and descend . This derrick is from twenty to thirty feet in height , and has at its summit a pulley , by means of which the boring implements are drawn from the well . A pit is then sunk through the earth within the derrick , about six feet square , until the work is interrupted by water . The remaining distance to the rock is reached by driving strong cast-iron pipe by means of a battering ram . This pipe has a caliber of about five inches , with walls of one inch in thickness . It is prepared in joints of about eight feet in length , which are connected together at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe reaches the rock , the earth is removed from its cavity , and the operation of boring is ready to be commenced . Occasionally , however , this driving operation is interrupted by coming upon a huge bowlder . When this is the case , the boring operation is commenced , and a hole made through the bowlder nearly equal in size to the cavity of the pipe , when the driving is resumed , and the pipe made to ream its way through the stone . Sometimes in these operations the pipe is fractured , or turned aside from a perpendicular direction , when // the place is abandoned and a new location sought for . The boring implements do not differ materially from those used in sinking artesian wells . As a general thing , bits of two or three sizes are used , the first and smallest of which only has a cutting edge . If the hole to be sunk through the rock is to be four inches in diameter , the bits would be , first , one with a cutting edge two inches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide by one inch in thickness ; and lastly , by a similar bit four inches wide . These bits have a shank about two feet in length , that is screwed into an auger stem ten or twelve feet in length and a.bout one inch and a half in diameter . Connected with this auger stem is an arrangement called , technically , jars - two elongated loops of iron , working in each other like links in a chain , that serve to jar the bit loose when it sticks fast in the process of boring . Sometimes this auger stem is connected with wooden rods , joined together with screws and sockets , new joints being added as the work proceeds ; but more generally the connection is with a rope or cable of about one and a half inches iu diameter . To this rope the auger stem is attached by a clamp and screw , that can be readily shifted as the progress of the work renders it necessary . The entire weight of these implements is from four to six hundred pounds . The power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by means of a spring pole ; but oftener a steam engine of from four to eight horse power . Midway between the well and the engine a post is planted , on which is balanced a working beam about sixteen feet in length : one end of this beam is attached to the crank of the engine , and the other to the implements in the well . The power is applied to raising the bit  --  the blow is produced by the fall of the same when relieved by the downward motion of the working beam . In the process of boring , the workman is seated over the well , and , by a transverse handle attached to the machinery just above the rope , turns the rope , and with it the bit , partially around , so that each stroke of the bit on the rock beneath is *slightly across the cut that has preceded it . After the fore bit has proceeded about two feet , or until the work begins to clog with sand , it is withdrawn , and the next is inserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it goes by the last bit . The fragments of rock that are cut away descend to the bottom of the well in the form of sand , and are readily withdrawn by means of the sand pump . This is a simple copper tube about six feet in length , with a di*meter something less than that of the well , and furnished at the lower end with a simple valve opening upward . This pump is let down into the well by a rope , and , when it reaches the bottom , is agitated for a few moments , when the sand is forced up through the valve , and thus withdrawn from the well , when the boring is again resumed . As the work proceeds , a register is kept by the judicious borer of the dif ferent strata passed through , and also of the veins of water and oil passed through , in order to the formation of an intelligent judgment in tubing the well . As might be supposed , this operation of descending amid the rocks is not without its difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the auger stem , leai*ing a fragment of hardened steel , or an entire bit , deep in the recesses of the rock . When the latter is the case , recourse is had to divers expedients , by means of implements armed with sockets and spring jaws , in order to entrap the truant bit . And it is marvellous what success generally attends these efforts to extract bits that are oftentimes two or three hundred feet below the surface . Sometimes , however , these efforts fail , and the well must be aban // doned , with all the labor and anxiety that have been expended upon it . During the progress of the boring there is more or less carburetted hydrogen gas set free . This supply is so abundant at times as to cause an ebullition in the water of the well , resembling the boiling of a pot . In the case of the flowing wells , when the vein of petroleum is reached , the gas rushes forth with such violence , and the upward pressure is so furious , as to force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when not properly secured , has been driven through the derrick in its upward progress . After the boring has been successfully accomplished , the next operation consists in tubing the well . This is merely the introduction of a copper or iron chamber , extending down , or nearly so , to the vein of the oil . This tubing is , for the pumping and largerclass flowing wells , usually about two and a half or three inches in diameter , consisting of sections about twenty feet in length , and connected together by means of screw and socket joints . As there are usually many veins of water passed through in boring , some device must be resorted to in order to shut off this water from the oil vein and produce a vacuum . This is accomplished by applying what is called a seed bag to the tube at the point where this stoppage is desirable . The seed bag is a tube of strong leather some eighteen inches in length and about five inches in diameter . It is put around the metallic tube and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pint to a quart of fiaxseed is then poured in , and the upper end bound rather more slightly than the lower , when the tube is sunk to its place in the well . In a few hours the fiaxseed in the sack below will have swollen and distended the bag so as to effectually shut off all water from above . When it is desirable to withdraw the tubing from the well , the effort of raising it will break the slight fastening at the upper end of the leathem sack , permitting the seed to escape and the tube to be withdrawn without difficulty . When the well is to be pumped , a pump barrel is placed at the lower end of the tube , with piston rods extending to the top and attached to the working beam used in boring the well . As the petroleum is ordinarily mixed with more or less water when brought to the surface , it is thrown first into a tank , and the superior gravity of the water causing it to sink to the bottom , it is drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These tanks are of all sizes , ranking from thirty to two thousand barrels each . For the present , wells that were formerly pumped at a profit are biding their time ; for at present prices of oil operations upon them would be ruinous . This renders the computation of the weekly yield of the Oil Creek region comparatively easy . There are at the present time not far from one hundred flowing wells along the valley of the creek , producing probably on an average about forty thousand barrels per week . A portion of this is refined in the county , but by far the largest part is shipped to a distance , either by the Alleghany River by way of Pittsburg , or by the Philadelphia and Erie or Atlantic and Great Western Railroads to the Eastern markets . The necessities of the trade have given rise to many ingenious inventions in getting the oil to market . The wells extend along Oil Creek for a distance of about fourteen miles from its mouth . The ground is not favorable for land carriage , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself is too small for navigation under ordinary'circumstances , and a railroad with steam power would be in the highest degree dangerous . To compensate for all these difficulties , a system of artificial navigation has been adopted . Through . out the whole distance , at intervals of perhaps a mile , dams have been constructed across the creek , with draws // in the centre , that can be easily opened at the proper time . In this way pond freshets ' are arranged one or two days in a week . By the appointed tI'me , all persons having oil to run out of the creek have their boats ready , and as the water from the upper dam raises the creek below , the fleet of boats sets out . Each successive dam raises the water to a higher level , and as the fleet proceeds , small at first , it increases until , as it approaches the river , it often numbers two hundred boats , bearing with them not less than ten thousand barrels of petroleum . The advent of this fleet of boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree exciting . As boat after boat rushes into the river , there is the dashing to and fro of the boatmen , and the shouts of the multitude on the shore . Here and there a collision occurs that often results in the crushing of the feebler boat , and the indiscriminate mingling of boatmen , fragments of the broken craft , oil , and fixtures in one common ruin . In this fleet the form and variety of boats beggars all description . Sometimes there is the orthodox flatboat , filled with iron-bound barrels , with an air of respectability hovering around it . Next will follow a rude scow , and close upon it an unwieldy bulk , ' into which the oil has been pumped at the well . After this , perhaps , may be seen a rude nondescript , that surely was never dreamed of outside the oil region . It consists of a series of rough ladders , constructed of tall saplings . Between each pair of rounds in these ladders is placed a barrel of oil , floating in the water , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these ladders are lashed together , until the float contains two or three hundred barrels of oil . The bulks spoken of are about sixteen feet square and two or three feet in depth , divided internally into bulkheads of perhaps four feet square , to prevent any undue agitation of the oil by the motion of the boat , and are sometimes decked over . These unpromising boats , as well as the ladder floats , are , during favorable weather , often run to Pittsburg with entire safety . Steamboats , however , run up to the mouth of Oil Creek during the time of high water , and afford the safest and most expeditious means of transportation . As to the abundance of the supply in this region , there can be but little doubt . Wells seem at times to become exhausted , but it is from local causes . At times a cavity may be tapped that has been supplied from a very small avenue , and may be readily exhausted , but exhausted only to be refilled again The fact that wells do not interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is evidence that the supply is not confined to a limited stratum , but is drawn from the great deeps beneath . The existence of the ancient oil pits , before alluded to , assures us that the supply has been continued for centuries ; and observation confirms this , as we have noticed the hitherto unused treasure bubbling up silently through the crevices in the rocks and gradually evaporating amid the sands , or arising in the beds of the str*ams and floating down upon their surface . The history of the petroleum trade in other lands encourages us as to the abundance of the supply in our own . In the northern part of Italy , petroleum has been collected for more than two hundred years , without any intimation that the supply is being exhausted . In Burmah a supply has been drawn from the earth for an unknown period , and so far are these wells from exhaustion that they yield at the present time over twenty-five millions of gallons per annum . We may well suppose , then , that the treasure brought to light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted-that as the coals are found in illimitable abundance for fuel as the forests fail , petroleum for iluminating purposes will be found in like profusion . // We have said that the petroleum trade has known no infancy , but has sprung at once into maturity . The oil wells of Venango County alone produced , during the first year of their operation , more oil than the entire product of the whale fisheries during the most favorable and prosperous year in their history . At the present time , after a lapse of little more than two years , the daily product of the wells on Oil Creek alone is computed to be over six thousand barrels . And in this neighborhood the quantity might be weilnigh doubled , were it not for the low price the product commands . Petroleum differs in its characteristics in different localities . It is usually heavier in the shallow wells than in those that are deeper . Ordinarily it is of a greenish hue , that changes to a reddish as the oil becomes lighter and more evaporative . It is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The gravity of the various kinds of oil is ascertained by the oleometer . The lighter oils are found on Oil Creek , and are about 400 to 460 Baum4 ; at Franklin , from 300 to 320 . It is difficult to speak of the uses of petroleum at the present time , for these uses have not yet been fully developed . In its refined state it is preeminent as an illuminator . In this character it yields the palm to gas in matters of convenience and neatness , but is superior to it on the score of general adaptation and economy . Besides , the quality of the light is superior to that of gas , being soft , mild , tranquil , and exceedingly white . In the rural districts , where coal gas is impracticable , it would be an intolerable calamity to be obliged to return to the use of the old tallow candle that was the main dependence in years gone by . As an article of fuel , it has been used to some extent in the oil regions , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been general . When proper machinery shall have been invented , no doubt it will be a most important item of fuel in ocean navigation as well as in railway travel , conducing alike to economy of space and to ease of manipulation . In the manufacture of gas it has already been brought into successful use , both in this country and in England , and has been found most valuable alike in the quality of the product and in the economy of its production . As a medicinal agent it has long been employed in this country . It was used by the Indians in this way when the country was first discovered . It was also held in high estimation by the early settlers in what are now called the oil regions , for the medication of cuts and bruises , as well as an internal curative . It formed the staple of the British and American oils that were sold largely and at high rates throughout the country . It is a remarkable fact that since the quantity has increased so largely the popular faith has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed in the process of refining . This latter is exceedingly simple . The crude oil is placed in an iron retort connected with a coil of pipe in a Vessel of cold water . Heat is then applied to the retort , when the process of distillation commences . The first product is a light-colored , volatile substance , sometimes called naphtha , that is very explosive . This substance is used in the place of spirits of turpentine in the preparation of paints and varnishes , and , after further treatment , in removing paints and grease from clothing . The next product from the retort is the refined fluid for illumination . This is of a yellow color , with a bluish tinge and powerful odor , requiring further treatment before it is ready for the lamp . This treatment consists in placing it in a cistern lined with lead , and agitating it with a portion of sulphuric acid . The acid and impurities having sub sided , the oil is drawn off and further agitated with soda lye , and finally with water , when // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil for the lubrication of machinery is produced . Paraffine is another product resulting from this distillation . It is a white , tasteless , and inodorous substance , used in the manufacture of candles . The residuum in the retort may be applied to various useful purposes . It is sometimes used as fuel , and sometimes takes the place of coal tar in the arts , and by chemical processes is made to yield products useful in the laboratory and in the manufactory . But the *esthetics connected with this distillation must not be passed by in silence . On a bright , sunshiny day we see a bright globule of petroleum rising from the bottom of the stream . As it reaches the surface of the water it disperses , and , as it glides away , all the colors of the rainbow are reflected from its undulating surface . What radiant changes strike th ' astonished sight ! What glowing hues of mingled shade and light ! Not equal beauties gild the lucid west With parting heams o'er all profusely drest , Not lovelier colors paint the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn , Than in its waves in bright suffusion flow , That now with gold empyreal seem to glow ; Now in pellucid sapphires meet the view , And emulate the soft celestial hue ; Now beams a flaming crimson on the eye , And now assume the purple 's deeper dye . But here description clouds each shining rayWhat terms of art can Nature 's powers display V We gaze upon those colors , ever changing in their lustre and variety , until imagination revels in its most delightful dreams , suggesting thoughts of the good and beautiful , and reminding how beauty lingers amid the most unpromising things of earth ! And just as the bow that spans the mantling cloud reminds us of all beautiful things that glow around its antitype that spans the emerald throne on high , so , as we gaze upon the prismatic tints that are reflected from the oily surface , we dream of all that is beautiful in color and gorgeous in tinted radiance , as being hidden amid the elements of petroleum . This dream Ihas its fulfilment amid the processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called aniline , that is , the base of those beautiful colors so popular with ladies these last days-Mauve , Magenta , and Solferino . And in process of time , no doubt , the most delicate colors for flower and landscape painP ing will be educed , that will give a new impetus to the fine arts , and to the development of taste in our midst . And now where shall we look for the origin of this treasure ? From what elements is it elaborated ? We can not go with the great Chemist to his laboratory and look upon the ingredients , and notice the treatment used there . Science , although denominated the star eyed , ' can not penetrate the mighty strata of everlasting rocks that lie beneath us , and reveal to us these mysteries of nature . There is a path which no fowl knoweth , and which the vulture 's eye hath not seen : the lion 's whelps have not trodden it , nor the fierce lion passed by it . He putteth forth His hand upon the rock ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out rivers among the rocks ; and His eye seeth every precious thing . He bindeth the floods from overflowing ; and the thing that is hid , bringeth He forth to light . ' Nature has her mysteries . The earth has its great secrets . But over all , a God of wisdom and goodness presides . Age after age has rolled by-change after change has agitated the history of Time , as forms of beauty have been moulded and marred-as songs of joy have been sung , and requiems of sadness chanted in the great highways and quiet bypaths of life  --  the living of bygone ages are slumbering quietly in the dust , and the living of the present are hurrying to the same pale realms of shade . ' The nations of antiquity have passed off the stage with all their gran // deur and littleness , and the nations of more modern times are surging and dashing to and fro , like ships in the wild chaos of ocean 's storms . God alone is great ! Changes , too , have been quietly going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great dream of science , but perhaps an earnest , glowing reality , suggests that when God 's almighty power was rolling away the curtains of darkness from earth 's chaotic state-forming channels for oceans and rivers , and heaving up as barriers the mountain chains of earth , His eternal prescience of man 's coming need induced Him to bury deep down in subterranean recesses the imperfect vegetable organisms of a preAdamic state , that in the ages to come , coals and oils and gases might be drawn forth to supply his wants . We find in the coal deposits traces of ferns and leaves of gigantic stature and proportions . Casts of huge boles of trees are found among our fossils , inducing the belief that in some bygone age quantities of vegetable matter , absolutely enormous , were produced on the earth 's surface . And it is presumable that in some of the revolutions that have agitated our planet , renovating , improving , and fitting it for a higher order of life , mighty deposits of this vegetable matter were buried up amid the rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it may be that since the days of Adam this vegetable deposit has been undergoing the process of destructive distillation in the hidden regions beneath . In this process heat would not be wanting : it is furnished by the natural constitution of the earth . Says Professor Hitchcock : Wherever in Europe or America the temperature of the air , water , rocks , in deep excavations , has been ascertained , it has been found higher than the mean temperature of the climate at the surface , and experiments have been made at hundreds of places ; it is found that the heat of the earth increases rapidly as we descend below that point in the earth 's crust to which the sun 's heat extends . The mean rate of increase of heat has been stated by the British Association to be one degree of Fahrenheit 's thermometer for every forty-five feet : at this rate all the known rocks in the earth would be melted at a depth of sixty miles . ' Here , then , are all the conditions necessary to the production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks-we know not when ; internal heat has been decomposing that matter , and setting free its gases ; these again have been condensed as they approached the surface , and have filled up the cavities , and accumulated amid the rocks , until in these last days the earth has literally poured us out rivers of oil . Still all this is mere speculation . The hidden path yet remains unexplored . It may always remain so ; but we have the great fact of Divine providence in the rich and copioi*s supply , that is none the less valuable because it flows from an unknown source , and comes to us through unexplored channels .
