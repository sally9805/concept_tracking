ARTICLE V.-ADEQUACY OF THE CONSTITUTION . 3fessaqe of the President of the United States , at the opening of the first session of the thirty-seventh Congress , July4 , 1861. laws of the United States , passed at the first session of the thirty-seventh Congress . Washington , 1861 . TILE Convention that framed our present Constitution and form of government , was authorized and convened for this express purpose , to " render the federal Constitution adequate to the exigencies of Goverunment , and the preservation of the Union . " That they had done this , however , they never alleged or attempted to prove . Their work was immediately attacked , even before it was promulgated under their hands , not on the ground of its inadequacy for the purposes in view , but on the more popular ground , that the liberties of the people were in. danger . So that its friends were called upon at once , to defend the Constitution against the allegations of its adversaries , that . it had too much , rather than too little strength ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any assumed weakness , rather than to desire a full display of all its actual strength . When this crisis was passed , and the Constitution was accepted by the people , and went into actual operation , the same class of politicians that had objected to its acceptance becanse it had some power , now endeavored to make it , by construction , as destitute of power as they had before insisted that it ought to be , but was not . For this cause , almost every act of Congress and of the government was impugned and resisted , not only before , but often after its enactment , on the assumed ground , that it was not warranted by the powers of the Con-* stitution . To avoid or modify these contests , the friends of the Constitution were still kept under a constant temptation to claim and exercise as little power as possible , instead of being // driven to assert and defend its plenary adequacy to all the purposes of its creation . By the successful progress of the government , this state of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adequacy of the Constitution to the exigencies of government and the preservation of the Union , has not hitherto been exhibited and proved in practice , nor fully asserted and insisted on by its friends , even in theory . But the time has arrived when the practical test is being applied , and when of course the theory should be more particularly examined , with a view to its capacity for the endurance . It may result in a more perfect assurance that the prize is worth the contest . If it is not , perhaps the sooner it is given up the better . There should be no waste of strength and resources in a vain contest . Government and Union were the objects to be preserved . They were old ideas in the minds of our ancestors , having existed together from the time of the first settlement of the country . Though not identical , they were so essential to each other that neither could exist alone . Such governments as the States could have had without Union , or such Union as they could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experience and the aspirations of the people rendered desirable . They had lived under a general or national government for national purposes , and with special or local governments for local purposes , in every stage of their previous existence as a people . They were in this manner united under the royal government of Great Britain before the revolution . They continued the same under the IRevolutionary government , exercising generally all the powers they admitted rightfully belonged to their predecessors . They called themselves " The United Colonies of America , " and as such they levied war , raised armies , equipped navies , contracted alliances , and regulated commerce ; and before the Declaration of Independence , they suppressed the exercise of every kind of authority under the British crown , and all oaths necessary for the support thereof , and authorized the people of the respective Colonies to exercise all the powers of govermnent for the preservation of internal peace , virtue , and good order , under the authority of the peo // pie themselves. * In May , 1776 , this was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing had been done on the application of particular Colonies , as in the ease of IMiassachnsetts , New Hampshire , South Carolina and Yirginia . Thus the Colonies stood in the same relation to the Union , or national government , after the Revolution , as before . In the Declaration of Independence , our fathers expressly assume to be " ONE PEOPLE*** and that " they have full power " to do all these things . The powers specially named in the Declaration , viz , war , peace , alliances , and commerce , are national in their character , and were then so claimed and exercised by the " Representatives of the United States of America , in General Congress assembled , " and have been generally so claimed and exercised ever since . With the partial and unwise exception of Commerce for a short time , they have none of them ever been claimed or admitted properly to appertain to any of the local governments . By the Declaration of Independence , the Union became a Nation , and the separate Colonies were made States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty appertained exclusively to the Union ; and the local governments were exercised , as before , in subordination to it . Under the Confederation , which took effect at the close of the war , the last of the thirteen States , on whom it depended , not having adopted it till 1781 , the same general division of national and local powers was continned , the Union was declared to be per- * Mr. Dane , speaking of the Congress of 1' and ViTh , says : " The general government was , by the sovereign acts of this people , 1st , created de novo , and de facto established ; and by the same acts , the people vested in it very extensive powers , which have ever remained in it , modified and defined by the articles of Confederation , and enlarged and arranged anew by the Constitution of the United States . 2d . That the State governments , and States , as free and independent States* were , July 4 , 1776 , created by the General Government , empowered to do it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their original sovereign capacity ; and that nil the State Governments , as such , bave been institnted during the existence of the General Government , and in subordination to it , and two-thirds of them since the Constitution of the United States was ordained and established by the people thereof in that sovereign capacity . These State governments have been , by the people of each State , instituted under , and expressly or impliedly in subordination to the General Government , which is expressly recognized by all to be the supreme law . " 9 Dane 's Abridg't , App'x , 2 , p. 10. // petual , and the articles inviolable , unless by the consent of every State . But the external pressure of the war being removed , the local governments soon began to make inrqads upon the national authority . A short experience was sufficient to prove the total inadequacy of that system to the purposes in view ; and in February , 1787 , Congress recommended the appointment of Delegates to the Constitutional Convention , as " the most probable means of establishing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the federal tJon8titution adequate to the exigencie8 of government and the 9re8-ervation of the Union . " Under this commission , the Constitution was formed for the renovation of the national authority , at a time when it had become inefficient and almost extinct , by the constant and unauthorized aggressions of the local governments . In the Convention of its franiers , it encountered a strong opposition , not merely in the arrangement of its details , but in the main idea of creating *u'adequate and efficient national government . Its opponents were for some time a majority in several of the State Conventions , and its adoption was , with difficulty , finally accomplished , under the influence of an expectation of future amendments , which were afterwards made . After such an inauguration , seventy-two years ago , it commenced the practical development of its powers , under the prevailing auspices of its friends . Their administration , however , continued but twelve years , checked and thwarted , as it frequently was , by their opponents , who constituted a majority of one or both Houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sixty years ago the Constitution fell entirely into the hands of a different class of politicians , many of whom had opposed its adoption from the first ; all of whom had countenanced a denial or non-user of many of its essential powers , and contested the principles of its development under the administration of its original friends ; and not a few of whom had been supposed to sympathize with the first actual rebels against its authority . By the associates and successors of that school of politicians , with short and inconsiderable exceptions , the government has continued to be administered to the present time ; during the last two Presidential terms of // which , under the direct agency of those who are now the leaders of the rebellion , its revenues were diminished , its expenses increased , its debts accumnlated , its army and navy placed beyond its control , its officers and sworn agents corrupted and turned traitors to its interests , the materials of its power so disposed as to be available to themselves and their associate conspirators for its destruction , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their avowed leadership , placed in open , armed rebellion . In this situation , on the fourth of March last , it was handed over to the present administration to " preserve , protect , and defend . " Under these circumstances , the strength of the Constitution , the virtue of the people , and the honesty and vigor of the administration , are all to be thoroughly tested . If either of them fail , the nation is ruined . I ? e8publica damnatur . Our present business is to examine the first , and see if the Constitution itself is adequate to the exigency , in case the people and the administration fail not . In doing this , before looking at the superstructure , it becomes us to inquire well into the foundation , and see if that is deeply laid , firm and immovable . The wrong and injustice , that , after many unavailing attempts at avoidance , at length drove the United States into the family of nations , brought at the same time the right and the will to assume the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authority of the good people of these Colonies , " their Unity as " one people , " and their nationality as possessing all the powers , which of right pertain only to separate and independent nations . God , who gave the right and the will to make this Declaration , gave also the power to sustain it ; and there it stands . It has never been revoked or abrogated ; and never can be by any human power , but that which made it ,  --  the good people of the United States ; and there let it stand-e8to perpetma . By it we acquired the right , as " one people , " one nation , to govern ourselves , as other nations govern themselves . The institutions , under which nations govern themselves , originate in different modes . The only hegitirn ate mode is by the voluntary choice of the people . But o'overnments originating in fraud or violence become rightful , // by such express or silent acquiescence of the people , as proves their voluntary acceptance . Ours have always originated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of the people ; first as a nation , and then , under their advice and approval , by the separate States . There is not at this day , and never has been , or can be , a State Government in the Union , that does not in some form recognize the existence and paramount authority of the General Government . The present national Uonstitution , after the trial of other forms , was ordained and established by the people of the United States , for themselves and their posterity . This great fact is not only true , but it is formally announced and set forth on the face of the instrument itself , as the irrefragable foundation of its authority , sovereignty , and right to govern . Another fact , scarcely less important , though not patent on the face of the instrument , is , that it was ratified and confirmed by the people of each of the States individually ; thus not only giving it all the authority , in each State , they could give to their own Constitution , but expressly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made or to be made , and putting it forever beyond their power to alter it , by making it unalterable , except by the people of three-fourths of all the States . Such a foundation for government , so broad and deep , was never before laid by any people . If a fundamental law , so solemnly made and agreed to , will not bind the nation , and every man , woman , and child in it or any part of it , it . may be safely affirmed that a voluntary free government is impossible . If obligations so incurred can be rightfully cast off at pleasure , repudiated , and nullified , so far as respects themselves and their neighbors , by any section of the people , or any number of the people short of a majority of the whole , constitutionally expressed , mankind are incapable of governing themselves , for any man , or any number of men , will have the same right in any government they may voluntarily assume . So that a government by force , and not by law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , with the rebellion , is a contest for the right of selfgovernment ,  --  the right of the nation to govern themselves by // laws of their own making  --  the right of free government-the rights of mankind . Nothing less , and nothing different . If we have not a right to onr present government , we can have no right to ally . The power of the people being the source of the Government , the foundation of right and authority on which it rests , we are next to look at their act ,  --  what have they done ? They have ordained and established a Constitution for the United States of America ,  --  a body of fundamental principles and rules for the government of the nation . Such a Constitution is necessarily in its own nature paramount to all other laws , being the ground-work and origin of them . But even this is not left to stand only on this necessary and unavoidable inference ; but is embodied iu express words in the instrument . " This Constitution shall be the supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States even , not made in pnrsuance of it-any treaty not made under its authority  --  and any Constitution , law , or ordinance of any State , contrary to it , are absolutely void . Such is the supremacy of the Constitution over the whole land , and every inhabitant of it . Its binding obligatipn is universal and perpetual . No man or number of men , individually or officially , separately or sectionally , can absolve themselves from it . They can , we have seen , rebel against it - as they may do many other things that they have n* right to do . But they can not relieve themselves from the duty , nor can any other human power do it for them , but the power that created it  --  the people of the United States . Having seen the source and nature of the Constitution , it will be necessary to consider some of its details , in order to ascertain its capacity for self-preservation and defense . A Government without power to continue its own existence in the performance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other good purpose . What is the true meaning , in a republican State , of the plain and undispnted maxim- " that every Coyernrnen t ought to contain in itself the meeitns of its own preservation ? " It certainly does not mean , that every act , essential to an occasional or periodical renovation of the administration , should be performed by the Government itself . This can never // be done by any free Government . A popular Government is not only instituted by the people , but requires the active agency of the people , at least in some of its departments , for prolonging its existence by regular succession . All that the maxim can require , therefore , is that the Government should possess the right to cotumnand , which implies the power to enforce the necessary subordinate agency . iDoes our Constitution confer this right ? We have seen that the Constitutionis supreme law , not only over the country generally , but in each State particularly . Every precept it eont*ins is as valid in every State , upon every man in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their own Constitution , and even more so , inasmuch as it is perpetual and unalterable by them . When the Constitution says that every State officer " shall be bound by oath . . . to support this Constitution , " is this supreme law ? Would it be in the State Constitution ? May the officer take the oath or not , as lie pleases , and still enjoy the honors and emoluments of the office , and all his acts therein be valid ? The very idea of law implies a sanction . If he takes the oath is lie bound by it or not , as lie pleases ? If he violates it , may lie still retain his position , defy the law , and go unpunished ? Similar questions might be asked in regard to every duty imposed by the Constitution on State officers . When they are required to perform certain acts in reference to the election of President , Senators , or Representatives , the requisition is made by the sovereignty , having the right to command in the last resort and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be enforced , it is not our present purpose to inquire ; it is sufficient for the day to show that the obligation is imposed by suprenie law , and that the appropriate departments of the Government are required to execute the law . The department authorized " to make all laws . . . . for carrying into execution the . . . . powers vested . . . . in the Government " may safely be trusted to find out the proper means , whenever they are disposed to use them . " No trace is to be found in the Constitution of an intention to create a dependence of the General Government of the Union on those of the States , for the // execution of the great powers assigned to it . Its means are adequate to its eiids ; and on those means alone was it expected to rely for the accomplishment of its ends . To impose on it the necessity of resorting to means it can not control , which another Government may furnish or withhold , would render its course precarious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dependence on other Governments , which might disappoint its most important designs , and is incompatible with the language of the Constitution . " - The unanimous opinion of the Court , pr . Marshall , C. J. in McCnllock vs . Maryland , 4 Wheat . 424 . " The General Government must cease to exist whenever it loses the power of protecting itself in the exercise of its constitutional powers . " - Pr . Johnson , Jus. in Martin vs . Hunter , 1 Wheat . 363 . " The Federal Governinent may rely upon its own agency in giving effect to the laws . " - Pr . McLean , Jns. in Prigg 's case , 16 Peters . The disposition to render the Government inefficient has more responsibility in this matter than any deficiency in the Constitution . l3ut notwithstandmno ' the almost total absence of all suit-6 able legislation for guarding and controlling the purity of our federal elections , the present attempt to destroy the Government is fortunately not on the ground of any such deficiency . Doubtless an attack of this kind would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is but little time since we have had occasion to see how a prevailing faction in either house of Congress can accommodate themselves with new members to their liking , by jndging of their elections , untrammeled by any law . ( In the case of the IRepresentatives of New Jersey and the Senators of Indiana . ) If the plan had succeeded , at the last presidential election , ot throwing the election upon Congress , with the control of a decided majority in one house , and all but a majority in the other , and i*o organized majority against them , or any adequate statutory regulations to control them , there can be no reasonable doubt but they would have saved themselves from this rebellion , either by keeping the government in their own hands , or by succcssfnlly preventing it from going into any otimer . The contest is now probably upon the only issue safe for the // country . Nothing short of open rebellion and actual war upon the Government would have roused the slumbering patriotism of the nation . As it is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have accomplished its necessary work of well merited castigation , the people will have ascertained that it is not only better , but actually cheaper , to look after their Government , and commit it to honest and competent hands , who will administer it upon the principles on which it was instituted , than to allow its resources to be used and squandered for pampering and arming rogues and rebels , till they are obliged to fight them empty-handed , in order to get rid of them . If the want of power in Congress to prevent the destruction of the Government , by the action or inaction of State governors or legislators , in the matter of federal elections , had been made an objection to the original adoption of the Constitution , the objection would probably have gone unanswered , because it would have been seen to operate against rather than in favor of the objectors . But such an objection was not made . The great statesmen , who defended the Constitution against such objections as were made , could have had no difficulty in proving that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election of a President , and for securing and controlling the purity , regularity , and uniformity of the elections , and returns of Senators and iRepresentatives . But such legislation should be had before the evil occurs , which it might prevent , because when the evil occurs it may be too late . The other powers of the Constitution necessary for a " firm National Government , " adequate to the " preservation of the Union , " may be arranged in different classes , according to the manner in which they are distributed and conferred . 1 . The express powers of Congress , mentioned under seventeen heads in Sec. 8th of Art . 1st , and commonly called the emumerated power8 . These include the great national and legislative powers of war , internal or external ; armies , navies , and militia ; revenue , by taxation or credit ; commerce , internal and external ; offenses on the high seas , and against the law of nations ; and all others necessary and proper for executing all the powers of the Constitution . These powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unrestricted terms , and may be used to the full extent of all the physical power and material resources of the nation , if the present or any future exigency should require it . They are adequate to the defense of the Union , if the nation is , for they bestow all that the nation has . None of these powers have ever been called into exercise , to their full extent , and it may be hoped they never will be . But our fathers saw the impropriety of any attempt to limit them , so long as they could not limit the exigency which might call for them . Several of the enumerated powers have heretofore been very sparingly used , and one of them at least , on the important subject of bankruptcies , is at this moment entirely unrepresented on the statute book . Commerce among the several States is very little regulated by law ; and the law of naturalization is anything but unitbrm , if a late dictum of the Supreme Court is entitled to respect , that every State may naturalize whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rule at all . The post office clause , though made the foundation of a gigantic monopoly , involving the collection and disbursement of a revenue of many millions annually , and the employment of an immense army of officers and agents of all grades and conditions , has never been used for establishing post roads , otherwise than by using common roads previously established by other authority . But any such defects or deficiency of legislation will not prove an inadequacy of the Constitution . 2 . Another class of the powers of Congress are those expressly given by different parts of the Constitution , and not included in the enumerated list . These , though not of equal magnitude with the great national powers of war , revenue , and commerce , are not less numerous than the other class . They include , among others , such subjects as these :  --  the census ; elections of Senators , Representatives and Electors of President , and the mode of their voting ; overruling the Presidential veto ; meetings of Congress ; presents , offices , &amp;c. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and consenting to others ; vacancies in the offices of President and Vice-President ; appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court ; // trial of crimes committed without the limits of any State ; the punishment of treason ; their own compensation ; tax on the importation of persons ; creating and appointing officers ; proof and effect of State records ; admission of new States ; regulation of territories ; and amending the Constitution . On all these snbjects the Constitntion confers on Congress important express powers , not in the enumerated list , many of which have been sparingly exercised , and others not at all . 3 . A third class of the powers of Congress is not conferred by express grant , but indirectly , as the necessary result of certain express restrictions , as the power of the abolition of the slave trade after 1807 , by the express prohibition of its being done before 1808 . This is doubtless included , as also the interState slave trade , in the commercial power ; but if it were not , it would result from this restriction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly correct to say the power is conferred by the restriction in any sense . Put such is the absurdity of limiting the exercise of a non-existing power , that the act of inserting the limitation is positive proof or express admission that the power itself does exist , though its precise place may not elsexvhere be found . Similar to this is the provision relating to the suspension of habea8 eorpu&amp; The Constitution nowhere confers the privilege of this writ , or expressly authorizes its suspension . Put in the ninth section , by limiting the suspension to two special cases , it clearly acknowledges that the privilege may be granted , and also suspended , under the Constitution . It does not say who may do either . This must be ascertained from other parts of the Constitution . The privilege has in fact been conferred by act of Congress , and stands on that foundation only . Is that act irrepealable ? The power to grant the writ is given by law to the Judges of the Supreme Court . May that power be revoked by law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away altogether ? Who can hinder either ? By the practice of the government , all the inferior courts may themselves be repealed and abolished by Congress . What then becomes of ltabea8 earpu* ? If any desire had existed to restrain the plenary power of Congress over this whole subject , something would // have been done very different from this negative provision regarding occasional and temporary snspension . This provision looks to something much less formidable , and much more easily circnmvented than the power of Congress . It is in fact designed only as a qualification of the military power in time of war . Nothing can be inferred against this view , from its location in the ninth section , for of the seven clauses in that section , three of them certainly , and perhaps more , have no exclusive reference to the legislative department . The cases of rebellion and invasion , to which alone this suspension is restricted , are cases of internal war ; and precisely the cases where the executive and military power is likely to be most active and efficient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be available for a purpose like this , required for the public safety . Indeed , the existence of internal war , whether civil or foreign , necessarily carries with it all the rights of war , which is but another name for martial law , and for the time being , and within the range demanded by the public safety , according to the views of those responsible for its administration , is paramount to all other law , habeas corpus inclusive . And when the Constitution says , as it does substantially , that in cases of rebellion and invasion , it maybe suspended , it means , as it does , by similar phraseology , in some other places , that it is suspended ipso facto , so far forth as the circumstances require , in the opinion of those it has made responsible for the public safety . By the law of war , martial law , you umay destroy your enemy and all that he has . You may seize his goods , devastate his fields , appropriate his horses and cattle , burn his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kill him , and all his associates and abettors . But if you catch him alive , he may have habeas corpus against you , say your opponents , and be set at liberty by your own umagistrates , to exercise again the same belligerent rights against you . If his slave comes into your possession , you must not set him at large , or let him go free , but return him to his master , to be used against you for your own destruction . The whole doctrine is too preposterous to be reasoned about . // There is but one other instance where the Constitution has attempted to place any civil right , beyond the control of the military power in time of war , internal or external , and that regards the quartering of troops in private houses , without the consent of the owner . This should be previously regulated by law . iI3nt if Congress should continue to neglect this duty , as they have many others , and a case should arise in which the 8a1u8 popzdi should , clearly and unequivocally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this right , Constitution and all , for the time being , would not rightfully be swept by the board . The whole is to be sure under the control of the President , in whom is vested the executive power . The law martial , like the law civil , is to be " faithfully executed " by him . But it is to be executed , like all other law , under the hi0h responsibilities of his office , for the safety of the people , and the preservation of their Government . A power to lay a capitation tax in proportion to the census , is another of a similar nature , resulting from a prohibition to do it otherwise . There may be others of the same kind ; but they would all probably be found to be included in some more direct grant , in another part of the Constitution , and so not rest exclusively on the negation , with which they are connected . 4 . The fourth class of the powers of Congress includes the legislation required in the execution of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express power of Congress , included in the enumerated list . But in its application to the general powers of the Government , and its departments , not embraced under the foregoing heads , it requires a separate consideration . The Constitution is a body of fundamental precepts and rules established for the government of the nation , and is the supreme law of the land . These precepts and rules constitute the powers of the Government , and are vested by the Constitution ; and all the laws necessary and proper for carrying them into execution Congress is authorized to make . ft is not essential that each of these precepts should be addressed to one particular department exclusively ; but being in the Constitn // tion , and being supreme law , they are to be executed by the proper department ; and if any legislation is requisite for that purpose , it is the duty of Congress to furnish it . This principle is as old as the government itself , and as indisputable . It was adopted and applied in the first legislative act under the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , in full force , unrepealed , and unquestioned to this day . It was for carrying into execution that clause of the sixth article , which requires State Officers to be bound by oath to support the Constitution . The clause in terms vested no power in the government , or any department , or officer thereof , and required nothing of the State governments in the matter . It provided no oath in form , no time or place for taking it , and no authority for administering or recording it . It perhaps , though somewhat equivocally , made it the duty of the officers to take some such oath , but without penalty for delay , refnsal , or breach of it . In these circumstances Con - congress undertook to legislate-their first act of legislation under the Constitution . The bill was introduced by a committee chosen for the purpose , which included two Virginians , Mr. Madison being one , and besides the present enactments , contained a penal clause , which was omitted on the suggestion by several members , that the oath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their acts would be void . Still it was objected to by one who had been a member of the Convention , had refused to sign the Constitution , and had actively and constantly opposed it from the beginning . The principles of the objection involved the whole doctrine necessary to defeat the action of the Constitution , render it inefficient , and utterly inadequate to the exit encies of Government and the preservation of the Union . It was well stated by Mr. Gerry in these words : " There is no provision for empowering the Government of the United States , or any officer or department thereof , to pass a law obligatory on the members of the legislatures of the several States , and other officers thereof , to take this oath . " The objection was formally answered by Mr. Lawrence , of New York , as follows : " It has been said by one gentle von . xxi. 5 // man , that Congress has not the power to carry this regulation into effect . Only a few words will be necessary to convince gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution that its ordinances shall be the supreme law of the land . If the Constitution is the supreme law of the land , every part of it must partake of this supremacy ; consequently , every general declaration it contains is the supreme law . But then these general declarations can not be carried into effect , without particular regulations adapted to the circumstances . These particular regulations are to be made by Congress , who , by the Constitution , have power to make all laws necessary or proper to carry the declarations of the Constitution into effect . The Constitution likewise declares that the members of the State legislatures , and all officers , executive and judicial , shall take an oath to support the Constitution . This ' declaration is general , and it lies with the supreme legislature to detail and regulate it . The law is to supply the necessary means of executing the principle laid down ; for how can it be carried into effect in any other manner * This explanation , I trust , will convince gentlemen , that the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This answer seems to have been entirely satisfactory . Mr. Bland , of Virginia , Mr. Jackson , of Georgia , Mr. Sylvester , of New York , and Mr. Sherman , of Connecticut , said substantially they had no doubt of the power , and Mr. Boudinot , of New Jersey , said it was the duty of Congress to pass it agreeably to the reasoning of Mr. Lawrence . Accordingly the bill passed both houses , so far as appears , without division , and was approved by President Washington . Thus early was it settled , even by the first legislative act under the Government , which has been in force and practiced upon with approbation ever since , that ever*y precept of the Constitution , being supreme law , and a power of the Government , is to be carried into effect , so far as legislation is necessary , by appropriate acts of Congress . Congress , to be sure , may not impose new duties on State officers , as such , thereby rendering them , for certain purposes , officers of the General Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the Constitution , had the same // right to impose duties on them officially , and on all the inhabitants individually , and in the aggregate as a political body , in this Constitution as in their own local Constitution . They have done all three , and might have given Congress the right to do the same . They have in fact only required of Congress to provide for the execution by State officers of the duties imposed by themselves . The principle has not only been so long practiced upon and approved in this instance , but it has been repeatedly applied in other cases , and for aught now known to the contrary , as often as it has been wanted for the protection of any southern right ; but when wanted to protect the rights of northern citizens in southern States it has not been applied . The very next Congress in February , 1793 , on the same principle passed an act for reclaiming fugitives from justice , and fngitives from labor . The clauses of the 2d Section of the 4th Article , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any power in Congress on the subject , nor any , the most remote , allusion to any legislation in the matter , by any authority whatever , State or National . The only possible ground , on which such legislation can be claimed or justified , is that the ordinances of the Constitution are supreme law , to be executed , like other powers vested in the Government , * through the appropriate legislation of Congress . The act . originated in this way . In 1791 , a controversy arose betweca Virginia and Pennsylvania , in regard to the surrender of a fugitive from justice . The Attorney General of Virginia , to whom the demand was referred , held that as the manner in which the delivery and removal was to be effected , was not . prescribed in the Constitution , the demand could not be complied with by the Governor of Virginia , without some addi * It is not a little curious to observe that the exact grammatical readin " ' of the b third clause of the second section , is , that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " &amp;c escaping into another " &amp;c shall be delivered up , " &amp;c . No person is the only nominative case throughout the sentence . This is in exact conformity with the Levitical law on the same subject . it is not perhaps quite so surprising that our pious friends of the South , though strict constructionists , have never insisted on this reading of the Constitution . // tional provision by law , to enable him to do so . The Governor adopted this view , and expressed a hope that Congress would legislate on the snb*ject . The Governor of Pennsylvania transmitted the whole of the papers to the President , with the snggestion that by the interposition of the Federal Legislature , similar difficnlties in future might be obviated . The President laid the matter before Congress , and ont of it grew the Act of 1793 . When it had quietly performed its office for over half a century , its constitutionality , particularly that part of it relating to fugitives from labor , was drawn in question in Prigg 's case , reported in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pr . Story , J. say , " It has been argned , that the Act of Congress is unconstitutional becanse it does not fall within the scope of any of the enumerated powers of legislation confided to that body ; and therefore it is void . Stripped of its artificial structure , the argument comes to this , that although rights are exclusively secured by , or duties exclnsively imposed upon , the Kational Government , yet unless the power to enforce these rights , or to execute these duties , can be found among the express powers of legislation enumerated in the Constitution , they remain without any means of giving them effect by any Act of Congress , *nd must operate solely proprio vigore , however defective may be their operation ; nay , even although , in a practical sense , they may become a nullity for the want of a proper remedy to enforce them , or to provide against their violation . If this be the true interpretation of the Constitution , it must in a great measure fail to attam many of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a recognition of duties . Such a limited constrnction of the Constitution has never yet been adopted as correct , either in theory or practice . INo one has ever supposed that Congress could constitutionally , by its legislation , exercise powers , or enact laws , beyond the powers delegated to it by the Constitution ; but it has , on various occasions , exercised powers , which were necessary and proper as means to carry into effect rights expressly given , and duties expressly enjoined thereby . The end being required , it has been deemed a just and necessary implication , that the means to accomplish it // are given also ; or , in other words , that the power flows as a necessary means to accomplish the end . " The Court say in another place , " The National Government in the absence of all positive provisions to the contrary , is bound , through its proper departments , legislative , judicial , or executive , to carry into effect all the rights and duties imposed upon it by the Constitution . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Constitution , but all the rules , regulations , precepts , ordinances , and prohibitions , contained in it , as the supreme law of the land ? On one or two points of the case there was a division of opinion in the Court , but no judge expressed any dissent from the opinion or the reasoning on this point . In 1850 an additional act was passed on the same subject , involving a new examination and a reaffirmation of the same principles of construction , by every department of the Government . It is not intended that all the provisions of the new act were deserving of approbation , but that the general authority and duty of Congress to legislate for the execution of that part of the Constitution was all but universally sanctioned . The same principle that all the provisions of the Constitution are to be executed through the agencyof Congress , if required , has been practiced upon in divers other instances , extending through the whole history of the Government . The Court , in the opinion last cited , mention several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for carrying into effect treaties made with other nations , for protecting members of Congress from arrest &amp;c . Others still might have been added to the list , as laws for organizing the executive departments , publishing the receipts and expenditures of the Government , fixing the compensation of the President unalterably during his term , and of the Judges not to be diminished during theirs , &amp;c . In none of these cases is any authority or duty specially assigned to Congress ; but the Constitution prescribes and enjoins certain things , the execution of which by the Government demands leo'islation and Congress , 6 as in duty bound , has furnished it . Many other ordinances and injunctions , rights and duties , // sanctioned and prescribed by the Constitution , have been allowed to remain altogether inert and nuexecuted , except so far as they could execute themselves , proprio vi gore , unaided by any appropriate legislation of Congress . And what is this ip.sissirnus vigor of the Constitution , but a part of the powers of the Government , for the complete execution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and proper ? Citizens of every State are entitled to all the privileges of citizens in all the States ; yet this right has been constantly violated , under the eye of the Government , without any attempt to enforce it by any appropriate action of Congress . In one instance , an authorized agent of a State was sent into another , to institute legal proceedings for testing , by judicial decision , the actual validity of this constitutional right , and was forcibly prevented and expelled from the State , contrary to law , and without remedy . The power of Congress to remedy the evil , by adequate laws , has never been questioned by any competent authority . It is distinctly admitted in Mr. Tucker 's Commentary on l3lackstone , and by Chief Justice Taney and many other authorities of southern proclivities , but it has not been applied . The clause of guarantee ( Article IV , Section 4 ) has received no legislative construction , and been furnished with no legislative aid for its administration ; but it has a significance not to be overlooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subordinate responsible position of the States , are ideas inseparably and endlessly involved in this guaranty as to the form of State Governments . If the subordinate must , in any respect , approve itself to the superior , it can not change its relative position , nor shake off the supremacy of the Union . New States may be admitted into it , but when admitted none can constitutionally ever get out . They are promised protection against invasion , rtolens volens , and against domestic violence , on request . Is not the power to fulfill these engagements , among the powers vested by the Constitution in the Government ? Are these duties directly imposed on the Governument , by the people , for their own benefit , and the power // to perform them denied ? Oredat qui pote8t . The State Governments must not only be preserved in republican form , and defended in the exercise of their appropriate functions by the power of the General Government , according to the guaranty , but they must be held to the actual performance of those functions by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued existence of the General Government itseltl No State shall enter into any alliance , or coi federation ; or make any agreement or compact with another State , or with a foreign power . The States are also prohibited from discharging any fugitive from labor , due under the laws of another State , from the claims warranted by such laws . Did any person ever surmisc that these and other important prohibitions were left to be conformed to or not , at the option of the party so bound , without any power vested in the General Government to enforce them ? It there is such power it may and must be exerted through the legislation of Congress . The Constitution says , among other things respecting States and their officers , that the executive authority of a State shall , in certain cases , issue writs of election , and that State judges shall be bound by the supreme law of the land , and they are all under oath to obey the Constitution . The General Governmnent is created for the purpose , and vested with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Congress is bound to furnish the necessary legislation for the purpose . So that these amid all other duties enjoined by the Constitution on the State Officers , or individuals , or on the States themselves , are enjoined by a competent authority , the real sovereignty , having the right to command , and are committed to the Government for execution , with all the powers and means necessary and proper for its accomplishment . We arrive at the same result , if , after considering the powers vested by the Constitution in the Government generally , we examine the different departments of the Government in detail . 1st . The Legislative . All the Legislative powers of the Governmuent are vested in the Congress of the United States . These powers *extend to // the making of all laws necessary and proper for the execution of all the powers , precepts , ordinances , rights , duties , and prohibitions of the Constitution . It is the duty of Congress , therefore , to legislate to this extent . 2d . The Executive . The Executive power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . His duty extends to the faithful execution of all the laws , most certainly including the great fundamental and supreme law of the land , the Constitution itself , and every part and portion of it . He is under a solemn oath to perform the whole of this duty . The execution of it is therefore a power , the executive power , vested by the Constitution in this departm6nt of the Government , and to be carried into full effect , by the aid of all necessary and proper laws , to be made for the purpose by Congress . 3d . The Judicial ; The Judicial power of the Government is vested in the Supreme Court , and such others as Congress may establish , and extends to all cases in law or equity arising under the Constitution or any part of it . Every article and clause in it involves some precept , ordinance , right , duty , or prohibition , liable to become the subject or the incident of some litigation between party and party , interested in its construction , evasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases and carry their decision into execution , according to the forms of law ; States themselves , in their political capacity , are directly subject to the jurisdiction of this department , in all cases where they may become parties . This , then , is a power vested by the Constitution in this department of the Government , and may extend to the construction and execution of every word in it . All the laws necessary and proper to enable this department of the government to execute the duty must be muade by Congress . Thus we see , whether we view the Government in the aggregate , or as divided in separate departments , the powers vested by the Constitution extend to the execution of the whole Constitution and every part of it , by the Government , or some department or officer thereof . The decisive and unanswera // ble argument in support of the principle is the early and considerate adoption of it in practice , by the first Congress , composed of the original makers and ratifiers of the Constitution , and the continued and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole nation , from that day to the present time . The provisions of the Constitution are the measure of the powers of the Government , and adequate to all the purposes for which it was made . Our fathers made it and put it into successful operation , under circumstances vastly more discouraging than those in which we are now called upon to defend it . If we fail of performing worthily the part devolving upon us , as our fathers did not the part devolving upon them , we shall prove ourselves unworthy of them , and unworthy of the rich inheritance they have left us.
