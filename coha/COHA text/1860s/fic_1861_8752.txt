Enter Kenneth and Mabel . Ken . Kenneth Peace , peace , good Mabel . Mab . Mabel That ever I was born to see this day ! Ken . Kenneth I am an old man , and in my three-score years I have never found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little child , crouching at the winter hearth , I believed in them . Old as I am , I believe in them still . It is said that in sleep the immortal soul reads in the form of parables , revealment of the future , sometimes not easily interpreted . Ken . Kenneth You make me almost believe in your fears ; tho ' it is a foolish fear . Mab . Mabel And then the legend ! When haughty might Down-crushes right : When humble foes And high oppose  --  Listen the wail Of Liddesdale ! Ken . Kenneth A silly rhyme . But what was thy dream ? Mab . Mabel I thought I was awake  --  it seemed so like noonday truth  --  I was , I know not when nor where : all things gloomed darkly . I saw them dimly , as through the storm-cloud we sometimes mark the sun 's place in the sky . Suddenly , I felt that I stood in the white chamber : it was brightly lighted with beaming eyes , gay forms flitted about , glad voices spoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  thick , deep darkness  --  shrouded all . Ken . Kenneth Why , this is not so terrible , Mabel . I read good bodement here . Methinks this may foreshadow the marriage of our dear young lady with the brave Master of Maxwell . We shall all be so happy that day , Mabel . Mab . Mabel But hear me Kenneth ; the worst is yet to come . I ran to the window to let the daylight in  --  the sky was overcast , not with dark , dun clouds that threaten rain or storm , but with blood-red clouds , and from them wept thick , crimson drops . Ken . Kenneth A dreaming fancy of the wounded deer , that fell yesterday at your feet and died . Mab . Mabel No , Kenneth ; woe is me , no ! Then I saw a proud eagle pounced on by a wicked hawk  --  its beak and talons tore it deep , deep and deeper , till blood  --  the very color of the clouds  --  oozed out . Ken . Kenneth This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day , were like the eagle of your dream . Mab . Mabel At last the hawk tore out the eagle 's heart , and shook it revengefully at a cooing dove that perched upon a blighted rowan tree . The innocent moaned a bitter moan , and then fell down  --  dead upon the ground . Ken . Kenneth What of the hawk , then ? Mab . Mabel I saw no more ; tears blinded my eyes . Oh ! woe is me , Kenneth , I saw no more ; but a voice in the air murmured the legend  --  bitterly , Kenneth , bitterly . Ken . Kenneth Art well this morning ? Last night thou wert feverish and disturbed in sleep . Thy nerves are shaken yet . Where is the quaigh ? Good Mabel , let me fill it with usquebaugh  --  thou wilt not , that by thy pillow , have such dreams again . Mab . Mabel You are kind , and usquebaugh is very wholesome . You do not reverence dreams , Kenneth ? Ken . Kenneth I can not say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less than heresy to doubt Omens , Ghosts and Spirits ; our Lord and Lady , their forebears , too , believed in them . These we may not doubt . Mab . Mabel No , truly . But the usquebaugh ? Ken . Kenneth When comes the Master of Maxwell ? Mab . Mabel My lady looks for him at noon . I hope our chief will be kind ; but why he brings Lord Hume so often to the castle , or why they are such friends , I know not . What do you think , Kenneth ? Ken . Kenneth We must not question our chief 's intents  --  we must obey his will . But Lord Hume , I think , looks on our dear young mistress with an eye of love . Mab . Mabel Ah , Kenneth ! never will she give her love for his ; he is not gentle like the brave young Maxwell . He has not such an eye ; no , nor such a smile , but cold , cold and reserved . Ken . Kenneth Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more with thy idle dreamings , Mabel . Why should one so innocent be troubled with thy fantasies ? Come , Mabel . Mab . Mabel You spoke of usquebaugh ! Ken . Kenneth You shall have the quaigh , full  --  and a brancher pie besides . Mab . Mabel It is their season  --  nearly . Usquebaugh is very wholesome . Exeunt . ACT I. Scene I.  --  A woody , wild and mountain pass . Bugles . A March . Enter Lord Hume , Ker of Cessford , Johnstone , of Lochwood and followers . Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood Well , here we are before him . Patience , friends ; If he come not at the appointed moment , I 'll warrant ' t is an honest cause detains him . Cess . Ker , of Cessford The Three Estates are suddenly convened , And Liddesdale , perchance , delays to learn If pliant tools have passed the threatened law . Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood Dare they ? For what ? To please a baby king , A froward boy , who under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired , our sovereign seems resolved To turn reformer and amend the world . Cess . Ker , of Cessford The English mother 's , and French uncle 's sway , During a long minority , he swears , Has soured the nobles , nurtured discontent , And spread disloyalty throughout the realm : That , in especial , on the borders , here , In derogation of the sovereign power , We have usurped the law , and dared chastise The English thieves and beat them to their homes . Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood What else , sir , should we do ? Look tamely on , With visor up and sword undrawn , and thank The greedy knaves for ravaging our lands ; Or , in the spirit of our fathers rise , And strike the invaders down ? Cess . Ker , of Cessford No , Lochwood , no : But on our knees at Holy-rood should fall , Weep o'er our wrongs , and humbly pray the king Would graciously vouchsafe his royal aid , And shield us from injustice ! Loch . Johnstone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that : but I am blunt  --  Some say discourteous . May the wrath of heaven Strike me this instant dead , ere I would learn To play the sycophant , or court the aid Of living man , though twenty times a king . What says Lord Hume ? Hume . Lord Hume I pray you , pardon me : My mind was wandering . Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood Cessford , thy ear : Our friend , whose life is a romance  --  that is , His heart turns woman-ward  --  is musing now On Liddesdale 's fair daughter . She 's a gem ! Hume . Lord Hume She is a maid as innocent and free , As ever brushed the dew-drop from the flower , Or smiled in sweetness to the jocund Spring ; Of mind withal , as dignified and kind As ever graced the banquet or the chase . A March . Enter Liddesdale , Carnegie , Lords and followers . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale Good morrow : ' save ye gentlemen and friends ; The sun rules fiercely in meridian height , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Carnegie . Thou know'st the pledge on which I spared thy life , Look to it well : if thou by breath or sign Declare thou art not what thou feign'st  --  thou diest . But thou must faithful as my shadow be , The secret listener of my vassals ' words , That I , of all , may sure advantage take , None knowing of the source . I cry your mercy . Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood Here have we waited , noble Chief , to learn The latest news of these disjointed times . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale I am attainted , and my truest friends , With terms opprobrious added to their names , Are held as contumacious to the king . Cess . Ker , of Cessford No , not to him  --  but to his evil counsellors And unjust laws , stand we in opposition . Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood What treason talk they of ? Liddes . Lord Liddesdale It is alleged That we , in violation of the peace With England 's king , have slain and robbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general safety of the realms . Revived ! This hatred which the borderers nurse , Has been , through time , the motion of the heart , And we shall cherish it , while Southron churls , Stuffed to the throat  --  look on us with disdain . Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood I hate the English as I do the devil . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale Our lands are now declared the common prey , Our kinsmen thieves , and we , believe it , rebels , To be pursued by sleugh hound , fire and sword . What ! are we aliens here , or what are we , That they dare hunt us like the ravenous wolves , Or think to do it ? Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood Are we crushed already ? Cess . Ker , of Cessford I 'm glad ; yes , very glad  --  for we shall prove What men may do when conscious of the right . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale Yes , right ! When English knaves have crossed the march , And from our plenty stolen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot  --  or , if they ' scaped , Pursued , and ten times retribution took . For every Scotsman by a Southron slain , I have made twenty bleed . This sacred right , By all confessed the right of self-defence , Is termed a treason  --  and , ye 'll start to hear it , At Edinburgh Cross they 've put me to the Horn , With phrase , freebooter , added to my name . Now , by my sword I swear , from this hour forth , Here , I renounce allegiance to the king , And not alone in my defence I stand , But in his opposition . Judge me , friends , And for yourselves resolve . Cess . Ker , of Cessford I am resolved . Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood And I. Rather than live a passive slave , May hell 's eternal tortures rack my bones . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale Has not my noble Hume a word to say ? I met a friendly greeting from his eye , But not a word . What , dumb ! Thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , As thine did , Cessford  --  on the scaffold suffered  --  He always had a word to spare a friend , And , if his need required , an arm to help . Hume . Lord Hume My lord , excuse me : I was lost in thought . Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood The youth is cautious  --  uncommitted , too  --  Secure his power : thy daughter is the price . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale I understand . Brave youth , we all have thoughts , Sometimes unwelcome ones , that take the mind , As ' t were , a prisoner , and shut it up From the gay troop of pleasant memories That sweeten life , and make us slow to pay The courtesy that 's due . Heard'st thou the news ? Hume . Lord Hume I did , with feelings of regret and pain ; For I suspect the cause is unrevealed , And a false issue most ignobly urged . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale What think'st ? Hume . Lord Hume Thou art too powerful : monarchs ever fear A powerful subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hume . Lord Hume Why in especial art thou singled out For royal hate ? Thy independent mind , By valiant clansmen aided , dares the right . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale And will maintain it , spite of all the world . Hume . Lord Hume For this thou'rt feared ; for this must be subdued , The sooner , surer , as the adage runs . Cess . Ker , of Cessford I marvel much this struck me not before ; The thought seems like an old familiar friend , Forgotten long  --  but instantly as seen , Is recognized and loved . Hume . Lord Hume The reason 's plain  --  When French and English regents ruled the land , And fierce contention shook it to the core , Thou stood'st aloof from profitless revolts , And used thy power to vindicate thy rank : While in the Lothians and the land of Fife , In the far Mearns and distant northern isles , Revenge and hate crushed Scotland 's bravest men . And there , a weak nobility abide , Who , for self-interest or in fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than thy years ! Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood Old as I am , I never thought so far ! ' T is gospel truth . Cess . Ker , of Cessford Words , with electric fire , that rouse men up To deeds the world my look on and admire . Hume . Lord Hume Wert thou subdued , he turns his arms ' gainst me , In which succeeding , then comes Cessford 's turn , Or honest Johnstone , thine  --  singly we fall , And our dear Scotland is a mart of slaves . Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood We must brush up our armor  --  that I see . Cess . Ker , of Cessford Which is the worse  --  endurance or redress ? Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood Endurance : may annihilation come Rather than base submission to our wrongs . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale Let him or his with hostile front approach , Yes , let him step one inch upon my land ; And , by my father 's unattainted name , He 'll sorely rue the day . Hume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oppressor , patriots we  --  Success is sovereign law . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale Brave , noble youth ! Long have I looked with pride upon thy growth ; I 've seen a spirit swelling in thy blood , A courage in thy heart , presaging greatness . Hume . Lord Hume I 'll die , my lord , to merit good men 's praise . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale Not die , but fight thou may'st . I have a treasure , Dear to my heart as liberty or life  --  A noble , brave and generous lord is he Who wins her hand . Increase in thy desert , And I may whisper in her gentle ear , Thou art her father 's friend . Hume . Lord Hume I 'm thine forever . Cess . Ker , of Cessford Hast heard the Wardens met last night in council ? Liddes . Lord Liddesdale I hear it from my spies . With them convened Time-serving nobles , and base-hearted chiefs  --  A herald , as I learn , will soon proclaim The foul decision of this Warden-Court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t is said . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale The name of Maxwell is my seated hate , And festers in my heart . One of that house Once marched disdainful past my castle gate , with pennon streaming and with vizor closed , With bugles sounding and with glaive unsheathed , Despite all rule and token of respect . This insult , in fit time , I will revenge . Hume . Lord Hume The Master is a visitor of thine . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale Doubt not , nor fear . I have already said That I will whisper in my daughter 's ear Thy name and my regard . Hume . Lord Hume I 'll gladly peril My all , save honor , for her priceless hand . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale I 've promised thee : no thanks . On to our Castle . Exeunt . Scene II .  --  Liddel Castle : around the room and on the walls are seen implements and trophies of war and chase . Lady Christina engaged in embroidery . Lady C. Lady Christina An idle dream ! and yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our house . On ride or raid my father is abroad ; He is the last in whom exists our name , No son has he to inherit his renown ; And I , a maid , when married , like a brook Whose current mingles with some noble stream , Am then my former self no more . Ah me ! Much I lament these wild , distracted times ; For England 's Henry , and old Scotland 's James , With frowning brows regard the border lords  --  And then the history of my foolish heart , Is chequered , like love 's tale , with hopes and fears . Enter Mabel . Come hither , nurse : sing me the " Bonny Page . " Mab . Mabel I can not sing , and least of all , that song . Lady C. Lady Christina It is indeed a melancholy air : The plaintive notes embody forth the verse , As they were one , both at a thought inspired  --  And , by the minstrel 's magic power , they reach The fount of feeling and subdue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sigh , my lady ; maids less fair Have been of beauty vain . Tell me , what think'st ? Does not young Maxwell love thee for thyself ? Ah , now thou smilest ? Lady C. Lady Christina Thou'rt old and foolish , Mabel . Mab . Mabel There is a something in his beaming eye , I know not what , that cheers and wins the heart  --  And when he smiles , no wonder woman loves . May heaven bless him ! Lady C. Lady Christina An old enthusiast thou . Behold the children on yon grassy knoll , Health in their cheeks and pleasure in their eyes , And every look is redolent of joy . How lithe each limb ! how earnest every bound ! No bitter thought through all the sunny hours , No feverish dream through all the solemn night , They touch the pillow and are blest with sleep ! Hark to their gladsome voices ! Mab . Mabel I little thought , When thou , like them , ran'st on the velvet sward , That I should live to see thy mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul ! Lady C. Lady Christina Hush , Mabel , hush : my father comes , and Hume , Whose presence is a pain : yet I must smile , And mask with mirth the sadness of my heart . Enter Liddesdale , Hume , Lochwood and Cessford . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale My honored friends ! She 's taken by surprise ; Her nurse and needle , signs of love and thrift , Ye see beside her . Daughter , be thou kind . Aside . Hume . Lord Hume How fares your ladyship ? Lady C. Lady Christina Unruly times Scare timid woman : save for these , I 'm well . From the chase my lord ? Hume . Lord Hume Yes , and fleet of foot Were dogs and deer , that made the richer sport . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale More than the trophies of the chase I 've brought For thee , my child . Lady C. Lady Christina Indeed ! Liddes . Lord Liddesdale My heart 's dear pride ! Thy love , obedience , and thy gentle nature , Deserve my ceaseless care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For thou art ever kind : say , what hast thou ? Beseech thee tell , nor overtask my guess . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale She is my daughter ! Go , bid Kenneth bring  --  He 'll understand  --  I gave him charge withal . Exit Mabel . Lady C. Lady Christina Thou would'st surprise me . Well ! know'st thou , my lord ? Hume . Lord Hume I may not tell . Lady C. Lady Christina Or thou ? Lochwood . Johnstone , of Lochwood I must be mute . Lady C. Lady Christina What ! mystery here ! I shall be patient , Incurious , too  --  though it may shame the adage . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale Thou shalt be satisfied : they come . Re-enter Mabel , with Kenneth and Carnegie . The Mute , at the motion of Liddesdale , kneels at the feet of Lady Christina . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale Thy page ! Daughter , I spared his life for thee . Lady C. Lady Christina For me ! Liddes . Lord Liddesdale An humble serf of not ungraceful mien  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have slain him had not chance revealed He is a mute ; for that I spared his life , On one condition  --  ' t was by signs expressed  --  That he should serve thy bidding . Lady C. Lady Christina Is he mute ! " I must be mute "  --  my lord , I understand . ' T is sure a strange presentment to a maid . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale A fancy , sweet , which thou may'st easier question Than I give answer . Lady C. Lady Christina Rise : I will be kind . No tongue to speak , no ear to hear , alas ! Thou hast an eye ; perchance a faithful heart , Nobler , since utterance is denied . Arise . Carnegie rises . Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood It were a want important to a dame . Lady C. Lady Christina My lord , take care , else I with worthy cause , May challenge thy respect and love for us . Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood I am too old and tough to fret my heart About the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Liddesdale I did not look for uninvited guests . Who comes ? Mab . Mabel My lord , I guess . Lady Christina motions her to silence . I 'll speak the truth aside to her . Master of Maxwell we expect to-day . Hume . Lord Hume Expected ! Liddes . Lord Liddesdale Kenneth , bid him to our presence exit Ken . To Hume . To her we owe the first intelligence Of his approach  --  but being at our gate We 'll not deny admittance . Lady C. Lady Christina Aside . Mabel , Mabel ! Cess . Ker , of Cessford To Hume . What , jealous ! never fear . Re-enter Kenneth and Master of Maxwell . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale Good morrow , sir . M. of Max . Master of Maxwell Thanks for thy welcome : Good morrow , gentlemen . How thrives the flower of Liddesdale to-day ? Lady C. Lady Christina I thank ye , well . Thy ride I hope was pleasant . M. of Max . Master of Maxwell With thoughts of thee . Hume . Lord Hume Observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes . Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood Yes , like love 's torches Of which the poet dreams  --  I never saw them . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale Be not , fair hostess , partial in your smiles ; If to each guest you mete not equal favor , The welcome loses courtesy and grace . Lady C. Lady Christina I thank you , father , for this admonition ; But latest come may claim the latest smile : That paid , to all I owe a like respect . M. of Max . Master of Maxwell Carnegie ! Aside . Carn . Carn Hush ! Aside . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale Our hostess gives us welcome ; We shall accept it kindly and be glad . Lady C. Lady Christina I can not talk of chase or war in phrase To match your cunning  --  then , no welcome 's there . But I 've a fawn , a falcon strong of wing , A hound well-shaped , whose speed is like the wind 's : And in a cabinet of curious work There are strange relics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . Come with me , lords , come to the eastern chamber ; There , I 'll essay  --  and with impartial smiles  --  To give such welcome as my skill affords . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale Brave , dearly prized ! Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood Or , would ye imitate The pious abbot 's sacrificing life , Why cards , or dice , or tables ye may play , And she , perchance , will join : in faith , I ca n't . M. of Max . Master of Maxwell Or chess , a game her gentleness admires . Mab . Mabel And she , my lords , can play and sweetly sing , And show such needlework . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale Her privilege ! Old foolish nurse , she deems my daughter 's skill Should , in your sager judgment , as in hers , Out-challenge all the world . Mab . Mabel Mark well the tapestry that adorns the walls ; ' T is , as I 'm told , the ancient Trojan tale , Her dear hand wrought it all . Liddes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my daughter 's thoughts Delight to linger with , should charm your minds ; As well might she enjoy our sterner moods  --  But , on , my noble friends . Hume takes Lady Christina 's hand . Lady C. Lady Christina Lead on , my lords . All , except . Carnegie , exeunt . Carn . Carn ' T is better than my best desire , I 'm sure ; There is a guiding star to just revenge . Man never yet was wronged , if he that 's wronged , Waited and watched , but found the avenging hour ; And this base lord shall feel my father 's shame In very kind . And yet , my heart relents  --  Why should the guiltless for the guilty die ! If Maxwell speak , all 's lost . He 's here in danger : Mine be the task to save him . Grant , kind Heaven , That I may be an instrument of good , Upholding justice and confounding crime ; Grant my soul 's wish , that this foul , lustful lord  --  Re-enter Liddesdale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why followed not the rest ? Carn . Carn I waited to obey . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale Come hither , sirrah ! I doubt : nearer ! If false , make peace with heaven . Carn . Carn Preserver of my life  --  my master for't . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale Speak low , and feign as if by signs you speak : I will not even trust my castle walls . Carn . Carn Why shouldst thou doubt when I have sworn to serve ? Liddes . Lord Liddesdale I will believe : if once I doubt , beware  --  I 'll pluck thy tongue out from its rooted throat , And drive thee from my presence , mute indeed . Sirrah , begone . Exit Carnegie . Freebooter , I am called ! That sole addition to a name like mine Stirs up my blood against the allied kings , And ne'er shall slumber till I am avenged . Lord Hume I must secure ; arrange her dower , Which done , the clerk shall instantly engross And all 's complete . For Maxwell I 'll provide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll live the terror of each hostile chief , And in the borders rule , despite the king . Exit . ACT II . Scene I.  --  Liddel Castle : Enter Lady Christina and Master of Maxwell . Mabel , Kenneth and Carnegie attending . M. of Max . Master of Maxwell Why , dearest , art thou sad ? Tell me the cause , For I must share , or else assuage thy grief . Lady C. Lady Christina Lately my father has expressed a wish That I should favor Hume . I hate the man ! Frequent his visits : he 's this instant here  --  Through tedious hours I must endure his presence , When all my thoughts turn to an absent one . M. of Max . Master of Maxwell Turn they to me ? Lady C. Lady Christina Why ask ? Thou know'st , dear lord , Where all my fondest fancies stray . M. of Max . Master of Maxwell I do , And in that knowledge is supremest bliss . Lady C. Lady Christina Lord Hume is powerful : in these stormy times My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our loves . M. of Max . Master of Maxwell I am to blame  --  I should ere this our secret have confessed And sought approval : but young blood is wild And stops not to consult the frigid rules That courtesy applauds . I will amend , Seek him this moment and implore his blessing . Lady C. Lady Christina I tremble : go , and if in pliant mood , Tell him I 'll never love another man . M. of Max . Master of Maxwell His happiness is thine : he would not risk Thy peace for twenty times the power of Hume . Sweet one retire ; I hope ere daylight fades , With free consent to claim thee for my bride . Lady C. Lady Christina Go , speak with gentle and entreating words , For he is sometimes choleric when chaffed ; Perhaps thy asking may provoke his ire , ( I fear that he inclines not to my choice ) And he may rather chide than answer kindly . If thou but see'st the dawning of his anger , Press not the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dear lord , adieu ; I shall in patience wait , But with an anxious heart : speed thy return ! M. of Max . Master of Maxwell Dear life , be glad : give not a thought to fear , For I ere long shall conqueror-like return And take thee captive , thus . Till then farewell . Exeunt Lady Christina , Mabel and Kenneth . Now , sirrah , speak : thy presence is a marvel . Carn . Carn I will confess : my lord , in whispers speak ; Listeners are round . I am thy father 's vassal , And thou , his first born , I will die to serve . M. of Max . Master of Maxwell If thou speak that which is approved and true , At peril of mine own I 'll shield thy life . Carn . Carn Thou may'st perchance remember , on the hill That overlooks the Esk , a cottage stands ; The summer 's sun invites the blue-bell there , The honeysuckle and rose-bearing vine . Thy father bounteously on mine bestowed That cot , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a maiden 's smile , The old man 's heart was lightened by her love : Throughout the day she earned the scanty meal , At evening sang the merry border songs , Until my aged sire forgot his years And thought himself again a stalwart man , Out on the chase or mingling in the fray . Among our hills her unaffected grace , Her gentle voice and ever-cheerful smile , Won her the favor of each neighboring swain , And , in our lowly lot , esteemed , admired , She moved a queen ! This maiden was my sister . The moon that wanes as blaze the beltane fires , Beheld her happy , now beholds her grave . M. of Max . Master of Maxwell I may not weep with thee a private sorrow . Why art thou here ? Be brief . Carn . Carn Forgive my tears  --  That is the cause I counterfeit a mute , And in thy presence stand , thus , to be questioned . A sennight since , that maid by ruffian hands Was from her father violently torn  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In vain his grey hairs pleaded for the child His palsied arm no longer could protect . Her streaming eyes and agonizing screams Affected not the heart with passion fired : Dragged  --  aye , she to a pander 's house was dragged , ( It blazed last night and scared the timid deer ) And there ! Oh Christ , to think o n't drives me mad ! When next I saw her , she was cold and dead ; Drowned in the Liddel where the rowan tree That 's famed in legend overhangs the linn . She , in her frenzy , thought the wave would hide Her shame and sorrow from the unpitying world . M. of Max . Master of Maxwell He can not render back the life she took With irreligious haste . For whom said'st thou ? Carn . Carn For him I serve . M. of Max . Master of Maxwell Is't possible ! Go on . Carn . Carn As from that burning house I hurried forth , I seized on arms , and hitherward I ran : A blazoned shield exposed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merciless lord , Stubborn and mute I stood , resolved to die Rather than utter word . With sudden thought His anger cooled : he offered me my life If I would swear to serve him as a mute . I swore : ' t was not for liberty to breathe , But for delicious , exquisite revenge . M. of Max . Master of Maxwell I am amazed . Reveal thy hidden purpose , That I may know how desperate is thy heart . Carn . Carn The strong and noble may inflict such wrongs The humblest mortal will arise in strength Despite his grade , an independent man ; And , as in terror , all distinction level . M. of Max . Master of Maxwell I listen , sirrah  --  madly damn thyself . Carn . Carn Throughout the border his fair daughter 's name Is in each prayer remembered ; I resolved ( Oh , kill me not till I declare the truth ) That he should feel my father 's woe : I looked On her sweet face  --  I saw my sister 's smile  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Master of Maxwell For that unhallowed thought thy life is lost . Carn . Carn I care not for my life : ' t is in thy hands ; But for thy sake and her 's , expose me not . There is a serpent lurking in thy path  --  M. of Max . Master of Maxwell Speaking or mute , thou art a living lie . Carn . Carn Could I preserve thy life and gladden her 's , One act of present vengeance is complete . Trust in her fears : I know his stubborn will . I heard himself declare his mortal hate And purpose to bestow her hand on Hume . In mercy to thyself , not me , I pray Be in his presence vigilant and wary . M. of Max . Master of Maxwell Base-hearted slave ! Carn . Carn Despise me as thou wilt , But I beseech thee , master , credit all . Sleep o'er thy present anger , for her sake . If on the morrow thy resolve still holds , When thou hast seen and proved him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max . Master of Maxwell Leave me , slave ! begone ! Exit Carnegie . ' T is past belief , and yet , if true or false , I 'm placed in a dishonorable stand Unless I speak . It must be told , but when ? Just at the moment that my bounding heart Was bent to learn a fate , his story held me , Against my judgment , rooted to the spot . Oh , chance inopportune ! What 's best ? Not that . Postpone the plighted visit and expose At once the counterfeit ? There 's none to counsel . Oh , guide me Fate , and keep my honor clear , For in this conflict I am sore perplexed . Within his veins must slumber ancient blood : For gentle nature , as we sometimes find , In spite of education , training , grade , Rises above all antecedents known , And proves a dash of untraced noble stock , That seeks its place among exalted men . ' T were best to move with circumspection here ; I 'll write my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Then , by his answer , judge my proper course ; That 's surely best . Unwelcome news forewarns . Exit . Scene II .  --  A Court of Liddel Castle . Enter Liddesdale and Carnegie . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale They of the dream and legend prate ? No more ? Let the fools babble , I regard not them . Did not young Maxwell and my daughter meet Within the hour alone ? Carn . Carn Mabel and I Were present all the while . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale What heard'st him say ? Carn .

To the heart distraught The Gospel word , like rain on sandy wastes , Falls harren down  --  no quickening grace is there . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale Mouth full of words . Give me the man sincere , Whose actions with his sacred office squares . Enter Mabel . How is your mistress , Mabel ? Lo ! she comes . Enter Lady Christina . Lady C.

My sandals are not green . I will not dance ; Then , wherefore fret and frown ! Nor will I sing  --  A singing bride turns to a weeping wife . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale Have trees no gum  --  have fields no herb or flower , The rocks no mineral for mental ills  --  Can my physician nothing more prescribe ? Is there no balm for the tormented brain ? Priest . Priest The Eternal Sire , alone , may bring relief . Lady C. Lady Christina Behold that gash ! O flinty-hearted man , Laugh at a sight like this !

Lord Liddesdale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Christina The steeds stand saddled at the Abbey gate , The solemn words are said : they mount , they speed Fleet as the wind a-down the mountain gorge . Well done , proud roan , a better never paced ! See how he tosses high his haughty head With flowing mane , and lightning-like he leaps ! What cloud is that ? The rider is o'erthrown And dashed against the rocks ! Where is the horse ? The huge sun seems too heavy in his sphere , He 'll fall and crush the world . ' T is noon , and dark . Last night the slipper prophesied his doom . O never will glad tidings reach her door ; That bride can never thrive nor bless her lord : There 's wailing there  --  all hearths are desolate , And smiles and love shall never gladden more !

My brave , young friend , when we return from war , We 'll meet a mirthful tone and smiling face  --  Then thy reward shall be her willing hand . Lady C. Lady Christina Thy torches , Mabel , quick !

Lord Hume Though in the list of honor stands my name Equal to thine , yet the respect I owe Less to thy rank than age , forbids rebuke . I held a promise Maxwell 's life was safe . Liddes . Lord Liddesdale Were this a time to strike ! But that sad sight Subdues a heart that never brooked reproach ; Were she restored to pristine health again , Utter these words , and thou art instant doomed . Priest .

" The murder of an innocent lord , " I cried , " And , by the Power that loosed my tongue , " I said , " I stand commissioned to protect his corse . Quick bear it hence , convey it to his sire For Christian burial in the ancestral vault . " Deeming me favored by the grace of heaven , They , at my word , as a command divine , In silent reverence bore the corse away .

" Good morrow , whither bound so fast ? " quoth he ; " Where the road leadeth , " was the brief reply . Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood Much information was not given in that . Cess . Ker , of Cessford One lagged behind the rest , vouchsafed to say That angry words had passed ' twixt two proud lords ; But what the discord , was beyond his guess . Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood If true , then is our right hand paralyzed . Cess . Ker , of Cessford Shall I , old friend , adventure on my guess ? Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood Ask me who never feared to speak aloud ? Cess . Ker , of Cessford Of will imperious , Liddesdale would make His thought the standard  --  like the knave of old  --  For each man 's mind ; and he as alien holds Whoever contradicts . To keep his favor , New service daily must we render him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a first-rate actor on the stage , All men must play subordinate to him , Or else must lose him . Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood When discovered this ? At least you must confess in him one merit ; He loves his daughter . Cess .

Ker , of Cessford I have not said he has deserted us , Or had he , that his course would alter mine . Yet , though subdued in manner , Hume still keeps Coals in his heart , that soon are blown to flame , And he 's a-fire . Loch . Johnstone , of Lochwood Not fire of hate , but love Glows like the furnace , told in Holy Writ , That never singed a lock of three good men . I tell you love is stronger far than hate , That is , at twenty-five : had he my years , When blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be different . Think ye , for a word , That he would sacrifice so rich a gem ? Pride against passion could not so rebel . We 'll see the youth anon : my word on that . Cess .
