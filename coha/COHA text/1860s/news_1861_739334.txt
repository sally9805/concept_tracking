txt Blunders of the Ruling Caste in England and the Penalty . The ruling caste in England give law and public opinion to that country . The newspaper press there is only its mouthpiece . This class and press have been constant in their assertions than the rebellion in this country could not be put down . In this way they have contributed more than all other causes to give courage and persistency to it . It was this assumption of its strength that led the British Government to recognize the rebels as belligerents . The ruling classes in that country professed an indifference to the result which men affect , when they expect soon to see it , by the natural course of events , turn in their favor . They readily acknowledged the blockade under a belief that it would be speedily ended by our inability to maintain it . The quarrel they asserted was purely.a local one , not concerning them , and of which they chose to remain passive spectators , under the idea , apparently , that whichever way it might turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good cause to be indignant towards that country at a ' course so directly in conflict with those principles which had been the highest boast of its people , and for indirectly fannin the flames of the rebellion ; but we were content to take them at their word , to let us settle our own quarrels . We may not yet , in their opinion , have made very great headway , but we have certainly got far enough along to awaken them from their assumed indifference . We have sealed up every Southern port , so effectually that the commerce of every rebel State has totally disappeared . We want no better testimony to our power than the fact that the rebels dare not put a bale of cotton or hogshead of tobacco within a hundred miles of a seaport . Cotton non est , and property valued at hundreds of millions sterling , and millions of persons , will in a few short months be unemployed . England took last year , from the United States , cotton to the amount of nearly $150,000,000 , and exported its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarge upon the magnitude of the calamity that blots out such a vast manufacturing industry and commerce . Suffice to say , that the apprehension already excited is beginning to shake the kingdom to its centre . But this is not all . We imported direct from that country the last year merchandise to the value of $138,596,484 , by far the greater portion made up of manufactures of woolens , cottons and iron . The reduction of these imports the present year will fall off $80,000,000 , and in 1802 the falling off will probably equal $100 , - 000,000 . We are engaged in a ; great war , and have given . over , for a time at least , foreign luxuries , while necessities we supply ourselves . We shall import into the United States the present year not over $175,000,000 in merchandise , against $354 , 000,000 in 1860 . We do not , as a nation , suffer for the contraction any more than an individual , for buying less and selling more . England can not follow our example . She must continue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , whether we take anything from.her or not . The balance , whatever it may be , must be paid in coin . We exported last year $57,000,000 in gold and silver , to make good the balance against us . That country must export as much to us the present year to make good our balance against her , making a difference of $100,000,000 in the movement of the precious metals alone . The exports of these from that country next year will probably be still greater , and must for the present increase , as our imports of merchandise fall off . England , consequently , is in a dilemma , growing out of the war , of far more difficult solution than our own . Ours is not a commercial or industrial one . Our industries were never more active and productive ; and while tl ! s is a fact with any nation , it can bear all other burdens . The expenses of the war , at present , stimulate industry , instead of being felt , as a burden . We have abundance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed . We are saving , by our economy , a good part of what the war costs . The management of this , with our material prosperity unimpaired , is the problem before us . Its commercial consequences , which instantly paralyzes industry and commerce , and threatens to throw millions out of employment , is the legacy which the v a r leaves to England . If she can bear her part of the burden , we are quite cone dent N1-2 can Ours . The truth is , the English Cabinet have been guilty of a crowning blunder of statesmanship , the disastrous consequences of which can hardly be estimated . No matter whether it proceeded from ignorance of the strength of ; or hostility toward this country . It gave us to understand , because it really believod it , that we were speedily going to destruction . By the encouragement it has given to the war , it has directly brought upon the nation the calamities it is sutkring . We have , no doubt , hy this time that it filly appreciates the mistakes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedy , the crushing of the rebellion . We speedily expect an altered tone toward us . An early unlocking of the cotton crop will be the only thing that will save that country from a terrible commercial revulsion . She must be saved , if at all , through the success of our arms , and will be as eager for this as ourselves . By this time she has discovered cur strength and commercial independence , Ind however mortifying may be her change ) f tone and position , she will henceforward ) id God speed to the march of our armies . She will learn another useful lesson , that all - ; ommercial nations are partners in each ) ther 's Prosperity and losses , awl that the greatest loser may by no means be the on that finds itself involved in war . England now commercially the most dependent natio in the world , and , consequently , suffers MOI by a disturbance in others .
