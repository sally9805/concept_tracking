An historical drama being the incarnation  --  through the most compact and brilliant literary form  --  of the spirit of a national epoch , the dramatic author , in adopting historic personages and events , is bound to subordinate himself with conscientious faithfulness to the actuality he attempts to reproduce . His task is , by help of imaginative power , to give to important conjunctures , and to the individuals that rule them , a more vivid embodiment than can be given on the literal page of history ,  --  not to transform , but to elevate and animate an enacted reality , and , by injecting it with poetic rays , to make it throw out from itself a light whereby its features shall be more clearly visible . Historic subjects have necessarily an epic bias , events sweeping men along in their current , instead of the current being much determined by the personalities of men . Hence Shakspeare 's most dramatric tragedies , Macbeth and Lear and Hamlet , are drawn from the prehistoric period , where the poetic as well as the dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ancient history are enjoyed for their clean characterization and luminous historic picture-painting , and for  --  what is common to all his work  --  great thoughts buoyed on a sea of beauty , more than for the prolific interplay of feelings and the deep entanglements of passion  --  inextricable but by death  --  and the breath of seemingly free movement , which make the tragedies wrought by Shakspeare out of legend a glowing epitome of the fallible and pathetic in human nature , a poetic abstract of the tragic liabilities of man . The Epic may be likened to a broad , swollen , majestic , irresistible river : the Dramatic to the pent-up waters of a rock-bound lake lashed by a tempest . But the Dramatic , gathering up the varied and separate impulses of humanity into condensed organic wholes , combines into itself both the other classes of poetic utterance , perfusing its tissue with lyric as well as with epic juice . As Shakspeare 's historic plays are largely tinted with epic color , others so sparkle with fantastic wilfulness that they may almost be styled lyrical dramas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tempest , wherein , through scenes and dialogue still thoroughly dramatic , Shakspeare has more completely than elsewhere given vent to his poetic and , I may venture to say , his personal individuality , saturating them with the inmost fragrance of his beautiful nature , and making them buoyant with the fullest play of a divine cheerfulness . To get a view of the level little enclosure of the three acts that are to follow , it is not at all necessary to ascend to these Shakspearian heights , up to which one is ever tempted by the fruit that grows on them ,  --  a golden crop , inexhaustible in its beauty and healthful succulence . We come down from them to say , that the momentous consequences involved in success or failure , the exciting and special nature of the incidents and accompaniments , the individualities of the two chief agents , with the figure and character of Washington looming in the background almost like a controlling destiny , give to the treason of Arnold rare capabilities as an sthetic subject ; and if the necessary locking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation of the principal agents except for one interview , prevent there being much of that action and reaction between the personages which is needed for the deepest dramatic involution , this is largely compensated for by the contrast between the natures of Arnold and Andr , and by the direct effect which their personal qualities and temperaments had on the original conception of the treason and on its issue . Although , from the confined circle in which such a treason necessarily moved , it be not as a subject for dramatic treatment the richest and broadest , it is nevertheless well fitted for such treatment , inasmuch as not only its inception and progress , but also its defeat , were so directly the result of the especial character of the several persons engaged . The epic flow pauses for a moment while human passions enact this episode . In the rising stream of our history an eddy was made to which a high military trust enabled a Major-General to give so wide a sweep that the success of his plot would have caused the current disastrously to overflow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim of the dramatist being to reproduce in poetic form a chapter or section of National Annals , and fidelity therefor to the spirit of the period selected being a primary condition to the attainment of his aim , it follows that truth of characterization becomes a demand which he must satisfy , or fail in his undertaking ; for the events , owing their import , and it may be their very existence , to the individualities of the chief historic agents , the more faithfully these are reproduced the more truly will the historic spirit be preserved , it being the peculiar quality of epochs fitted for dramatic treatment , that their spirit is a distillation , so to speak , out of that of the influential agents , in a measure the creators , of the epoch . By truth of characterization is meant historic truth , which is not only no bar to poetic truth , but makes for it a solid elastic basis , history and poetry enlivening and elevating one the other . Poetry being the finest truth , the essence indeed of truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if fed on the false , and has within itself such all-sufficient resources , that whatever is required for its own corporeal manifestation it can freshly generate , if need be , by imaginative energy . Wherefore , to falsify history in order to compass dramatic ends , were in the author self-conviction of incompetency ; and whenever such falsification has been resorted to , it will be found that there is weakness in the spirit , as well as in the body , of the product . But to compass his ends , the dramatist may " feign according to nature , " not only in the dialogue and monologue of the historic figures , but also by intermingling with them others , the breath of whose life is the concentrated spirit of the epoch represented . Such inventions are not justifiable merely , as being in keeping with the historic picture : they are demanded for the very purpose of giving to historic fact more palpable actuality . They are not mere ornaments ,  --  for as such they would be vicious weaknesses ,  --  but are serviceable adjuncts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personages , but by giving higher relief to them and their deeds , heighten and enlarge the dramatic effect . Being secondary , they are like the flying buttresses of a cathedral , which , although subordinate , give to the edifice strength , as well as grace and expansion . This dramatic privilege I have used , especially in the first and second Scenes , seeking by means of it to bring more clearly to view the public and military opinion and feeling of the time , and by thus exhibiting the medium in which the transactions occur , and by which they are subtly influenced , to impart to the dramatic picture more fulness and vivacity . Whether or not Mrs. Arnold knew of her husband 's design was for some time uncertain . I believe that the final judgment upon all the evidence accessible is , that she did not . I should in every case have eagerly seized upon and given her the benefit of any doubt , as to suppose her ignorant is grateful to humane and generous feeling , besides making her dramatically more effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  thus infolding , as it were , the whole action in his vast paternal arms ; but he is seen for a few moments only , and at the bottom of the stage , and is not heard . That the plot failed was remotely owing to him ; for when , after crossing the river , as presented in the opening Scene , Arnold at Peekskill showed him the letter just received from Beverly Robinson , seemingly on private business , and asking an interview , Washington , with his habitual masterly prudence and benignant watchfulness , forbade the interview , and this prohibition it was that obliged the more circuitous and more dangerous procedure . The drama was finished some years since . One Scene , the second of the first Act , was written long ago , and was printed in 1840 . The author deems the present a favorable time for the publication of a work which embodies the first American treason , now that our national life has been , and continues to be assailed by the most gigantic and the most wicked treason known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1863 . Main text ACT I. SCENE I. The landing at Verplanck 's Point on the Hudson River , September 18th , 1780 . Enter , on one side , Fleming , lame , and Vanberg ; on the other , Sergeant Briggs , who has lost an arm ; with him two farmers . FLEMING . Fleming Well met , Sergeant Briggs . We are here on the same errand , eh ? BRIGGS . Sergeant Briggs Aye , cripples that we are . Hard , is it not , to be lazy lookers-on ? I 'll brook it no longer , now that my stump is healed . There 's no snuff like burnt gunpowder : it puts two lives into the brain of a man . FARMER . Farmer And takes one from his arms . BRIGGS . Sergeant Briggs Aye , neighbor , that was rare luck , when you see how close the head is to the shoulders . I 've my best arm left , and for that one the Commander-in-Chief must find something to do . FLEMING . Fleming It 's certain , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sergeant Briggs Certain as the tide . My neighbor here was over at Stony Point two hours ago . The Chief is on his way to Hartford , to confer with the French Commander , Count Rochambeau , lately arrived at Newport . General Arnold has just come down the river to meet him , and will bring him over in a barge . FLEMING . Fleming Ha ! then I shall have another look at General Arnold . There 's a general for you , if ever there was one . Could you have seen him at Behmus 's Heights ! Like the wind , he was everywhere at once , and wherever he came , he blew into us his own heat . That was a time when we drove the Hessians from their encampment . The General and I fell together in the very mouth of the sally-port , wounded in the same leg . I say nothing against General Washington , God bless him ; but this I do say , that if Arnold was Commander-in-Chief there would be hotter work and more battles . BRIGGS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's right ; I like that . But the fewer battles we fight , my friend , the better . In a war like this , to know when not to fight is the best generalship . Our retreats have gained us more than our victories . That I learned in the Jersey campaigns . To retreat is sometimes better even than to beat : it spares ourselves and wears the enemy . VANBERG . Vanberg I perceive , sir , that you are an apt scholar in the school of Washington . BRIGGS . Sergeant Briggs And pray , sir , in what school did you learn the art of war ? VANBERG . Vanberg I am myself no soldier , but I had a son killed at Saratoga , and have another in garrison at West Point . BRIGGS . Sergeant Briggs Your pardon , sir . ( Touching his hat . ) The father of such sons has a right to his opinions . VANBERG . Vanberg No offence ; but our side never was in worse plight than now . We have been routed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with victorious troops to renforce New York . The second French armament , that was to have been out ere this , is blockaded in Brest . The first is shut up in Newport . Washington is too weak to attack New York ; ' t is as much as he can do to hold his own on the river . If we lose West Point , we make our last retreat . BRIGGS . Sergeant Briggs Our last retreat will be made by the last man left of us into a bloody grave . But that will never be . We 'll fight them back to the Alleghany Mountains , and hold them there at bay till our sons are big enough to fight in front of us . Oh that I had a hundred arms , instead of but one ! Enter an old man with his grandson , fourteen years of age , and two or three other citizens . OLD MAN , Old Man to Briggs . Can you tell me , sir , is it true that General Washington comes across the ferry this afternoon ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming . That 's enough : he 'll come ,  --  unless an earthquake swallow up his horse . Him it will not swallow up ; for He who makes earthquakes guards his life as the most precious thing on earth at this hour . OLD MAN Old Man You have seen him , sir ? BRIGGS . Sergeant Briggs A hundred times . OLD MAN . Old Man Is there that greatness in his look , that I have heard speak of ? BRIGGS . Sergeant Briggs There is that in his aspect that you feel yourself grow larger as you look at him , as a tree grows by looking at the sun . There is in him such a soul , that men get suddenly strong by his side . Have you come to look on him ? OLD MAN . Old Man Aye , sir , and that this boy may have sight of him . His father , my son , is a dragoon in the camp . BRIGGS . Sergeant Briggs Ha ! Then you shall have speech of him , too , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not , this ( striking the stump of his lost arm ) would be a passport to his eye , and from that to his heart . FLEMING . Fleming There 's the barge ! The approaching barge is visible from the stage . BRIGGS . Sergeant Briggs Aye , so it is , and full of officers . As yet I can not make them out . Lafayette , the noble young Frenchman , will be among them . FLEMING . Fleming There 's General Arnold . OLD MAN . Old Man That 's Washington in the centre , is it not ? BBIGGS . Sergeant Briggs Aye , and beside him , on his left , is Lafayette . FLEMING . Fleming And Arnold is on his right . BRIGGS . Sergeant Briggs There , Washington is speaking to Lafayette . The stout one next to Arnold is General Knox of the artillery , a Boston boy . He was a volunteer at Bunker Hill , and has been in every battle in the Jerseys . General Washington likes to have him near himself . OLD MAN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? BRIGGS . Sergeant Briggs No . The Commander-in-Chief , while absent , leaves him in command ; and worthiest is he to fill so great a place . FLEMING . Fleming Sergeant , who are the two behind ? BRIGGS . Sergeant Briggs Ah ! now I know them . The one directly behind Lafayette is young Hamilton , whom Washington loves as a son and trusts as a brother . The other is Lee of Virginia ,  --  Major Lee , called Light-horse Harry . He , too , has a place in the heart of the chief . Of these three , Lee , the oldest , is only twenty-four , Lafayette and Hamilton twenty-three . OLD MAN . Old Man So young and so ripe ! BRIGGS . Sergeant Briggs They are about to land . Arnold is helping Washington out of the barga . As Washington steps on the shore , Briggs and all the others lift their hats , which salutation Washington returns , and then , accompanied by the officers , passes from the stage at the side , without coming any nearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same side , except the Old Man and his grandson , who remain . GRANDSON . Grandson See , sir : he is speaking to the gentleman with one arm . But , grandfather , how sad he looks . OLD MAN . Old Man Very sad ,  --  very sad . Take that look into thy heart , my boy : human eyes will never see a greater . GRANDSON . Grandson He is mounting his horse . OLD MAN . Old Man What a majestic air ! My son , when you shall be as old as I am , this hour will be priceless to your grandchildren , and men will have a joy in seeing the man who saw Washington . GRANDSON . Grandson What a fine horse he rides ! There he goes . OLD MAN . Old Man taking off his hat . Thank Heaven , I have seen him . What a man ! What a man ! Exeunt . SCENE II . New York . Sir Henry Clinton , Colonel Robinson , an Old British Officer . SIR H. CLINTON Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wanting the breath of eager confidence . Discord , twin-brother to defeat , now lifts Within the Congress walls her husky voice , ( Fit sound for rebel ears , ) and in their camp Lean want breeds discontent and mutiny : The while , o'er our embattled squadrons poised , High-crested victory flaps freshened wings , Fanning the fires of native valiantness . Quickly shall peace revisit this vext land , So long Lestrid by war , whose iron heel With her own life-blood madly stains her sides . ROBINSON . Colonel Beverly Robinson Our arms ' success upon the southern shore ,  --  Whose thirsty sands are saturate with streams From rebel wounds ,  --  and the discomfiture Of new-born hopes of aid from fickle France , Brought on by Rodney 's timely coming , have Even to the stoutest hearts struck cold dismay .

ROBINSON . Colonel Beverly Robinson But years of fruitless warfare , sucking up The people 's blood alike and daily substance , Weigh on th ' exhausted land , like helpless debts Of foild enterprise , that clog the step Of action . OLD OFFICER . Old British Officer Deem ye not the spirit dulled Which first impelled this people to take arms And brave our mighty power , nor yet extinct The hope which has their energies upheld Against such fearful odds . The blood they 've shed Is blood of martyrs ,  --  consecrated oil ,  --  Rich fuel to the flame that 's boldly lit On Freedom 's altar , and whose dear perfume , Upward ascending , is by heroes snuffed , Strengthening the soul of patriotic love With ireful vengeance . SIR H. CLINTON . Sir Henry Clinton Whence , my veteran Colonel , Comes it , that you , whose scarred body bears The outward proofs of inward loyalty , Will entertain for rebels such regard ? OLD OFFICER . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart , But that its pulse will beat in admiration Of noble deeds , even those by foemen done ; Nor does my sworn allegiance to my king Ban sympathy for men who war for rights Inherited from British ancestors . SIR H. CLINTON . Sir Henry Clinton Their yet unconquered souls , and the stern front They have so long opposed in equal strife To a war-practised soldiery , attest Their valor ; and for us to stint the meed Of praise for gallant bearing in the field , Were self-disparagement , seeing that still They hold at bay our much out-numbering host . But for the justice of their cause ,  --  the wrong , Skilled to bedeck itself in garb of right , Oft cheats the conscience ' lax credulity , And thus will vice , with virtue 's armature Engirt , fight often unabashed . Unloose The spurs wherewith desire of change , the pride Of will , hot blood of restless , uncurbed youth Wanting a distant parent 's discipline , And bad ambition of aspiring chiefs , Do prick them on to this unnatural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mettle , Heated alone by patriotic warmth . OLD OFFICER . Old British Officer My General , I know this people well ; And all the virtues which Old England claims , As the foundations of her happiness And greatness ,  --  such as reverence of law And custom , justice , female chastity , And , with them , independence , fortitude , Courage , and sturdiness of purpose ,  --  are Transplanted here from their maternal soil , And flourish undegenerate . From these  --  Sources exhaustible but with the life That feeds them  --  their severe intents take birth , And draw the lusty sustenance to mould The limbs and body of their own fulfilment , So that performance lag not after purpose . They are our countrymen : they are , as well In manly resolution as in blood , The children of our fathers .

You 'll task your judgment vainly to descry , Through all this desperate conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution . He In spirit is unconquerable , as In genius perfect . Side by side I fought With him in that disastrous enterprise Where rash young Braddock fell ; and there I marked The veteran 's skill contend for mastery With youthful courage in his wondrous deeds . Well might the ruthless Indian warrior pause , Amid his massacre confounded , and His baffled rifle 's aim , till then unerring , Turn from " that tall young man , " and deem in awe That the Great Spirit hovered over him ; For he , of all our mounted officers , Alone came out unscathed from that dread carnage , To guard our shattered army 's swift retreat . For years did his majestic form hold place Upon my mind , stamped in that perilous hour , In th ' image of a stalwart friend , until I met him next as a resistless foe .

Doubly imperilled He stood unharmed . Like eagles tempest-borne Rushed to his side his men ; and had our souls And arms with tenfold strength been braced , we yet Had not withstood that onset . Thus does he Keep ever with occasion even step ,  --  Now , mockingly before our angry speed Retreating , tempting us with battle 's promise Only to toil us with a vain pursuit ,  --  Now , wheeling rapidly about our flanks , Startling our ears with sudden peal of war , And fronting in the thickest of the fight The common soldier 's death , stirring the blood Of faintest hearts to deeds of bravery By his great presence ,  --  and his every act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtful judgment first inferred . ROBINSON . Colonel Beverly Robinson If you Report him truly , and your lavish words Be not the wings to float a brain born vision , But are true heralds who deliver what In corporal doings will be stern avouched , Then was this man born to command ; and shall Ingrate revolt be justified by fate , And Britain 's side bleed with the rending off Of this vast member ; they will find it so , Who seek to gain a greater liberty Than profiteth man 's passion-mastered state . Jove 's bird as soon shall quail his cloud-wet plumage , Sinking his sinewy wafture to the flight Of common pinions ,  --  or the silent tide Break its mysterious law at the wind 's bidding , Remitting for a day its mighty flood Upon this shore ,  --  as that , one recognized To have all kingly qualities shall not Assert his natural supremacy , And weaker men submit to his full sway . Power doth grow unto the palm that wields it . The necks that bend to make ambition 's seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be crushed under it . OLD OFFICER Old British Officer And heads That quit the roof of sheltering peace , and bare them To war 's fierce lightning for a principle , Becrown the limbs of men , each one a rock Baffling with loftiness ambition 's step , Whose ladder is servility . Were they Susceptible of usurpation 's sway , This conflict had not been ; and then the world Had missed a Washington , whose greatness is Of greatness born . Him have they raised , because Of his great worth ; and he has headed them , For that they knew to value him . Had he Been less , then they had passed him by ; and had Their souls lacked nobleness , his towering trunk , Scanted of genial sap , had failed to reach Its proper altitude . No smiling time Is this for hypocritical ambition To cheat men 's minds with virtue 's counterfeit .

Sir Henry Clinton Yet , Scarce does his liberal extolment stretch Beyond its object 's dues . Were Washington Not rooted in his compeers ' confidence , And in his generalship unmatched , this league Had long since crumbled from within , and o'er Its severed bands our arms had quickly triumphed .

Colonel Beverly Robinson He 's now near Arnold 's post . If he depart , ( As ' t is his plan , to hold an interview With the French leaders at the town of Hartford , ) We 'll know he harbors no suspicious thought ; And then we can not fail . His presence there Is hindrance absolute to any movement , Whether he do suspect or not . SIR H. CLINTON .

Colonel Beverly Robinson There 's in him no live seed of honesty , For the pure dews of natural affection To quicken with their sweetness . And the cord , Wherewith ambitiously he swung himself Aloft o'er revolution 's dark abyss , Has rotted in his hand ; and now he 'd leap Th ' audacious backward leap of desperation . SIR H. CLINTON .

While I was there came news of Gates 's rout . Men were aghast . The hopefullest faces fell . The streets all hissed with railing : some at Gates , Others at Washington , the most at Congress . Three out of four are ready for submission ; And should there come another big defeat , The Congress will not hold a week together .

And , know you , I begin to honor it , To spy a greatness ' hind its shrunken visage . In Philadelphia my old friends and I , We angered one another with warm words And daily contradiction . Washington , Your friend , our towering head , the man of men , Even he escapes not their coarse jests and rancor . The more they jibed , the more my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their banterings I fled to waking dreams of his great future ,  --  How his illustrious name will usher him To eminence in the hard-won Republic ; How in the street people will smile upon him , And gray-haired men will boast they knew his father . And now I think of it , ' t is two days since Thou hast asked to see him . ARNOLD . Major-General Arnold Is he well ? MRS . ARNOLD . Mrs. Arnold A lump Of rosy health , and hourly more like thee . Arnold bursts into tears . Great Heaven ! My husband ! What hast thou ? thou'rt ill . Never before did I behold thee weep . ARNOLD .

Cabin of the British sloop-of-war " Vulture , " lying in the Hudson River , a few miles below King 's Ferry , towards midnight , September 21st . Colonel Robinson , Major Andr , and Captain Sutherland , commander of the " Vulture . " ANDR . Major Andr You 'll pardon me , Captain , for thinking , spite of my quarters and my company , that this sailor 's life up a river is as tedious as fishing with an unbated hook . It 's neither work nor play . SUTHERLAND . Captain Sutherland I am entirely of your mind , Major . It smacks too much of the land-service for my palate . But have patience . Your friend , General Arnold , will soon relieve you . ANDR . Major Andr The General is as cautious in his diplomacy as he is headlong in the field .

Boat ahoy ! ROBINSON . Colonel Beverly Robinson Hark ! There he is . VOICE , Voice from the boat . A friend . OFFICER , Officer on deck . Where from , and whither bound ? VOICE . Voice From King 's Ferry to Dobbs 's Ferry . OFFICER , Officer on deck . You lubberly land-shark , how dare you , under cover of the night , get within the buoys of one of His Majesty 's ships ? Spring your luff and come along-side , you son of a sea-cook , or I 'll deaden your headway before you can say your prayers . ANDR . Major Andr A savory salutation that to a major-general .

Major Andr You were ever a good mentor , Colonel . Exit . Enter Smith . ROBINSON . Colonel Beverly Robinson Mr. Smith , I believe . SMITH . Joshua Smith Colonel Robinson , I 'm glad to see you again . I bring you a letter from General Arnold . Gives the letter , which Robinson reads . ROBINSON . Colonel Beverly Robinson Have you any other papers ? SMITH . Joshua Smith Two passports . Gives them to Robinson . ROBINSON .

Colonel Beverly Robinson Mr. Smith , I 'll leave you for a few moments with Captain Sutherland . Exit . SUTHERLAND . Captain Sutherland Take a seat , sir . ( Both sit . ) When do you think , Mr. Smith , this war will end . SMITH . Joshua Smith When there shall be neither a British soldier on our soil , nor a British gun in our waters . SUTHERLAND . Captain Sutherland Oh ! then you prize the war so much , you mean to leave it as an heirloom to your grandchildren ? SMITH . Joshua Smith I give you our final terms , come what may . SUTHERLAND . Captain Sutherland But , seriously , your side looks very black just now . SMITH . Joshua Smith It has looked black from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the blackness of the thunder-cloud ,  --  the blacker it is , the more lightning there is in it . SUTHERLAND . Captain Sutherland Well said , by Jove . It ca n't be denied , there 's good stuff in your fellows . And for my part , Mr. Smith , I tell you frankly , I hate this war , and heartily wish it over ,  --  aye , and I 'll say more ,  --  I wish it over without loss of honor to either side . SMITH . Joshua Smith I wish , then , from my heart , Captain Sutherland , that you were Prime-Minister of England . Permit me , though , to say , that we might without loss of honor lose our cause ; and that would not suit our temper . Honor is a good thing , useful at times , as well as ornamental ; but it follows in the wake of our cause , and if we lose that , we shall not take the trouble to pick honor up . SUTHERLAND . Captain Sutherland You count largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their hatred of you than on their love for us . SUTHERLAND . Captain Sutherland They say that General Washington is gone to Hartford to meet the French commanders . SMITH . Joshua Smith Captain , how many spies do you keep in your service ? SUTHERLAND . Captain Sutherland Always , Mr. Smith , one less than you keep in yours . Renter Colonel Robinson , accompanied by Major Andr , in a blue overcoat with cape close buttoned . ROBINSON . Colonel Beverly Robinson Mr. Smith , I am not well enough to go out in an open boat in the night . My friend here , Mr. Anderson , understands the business about which the General and I were to confer , and is ready to accompany you . SMITH . Joshua Smith The business is yours , Colonel , and not mine . I am but a go-between ' twixt you and the General , happy to serve both of you in any honorable way . It is already so late , I advise that we start at once . ANDR . Major Andr The sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ROBINSON . Colonel Beverly Robinson God bless you , my friend .

Colonel Beverly Robinson This business disquiets me , Captain . I opposed Andr 's going on shore ; but he is eager , and would not be overruled . I have misgivings . SUTHERLAND . Captain Sutherland I see no cause for them . ROBINSON . Colonel Beverly Robinson Think what a man we are dealing with . Of Andr 's safety what thought will he take who is capable of such a treason ? SUTHERLAND . Captain Sutherland But observe how thoughtful he has been of his own safety ; henceforth that is bound closely up with the safety of Andr . ROBINSON . Colonel Beverly Robinson True , but villains are so apt to be botchers ; they leave a flaw somewhere , villany so blinds the judgment . From a bad heart there rises into the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will hope for the best . Exeunt . SCENE III . Foot of a mountain called the Long Clove , on the western shore of the river , several miles below Stony Point . One hour and a half after midnight , September 22d . ARNOLD , Major-General Arnold alone . I like to be alone , and in the night . Darkness and my deep purpose are attuned ; For that is dark and natural as night , Aye , and as wholesome too . Wherefore not wholesome ? Strong men are their own law . ' T is meant they should be . Else , wherefore have they that which builds the world ? Poor weaklings pile about their littleness A rampart of conventions , which the strong Storm with their intellectual squadrons deep , Making the garrison slaves irredeemable . Let them cry shame and conscience as they will . Conscience , forsooth ! Where are there two alike ? Fools set their conscience by their neighbors ' wants . My wants  --  they are a liberal hungry crew  --  Make mine . Life is a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stratagem and force are victors . Never from boyhood have I dreaded aught . Shall I begin so late , and wince with fear Before the chief of changelings , vile opinion , The whitest coward of the coward world ? Traitor ! England calls Washington a traitor . What if I help to prove him one . I hate him , With his chill stateliness , his wise reserve , His stubborn prudence , and his calm directness . Of all the men I 've known , only with him I am not at my ease . It angers me , To feel my nature is rebuked by his . A withering frost I 'll be to his young greatness , Striking with palsy their pale bankrupt cause . In this coarse world failure is ignominy .  --  The night wears fast away . ' T is time he came . Had I been sure of Smith , myself had gone . It had been quicker done . But he 's so vain . The best of marplots is glib vanity . The night is cool . I 'll walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joshua Smith cautiously . General ! General ! I left him hereabout . I 'll seek him . He will not be far . Exit . ANDR , Major Andr alone . Moments there are when thought is so ablaze With all the fires that have inflamed a life , That memory is one great grasping light , Flashed on the present from the total past . I seem not to have lived till now , so burning Is my new consciousness . ' T is said that men , In the last agony of drowning , are Thus flooded with their faded motley years In one fresh rounded instantaneous picture ,  --  Life gathering to a point its scattered beams , To shine its earthly last with warmest flush , And , robed in full collected brightness , usher The rising soul to a diviner home . My mind 's aglow with happiest light , possessed As by illuminated memories . There , they are fading , fading fast , like to th ' ebb From blissful clouds of golden beams at evening . What a vast waking dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my life By beauty 's cleansing brush . ' T is going ,  --  gone . Come back , come back , and wrap me yet awhile In  --  His arm is grasped by Arnold , who has just re-ntered . General Arnold ! ARNOLD . Major-General Arnold Major Andr ! ANDR . Major Andr Are we alone ? ARNOLD . Major-General Arnold We are . A momentous business is this we have to do . Are you fully empowered . ANDR . Major Andr Fully . We stand on neutral ground ? ARNOLD Major-General Arnold Aye ; no fear . Enter Smith . SMITH . Joshua Smith General , you know the boat must be sent up the river before daybreak . ARNOLD . Major-General Arnold For that there 's time enough . The boatmen can sleep an hour on their oars . Let us ( to Andr ) withdraw a little from the shore . Arnold and Andr withdraws . SMITH , Joshua Smith alone . Humph ! He treats me as though I were one of his corporals . What can he have to say to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your great men always have secrets . Mystery is the garment of greatness : it helps to keep it warm . But what is to keep me warm ? To play sentinel in this air for an hour would give me a tertian , if I had not one already . Enter Arnold . ARNOLD . Major-General Arnold Smith , we ca n't finish our business here . Send the boat round to the creek , and follow us up to the house . Exit . SMITH . Joshua Smith The General 's voice is always set to the military pitch . Orders come as glib from his tongue as foul speech from a sailor . Well , I 'm thankful to be let off so easily . Colquhoun ! ( Calling . ) Colquhoun ! These two boatmen brothers make good the saying , Coarse feeders , sound sleepers . Colquhoun ! But there 's no use in calling . Fellows that snore like the croak of a pond of bull-frogs praying for rain , will not wake before dawn to anything less than a twenty-four pounder . By fist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exit on the side opposite to that at which Arnold went out . SCENE IV . A room in Smith 's house , early morning . Arnold and Andr , seated at a table with writing materials . Andr in his uniform coat . ANDR , Major Andr rising . They were the last orders Sir Henry Clinton gave me , positive orders , to take no papers . ARNOLD , Major-General Arnold remains seated . Then Sir Henry Clinton can not take West Point . Have you , Major , the memory of Mithridates ? Can you , by word of mouth , deliver to Sir Henry a plan of the whole system of defences at West Point : the number and calibre of guns in each fort , redoubt , and battery ; the construction , size , and strength of each ; the amount and quality of the force within the works ; and the distribution of the several corps in case of alarm ? All these details , full , precise , without error , Sir Henry must have , before he , with hope of success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this key of knowledge , the post remains locked against him in spite of us both . Even with it there would be in the assault some loss of life . What matters it whether you risk yours then or now ? it 's for the same end . For a soldier , methinks , you calculate adverse chances too curiously . ANDR . Major Andr My life is my King 's ; but my honor is my own . ARNOLD . Major-General Arnold That thought comes to you some hours too late . ANDR , Major Andr aside . The villain is right . ARNOLD . Major-General Arnold Come , Major , be calm . Your risk is less than mine ; and see how cool I am . After all , the danger is not much ; and for clearing what there is , trust to chance , or if you like the word better , to Providence . ANDR , Major Andr aside . That I should be closely coupled with such a wretch ! Ever since I met him , my blood creeps like that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you of the greatness of your mission . At this moment you are the most important man in His Majesty 's service . On your doing well what you were sent to do , hangs the issue of this war . This one success makes your fortune . ANDR . Major Andr Give me the papers . ARNOLD , Major-General Arnold rising . There are six of them , ( gives them , ) each one labelled . Those papers are too cheap at ten thousand pounds . ANDR . Major Andr That is the limit of my power . ARNOLD . Major-General Arnold Were I face to face with Sir Henry , he should double that sum . Say to him that I expect it . Now , the sooner he moves the better , and the day must be at once determined . This is Friday , the 22d . In three days , at farthest , Washington will have returned from Hartford . And he will return by West Point to inspect the works : I know him . To that he will give a day , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spendthrift of time . In five days from this the coast will be clear . Let Sir Henry move on Tuesday evening . The instant news of your approach reaches the garrison , I will  --  in so far as I can without causing suspicion  --  weaken the main points . Under pretence of encountering you , I will send out corps , so separated that they can not at once aid one the other . They will be stationed in the gorges westward . Keep your main body closer to the river . This I 've already told you : I repeat it ; it is important . A common is heard . ANDR , Major Andr alarmed . What 's that ? ( Another shot . ) We are betrayed . Enter Smith . ARNOLD . Major-General Arnold Smith , what is that firing ? SMITH . Joshua Smith At the " Vulture , " from the shore . ANDR . Major Andr But can they reach her ? ( Going to the window ; cannon-shots continue . ) Ha ! that they can . She looks as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SMITH , Joshua Smith aside to Arnold , seeing Andr 's uniform . What ! is he a British officer ? ARNOLD . Major-General Arnold Oh , no ! A fop of a fellow , a New York cockney , who borrowed a uniform to look big in . SMITH . Joshua Smith He 'll feel small enough if he is caught in it . ANDR . Major Andr Why , the " Vulture " is dropping down the river ! I shall not be able to get back to her . ARNOLD . Major-General Arnold She 'll not have to go far to get out of reach of those guns . It 's only Colonel Livingston keeping his hand in . SMITH . Joshua Smith And even if the sloop had not budged , the boatmen will not row out to her again . ANDR . Major Andr But I must be put on board . I demand that . General Arnold , I have a right to demand so much . SMITH . Joshua Smith Young gentleman , if you are a good swimmer , and a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to be sent after you , you may board the sloop . Arnold takes Smith on one side . ANDR . Major Andr To be at the mercy of these two ! This is no business for a gentleman . I 've been over-zealous . So much for playing spy . Spy ! Does a spy wear this coat ? No , no ! it 's not so bad as that . Arnold and Smith return . ARNOLD . Major-General Arnold Mr. Anderson , my friend Smith promises to get you on board , if he can . If not , he will escort you safely beyond our outposts . I 'll give you a passport that will be full protection . ANDR . Major Andr I must be content . ARNOLD , Major-General Arnold to Andr . He 's bound to me . He 'll do the best he can . The hazard 's small . The passport will carry you through to your own lines . People are passing to and fro every day . Those papers ,  --  in case of accident , destroy them ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against us . Not to a soul on our side is the object of this meeting known . For greater secrecy , hide them in your boots .  --  Mr. Smith , I must return up the river . In your charge I leave Mr. Anderson .  --  Give my best regards to Colonel Robinson , Mr. Anderson . Tell him the affair shall be settled to suit him . Farewell . ( Coming back . ) Mr. Anderson , you had better change that borrowed red coat for a plain one . Exeunt , first Arnold on one side , then Smith on the other . ANDR , Major Andr alone , looking first after Arnold , then after Smith . Now that they 're gone , I draw a better breath . Their presence stifled me . I know not why , But while they were beside me , it did seem As they were plotters ' gainst my life . Since Arnold Grasped in the dark upon the shore my arm , I have not been myself . That touch was venomed : It shrivelled up my nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quaking culprit ; My fancies are as pale as a sick mother 's . Poh ! Poh ! A soldier must not let imagination Unheart him . I have work to do , great work . He 's right : it ca n't be done without these warrants . He takes out the papers , and seats himself at the table . The curtain drops . ACT III . SCENE I. Half a mile above Tarrytown , by the road-side among trees , about ten o'clock in the morning of September 23d . Paulding , Williams , and Van Wart , lying on the ground . PAULDING . Paulding Did you say , Isaac , that the cow-boys have been seen this week above Pine Bridge ? VAN WART . Van Wart Aye , and felt too ; for they carried off a cow from a Dutch woman three miles beyond the bridge . WILLIAMS . Williams The saucy varlets . Why , that 's four or five miles higher up than North Castle , Colonel Jamieson 's station . Where was he with his dragoons ? PAULDING . Paulding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work that 's wanted in these parts . I warrant you , if the marauding rascals come so near to Captain Boyd , they 'll catch a Tartar instead of a cow . WILLIAMS . Williams The skinners , too , have been busy above White Plains . PAULDING . Paulding The pirates ! They are worse than the cowboys . They belong to neither side , and pillage both . David , what 's o'clock , think you ? past nine ? WILLIAMS . Williams Nearer to ten than nine , I should say , by the sun . PAULDING . Paulding This lying down in the daytime is hard both for bones and brains . WILLIAMS . Williams It 's the worst work I ever tried ; but should a brace of cattle come along with their noses to the south , it will pay . PAULDING . Paulding That 's a wise law , that gives cattle for the enemy to the captors . But this waiting on chance is sorry work after all for two-fisted men . VAN WART . Van Wart There comes somebody on horseback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . If you do n't know him , Mr. Paulding , you had better make him stop . Enter Major Andr on horseback . PAULDING , Paulding who has risen , presents his firelock . Stand . Where are you going ? ANDR . Major Andr I hope , my friends , you are of our party . PAULDING . Paulding Which party ? ANDR . Major Andr The lower party . PAULDING . Paulding That 's ours . ANDR . Major Andr Then we are friends . I am a British officer out on particular business . Let me pass , and take this . ( Offering his watch . ) PAULDING . Paulding Keep your watch , sir ; you must dismount . ANDR . Major Andr Why , what good will it do you to stop me . It may do you harm ; for , see here , I have a pass from General Arnold . ( Gives the passport to Paulding , and then dismounts . ) If you detain me , you may get yourselves into trouble . I 'm on my way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAULDING . Paulding You seem to be a gentleman , sir ; and we mean you no harm . But there are bad people about , and in these times it 's hard to tell friend from foe . You must submit to be searched . WILLIAMS . Williams Step this way , sir , and take off your clothes . If you are on an honest errand , no harm will come to you . Williams and Van Wart withdraw with Andr just outside the stage . PAULDING . Paulding A British officer , in disguise , with a passport from General Arnold . That 's odd . And how anxious he seems . When I told him to dismount , he turned pale . There 's something crooked , which we may be the means of straightening . ( Renter Van Wart . ) Do you find any papers ? VAN WART . Van Wart Nothing ; and we 've searched him thoroughly . PAULDING , Paulding going to the side . Williams , look into his boots . WILLIAMS . Williams There 's nothing in this one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  What 's that in your stocking ? Off with it .  --  Here are papers . Paulding , you can read . Gives Paulding the papers . PAULDING . Paulding What 's this ? Artillery orders at West Point . And here 's one marked , " Estimate of the force at West Point and its dependencies . " Williams , search the other foot . If he is not a spy , I do n't know how to read . WILLIAMS . Williams Here are three more . Gives them to Paulding . PAULDING , Paulding reading . " Report of a Council of War on the Campaign . " " Description of the works at West Point . " There 's treason , somewhere ,  --  nothing less . Some black plot . What a providence that we were at this very spot at this very hour ! Keep your eye on him , Isaac . He 's a prize . We must take him right off to North Castle . That 's the nearest station . Andr , who has re-dressed , advances . Paulding and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside . Sooner or later a curse doth ever follow false-hood How quick it falls on me . Till now my life was true . This is my first lie , and I am caught in it ,  --  caught acting a monstrous false-hood . Oh , what a fool I 've been ! They should have chosen some sharper , harder instrument for such a work .  --  I blame no one but myself .  --  What will be my fate ?  --  I dare not think of it . Rests his head against a tree . PAULDING . Paulding I tell you , this is a great day 's work . Few of the generals have done a better . WILLIAMS . Williams Think you so ? PAULDING . Paulding Aye . Had that man got to New York with those papers , in a week the English would have had West Point . And then , good bye to our cause . VAN WART . Van Wart Indeed ! PAULDING . Paulding Mark me : when this republic shall have grown great ,  --  which it will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and shall be as strong as old England herself  --  WILLIAMS . Williams As strong as England ! PAULDING . Paulding Aye , it will take but two or three generations for that ;  --  for this day 's doings , tens of millions will know the names of us three , and speak them with thanks , and will hand them down to be blessed by their children 's children , to the twentieth generation ; and on this very spot where we stand will gather a great crowd ,  --  which our children may live to see ,  --  and raise a monument to our memory . VAN WART . Van Wart What ! a monument ! PAULDING . Paulding Aye . And thereon , in large , deep letters , your name , Isaac , will be cut . Now to our prisoner . See how he 's troubled . I shold n't wonder if he turns out to be a British general . WILLIAMS , Williams to Andr . Now , what will you give us to let you go ? ANDR . Major Andr Anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse , saddle , bridle , watch , and one hundred guineas ? ANDR . Major Andr And a hundred apiece to each of you besides , and as much more in dry goods , and have them delivered at this very spot , or anywhere that you shall name . PAULDING . Paulding Not for ten thousand guineas would we let you go . Here is some dark plot against the American cause , and you , Mr. Anderson , as your passport calls you , are an agent in it . Had you this passport directly from General Arnold 's hand ? ANDR . Major Andr Ask me no questions . PAULDING . Paulding When did you see General Arnold ? ANDR . Major Andr Bring me to one of your commanders . To him I will reveal all . PAULDING . Paulding Forward , then , to North Castle . Exeunt . SCENE II .

Where 's the General ? HAMILTON . Colonel Hamilton He turned off towards the river , to inspect the works before dismounting . He sends us to request that you will not wait breakfast for him . ARNOLD . Major-General Arnold Mrs. Arnold , this is Colonel Alexander Hamilton , aide-de-camp to General Washington ; Major McHenry , aide-de-camp to the Marquis Lafayette . The orders of the Commander-in-Chief , whatever they may be , must be obeyed ; so , we will go to breakfast . Come , gentlemen . ( All sit at the table . ) This ride to Hartford has been a pleasant holiday to you . How did you like our French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what we like even better than them is the effect the interview with Count Rochambeau has had on General Washington . We all observe that he is less silent and more cheerful since we left Hartford than on the journey thither . ARNOLD . Major-General Arnold What is the amount of the land-force the Count has brought over ? McHENRY . Major McHenry Between six and seven thousand choice troops . ARNOLD . Major-General Arnold Any artillery ? McHENRY . Major McHenry A larger train than belongs to such a force ; both heavy and light guns . Enter an Attendant , who gives Arnold a letter , and retires . ARNOLD , Major-General Arnold who with difficulty conceals his emotion while reading the letter . I am called , gentlemen , across the river to West Point . Say to General Washington that I have been suddenly summoned on business . Exit . HAMILTON . Colonel Hamilton The General , I fear , has had bad news . That letter seemed to disturb him . MRS .

' T is the hardest duty he ever had to do . VARICK . Major Varick What a fate for a young , generous gentleman ! HAMILTON . Colonel Hamilton As bitter to him , poor fellow , as his capture was to us providentially merciful . A full , fair trial he has had by a jury , than which one more enlightened and honorable never gave a verdict . Six Major-Generals ,  --  Greene , President , and with him , Stirling , St. Clair , Lafayette , Howe , Steuben ; and eight Brigadiers ,  --  Parsons , Clinton , Knox , Glover , Patterson , Hand , Huntington , Stark . To justice never was given by a tribunal a stronger bond than that sealed by the character of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissentient voice ? HAMILTON . Colonel Hamilton Finally , none . Two or three members of the board , prompted by humanity , started some technical objections , but could not sustain them . Andr bears his doom like a soldier , and , by his gentleness and dignity , wins all who approach him . VARICK . Major Varick In battle how light a thing it is to give or take death . But in calm blood , by deliberate judgment to cut off the life of a fellow-being ,  --  the brain trembles over its work . The thought of Andr must light a hell in Arnold 's breast . HAMILTON . Colonel Hamilton In his breast there is not glow enough to kindle the fires of conscience . His nature is ruthless and shameless . Think of his writing a defiant , threatening letter to the Commander-in-Chief . Enter Sergeant Briggs , accompanied by another sergeant . BRIGGS . Sergeant Briggs Can you tell me , Colonel Hamilton , has General Washington signed the sentence ? HAMILTON . Colonel Hamilton Not yet . BRIGGS . Sergeant Briggs But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T is said he will . BRIGGS . Sergeant Briggs I knew he would . HAMILTON . Colonel Hamilton How did you know it ? BRIGGS . Sergeant Briggs Because he ought to sign it ; and he never yet failed , and never will fail , to do what he ought to do . HAMILTON . Colonel Hamilton Some think he ought not to sign it . BRIGGS . Sergeant Briggs Tories and traitors and love-sick girls . HAMILTON . Colonel Hamilton Sergeant , you seem much moved . BRIGGS . Sergeant Briggs Moved ! I have n't slept for a week for dreaming . The instant I close my eyes , I see the cursed red-coats pouring up the heights ,  --  our men scattered and flying , shot down like rabbits ,  --  officers bewildered ,  --  all dismayed , all betrayed . They 've scaled Fort Putnam ! There ! the royal ensign waves above it ! And that wakes me ; and I cry for joy to find I 've been dreaming . I shall do nothing but dream o ' nights while Andr lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life . HAMILTON . Colonel Hamilton What 's that ? BRIGGS . Sergeant Briggs Their giving us Arnold in his place . Oh , for that , I 'd hug Andr with my one arm . I have but the one ; but look you , Colonel , I 'll lay it on a block , and you may hew it off inch by inch to the shoulder , if thereby we can clutch that  --  what shall I say  --  traitor ! There have been traitors before ; but Arnold is something diabolically new . VARICK . Major Varick Now that his villany is baffled , what have we to gain by taking the life of poor Andr ? BRIGGS . Sergeant Briggs Poor Andr ,  --  what to gain ? I knew a man , a brave one . I saw him fight at Princeton ,  --  a young , strong man and true . He left a wife and babe at home in Monmouth . The day before yesterday came a letter telling him his wife was ill unto death . No mother , no sister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside himself with grief . In that state he deserted . He was taken ; and yesterday , within twelve hours of his capture , he was shot ; and it was right that he was ,  --  it was right . And a British officer , by the British Commander-in-Chief sent with most malignant purpose , comes within our lines under a false name , under a false character , in disguise , at midnight , to plot with the worst enemy our cause could have ,  --  to plot the ruin of that cause by one great perfidious blow ,  --  goes away in the dark , hiding in his boots the plans and papers to make that blow unfailing ; this man , who came upon us stealthily , like a thief in the night , and went out like a thief in the night , carrying with him a key to our very citadel of safety ,  --  a man , who , by means gotten through his own double , treble falsehood and the deep treason of his black accomplice , would , within a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our army , struck despair to the whole country 's heart , perhaps , aye , quite possibly , made captive Washington himself ,  --  this man ,  --  this man is poor Andr ! Hanging 's too good for him . Exit , followed by his companion , who makes an energetic gesture of sympathy and approval . VARICK . Major Varick Colonel , there 's marrow in that man 's bones . HAMILTON . Colonel Hamilton Aye , Major ; that 's the stuff that carried us into this war , and will carry us through it . Exeunt . SCENE V. A Hall . At the father end General Washington , seated at a table , with his face to the audience , takes a pen . The fourteen Generals who formed the Board of Inquiry that sat on Andr are standing about the table on his right and left , looking at him sign the sentence , which he does . He then rises , gives the paper to General Greene , President of the Board , bows to the Generals and retires , they all bowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weak pen to tremble , Until he ruled it with his mighty will . LAFAYETTE . Major-General Marquis Lafayette Tears are rare visitors to those calm eyes ; And when they come , they bring a solemn message From the great heart that could no longer quench them . KNOX . General Knox But once before have I beheld him thus . STEUBEN . Major-General Baron Steuben And yet , at last , in what a clear firm hand He wrote the one irrevocable word , His loved and dreaded name . GREENE . Major-General Greene The steady hand Belongs to war , to peace the moistened eye . War dislocates the man , his sterner half Ruling the gentler with the soldier 's law , Which is sharp as his sword , quick as his flint . KNOX . General Knox The law of war is now our law of life . Its rough necessities so sway the hour That in a case like this mercy were suicide . LAFAYETTE . Major-General Marquis Lafayette As if by miracle we have escaped The ruin of the noblest , grandest cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the storms of rageful war . GREENE . Major-General Greene By providential blessing we 've escaped ; But while from danger 's loosened grip our hearts Still shudder , round beneath us baffled Death From rock to rock , in sight , springs black and bellowing , Where the loud foam of open enmity Curls o'er the silent reefs of treason deep ; So that , to ward the costliest wreck e'er strewn Upon the shores of time , we still must bind In one great cable all our life 's best threads , And on our haughty foe hurl death for death . THE END .
