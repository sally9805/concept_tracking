NEXT to the interest to be derived from tracing the development of a remarkable individual character , we may place the pleasure and profit consequent upon a careful survey of the successive steps by which nations , or the separate states of a nation , have lifted themselves from a wild and savage condition to prosperity and power . And , as in the former case we // give more earnest heed to the early records of those lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the latter we dwell longest upon the history of those regions which , with great natural capabilities , have received the most fortunate care . The rise of the United States of America to place and prominence among the governments of the earth , is unprecedented and marvellous . Viewed in comparison with the long and tedious processes by which the countries of the Old World were gradually civilized , theirs is a brilliant and startling history ; a verification , in a secular sense , of the prophecy , that " a nation shall be born in a day . " But if this be noticeable in the States united , it is especially true of those single States which have more recently been added to the Union . The very latest accessions are too new to allow of any valuable judgment as to their promise ; but of those which are still so young as to be included in the comprehensive term " Out West , " there is much to learn that is inspiriting and useful . Michigan , in her early history , the most romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of rapid and steady progress , and in her future promise of desirable position and unfailing resources , is well worthy the attention of the wise and thoughtful men of this age . Already is her fame so far established as to admit of looking up her antecedents and establishing her pedigree ; a task which we find to have been carefully and lovingly performed in a book , published a few years ago , under the title of " The Early Days of Michigan . " These pages carry us back to the time when the capacities of the great Northwest began to be regarded with prudent eyes by the statesmen of the Old World , and their delegates in the New . By a kind of tacit agreement , this part of the continent had been left to the French ; the English having appropriated the middle , and the Spanish the southern portions . The cheerfulness of disposition and restless spirit of adventure which characterize the French nation enable them to make light of the drawbacks of a cold and inhospitable climate ; so we find them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making the most of the few natural advantages they pos // sessed . But that star of empire which had guided the daring wanderers to Canadian wilds still went before , and beckoned them westward , till it stood over the cradle of future promise , - the beautiful region of the Lakes . It is a striking proof of the sagacity of the Indian race , that , without chart or compass , they always succeeded in selecting for their favorite places of meeting the most eligible positions in the whole range of their wanderings , - spots which were not only the best adapted to serve their own convenience , but as to which the superior knowledge and advanced needs of their successors have abundantly justified their selection . Accordingly , we find that the site of the present city of Detroit , and the site called Old Mackinaw , commanding the entrance to Lakes Superior , Huron , and Michigan , were early known and occupied as head-quarters by the savages . From the warsongs and traditions of the various tribes , we gather that there had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these important points . But the " pale-faces " were welcomed by all , and the inducements offered in the way of trade gave to the French an easy and peaceable entrance . Nor was this first success vitiated by subsequent imprudence . The French seem to have been kind and genial neighbors , indulgent and considerate masters . The early efforts of the Jesuits , among whom were IRaymbault , Mesnard , Allouez , and Marquette , who not only labored , but died in the strife , had created a feeling of filial reverence toward the French king and his representatives in the hearts of the warlike but simple natives . It is curious to read of the innocent devices by which the French officials contrived to explain their ideas of justice to their untutored brethren ; and in how frank and childlike a spirit their separate interests were harmonized . In fact , it was not till the jealousies arising between the different orders of IRomish priests had begun to make trouble among diplomatists and officers , and the influence of the English had encroached upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a sense of the existence of " lords many , " and set their native shrewdness and duplicity at work to discover the stronger side , and to mark out their own consequent policy . But after these various interests had once come // into play , there was no further security ; and his was an unenviable position who stood at the head of Western affairs , in the feeble little fort at Detroit . The man who , in the most trying times , showed the best ability to meet and guide them , was M. de la Motte Cadillac , who held the post from 1696 to 1*T11 , a period of fifteen years . He was appointed while Count Frontenac was Governor-General of Canada , - himself the best possible man for his place , whose very name was a word of power among the savages . The letters of M. Cadillac to this functionary and to his successors are remarkable and intensely interesting productions . They describe the state of affairs in the little colony with the vivid freshness of a picture , while his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own constant endeavors to counteract their plans , show us a naive simplicity and directness which , when brought into action , must have proved an awkward obstacle to those crafty and politic schemers . It appears that , in order to secure the immense fur-trade of the Northwest for France , the merchants engaged in that traffic organized themselves into an association , known as " The Company of the Colony of Canada . " The Directors of this Company were Jesuits , and sympathized strongly with their reverend brethren scattered throughout the West as missionaries . Their principal point was Michilimackinac , and it was for their interest that this post should be maintained , as in case of its abandonment the Indians would no longer make their annual visit to Moiitreal , with presents for the GovernorGeneral . On the other hand , La Motte Cadillac , the first strong ruler at Detroit , was a Franciscan , and a cordial hater of the Jesuits . The chaplain of the fort was a Franciscan monk , and a house of Recollets was early established in the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that society could not hope to gain the chief power over such counteracting influences ; and hence their determined endeavor to destroy the post , especially as it might easily be placed in more direct communication with Montreal than Michilimackinac could possibly be in the event of an Indian war . With these selfish motives at work , under the powerful machinery which the Jesuits always brought to bear upon any and // every opposing force , poor Cadillac led a weary and harassed life . The following extracts will give an idea of his mode of thought , as well as of his keen appreciation of his position . In speaking of his desire to induce the Indians of this region to settle at Detroit , from which locality they had been driven many years before by the Iroquois , he says - " It seems that God has raised me as another Moses , to go and deliver this people from captivity ; or rather as Caleb , to bring them back to the country of their fathers , - to their ancient dwelling-place , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Montreal plays the part of Pharaoh ; he can not see this emigration without trembling , and he arms himself to destroy it . But I hope the Count , noticing that he is a ferocious beast , without a guide and without light , will smooth my path and break through the impediments , only to inundate and submerge those who have the rashness to desire the overthrow of a design so just . " In another place he speaks in plain terms of the machinations of the Jesuits , who were doing their best to destroy the settlement at Detroit . He writes to the Colonial Minister : " You wished me to be a friend of the Jesuits , and to have no trouble with them . After much reflection , I have found only three ways in which this can be accomplished . The first is , to let them do as they please ; the second , to do whatever they desire ; and the third , to say nothing of what they do . " And again : " I do my best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theirs ; but , if I dare say it , all impiety apart , it would be better to speak against God than against them ; because , on the one side , a person might receive his pardon ; but on the other , the offence , though doubtful , is never forgiven in this world , and would not be in the other , if their credit were as good there as it is in this country . " But this brave and honest man could not long contend single-handed and single-hearted with the mass of influence arrayed against him . Not only were the Jesuits sworn to work his ruin , but the Directors of the Trading Company , and even the Governor-General and other high officers , joined the league , and procured his arrest and detention for trial at Qnebec . This was in consequence of Cadillac 's fearless exposure of frauds committed by men connected with these officers ; for , // as is the case in almost all monopolies , the opportunity for selfaggrandizement at the expense of honesty proved a temptation too strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gathered from the reply of Count Pontchartrain , when Cadillac was explaining to him the situation of the parties concerned . " Pray stop , " said he , " I shall soon believe that all who are in the employ of the Company at Detroit , and wish to retain you at Quebec , are the relatives of the three Directors , and also allied to the Governor-General . " This trial , which disclosed a reasonable amount of human depravity , resulted in the honorable acquittal of Cadillac , and his reinstatement in office . He resumed at once his cares and his patient endurance of them ; and for the few years which remained of his public service he manifested an earnestness of spirit , and a large appreciation of the capabilities of his position , which increased its power and proved him to be in advance of his time and material . One of his first efforts , after establishing the post at Detroit , was to urge upon the Company the necessity of providing a seminary for the instruction of the children of the savages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered as the first promoter of educational interests in Michigan . He also gave a large sum for the erection of a church in the little colony , and seems to have had ever before him the importance of mental and moral training for the improvement of individual and national character . He had the satisfaction of leaving the fort in a flourishing condition , and it continued to withstand the assaults of its various enemies till , by the surrender of Montreal in 1760 , it passed , with Mackinaw and other less important posts , into the hands of the British . Soon after their accession to power , the well-matured conspiracy of Pontiac had wellnigh deprived them of their long coveted possessions , and the effect of this attempt was to destroy their confidence in their Indian allies , rendering a life which was at best full of annoyance and hardship also burdened with anxiety and distrust . After an occnpancy of several years , during which Detroit grew in size and importance , the treaty between England and the United States gave these frontiers to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe check from a fire , which burned up the whole town , leaving the inhabitants houseless and homeless . With brave hearts they hastened to repair the evil , and content and peace once more settled upon the scene of so much strife and sorrow - for a little time ; but with the war of 1812 came another struggle for a point so manifestly important . The short conflict with the British , and the cowardly surrender of General Hull , are painful subjects , which we hasten by , and would fain cover from the researches of history . But after a year of forced submission to foreign rule , Detroit was surrendered to General Harrison , to the great joy of the patriotic settlers . With this happy consummation the early history of Michigan comes to a close . It is for us now to note her progress in the arts of peace , the helps and rewards which she offers to the industrious who cultivate her resources , the influence of these upon her prosperity , and the character of her people . To the traveller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit or Mackinaw , we would repeat with confidence the motto on her public seal , " Si qu*ris peninsulam amcenam , circumspice . " The beauties of the northern shore have been described by scores of writers , and are annually gazed upon by hundreds of delighted tourists . Mackinaw , the head and type of these gifts of nature , affords many charms to arrest and beguile the admiration of the visitor . The site of the mission of St. Ignace , the favorite home of the sainted Marquette , the ruins of the old fort , and the present quaint little town , are all comprised within an area of a few miles , and contain historical traces and associations which are full of mournful , yet pleasing interest . The beauty-loving eye could desire no fairer spot ; the antiquarian finds here relics of a lost and buried time ; and the political economist sees upon this quiet wave-washed shore the key to the whole Northwest , - the future Queen City of the Lakes . Heretofore there has not been sufficient attention paid to remote probabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mackinaw , or rather of Old Mackinaw , demands the thoughtful regard of men of business and enterprise whose interests are identified with the prosperity of the West . Commanding as it does the entrance to three great lakes , sur // rounded by flourishing free States , and with the yet undeveloped resources of immense tracts pressing down upon it from the North , this spot can not fail to become the most accessible and important depot for trade west of New York . All the extensive pine forests of Northern Michigan must send their growth through the Straits of Mackinaw ; all the future crops of grain which these upper countries are so eminently calculated to bring forth must in this manner seek the sea-board ; while the vast mineral yield can find no other medium of transport . It is the " manifest destiny " of this now quiet retreat to receive the rich abundance of the Northwest , and send it with fresh impetus to the Atlantic shores . But while these advantages are plain for peaceful times , it were well to inquire into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - especially a war with England . By looking at a common map it is easy to perceive that very few positions are so strong as this . Gibraltar , Singapore , and Panama only are parallels to the case in question . The island of Mackinaw could easily be made into an impregnable fortress ; while the site upon the mainland stands out observant and self-defensive on every side . The natural stronghold for the possession of which the savage warrior , the sagacious French trader , and the welldisciplined English soldier alike strove , has not lost aught of its precedency by the closing around of a busy and successful population ; it is equal to every emergency , and can meet every demand . Meanwhile , this region will be famed for its objects of interest and its health-giving climate . The cool , bracing air will woo the invalid from the debilitating heat of a southern summer ; the legends of a fanciful race will charm young hearts to new visions of beauty ; and the artistic eye and cultivated mind will find in the scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delightful meditations . In the southeastern part of the State , commanding the entrance to Lakes Erie and Huron , stands the city which has thus far attested the early-discovered importance of her situation , - Detroit , - the noble fruit of a seed planted and replanted in toil and blood , and cherished with a profound faith in its future* growth and power . This prosperous city rises before 16* // us , endued with the absorbing interest we feel for one who has " a story " in her life beyond the outward seeming . To those who know her history , her name is enveloped in tender memories , as soft and mournful as the hazy light of the Indian summer ; and we no longer wonder that poets have sung and day-dreamers related the scenes of her early days , or that the commonest details take an air of romance as they approach those trying times . Hence we delight to read of this spot when its charms were first disclosed to the gaze of the white man ; when the silence was unbroken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more stealthy tread of the hunter ; when the peaceful river bore no heavier burden than the Indian 's canoe ; - or , further on , - when trade began to arouse the slumbering energies of its few inhabitants ; when this same stream was alive with freighted boats , bearing their wealth of furs to the emissaries of the French king , and when nationality first spoke out in the floating banner of the fleur de us ; - later still , when the vivacity of French life and rule was succeeded by the sway of the energetic and far-seeing English , and the cross of St. George spread protection over fort and hamlet ; when the sweet decorum of home-life had in it enough of border freedom to give variety and picturesque effect , and the inhabitants had time and opportunity to love and be happy ; - and , latest of all , when this favored spot , not losing the benefits of Anglo-Saxon rule , but passing to a younger and more active branch of the all-conquering race , became the long-desired possession of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream of Western prosperity flows steadily on , leaving golden sands upon the shore . The days of poetic incident are gone forever ; but we would not change for these the hum of industry , the clash and din with which art comes up to the help of nature , and ennobles the commonest pursuits . More pleasing the long array of dingy storehouses and factories at the water 's edge , than the picturesque hut of the Indian ; more satisfying the forest of bare and slender masts , than the waving trees of old ; more beautiful the quick-glancing sails of busy ships , than the lightfloating , errandless bark canoe . Perhaps our recent history affords no more complete picture // of the prosperous and happy condition of Detroit , than was witnessed on the night of September 20 , 1860 , the occasion of the arrival upon our shores of the heir to the British crown . All day the friendly work of preparation had gone on , and darkness revealed the display which patriotism had made under the direction of good feeling and good taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreads , lights flamed out from dock and shipping ; the vessels within reach had been secured and advantageously stationed , while up and down went the swift-sailing sloops , hung with colored lamps from deck to masthead . The steamer which was to bear the Prince from his own dominions to ours , illuminated from stem to stern , waited at the opposite wharf , and sent forth sweet chords of music to beguile the lingering moments . On the Canadian shore , so near that it seems a part of our own , the churches and homes of Windsor were ablaze with light ; and at short intervals the thunder of artillery was heard , starting each eager heart to *t fuller throb of expectancy ; - while with us flags floated in the night-wind , the emblems of the two friendly nations grouped harmoniously in the sight of all ; and , as if to anticipate the sentiments of the entertainers , familiar mottos shone transparent from heads of ships , and decorated house-fronts . " Welcome , laddie , for your mither 's sake , " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his first greeting from the United States . Can those who were present ever forget the burst of enthusiasm which rose from the farther shore , when guns and bells and bands of music proclaimed that the royal youth had reached the limit of his inheritance , and embarked for a new country , - a shout which was taken up by thousands of strong voices among the people who waited for him , growing louder as the steamer ploughed her way across the river to the solemn strains of " God save the Queen , " and rising to a grand exultant chorus as his foot first pressed the soil of the American States . Even as we write , our pulse beats quicker at the recollection of that sublime manifestation of brotherhood , - a faint foreshadowing of the promised reign of universal peace and goodwill which the world now longs for and waits to see . In apportioning the gifts of fortune to Michigan , Nature would seem to have relaxed her usually strict system of com // pensation , and bestowed upon this favored spot not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetable and mineral wealth which would call other resources into use , and increase the prosperity of its inhabitants . In the northern part of the State , apparently inexhaustible mines of copper give employment and reward to hundreds of busy men . Just below this region , immense tracts of pine forest await the woodman 's axe ; the waters of the lakes yield abundance of fish , which are shipped to Eastern markets ; and the earth brings forth every variety of fruit , grain , and esculent root , in liberal measure and of richest quality . The orchards of Michigan have long been famous for the most luscious of peaches , plums , and pears ; the spiciest of apples grow in profusion , and are in great demand in less favored portions of the country ; while the high prices at which the best Michigan wheat and flour are always sold attest the superior quality of her grain crops . Nor are the productions of warmer climates out of place in this accommodating atmosphere , made soft and genial by the vast bodies of water which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivated with success ; while the grape , in all its varieties , yields richly with careful nurture . Now that the rural districts are becoming more settled , and their capabilities better understood , many farmers make a specialty of some one branch of their occupation , for which they and their lands are the best fitted , and by this plan meet with the success which concentration of thought and action always brings . Some entire farms are devoted to grazing , and the stock is often of the best breeds , and developed under the most favorable circumstances . Others give their time and attention to the raising of fruit , and it is good for the eye to witness the perfection which may be attained in this department . Others again devote their fields to grain , and their sheaves are like the sheaf of Joseph , to which those of his brethren paid obeisance . In truth , there seems to be no useful production of the earth which may not find a home in Michigan , no natural advantage which is not there proffered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which belongs to mountains ; but though we look in vain for their sublime presence , yet the scenery is by no means tame , nor // wanting in picturesque effect . The first settlers in the interior have all the same story to tell of the beauty of the oak openings which were the characteristic feature of the land scape . In these vast forests the trees , instead of presenting a dense growth , stood singly or in groups , like those of an English park ; while weeds and underbrush were prevented by the annual fires kindled by the Indians , which swept through the whole country , destroying all tender life , and leaving only the sturdy trees . Underneath , the mossy sward lay green and soft as velvet , the prevailing tint being relieved by a profusion of many-colored blossoms . The wild-flowers of this region are the admiration of every lover of nature . It would seem as though there were some peculiarity in the atmosphere which gives to all natural objects a richer hue and softer shades of coloring . The sunsets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Italian skies which inspired the pencil of Claude Lorraine . The Michigan rose retains its name when transplanted to other lands , and is made forever sacred by having been chosen to bloom upon the grave of Felicia Hemans ; and one of England 's loveliest daughters , amidst the splendors of a court ball , could find no richer garland for her fair head than a chaplet of autumn leaves from Michigan . Beneath this beautiful surface lie the hidden treasures of the earth , - mines of coal long prophesied of by geologists , but now first brought to account , and newly-discovered salt-springs of greater strength than those of Western New York . Thus , with every inducement to honest labor and with unusual natural facilities for the transportation of its products , Michigan advances into the front rank of the Free States ; her advantages being those which time and progress will only develop and increase . We may now ask what is the character of the people so highly favored , and whether their intellectual culture keeps pace with their commercial prosperity , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Michigan is more perfect than that of any other State , unless Massachusetts be excepted , and its design is even more liberal than that of Massachusetts . In order to provide a settled fund for the establishment and perpetuation // of free schools , the first State Convention submitted to Congress a proposition , that one section in every township should be set apart for this purpose , which was approved of and made a law . The sale of these lands has created a large principal , the interest of which is distributed annually throughout the State , and is an ample provision for the educational needs of the people . By the terms of this law every township is divided into several school-districts , varying in size according to the number of inhabitants , in each of which there must be kept a free school during three months of the year , and if a longer term be desired , the tax to aid in meeting the expense is very small . Nor is the plan limited to the primary school . In sufficiently populous neighborhoods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which larger privileges can be secured , and a higher standard of scholarship attained . Some of the finest buildings in the State are those of the union schools , where everything calculated to refine the mind and to aid in simplifying knowledge is to be found , and where men of superior talents and training are called to preside . Here the student may receive a full preparation for college , and may even complete the studies of the first year of that course , while less advanced pupils find also a place and due attention . Next in the scale come the normal schools , adapted to fit teachers for the primary schools , and thus far conducted with excellent success . But the chief glory of the State is her University , the history and system of which deserve thorough attention and consideration . The beginning of this institution may be dated as early as 1817 , as we find from a curious document entitled , " An Act to establish the Catholepistemiad , or University of Michigania . " Herein , amidst much quaintness of expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generosity in plan as could be allowed at that early day ; but the scheme does not seem to have proved feasible , and the matter rested till , in 1821 , a step in advance was taken by the adoption of another act , vesting the government of the proposed institution in a Board of Trustees , twenty-one in number . But it was not till the admission of the Territory of Michigan into the Union as a State , that the University was placed upon its pres // ent secure basis , - a part of that ordinance being the grant of two entire townships of land for the creation of the fund , which have proved so valuable that the present income is upward of forty thousand dollars . In the organization of the University the Board of Regents was appointed by the Legislature ; but in 1850 a change was made in the organic law , and the control was given to officers elected directly by the people . In other respects the plan continues unchanged . The organization provides for three departments , - that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicine , and that of Law , - all of which are in successful operation . There is no provision for a theological department , nor is it probable that there ever will be , as the idea of a State institution does not admit the existence of any sectarian system . Let us glance at the present condition of the University of Michigan , as displayed in the Catalogue for the year 1861 . And in order that those who know comparatively nothing of its history may be apprised of its local habitation as well as its name , we will say a word of Ann Arbor , the place in which it is situated . This pleasant little city is distant only thirty-five miles from Detroit , the chief town in the State , and is upon the line of the Central Railroad , which renders it easy of access from all points . It is in the most hilly , and consequently the most healthy , part of the State ; and , from the same cause , the scenery in and around its limits is interQsting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of active business , the main dependence for prosperity being upon the University . The tone of society is above that of ordinary towns of the same size ; not only from the presence of so many cultivated men belonging to the Faculties , but also from the fact that families of wealth and refinement are led to choose this spot as a home , in order to the better education of their children . All these things tend to promote quietness and order in common life , and throw a restraint upon the impulses of the hundreds of young men there assembled . Then the dormitory system has recently been abolished , and the students board and lodge in private families , being under the common law for citizens , and finding it for their interest to conform to the same rules of propriety . Of course , there are // persons and places in the community whose aim it is to entice the young to dissipation and vice , and students are found who yield readily to the instincts of a depraved nature ; but these instances are rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life declare that this University is singularly happy in its influences , and remarkably exempt from disgraceful scenes and characters . Having spoken of the physical surroundings of this seminary , let us now consider the scope and aim of its educational provisions . We quote from the Catalogue - " In the Department of Science , Literature , and the Arts , that grade of studies has been established which in our country is usually designated as the Collegiate , or Undergraduate . This , in all our colleges , corresponds in general to the course in the Gymnasia of Germany . In the University of Michigan , it is a cardinal object to make this correspondence as complete as possible . Hence it is proposed to make the studies here pursued , not only introductory to professional studies , and to studies in the higher branches of science and literature , but also to embrace such studies as are now particularly adapted to agriculture , the mechanic arts , and to the industrial arts generally . Accordingly , a distinct scientific course has been added , running parallel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four years , embracing the same number of classes , with the same designations . In this course , a more extended range of Mathematics and the Natural Sciences , together with English Language and Literature , is substituted for the Greek and Latin Languages . Students who have in view particular branches , as connected immediately with their pursuits in life , and who do not aim at general scientific or literary study , are admitted to Optional Courses . " The design of the Regents and Faculty is to make the Collegiate or Gymnastic Department as ample and rich as possible , and to adapt it to the wants of all classes of Students that properly come within its range " But the Regeiits and Faculty can not forget that a system of Public Instruction can never be complete without the highest form of education , any more than without that primary education which is the natural and necessary introduction to the whole . The Undergraduate Course , after all that can be done to perfect it , is still limited to a certain number of years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After this must come professional studies , and more extended studies in Science , Literature , and the Arts ; which alone can lead to profound // and finished scholarship . In such a system of education , that which forms the culmination of the whole can not be discarded . An institution can not deserve the name of a University , which does not aim , in all the mat6riel of learning , in the Professorships which it establishes , and in the whole scope of its provisions , to make it possible for every ' student to study what he pleases , and to any extent he pleases . Nor can it be regarded as consistent with the spirit of a free country to deny to its citizens the possibilities of the highest knowledge " The Medical and Legal Departments already established belong to the University proper " The University course is also already , in part , opened , in the Department of Science and Letters ; where courses of Lectures are given for those who have graduated at this , or other institutions , and for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable them to attend upon them with advantage . These Lectures , in accordance with the educational system of Germany and France , will form the proper development of the University , in distinction from the College or the Gymnasium now in operation . " - pp. 33-35 . It will at once be perceived that the organization of this liberal plan , and its application to a Western University , must have been achieved by highly cultivated and enlightened : minds ; and that the men who are most closely connected . with its affairs must be possessed of fine natural powers and large experience . The present Chancellor is a type of the prevailing spirit .. The name of Henry P. Tappan is one well known in the world of letters ; and its owner , whether viewed as a polished gentleman , a profound scholar , or a Christian philosopher , stands among the first men of the age . Associated with him in the various professorships are active workers , deep thinkers , men of character and genius , some of whom are already widely known through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others give brilliant promise of future fame , and all are earnestly engaged in a work of present usefulness which will bring ample reward in the development of the minds and hearts now under their training . The material helps provided by the University for this culture are already great , and will be continually increased . The Library numbers eight thousand volumes of valuable works , which are daily accessible to students . The Museum , V*OL . XCIII. - NO. 192. 17 // in its various departments of Natural History , Anatomy , and Materia Medica , contains a large collection of choice specimens , and the Gallery devoted to the illustration of History and the Fine Arts presents many objects of beauty and of classical interest . The Chemical Laboratory is one of the most complete and best arranged in the country , and contains , among other valuable apparatus , the celebrated Ruhmkorff 's Coil , for the demonstration of the workings of electricity . The Observatory possesses one of the best meridian-circles in existence , and a refracting telescope , than which there are but two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities for a complete education are offered to the student at so low a price as not to deserve to be called a price , and may be considered as virtually free to all . The sum of ten dollars , paid at the commencement of his career , and five dollars paid annually , entitles the student to the full enjoyment of the . *dvantages of every department in the University . The necessary expenses for board , lodging , and incidentals may be included in the sum of one hundred and twenty-five dollars ; and some , by strict economy , live on a still smaller sum . To refer again to the Catalogue - " The University of Michigan is popular , in the strictest sense ; whether we consider its course of study , or the fact that it is freely opened to all the people , without distinction . " Its present condition confirms this view of its character . While the sons of the rich , and of men of more or less property , and , in large proportion , the sons of substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is also a very considerable number of young men dependent entirely upon their own exertions , - young men who , accustomed to work on the farm , or in the mechanic 's shop , have become smitten with the love of knowledge , and are manfully working their way through to a liberal education , by appropriating a portion of their time to the field or the workshop . " - pp. 67 , 68 . The summary of the'classes proves that these advalitages are by no means unknown or neglected . The number of students in attendance at present is six hundred and seventy-four . We have shown our readers Michigan as she was in her beginning , as a Territory , and as she is now , in her youth , as a State .
