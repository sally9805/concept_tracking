txt II is very pleasant to have been the means of bringing two such journals as the World and Tribune into harmony of sentiment . We have that delightful satisfaction . Both these organs are suitably and harmoniously shocked at our intimation that the country was probably on the eve of a rupture with France , and that it would he wise to make preparation for that coetinuncy . The World was especially fearful that the expression of such an opinion might startle the weak nerves of " Wall-street , " though its principal concern , ( as was quite natural under the circumstances , ) was for the " dignity ofjournalism . " It made haste to announce that sundry Senators and other distinguished gentlemen , with Mr. SUMNER at their head , had called on the French Minister to assure him by their presence that they did not approve of the course of our Government in treating him and his Imperial Master with so little respect as was shown in declining his " suggestions " concerning the management of our domestic affairs . As this statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to its original base . The Tribune , in pursuance of the same general object , takes a higher flight . It publishes , as from " an occasional correspondent , " the following edifying paragraph : WAaarroToN , Feb. 20 , 1863 . Three days ago , a secret interview is said to have taken place at a friend 's house between Mr. LtscoLN and Mr. ** in which , If I am to trust my informant , questions of the greatest moment were reviewed and discussed . Notwithstanding the mystery observed in that interview , it is reported in diplomatic circles that Mr. LINCOLN denies leaving had any share m the framing If the document written In re 1 p.y to DROUYN DE LRUI-8. pi opos Mon , further than to have expressed , in Cabinet counsel , that the time for listening to the kind suggestions of France had not yet arrived . lie was very sorry to learn that exception bari been taken to the form in which the views of the Cabinet had been set forth ; and he hoped that the French Government would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its proposition , out paying any attention to the manner in Wick that refusal hod been presented . It is also stated that the President has recently been visited by prominent Senators and partistc , s , with whom he has remained closeted several hours , The greatest secretly is observed upon the subjects discussed in their interviews , the results of which , it is said , will soon be made known . It is noteworthy that at the same time a certain New-York journal , called in diplomatic circles the " servile Press , " has become furious against the Embassador of France and the French Government . Statesmen who are behind the scenes assert tha the unchaining of the dogs of war against France is an attempt at diplomatic strategy , produced by a oerfain feeling of insecurity which has suddenly taken possession of the Secretary of State . It is kis apprehensions on that subject , It is said , which have led the journal referred to during the last three days to denunciations of Mr. Micaezza and declarations of war against France . " We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their perspicacity . What it is that makes Mr. SEWARD feel " insecure " just now , we presume , is among the mysteries that are to be disclosed by and by . That he has been " unchaining the dogs of war " against France or anybody else , is a piece of news confined thus far exclusively to the Tribune 's " occasional correspondent . " Unless we have been entirely misled as to his sentiments , he has not the faintest idea that any such animal is loose , or is likely to be unchained within the next sixty or ninety days . He repeats the assurance constantly , in public and in private , that our relations with France and . ngland. were ! layer ' hilts . more arei , cAblelr , footing than ' at the preierit-moment. - : Neither the Tribune nor the World , we take it for granted , will for an instant question the - authenticity and conclusiveness of his opinion . Their habitual deference to his views , on both foreign and domestic topic 's , forbids any such suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action in the premises is especially edifying . Its estimate of the dignity and sense of propriety which mark his position and conduct , must have been acquired in some novel school . The Tribune probably is not aware that the Secretary of State never sends a.dispatch of any kind , either to our Ministers abroad or to any foreign Minister at Washington , without first reading it to the President , and taking his ' suggestions both as to its sentiments and the language in which they are couched . This has always been the practice of our State Department , as it is of every Foreign Secretary in any Government which has a responsible head ;  --  and we presume that Mr. SEWARD has never departed from so laudable and so necessary a habit . The idea , therefore , that President LINOOLN could hold a " secret interview " with a Foreign Minister , and disavow either the action or the language of his Secretary of State , on any subject of public importance , is about as atvitird as any crotchet that ever entered the Tribune 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It needs only the additional touch which the Tribune 's " Occasional Correspondent " gives it , ? in representing the President as begging M. MattetEs not to take any " notice " of anything he may find dialgreeahle in the Secretary 's dispatch  --  to make the conception worthy of an idiot ,  --  or of the Tribune 's " statesmen behind the scenes .
