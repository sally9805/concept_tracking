ART . VII . - HouRs OF LABOR . WHAT portion of a day laborers should work , is a question to which public attention is now very properly directed . The solution of this question will probably make it apparent that the interests of the employers and the employed are not materially diverse . There is no doubt that a man working a certain time with elastic vigor and determined purpose may accomplish as much or more than by a listless , sluggish , irksome application to work during a much longer period . The hours of labor may be so long as greatly to impair the bodily strength , and thus directly diminish the effective power . But , on the other hand , it is certain that the limit of greatest efficiency is less than that within which the physical organism can exert itself without detriment to its energy . It was always true , that intelligence added much to the efficiency of the laborer ; but it is more emphatically so now that so large a portion of the work requiring mere force is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery demanding intelligence to design and construct it , and then to superintend its movements . The intellectual improvement of the laborer is then of great importance , even in the merely economic aspect of the subject which we are considering . This improvement requires not only time , but mental effort , to which pbysical exhaustion by labor too long continued is very unfavorable , while a very considerable amount of bodily exercise gives tone and vigor to the mind 's action . It is , then , good economy to combine the two , and unwise to task all the powers of a man in mere muscular drudgery , to the exclusion of the mental effort which his intellectual health and progress demand . It is urged that laborers waste , or more than waste , the time which short working hours leave at their disposal . No class of men employ all their leisure most wisely ; but there is , perhaps , good reason to believe that none more nearly do so than laborers , when libraries , lyceums , and other means of unprovement are accessible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and directed , or even not misled , by those // 196 lTour8 of Lc*bor. whose superior advantages should make them the exemplars of society . Though much of the laborer 's leisure time may be wasted , yet that which is well employed will probably be in pro . portion to the whole quantity at his disposal ; and if more is given , more will be devoted to intellectual pursuits or moral cultivation . The conditions of slavery require that the laborers should be kept ignorant ; and this is one reason why accumulation in the Slave States has been so much less than in the Free . The slaves not only had no inducement , and hence no disposition , to earn , but through ignorance were comparatively powerless to do so . The cardinal points in our inquiry regard , in the first place , the quantity of product ; in the second , the division of that product . Security in its possession and economy in its application are important considerations , more remotely connected with our subject . The quantity of product depends upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which this labor is aided by natural agents or by artificial contrivances . Capital is one of the things needed to give efficiency to labor . As the laborers while at work on the growing crop must be fed , supported , paid from the accumulation of the past , this accumulation , this capital , constitutes a fund for this purpose . It is also needed to make the exchanges of property , - to construct roads , railways , and labor-saving machinery of various kinds . Having a value for these purposes , and the supply of it not being unlimited , it commands a price . This price is variable . In new countries , where there is little or no accumulation , and the opportunities for profitable use are numerous , its price is generally high , causing it to flow to them from older settled sections . In all countries , however , where there is trade , the products are divided between labor and capital ; and the proportion which each obtains is a very important point in this discussion . Labor and capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , the less will be left for the other . The capitalist often also labors , and , in that case , will get the shares respectively due to the amount of labor and of capital he supplies . When he furnishes the whole of both , the whole // product is his ; but it rarely if ever happens that a producer does not , in some way , avail himself of roads , railways , or machinery which have been provided by other capital than his own . Looking only to the enjoyment of material comforts , the common interest of mankind obviously demands that labor should be so employed as to realize the greatest production . The more of such comforts produced , the more easily can each individual procure a portion of them . It also appears , that for the greatest production the hours of labor must be less than the maximum which the mere muscles and sinews will bear . There must be time allotted to that intellectual development which gives efficiency and proper direction to muscular action . But the individual employer may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deem it his interest to foster the permanent efficiency of labor by accepting shorter days ' work at present , and for immediate gain may sordidly become accessory to the deterioration of his fellowmen . He may do this with the consent of those most directly injured . By high wages he may bribe the laborer to work himself , or , what is much worse , to cause his children to work , more h6urs than is compatible with his own or the public interest , or with humanity . Where the efficiency of the laborers has already been promoted by increased intelligence , such employers are in the position of a tenant hiring a farm which has been made productive by former good husbandry , but which he so crops as to render it comparatively barren , and then perhaps hires another to treat in the same manner . In neither case , however , does it often happen that so low a point of deterioration is actually arrived at , that a still lower may not be reached by a repetition of the same process . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably most nearly attained ; and here , too , the practice of weai*ng out one tract of land and removing - to another was most common . This system can probably only be sustained under the most favorable conditions of soil and climate , or by drawing more from the land than with slave culture it would continue to yield . These results , to some extent , illustrate the influence of ignorant and degraded labor . // It is obvious that the whole community , on purely economic grounds , has a deep interest in the great questions affecting labor , and the thought of individuals and the organized power of society may well be invoked to devise means to prevent its deterioration or promote its efficiency . It would not comport with our notions of liberty , nor should we deem it wise , or even expedient , for any government to interfere with the sphere of individual effort or duty , and deprive men of the needful discipline of self-control or self-direction , by prescribing the terms or conditions upon which they may dispose of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the common sentiment of humanity , demands that minors should be protected from the excessive toil which stints their intellectual growth , and that opportunities for the development of the greatest energy should be provided for all . It is obvious , however , that even for these objects the time of labor may be too short as well as too long , - so short that the product would not he sufficient to sustain the highest bodily or mental conditions , nor the accumulations suffice for erecting forges , mills , and constructing the various machinery by which h*iman labor is so abundantly aided . There would then be fewer products for use ; there would be a diminution of the comforts of life ; and if the consequent privation be divided between capitalisLs and laborers , all will have fewer of those comforts which labor provides . The idea prevails among laborers , and is shared by many others , that a general reduction of the hours of labor would so diminish the supply , that they could obtain as much wages for the shorter as they before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundation of the combinations to reduce the hours of work , and of interference with those disposed to work the longer time , it is important to ascertain how far it is well founded . If it were universally true , labor might command for its remuneration more than all it ' produced . We will suppose that ten hours per day will give the greatest product , and that laborers will work through each of the ten hours as efficiently as for a shorter time , and , further , that prices are inversely as the supply . Though neither of these propositions may be strictly true , they will serve the purposes of illustration . // If any one individual proposes to work only half time , he knows at once that he can get only half pay . Neither the supply of labor nor the quantity of product being sensibly affected , prices will remain the same , and in the division between labor and capital he gets the same share of what he actually produces , i. e. one half the quantity for half-time work that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can get no more per hour than all others demand . At any higher price there will be no sale for his labor , because all the customers for it can buy for less . He very naturally seeks to remove this obstacle to his obtaining the same wages per day for half time , by prevailing upon his colaborers to work half time also . Suppose he succeeds to an extent which will sensibly lessen the supply of labor . If the wages per hour are thus raised only in a very small section , the effect will be , either that the laborers from the adjoining sections will come in and do the work at a less rate , or the work will go to other sections to be done . Suppose , however , that this reduction of time is effected upon a larger scale ; for instance , that throughout Section A , embracing one whole country and one quarter of the whole labor of the commercial world , all reduce the time of work from ten to five hours . This would diminish the supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 to 7 ) ; and the price per hour , being equalized by competition , would advance in the ratio of 7 to 8 , or one seventh , say from 10 to 11* cents per hour , and the five-hour laborers will get 57 cents per day in place of the 100 cents they before received for ten hours . But this universal advance of* in the price of wages will advance the price of 7 products * , so that the 57 cents will buy no more of them than 50 cents before did ; that is , for five hours ' work the laborer still gets just half as much product as he did for ten hours ' work . This result , however , is founded upon the presumption that , as between capital and labor , the product will be divided in the same proportion as before its diminution . Labor and product , being both advanced in price as much as they are reduced in quantity , the amount of free or floating capital required to pay labor and exchange its products will remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capital applicable to these pur // poses all competitively seeks use , that prices rise in proportion to the diminution in quantity . The practical operation would be this . Labor and product in Section A being diminished one half , and prices advanced only one seventh , there is a portion of capital thrown out of use which will be sent abroad for employment . And it will there be wanted ; for the quantity of labor and product being the same as before in the rest of the world , and prices advanced one seventh , this addition to capital will be required . To illustrate this , suppose that , before the reduction , the quantity of product , as also of labor , in Section A is represented by the number *T00 , the product and also the labor of the other three fourths of the world will then be represented by 2100 , and these figures will also represent the proportion of capital required in each for paying labor and cxchanging its products . Now when the labor is reduced one half in Section A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being advanced one seventh in price , its value will be 400 , whieW will also represent the amount of capital required for the reduced business , leaving a surplus of 300 , which is just what will be needed by the advance of one seventh in the price of the 2100 labor and product in the rest of the world Hence , as the supply of this portion of capital and the demand and use for it remain the same , its price will not be changed ; and , the same rate of interest being paid , its owners receive the same aggregate amount as before the diminution iii labor and product . But they , too , have to pay the increased cost of products , and hence , with their incomes , can procure only seven eighths the amount of products as before . It appears , then , that while the laborer in Section A can obtain only one half the former amount of product for his labor , the capitalist can obtain seven eighths . Now people do not often lessen their expenditures in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Section A , while the laborers can , at the supposed advance in price , buy only one half the capitalists can buy seven eighths the former amount of pioduct . But the whole product in this Section has been reduced one half ; and hence the capitalist will either trench upon the laborer 's share by overbidding him in price , or a portion of the supply before produced at home must be brought // from abroad at increased cost . By this last process the price of the whole home product will be advanced to the cost of importing articles of the same kind , so that in either of the cases above mentioned prices are increased , and the products which the laborer in Section A can buy with his wages for half time will be reduced to less titan half quantity . The ability of the capitalist in Section A to buy is reduced in the same proportion below seven eighths as that of the laborer is below one half . As the product in the other three fourths of the world remains the same , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced one eighth , there will be a surplus just sufficient to supply the three eighths which the capitalists in Section A are able to buy over their proportion of the home product , but nothing to make up the deficiency of one half to the laborers , even if they had the means of buying . But in this moving of products there is increased labor , adding to cost and diminishing supply . But besides the free capital used to pay labor and exchange products , there is in Section A other capital in the form of iitensils , machinery , forges , mills , railroads , &amp;c. , which , though now used omly half time , will still all be required6 As , by the export of the surplus movable capital , the price of capital remains the same , these fixed investments will command the same rent per annum as before , and the owners of them , receiving the same income , will add to the class who can afford to buy seven eighths the quantity of product . Take , for example , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its machinery . If he could run it only five hours per day instead of ten , and paid the same price per hour for the same quantity of labor per hour , he would lose the use of his capital - his mill - half the time . Under these circumstances , there would be no new mills or machinery built till the profits to the owner from running five hours per day became equal to the profits of running for ten hours abroad , or to that obtained when running ten hours here . To effect this , the labor for five hours must be enough less per hour to make up the interest on the capital for the unemployed time , i. e. the five-hour laborers must work at half the price per day of the ten-hour laborers , with a further deduction from their aggregate wages of one half the interest on the fixed // capital required for the business . By lessening the time of work , the laborers are placed in the position of one who pays full interest for money which he uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose 1,000 laborers , working ten hours in a mill , produce or add to the value of the mate rial used per day . . . . . . $1,200 Which , being divided , the laborers get . $ 1,000 The capitalist . . . . . . 200 $1,200 This gives to each laborer 100 cents per day , or 10 cents per hour . Then , if the laborers reduce the time and product one half by working only five hours , the added value will be only $ 600 per day , of which the capital will still take $ 200 , leaving only $ 400 for the laborers , which will give to each of them only 40 cents per day , or 8 cents per hour for the five hours , in place of 10 cents per hour for ten hours ; or if prices are affected by the diminution of labor , the laborer will still get only four tenths the quantity of product for half-time work , and this again reduced by the competition for those products with a portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same ratio . In the case of the free capital , the community in Section A , after the reduction of one half in labor and product , pay the same rate per cent on four sevenths the amount , while they continue to pay an undiminished rate on the whole amount of fixed capital . It appears , then , that the laborers in Section A not only can not get more products per hour for their diminished time of work , but that , inasmuch as they have to contribute more in proportion to the capital employed , they can actualiy get less per hour , or less than half wages for half time . It may still be surmised that , if Section A embraced an area to which no products of foreign competing labor could come , and from which the capital released by diminishing labor and product could not be removed , the laborers might then reduce their time of work without lessening their material comforts . The collective commercial world is such an area . Let us then suppose that the hours of labor are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , the whole product being reduced one half , some or all must consume less , and it becomes important // to ascertain how this privation will be divided . In this case the capital applicable to the payment of labor remaining the same , and all competitively seeking use , the aggregate amount paid for labor would be the same , and laborers would get the same price per day for the half time . worked , or double the price per hour . This so far confirms the popular belief to which we have alluded , that diminished time will command the same amount of wages ; but then the same reason that we have just given for the rise of wages applies to products ; and with this universal double price of labor , double cost and double prices of all articles will be a necessary concomitant , so that the same amount of wages will buy only half the quantity of products , and the laborer still really gets only half pay for halftime work . The amount of capital required for these changed conditions will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand being unchanged , the capitalist will receive the same amount for its use ; but with the same money income he also can buy only one half the quantity of products . In the transition state there may be some irregularity in rates and prices of capital , labor , and prnducts , and especially if the change is sudden ; but the results must finally be as above stated . So far , then , the laborer seems to have gained by this extension of short time to the whole instead of a portion of the world , inasmuch as he has not now to compete in buying with a portion of the community whose means are reduced in a less proportion than his own . Labor , however , still gets , at best , only one half for halftime work , and the effect of the universal diminution of supply may for a long time operate quite as much against him as when that diminution was only local . Those having the means will not at once conform their consumption to the new conditions of supply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ g upon their accumulation of money for the purpose of raising prices , so that the laborer has to take less than one half of his previous quantity . It may be said that this rise in the prices of products will cause wages to advance in the same proportion . Such would perhaps be its tendency ; but then , as at least partially counteracting this tendency , // we must observe that the money capital is used both to pay labor and to exchange its products , and that with this rise in prices more is required for the latter object , leaving a less fund applicable to the former . There seems to be no reason to suppose that the effect upon the laborers ' share which would arise from diminishing the products one half by withdrawing half the labor , would be different from what it is when this diminution is caused by drought or other natural cause ; and it is by the laborer , and not by the capitalist , that such calamity is most severely felt . Thus we see how important it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich should be frugal in consuming , and not use their wealth as a power to appropriate to their own self . ish purposes more than their share of labor and its products . Another effect of this change would be , that many who before lived upon the income from capital , receiving now only half the product , would have to increase their means of support by labor , thus adding to the quantity of products , and so far counteracting the effect of diminished time of work generally . This would distribute labor more equally , and in this respect be just and beneficial . It is the laborers , then , and not the capitalists , who are mainly interested in keeping the hours of labor at the point of greatest production , because it is they who suffer most from the diminished supply of the comforts of life which arises from diminished labor . We have purposely considered the subject only in its economic aspect , and left out of view the influence of increased or diminished time of labor upon the happiness of a people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great increase of labor-saving appliances , less time might not now suffice for the supply of our bodily wants , leaving more to be devoted to other objects . Thus far the effect of the introduction of machines seems to have been to task the physical powers of man more severely than before their invention , or at least to have kept him more unremittingly employed in providing material subsistence and enjoyments than formerly . By their aid , a man can produce , and therefore obtain , so many more comforts in return for his labor , that the inducement overcomes the desire // of ease , and leads him to work steadily for the greater remuneration which rewards his toil . Within a very few years machinery has been very extensively applied to agriculture ; and with such success that , in many of the most important processes , one man will now perform the work which formerly required twenty , and with less muscular effort than each had formerly to exert . There is much encouragement in this direct and successful application of machinery to the production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it seems quite time that the aid which , in various ways , we are deriving from it , should abridge the hours of labor , and leave to all classes more time for intellectual pursuits ; and whenever the laborers , with full knowledge of the alternative involved , are ready to forego a portion of the former , that they may devote more time to the latter , it will be an event at which every right-minded and , true-1*earted philanthropist will rejoice . Nor would it be less cause of congratulation if the rich should voluntarily , not only abstain from a prodigal use of the products of labor , but should forego a portion of their accustomed comforts ; that , less work being needed for the support of the world , wore leisure might be allowed to the laborer . That , as we have already shown , the sacrifice which would be involved in flxing* the hours of labor below the point of greatest production would fall mainly on the laborers , should give at least additional influence to any well-considered conclusion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in a country in which the national expenses are small , the laborers might reduce the hours of labor much below what the same state of living would require from those whose productive industry is heavily taxed to support extravagant civil and ecclesiastical establishments , to prosecute expensive wars , or maintain standing armies . While this shows the importance of economy in our public expenditures , it also suggests that now , when we have our large national debt to provide for , it would be particularly unfortunate to reduce our productive ability too rapidly . We may regret this obstacle to the allotment of the maximum time for intellectual culture ; but must bear in mind that nothing is more important to the national prosperity of a people , or to // their progress in all that gives superiority to civilization , than good and stable government ; and that , to insure this , nothing is more essential than national credit , without which any government in this age is liable to be subverted . Withdraw the protection which organized society gives to the possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund from which to pay labor or to build labor-saving machinery . Without such security , no one would erect a furnace or forge , and the pointed stick would take the place of the plough . One step farther , and no one would plant what he would have no assurance he might not be permitted to harvest . The savage state , in which men live by hunting and gathering wild berries and roots , would then be reached . The subversion of governments is not always effected by the conquering armies of rival powers , or by civil commotion . To this end corruption is in itself more potent than either , and often prepares the way for them . There is more danger from fraud than from violence , though from their tendency mutually to produce each other they are generally combined in the work of destruction . It is said that , in some of our States , the bribery which commenced in the buying of votes has gone on to its legitimate consequences in our judicial tribunals ; and as it is through these that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be , guarded , the very foundation of government is here directly threatened . Its power for beneficial action is here most insidiously and effectually undermined . The extension of the suffrage , intended to protect and to elevate the poor , or , rather , to enable them to protect and elevate themselves , has been made the instrument for plundering and debasing them . The increase of purchasable votes has , in such cases , given the whole political power into the hands of the rich , and of the most unscrupulous portion of the rich . For a paltry sum the laborer gives to such men the power to rob him of an indefinite portion of his earnings . This is most frequently effected by peculating upon the public revenues ; but when this corruption reaches the courts , . it can be more directly accomplished by the judicial transfer of the property of those who will not furnish money to elect or sustain the judges to those who will and do . Those who pay this money will not be likely to make the mistake // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show their influential supporters no favor in their decisions . It is evident that , wherever this condition of things exists , there is little hope that laborers can benefit their pecuniary condition , even by successful efforts to procure larger compensation for their services . Where bribery prevails , they have no more security against judicial robbery for their earnings , than the serfs formerly had against the rapacious violence of their steelclad masters . Security for the product of their labor should be their first object ; and to elevate themselves above the point at which they can be made the tools for their own destruction by those who have more money than principle , they may properly use all the power of combination and all the incentives of individual interest which they can make conducive to that end . Elevate the national morality so as to insure at all times an honest administration of the legislative , executive , and judicial functions in all our governments , and , instead of being oppressed by the burden of our accumulated debt , we shall press forward on the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here we have yet had no example . In the item of the cpst of government we have heretofore had an advantage over the English ; but with them production and accumulation have been greatly encouraged by the perfect protection which their government gives to property , and by the prevailing feeling of security which an implicit confidence in the integrity of their judiciary inspires . In the complete destruction of the security of property , and the consequent absence of inducement to permanent investment , or even to accumulate the means for such investment , we see how direct and short is the process by which judicial corruption may reduce a civilized community to the savage state . In connection with the quantity , the division , and the security of the products of labor , the provident or wasteful use of it deserves consideration . There is a prevailing belief that the prodigality of the rich helps the poor . In this prodigality , however , the rich man only uses the power which the possession of wealth gives him to appropriate more than his share of the labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said that , in doing this , he employs and pays laborers . Suppose // it suited his fancy to employ and pay them for raising corn , and then to burn all the corn . It is evident that , in such case , the gratification of his caprice might cause some peopie to suffer from hunger . But the effect is obviously the same , if he employs and pays the laborers to minister to his own exclusive personal gratification in any other way . Any man who consumes more than he produces converts to his own use what the labor of others has provided , and thus inflicts an injury , while those who produce more than they consume confer a benefit , by contributing to the supply of the wants of others . In the immediate application of products to use , there is great room for improvement . In the preparation of food , we are in this country thought to be far behind most European nations . In the manufacture of cloth , some of the processes attended with considerable labor lessen its durability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or by improper processes* its beneficial properties are much diminished . It may be said that a portion of labor may properly be expended to minister to taste , refinement , and the sentiment of beauty ; but this can not be urged in favor of the waste in the application of products last mentioned , nor to a large class of articles wl*ich , in commdn phrase , are said to be " not honestly made . " As the results of our inquiries , we find , then , - 1st . That the laborer can at best get only a certain proportion of what he produces ; and that , with any considerable reduction of production , this proportion is more likely to be diminished than increased . 2d . That any one laborer reducing his time of work will obtain more actual remuneration if all others continue full work , than if a large body of them unite in short time ; and that , even if the combination extended to the whole world , the result would still be unfavorable to him ; and hence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not expedient for him to persuade others to do less work ; while any attempt by violence , intimidation , or social coercion to interfere with the liberty of others to work as they please , is such an outrage upon their rights , such a flagrant wrong , that only evil consequences can be ex* pected from it . 3d . That accumulation or increase of capital is beneficial to // the laborer , making a larger fund for the payment of wages and for providing labor-saving machinery . From this larger fund larger wages will be paid , but this will be neutralized by the prices of products being increased in the same ratio . With the increase of capital , it will generally happen that more people will be able to live without work . This will lessen the supply of labor , and thus tend to enhance wages ; but this again will be neutralized by the higher price of the diminished products , so that the great benefit derived from increase of capital is the ability to provide aids to labor by which products are increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large amount of machinery now used has not yet given more leisure , is because people have striven to raise the standard of living rather than to diminish their toil ; but it is from a change in this respect that we mainly look for the accomplishment of the latter object . In what we have said of accumulation , we do not intend to imply that it should be concentrated in the hands of large capitalists , but , on the contrary , we believe it better that it should be much diffused . 4th . That a prodigal use of labor and its products , though paid for , at full prices , is injurious to the whole community , while a universal economy would lessen the toil of providing for the general support , and thus facilitate a diminution in hours of labor . 5th . That to encourage accumulation , but more especially to get the benefits of its various applications in aid of labor , security in possession is essential ; and hence , in , view of this , as also of the benefits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the laborer of preserving the integrity and purity of our governments , State and National , and especially of the judiciary , in which the protecting power chiefl.y resides . 6th . That an improved , that is , a more intelligent , economy in the application of the products of industry to the immediate uses of life , and an honest purpose on the part of artisans and manufacturers to work up materials in a manner most beneficial to the world , would also tend to relieve the laborers of a portion of the toil now required to support the world , and leave them more time for self-culture.
