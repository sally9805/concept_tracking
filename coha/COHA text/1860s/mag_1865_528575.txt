GRIT . THERE is an influential form of practical force , compounded of strong will , strong sense , and strong egotism , which long waited for a strong monosyllable to announce its nature . Facts of character , indeed , are never at rest until they have become terms of language ; and that peculiar thing which is not exactly courage or heroism , but which unmistakably is " Grit , " has coined its own word to blurt out its own quality . If the word has not yet pushed its way into classic usage , or effected a lodbement in the dictionaries , the force it names is no less a reality of the popular consciousness , and the word itself no less a part of popular speech . Men who possessed the thing were just the men to snub elegance and stun propriety by giving it an inelegant , though vitally appropriate name . There is defiance in its very sound . The word is used by vast numbers of people to express their highest ideal of manliness , which is " real grit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation it confers by the most dexterous mimicry of its outside expressions ; for a swift analysis , which drives directly to the heart of the man , instantly detects the impostor behind the braggart , and curtly declares him to lack " the true grit . " The word is so close to the thing it names , has so much pith and point , is so tart on the tongue , and so stings the ear with its meaning , that foreigners ignorant of the language might at once feel its significance by its griding utterance as it is shot impatiently through the resisting teeth . Grit is in the grain of character . It may generally be described as heroism materialized , - spirit and will thrust into heart , brain , and backbone , so as to form part of the physical substance of the man . The feeling with which it rushes into consciousness is akin to physical sensation ; and the whole body - every nerve , muscle , and drop of blood - is thrilled with purpose and passion . " Spunk " does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petite in itself , is courage in effervescence rather than courage in essence . A person usually cowardly may be kicked or bullied into the exhibition of spunk ; but the man of grit carries in his presence a power which spares him the necessity of resenting insult ; for insult sneaks away from his look . It is not mere " pluck " ; for pluck also comes by fits and starts , and can be disconnected from the other elements of character . A tradesman once had the pluck to demand of Talleyrand , at the time that trickster-statesman was at the height of his power , when be intended to pay his bill ; but he was instantly extinguished by the impassive insolence of Talleyrand 's answer , - " My faith , how curiojis you are ! " Considered as an efficient force , it is sometimes below herdism , sometimes above it : below heroism , when heroism is the permanent condition of the soul ; above heroism , when heroism is simply the soul 's transient mood . Thus , Demosthenes had flashes of splendid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindled , - his brave actions flaming out from mental ecstasy rather than intrepid character . The moment his will dropped from its eminence of impassioned thought , he was scared by dangers which common soldiers faced with gay indifference . Erskine , the great advocate , was a hero at the bar ; but when he entered the House of Commons , there was something in the fixed imperiousness and scorn of Pitt which made him feel inwardly weak and fluttered . Erskine had flashes of heroism ; Pitt had consistent and persistent grit . If we may take the judgment of Sir Sidney Smith , Wellington had more grit than Napoleon had heroism . Just before the Battle of Waterloo , Sir Sidney , at Paris , was told that the Duke had decided to keep his // position at all events . " Oh ! " he exclaimed , " if the Duke has said that , of course t ' other fellow must give way . " And this is essentially the sign of grit , that , when it appears , t ' other fellow or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from its tough hold on the real , and the surly boldness with which it utters and acts it out . Thus , in social *ife , it puts itself in rude opposition to all those substitutes for reality which the weakness and hypocrisy and courtesy of men find necessary for their mutual defence . It denies that it has ever surrendered its original rights and aboriginal force , or that it has assented to the social compact . When it goes into any company of civilized persons , its pugnacity is roused by seeing that social life does not rest on the vigor of the persons who compose it , but on the authority of certain rules and manners to which all are required to conform . These appear to grit as external defences , thrown up to protect elegant feebleness against any direct collision with positive character , and to keep men and women at a respectful distance from ladies and gentlemen . Life is carried on there at one or more removes from the realities of life , on this princiciple , that , " I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't speak the truth of me " ; and the name of this principle is politeness . It is impolite to tell foolish men that they are foolish , mean men that they are mean , wicked men that they are wicked , traitorous men that they are traitors ; for smooth lies cement what impolite veracities would shatter . The system , it is contended , on the whole , civilizes the individuals whose natures it may repress , and is better than a sincerity which would set them by the ears , . and put a veto on all social intercourse whatever . But strong as may be the argument in favor of the system , it is certainly as important that it should be assailed as that it should exist , and that it should be assailed from within ; for , carried out unchecked to its last consequences , it results in sinking its victims into the realm of vapors and vacuity , its representative being the allaccomplished London man of fashion who committed suicide to save himself from the bore of dressing and undressing . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best sentiments and ideas can sometimes get expression only through the form of bad manners . It is charming to be in a circle where human nature is pranked out in purple and fine linen , and where you sometimes see manners as beautiful as the masterpieces of the arts ; yet some people can not get rid of the uneasy consciousness that a subtle tyranny pervades the room and tiesthe tongue , - that philanthropy is impolite , that heroism is ungenteel , that truth , honor , freedom , humanity , strongly asserted , are marks of a vulgar mind ; and many a person , daring enough to defend his opinions anywhere else , by speech or by the sword , quails in the parlor before some supercilious coxcomb , " Weak in his watery smile And educated whisker , " who can still tattle to the girls that the reformer is " no gentleman . " Now how different all this is , when a man of social grit thrusts himself into a drawing-room , and with an easy at*dacity tosses out disagreeable facts and unfashionable truths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying everything that no gentleman ought to say , indifferent to the titter or terror of the women and the offended looks and frightened stare of the men . How the gilded lies vanish in his presence ! How he states , contradicts , confutes ! how he smashes through proprieties to realities , flooding the room with his aggressive vitality , mastering by main force a position in the most exclusive set , and , by being perfectly indifferent to their opinion , making it impossible for them to put him down ! He thus becomes a social power by becoming a social rebel , - persecutes conventional politeness into submission to rude veracity ,  --  establishes an autocracy of man over th' gentleman ,  - -  and practises a kind of " ComeOuterism , " while insisting on enjoying all the advantages of Go-Interism . Ben Jonson in the age of Elizabeth , Samuel // Johnson in the last century , Carlyle and Brougham in the present , are prominent examples of this somewhat insolent manhood in the presence of social forms . It is , however , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human strength ; it requires , perhaps , in its combination , full as many defects as merits ; and how difficult is its justifiable exercise we see in the career of so illustrious a philanthropist as Wilberforce , - a man whose speech in Parliament showed no lack of vivid conceptions and smiting wo*ds , a man whom no threats of personal violence could intimidate , and who would cheerfully have risked his life for his cause , yet still a man who could never forget that he was a Tory and a : gentleman , who had no grit before lords and ladies , whose Abolitionism was not sufficiently blunt and downright in the good company of cabinet ministers , whose sensitive nature flinched at the thought of being conscientiously impolite and heroically ill- natured , and whose manners were thus frequently in the way of the full efficiency of his morals . In many respects a hero , in all respects benevolent , he still was not like Romilly , a man of grit . Politeness has been defined as benevolence in small things . To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty ; and Draco , though in the king 's drawing-room , and loyally supporting in Parliament the measures of the ministry , is still Draco , though cruelty in him has learned the dialect of fashion and clothed itself in the privileges of the genteel . Proceeding from social life to business life , we shall find that it is this unamiable , but indomitable , quality of grit which not only acquires fortunes , but preserves them after they have been acquired . The ruin which overtakes so many merchants is due not so much to their lack of business talent as to their lack of business nerve . How many lovable persons we see in trade , endowed with brilliant capacities , but cursed with yielding dispositions ,  --  who are resolute in no business habits and fixed in no business principles , - who are prone to follow the instincts of a weak good-nature against the ominous hints of a clear intelligence , now obliging this friend by indorsing an unsafe note , and then pleasing that neighbor by sharing his risk in a hopeless speculation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned by their industry and sagacity has been sunk in benevolent attempts to assist blundering or plundering incapacity , are doomed , in their bankruptcy , to be the mark of bitter taunts from growling creditors and insolent pity from a gossiping public . Much has been said about the pleasures of a good conscience ; and among these I reckon the act of that man who , having wickedly lent certain moneys to a casual acquaintance , was in the end called upon to advance a sum which transcended his honest means , with a dark hint , that , if the money was refused , there was but one thing for the casual acquaintance to do , - that is , to commit suicide . The person thus solicited , in a transient fit of moral enthusiasm , caught at the hint , and with great earnestness advised the casual acquaintance to do it , on the ground that it was the only reparation he could make to the numerous persons he had swindled . And this advice was given with no fear that the guilt of that gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission of that gentleman was to continue his existence by sucking out the life of others , and his last thought was to destroy his own ; and it is hardly necessary to announce that he is still alive and sponging . Indeed , a courageous merchant must ever be ready to face the fact that he will be called a curmudgeon , if he will not ruin himself to please others , and a weak fool , if he does . Many a fortune has melted away in the hesitating utterance of the placable " Yes , " which might have been saved by the unhesitating utterance of the implacable " No ! " Indeed , in business , the perfection of grit is this power of saying " No , " and saying it with such wrathful emphasis that the whole race of vampires and harpies are scared from your counting-room , and your reputation as unenterprising , unbearable niggard is // fully established among all borrowers of money never meant to be repaid , and all projectors of schemes intended for the benefit of the projectors alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man can thus conquer the right to mind his own business ; . and having done this , he has shown his possession of that nerve which , in his business , puts inexorable purpose ' into clear conceptions , follows out a plan of operations with sturdy intelligence , and conducts to fortune by the road of real enterprise . Many others may evince equal shrewdness in framing a project , but they hesitate , become timid , become confused , at some step . in its development . Their character is not strong enough to back up their intellect . But the iron-like tenacity of the merchant of grit holds on to the successful end . You can watch the operation of this quality in every-day business transacfions . Your man of grit seems never deficient in news of the markets , though he may employ no telegraph-operator . Thus , about two years ago , a great Boston holder of flour went to considerable expense in obtaining special intelligence , which would , when generally known , carry flour up to ten dollars and a half a barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " What do you say flour s worth to-day ? " - " Oh , " was the careless answer , " I suppose it might bring ten dollars . " - " Well , " retorted the querist , gruffly , " I ye got five thousand barrels on hand , and I should like to see the man who would give me ten dollars a barrel for it ! - " I will , " said the other , quickly , disclosing his secret by the eagerness of his manner . " Well , " was the reply , " all I can say is , then , that I have seen the man . " The importance of this quality as a business power is most apparent in those frightful panics which periodically occur in our country , and which sometimes tax the people more severely than wars and standing armies . In regard to one of the last of these financial hurricanes , that of 1857 , there can be little doubt , that , if the acknowledged holders of financial power had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there can be as little doubt , that , when it burst , if they had been men of real grit , it might have been made less disastrous . But they kept nearly all their sails set up to the point of danger , and when the tempest was on them ignominiously took to their boats and abandoned the ship . And as for the crew and passengers , it was the old spectacle of a shipwreck , - individuals squabbling to get a plank , instead of combining to construct a raft . Indeed , there was something pitiable in the state of things which that panic revealed in the business centres of the country . Common sense seemed to be disowned by mutual consent ; an infectious fear went shivering from man to man ; and a strange fascination led people to increase by suspicions and reports the peril which threatened their own destruction . Men , being thus thrown back upon the resources of character , were put to terrible tests . As the intellect can not act when the will is paralyzed , many a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , was s*en sitting , like the French prisoner in the iron cage whose sides were hourly contracting , stupidly gazing at the bars which were closing in upon him , and feeling in advance the pang of the iron which was to cut into his flesh and crush his bones . In invigorating contrast to the panicsmitten , we had the privilege to witness many an example of the grit-inspired . Then it was that the grouty , taciturn , obstinate trader , so unpopular in ordinary times , showed the stuff he was made of . Then his bearing was cheer and hope to all who looked upon him . How he girded himself for the fight , resolved , if he died , to die hard ! How he tugged with obstacles as if they were personal affronts , and hurled them to the right and to the left ! How grandly , amid the chatter of the madmen about him , came his few words of sense and sanity ! And then his brain , brightened , not bewildered , by the danger , how clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grit . dients , how firm in principles , with a glance that pierced through the ignorant present to the future , seeing as calmly and judging as accurately in the tempest as it had in the sunshine . Never losing heart and never losing head , with as strong a grip on his honor as on his property , detesting the very thought of failure , knowing that he might be broken to pieces , but determined that he would not weakly " go to pieces , " he performed the greatest service to the community , as well as to himself ; by resolutely , at any sacrifice , paying his debts when they became due . It is a pity that such austere Luthers of commerce , trade-militant instead of churchmilitant , who meet bard times with a harder will , had not a little beauty in their toughness , so that grit , lifted to heroism , would allure affection as well as enforce respect . But their sense is so rigid , their integrity so gruff , and their courage so unjoyous , that all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Ancient Pistol 's motto of " Base is the slave that pays , " will often be more popular , even among the creditor portidn of the public , than these crabbed heroes , and , if need be , surly martyrs , of mercantile honesty and personal honor . In regard to public life , and the influence of this rough manliness in politics , it is a matter of daily observation , that , in the strife of parties and principles , backbone without brain will carry it against brain without backbone . A politician weakly and amiably in the right is no match for a politician tenaciously and pugnaciously in the wrong . You can not , by tying an opinion to a man 's tongue , make him the representative of that opinion ; and at the close of any battle for principles , his name will be found neither among the dead nor among the wounded , but among the missing . The true motto for a party is neither " Measures , not men , " nor " Men , not measures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are in their blood as well as in their brain and on their lips . Wellington said that Napoleon 's presence in the French army was 4 " equivalent to forty thousand additional soldiers ; and in a legislative assembly , Mirabeau and John Adams and John Quincy Adams are not simply persons who hold a single vote , but forces whose power thrills through the whole mass of voters . Mean natures always feel a sort of terror before great natures ; and many a base thought has been unuttered , many a sneaking vote withheld , through the fear inspired by the rebuking presence of one noble man . Opinions embodied in men , and thus made aggressive and militant , are the opinions which mark the union of thought with grit . A politician of this class is not content to comprehend and wield the elements of power already existing in a community , but he aims to make his individual conviction and purpose dominant over the convictions and purposes of the accredited exponents of public opinion . He cares little about his unpopularity at the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem insurmountable . A great , but mischievous , example of this power appeared in our own generation in the person of Mr. Calhoun , a statesman who stamped his individual mind on the policy and thinkinn of the country more definitely , perhaps , than any statesman since Hamilton , though his influence has , on the whole , been . as evil as Hamilton 's was , on the whole , beneficent . Keen-sighted , far-sighted , and inflexible , Mr. Calhoun clearly saw the logical foundations and logical results of the institution of Slavery ; and though at first called an abstractionist and a fanatic by the looser thinkers of his own region , his inexorable argumentation , conquering by degrees politicians who could reason , made itself felt at last among politicians who could not reason ; and the conclusions of his logic were adopted by thousands whose brains would have broken in the attempt to follow its processes . One of those rare deductive reasoners whose audacity marches abreast their genius , he would have been willing to fight to the last gasp for a conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . tion through a score of intermediate steps ; from premises in themselves repugnant to the primal instincts both of reason and humanity . Always ready to meet anybody in argument , he detested all reasoners who attempted to show the f7allacy of his argument by pointifig out the dangerous results to which it led . In this he sometimes brought to mind that inflexible professor of the deductive method who was timidly informed that his priticiples , if carried out , would split the world to pieces . " Let it split , " was his careless answer ; " there are enough more planets . " By pure intellectual grit , he thus effected a revolution in , the ideas and sentiments of the South , and through the South made his mind act on the policy of the nation . The present war has its root in the principles he advocated . Never flinching from any logical consequence of his principles , Mr. Calhoun did not rest until through him religion , morality , statesmanship , the Constitution of the United States , the constitution of man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most nonsensical as well as detestable of oppressions , was , to him , the most beneficent contrivance of human wisdom . He called it an institution : Mr. Emerson has more happily styled it a destitution . At last the chains of his iron logic were heard clanking on the whole Southern intellect . Reasoning the most masterly was employed to annihilate the first principles of reason the understanding of man was insanely placed in direct antagonism to his moral instincts ; and finally the astounding conclusion was reached , that the Creator of mankind has his pet races , - that God himself scouts his colored children , and nicknames them " Niggers . " It is delicious to watch the exulting and somewhat contemptuous audacity with which he hurries to the unforeseen conclusion those who have once been simple enough to admit his premises . Towards men who have some logical capacity his tone is that of respectful impatience ; but as he goads on the reluctant and resentful victims April , of his reasoning , who loiter and limp painfully in the steps of his rapid deductions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A little faster , my poor cripples ! " So confident was Mr. Calhoun in his capacity to demonstrate the validity of his horrible creed , that he was ever eager to measure swords with the most accomplished of his antagonists in the duel of debate . And it must be said that he despised all the subterfuges and evasions by which , in ordinary controversies , the real question is dodged , and went directly to the heart of the matter , - a resolute intellect , burning to grapple with another resolute intellect in a vital encounter . In common legislative debates , on the contrary , there is no vital encounter . The exasperated opponents , personally courageous , but deficient in clear and fixed ideas , mutually contrive to avoid the things essential to he discussed , while wantoning in all the forms of discussion . They assert , brag , browbeat , dogmatize , domineer , pummel each other with the argurnenturn ad korninern , and abundantly prove that they stand for opposite opiiiions ; we watch them as we watch the feints and hits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the sparring is over , we find that neither the Southern champion nor the Northern bruiser has touched the inner reality of the question to decide which they stripped themselves for the fight . In regard to the intellectual issue , they are like two bullies enveloping themselves in an immense concealing dust of arrobant words , and , as they fearfully retreat from personal collision , shouting furiously to each other , " Let me get at him ! " And this is what is commonly called grit in politics , - abundant backbone to face persons , deficient btainbone to encounter principles . Not so was it when two debaters like Mr. Calhoun and Mr. Webster engaged in the contest of argument . Take , for example , as specimens of pure mental manliness , their speeches in the Senate , . in i833 , on the question whether or not the Constitution is a compact between sovereign States . Give Mr. Calhoun // 413 those two words , " compact " and " sovereign , " and he conducts you logically to Nullification and to all the consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , of indomitable ' resolution , intended to arrest the argument at a convenient point by the sword , and thus save himself the bother of going farther in the chain of inferences than he pleased . Mr. Webster grappled with the argument and with the man ; and it is curious to watch that spectacle of a meeting between two such hostile minds . Each is confident of the strength of his own position ; each is eager for a close hug of dialectics . Far from avoiding the point , they drive directly towards it , clearing their essential propositions from mutual misconception by the sharpest analysis and exactest statement . To get their minds near each other , to think close to the subject , to feel the griding contact of pure intellect with pure intellect , and , as spiritual beings , to conduct the war of reason with spiritual weapons , - this is their ambition . Conventionally courteous to each other , they are really in the deadliest antagonism ; for their contest is the tug and strain of soul with soul , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No nervous irritation , no hard words , no passionate recriminations , no flinching from unexpected difficulties , no substitution of declamatory sophisms for rigorous inferences , - but close , calm , ruthless grapple of thought with thought . To each , at the time , life seems to depenct on the issue , - not merely the life which a sword-cut or pistol-bullet can destroy , but immortal life , the life of immaterial minds and personalities , thus brought into spiritual feud . They know very well , that , whatever be the real result , the Webster-men will give the victory of argument to Webster , the Calhounmen the victory of argument to Calhoun ; but that consideration does not enter their thoughts as they prepare to close in that combat which is to determine , not to the world , but to each other , which is the stronger intellect , and which is in the right . Few ever appreciate great men in this hostile attittide , not of their passions , but of their minds ; and those who do it the least are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument that tells , and are apt to be bored with the argument which refutes ; but a true reasoner despises even his success , if he feels that two persons , himself and his opponent , know that he is in the wrong . And the strain on the whole being in this contest of intellect with intellect , and the reluctance with which the most combative enter it unless they are consciously strong , is well illustrated by Dr. Johnson s remark to some friends , when sickness had relaxed the tough fibre of his brain , - " If that fellow Burke were here now , he would kill me . " A peculiar kind of grit , not falling under any of the special expressions I have noted , yet partaking in some degree of all , is illustrated in the character of Lieutenant-General Grant . Without an atom of pretension or rhetoric , with none of the external signs of energy and intrepidity , making no parade of the immovable purpose , iron nerve , and silent , penetrating intelligence God has put into him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigar , as President Lincoln 's is behind a joke . When anybody tries to coax , cajole , overawe , browbeat , or deceive Lincoln , the President nurses his leg , and is reminded of a story ; when anybody tries the same game with Grant , the General listens and - smokes . If you try to wheedle out of him his plans for a campaign , he stolidly smokes ; if you call him an imbecile and a blunderer , he blandly lights another cigar ; if you praise him as the greatest general living , he placidly returns the puff from his regalia ; and if you tell him he should run for the Presidency , it does not disturb the equanimity with which he inhales and exhales the unsubstantial vapor which typifies the politician 's promises . While you are wondering what kind of man this creature without a tongue is , you are suddenly electrified with the news of some splendid victory , proving that be- // 414 hind the cigar , and behind the face dischargud of all tell-tale expression , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the generals of the Republic . It is curious to mark a variation of this intellectual hardihood and personal force when the premises are not in the solidities , but in the oddities of thought and character , and whim stands stiffly up to the remotest inferences which may be deduced from its insanest freaks of individual opinion . Thus it is said that in one of our country towns there is an old gentleman who is an eccentric hater of women ; and this crotchet of his character he carries to its extreme logical consequences . Not content with general declamation against the sex , he turns eagerly , the moment he receives the daily newspaper , to the list of deaths ; and if he sees the death of a woman recorded , he gleefully exclaims , - " Good ! good ! there s another of em gone ! " We have heard of a man who had conceived a violent eccentric prejudice against negroes ; and he was not content with chiming in with the usual cant of the prejudice that they ought not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vociferated , that , if he had his way , they should not he allowed in Africa ! The advantage of grit in this respect is in its annihilating a prejudice by presenting a vivid vision of its theoretical consequences . Carlyle has an eccentric hatred of the eighteenth century , its manners , morals , politics , religion , and men . He has expressed this in various ways for thirty years ; hut in his last work , the " Life of Frederick the Great , " his prejudice reached its logical climax in the assertion , that the only sensible thing the eibhteenth century ever did was blowing out its own brains in the French Revolution . Again , in discussion , some men have felicity in replying to a question , others a felicity in replying to the motive which prompted the question . In one case you get an answer addressed to your understanding ; in the other , an answer which smites like a slap in the face . Thus , when a pert skeptic asked Mar-April , tin Luther where God was before He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - " He was building hell fort such idle , presumptu*ous , fluttering , and inquisitive spirits as you . " And everybody will recollect the story of the self- complacent cardinal who went to confess to a holy monk , and thought by self-accusation *o get the reputation of a saint . " I have been guilty of every kind of sin , " snivelled the cardinal . " It is a solemn fact , " replied the impassive monk . " I have indulged in pride , ambition , malice , and revenge , " groaned the car-dinaL " It is too . true , " answered the monk . " Why , you fool , " exclaimed the enraged dignitary , " you do n't imagine that I mean all this to the letter ! " Ho ! ho ! " said the monk , " so you have been a liar , too , have you ? " This relentless rebuker of shams furnishes us with a good transition to another department of the subject , namely , moral hardihood , or grit organized in conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practical affairs of life . Now there is a wide difference between moral men , so called , and men moralized , - between men who lazily adopt and lazily practise the conventional moral proprieties of the time , and men transformed into the image of inexorable , unmerciful moral ideas , men in whom moral maxims appear organized as moral might . There are thousands who are prodigal of moral and benevolent opinions , and honestly eloquent in loud professions of what they would do in case circumstances called upon them to act ; but when the occasion is suddenly thrust upon them , when temptation , leering into every corner and crevice of their weak and selfish natures , connects the notion of virtue with the reality of sacrifice , then , in that sharp pinch , they become suddenly apprised of the difference between rhetoric and rectitude , and find that their speeches have been far ahead of their powers of performance . Thus , in one of Gerald Griffin 's novels , there is a // scene in which a young Irish student , fresh from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's table , who are all devout believers in the virtues of the hair-trigger , by an eloquent declamation against the folly and the sin of duelling . At last one of the set gets sufficient breath to call him a coward . The hot Irish blood is up in an instant , a tumbler is thrown at the head of the doubter of his courage , and in ten seconds the young moralist is crossing swords with his antagonist in a duel . But the characteristic of moral grit is equality with the occasions which exact its exercise . It is morality with thews and sinews and blood and passions , - morality made man , and eager to put its phrases to the test of action . It gives and takes hard blows , - aims not only to be upright in deed , but downright in word , - silences with a " Thus saith the Lord ' * all palliations of convenient sins , - scowls ominously at every attempt to reconcile the old feud between the right and the expedient and make them socially shake hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with good wholesome rage and execration . On the virtues of this stubborn conscientiousness it is needless to dilate ; its limitations spring from its tendency to disconnect morality from mercy , and law from love , - its too frequent substitution of moral antipathies for moral insight , - and its habit of describing individual men , not as they are in themselves , but as they appear to its offended conscience . Understanding sin better than it understands sinners , it sometimes sketches phantoms rather than paints portraits , - identifies the weakly wicked with the extreme of Satanic wickedness ,  --  and in its assaults , pitches at its adversaries rather than really pitches into them . But , in a large moral view , the light of intellectual perception should shine far in advance of the heat of ethical invective , and an ounce of characterization is worth a ton of imprecations . Indeed , moral grit , relatively admirable as it is , partakes of the inherent defect of other and lower kinds of grit , inasmuch as its force is apt to be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is invincible . It drives rather than draws , cuffs rather than coaxes . Intolerant of human infirmity , it is likewise often intolerant of all forms of human excellence which do not square with its own conceptions of right ; and its philanthropy in the abstract is apt to secrete a subtile misanthropy in the concrete . Brave , unselfish , self-sacrificing , and flinching from no consequences which its principles may bring upon itself , it flinches from no consequences which they may bring upon others ; and its attitude towards the laws and customs of instituted imperfection is almost as sourly belligerent as towards those of instituted iniquity . Men of this austere and somewhat crabbed rectitude may be found in every department of life , but they are most prominent and most efficient when they engage in the reform of abuses , whether those abuses be in manners , institutions , or religion ; and here they never shrink from the rough , rude work of the cause they espouse . They are commonly adored by their followers , commonly execrated by their opponents ; but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have performed their duties , as the shrieks of the wounded testify to the certainty of the shots . Indeed , they take a kind of grim delight in so pointing their invective that the adversaries of their principles are turned into enemies of their persons , and scout at all fame which does not spring from obloquy . As they thus exist in a state of war , the gentler elements of their being fall into the background ; the bitterness of the strife works into their souls , and gives to their conscientious wrath a certain Puritan pitilessness of temper and tone . In the thick of the fight , their battle-cry is , " No quarter to the enemies of God and man " - and as , unfortunately , there are few men who , tried by their standards , are friends of man , population very palpably thins as the lava-tide of their invective sweeps over it , and to the mental eye men . disappear as man emerges . // The gulf which yawns between uncompromising moral obligation and compromising human conduct is so immense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and visionaries . But history demonstrates that they are among the most practical of all the forces which work in human affairs ; for , without taking into account the response which their inflexible morality finds in the breasts of inflexibly moral men , their morality , in its application to common life , often becomes materialized , and shows an intimate connection with the most ordinary human appetites and passions . They commune with the mass of men through the subtile freemasonry of discontent . Compelled to hurl the thunderbolts of the moral law against injustice in possession , they unwittingly set fire to injustice smouldering in unrealized passions ; and their speech is translated and transformed , in its passage into the public mind , into some such shape as this - " These few persons who are dominant in Church and State , and who , while you physically and spiritually starve , are fed fat by the products of your labor and the illusions of your superstition , are powerfi*l and prosperous , not from any virtue in themselves , but from the violation of those laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe . Their property and their power are the signs , not of their merits , but of their sins . " The instinctive love of property and power are thus addressed to overturn the present possessors of property and power ; and the vices of men are unconsciously enlisted in the service of the regeneration of man . The motives which impel whole masses of the community are commonly different from the motives of those reformers who urgethe community to revolt ; and their fervent denunciations of injustice bring ito their side thousands of men who , perhaps unconsciously to themselves , oi*i1ydesire a chance to be unjust . The a*nalsof all emancipations , revolutions , ; and reformations are disfigured by this *fa*t. iBet*r Ahan what they supplant , their good is still relative , not absolute . In the history of religious reforms , few men better illustrate this hard moral manliness , as distinguished from the highest moral heroism , than the sturdy Scotch reformer , John Knox . Tenacious , pugnacious , thoroughly honest and thoroughly earnest , superior to all physical and moral fear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out unwelcome opinions to queens as readily as to peasants , and in wOrds which hit and hurt like knocks with the fist , he is one of those large , but somewhat coarse-grained natures , that influence rude populations by having so much in common with them , and in which the piety of the Christian , the thought of the Protestant , and the zeal of the martyr are curiously blended with the ferocity of the demagogue . Jenny Geddes , at the time when Archbishop Laud attempted to force Episcopacy upon Scotland , is a fair specimen of the kind of character which the teachings and the practice of such a man would tend to produce in a nation . This rustic heroime was present when the new bishop , hateful to Presbyterian eyes , began the service , with the smooth saying , " Let us read the Collect of the Day . " Jenny rose in wrath , and cried out to the surpliced official of the Lord , - " Thou foul thieg wilt thou say mass at my lug ? " and hurled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Pope ! a Pope ! Stone him ! " And " the worship *of the Lord in Episcopal decency and order " was ignominiously stopped . And in the next reign , when the same thing was attempted , the Covenanters , the true spiritual descendants of Knox , opposed to the most brutal persecution a fierce , morose heroism , strangely compounded of barbaric passion and Christiaq fortitude . They were the most perfect specimens of pure moral grit the world has ever seen . In the great theological humorist of the nineteenth century , the Reverend Sydney Smith , the legitimate intellectual successor of the Reverend Rabelais and the Reverend Swift and the Reverend Sterne , their sul // len intrepidity excites a mingled feeling , in which fun strives with admiration . In arguing against all intolerance , the intolerance of the church to which he belonged as well as the intolerance of the churches to which he was opposed , he said that persecution and bloodshed had no effect in preventing the Scotch , " that metaphysical people , from going to heaven in their true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes the humorous sally , - " With a little oatmeal for food and a little sulphur for friction , allaying cutaneous irritation with one hand and grasping his Calvinistical creed with the other , Sawney ran away to the flinty hills , sung his psalm out of tune his own way , and listened to his sermon of two hours long , amid the rough and imposing melancholy of the tallest thistles . " But from the graver historian , developing the historic significance of their determined resistance to the insolent claims of ecclesiastical authority , their desperate hardihood elicits a more fitting tribute . " Hunted down , " he says , " like wild beasts , tortured till their bones were beaten flat , imprisoned by hundreds , hanged by scores , , exposed at one time to the license of soldiers from England , abandoned at another time to the mercy of bands of marauders from the Highlands , they still stood at bay in a mood so savage that the boldest and mightiest oppressor could not but dread the audacity of their despair . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most prominently as the representative of this tough physical and moral fibre is Oliver Cromwell , the greatest of that class of Puritans who combined the intensest religious passions with the powers of the soldier and the statesman , and who , in some wild way , reconciled their austere piety with remorseless efficiency in the world of facts . After all the materials for an accurate judgment of Cromwell which have been collected by the malice of his libellers and the veneration of his partisans , he is still a puzzle to psychologists ; for no one , so far , has bridged the space which separates the voi*. xv . - NO. 90. 27 417 seeming anarchy of his mind from the executive decision of his conduct . A coarse , strong , massive English nature , thoroughly impregnated with Hebrew thought and Hebrew passion , - democratic in his sympathy with the rudest political and religious feelings of his party , autocratic in the consciousness of superior abilities and tyrannic will , - emancipated from the illusions of vanity , but not from those of ambition and pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear of obloquy or the fear of death , - a fanatic and * politician ,  - -  a demagogue Qnd a dictator ,  - -  seeking the kingdom of heaven , but determined to take the kingdom of England by the way ,  --  believing in God , believing in himself , and believing in his Ironsides , - clothing spiritual faith in physical force , and backing . dogmas and prayers with pikes and cannon , - anxious at once that his troops should trust in God and keep their powder dry , - with a mind deep indeed , but distracted by internal conflicts , and prolific only in enormous , half-shaped ideas , which stammer into expression at once obscure and ominous , the language a strange compound of the slang of the camp and the mystic phrases of inspired prophets and apostles , - we still feel throughout , that , whatever may be the contradictions of his character , they are not such as to impair the ruthless energy of his will .

He overrode the moral judgments of ordinary men as fiercely as he overrode their physical resistance , crushing prejudices as well as Parliaments , ideas as well as armies ; and whether his task was to cut off the head of an unmanageable king , or disperse an unmanageable legislative assembly , or massacre an unmanageable Irish garrison , or boldly establish himself as the uncontrolled supreme authority of the land , he ever did it thoroughly and unrelentingly , and could always throw the responsibility // of the deed on the God of battles and the God of Cromwell . In all this we observe th' operation of a colossal practical force rather than an ideal power , of grit*rather than heroism . However much he may command that portion of our sympathies which thrill at the touch of vigorous action , there are other sentiments of our being which detect something partial , vulgar , and repulsive even in his undisputed greatness . In truth , grit , in its highest forms , is not a form of courage deserving of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public and private life , conceding its value in the rough , direct struggle of person with person and opinions with institutions , it is still by no means the top and crown of heroic character ; for it lacks the element of beauty and the element of sympathy ; it is individual , unsocial , bigoted , relatively to occasions ; and its force has no necessary connection with grandeur , generosity , and enlargement of soul . Even in great men , like Cromwell , there is something in its aspect which is harsh , ugly , haggard , and ungenial ; even in them it is strong by the stifling of many a generous thought and tolerant feeling ; and when it descends to animate sterile and stunted natures , endowed with sufficient will to make their meanness or malignity efficient , its unfruitful force is absolutely hateful . It has done good work for the cause of truth and right ; but it has also done bad work for the cause of falsehood and wrong : for evil has its grit as well as virtue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is shorn of an important portion of a complete manhood ; for it not only loses the perception of beauty , but the power of passing into other minds . It never takes the point of view of the persons it opposes ; its object is victory , not insight ; and it thus fails in that modified mercy to men which springs from an interior knowledge of their characters . Even when it is the undaunted force through which moral wrath expresses its hatred of injustice and wrong , its want of imaginative perception makes it somewhat caricature the sinners it inveighs against . It converts imperfect or immoral men into perfect demons , which humanity as well as reason refuses to accept ; and it is therefore not surprising that the prayer of its indignant morality sometimes is , " Almighty God , condemn them , for they know what they do ! " But we can not forget that there sounds down the ages , from the saddest and most triumphant of all martyrdoms , a different and a diviner prayer , - " Father , forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Indeed , however much we may be struck with the startling immediateness of effect which follows the exercise of practical force , we must not forget the immense agency in human affairs of the ideal powers of the soul . These work creatively from within to mould character , not only inflaming great passions , but touching the springs of pity , tenderness , gentleness , and love , - above . all , infusing that wide-reaching sympathy which sends the individual out of the grit-guarded fortress of his personality into the wide plain of the race . The culmination of these ideal powers is in genius and heroism , which draw their inspiration from ideal and spiritual sources , and radiate it in thoughts beautifully large and deeds beautifully brave . They do not merely exert power , they communicate it . If you are overcome by a man of grit , he insolently makes you conscious of your own weakness . If you are overcome by genius and heroism , you are made participants in their strength ; for they overcome only to invigorate and uplift . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in view , by making it an object of affection as well as duty . Their power to allure and to attract is not lost even when their goal is the stake or the cross . They never , in transient ignominy and pain , los* sight and feeling of the beauty and bliss inseparably associated with goodness and virtue ; and the happiest death-beds have often been on the rack or in the flame of the hero-martyr . And // they are also , in their results , great practical influences ; for they break down the walls which separate man from man , - by magnanimous *thought or magnanimous act shame us out of our bitter personal contentions , and flash the sentiment of a common nature into our individual hatreds and oppositions . As grit decomposes society into an aggregate of strong and weak persons , genius and heroism unite them in one humanity . Thus , not many years ago , we were all battling about the higher law and the law to return fugitive slaves . It was argument against argument , passion against passion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced regarding virtue and vice , justice and injustice , humanity and inhumanity , were as different 419 as if the controversy had not been between men and men , but between men and cattle . There were no signs among the combatants that they had the common reason and the common instincts of a common nature . Then came a woman of genius , who refused to credit the horrible conceit that the diversity was essential , who resolutely believed that the human heart was a unit , and whose glance , piercing the mist of opinions and interests , saw in the deep and universal sources of humane and human action the exact point where her blow woild tell. ; and in a novel unexampled in the annals of literature for popular effect , shook the whole public reason and public conscience of the country , by the most searching of all appeals to its heart and imagination .
