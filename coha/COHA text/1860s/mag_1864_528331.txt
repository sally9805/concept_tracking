txt LIFE ON THE SEA ISLANDS . PART II . A FEW days before Christmas , we were delighted at receiving a beautiful Christmas Hymn from XVhittier , written by request , especially for our children . They learned it very easily , and enjoyed singing it . We showed them the writer 's picture , and told them he was a very good friend of theirs , who felt the deepest interest in them , and had written this hymn expressly for them to sing , - which made them very proud and happy . Early Christmas morning , we were wakened by the people knocking at the doors and windows , and shouting , " Merry Christmas ! " After distributing some little presents among them , we went to the church , which had been decorated with holly , pine , cassena , mistletoe , and the hanging moss , and had a very Christmas-like look . The children of our school assembled there , and we gave them the nice , comfortable clothing , and the picture - books , which had been kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred and fifty children present . It was very pleasant to see their happy , expectant little , faces . To them , it was a wonderful ChristmasiDay , - such as they had never dreamed of before . Thert* was cheerful sunshine without , lighting up the beautiful mossdrapery of the oaks , and looking in joyously through the open windows ; and there were bright faces and glad hearts within . The long , dark night of the Past , with all its sorrows and its fears , was forgotten ; and for the Future ,  --  the eyes of these freed children see no clouds in it . It is full of sunlight , they think , and they trust in it , perfectly . After the dstribution of the gifts , the children were addressed by some of the gentlemen present . They then sang Whittier 's Hymn , the " John Brown " song , and several of their own hymns , among them a very singular one , commencing , - " I wonder where my mudder gone ; Sing , 0 graveyard ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grass grow in de graveyard ; Sing , 0 graveyard ! Graveyard ought to know me ; Ring , Jerusalem ! " They improvise many more words , as they sing . It is one of the strangest , most mournful things I ever heard . It is impossible to give any idea of the deep pathos of the refrain , - " Sing , 0 graveyard ! " // In this , and many other hymns , the words seem to have but little meaning ; but the tones , - a whole lifetime of despairing sadness is concentrated in them . They sing , also , " Jehovyah , Hallelujah , " which we like particularly - " De foxes hab holes , An ' de birdies hab nes ' , But de Son ob Man he hab not where To lay de weary head . CHORUS . " Jehovyab , Hallelujah ! De Lord He will purvide ! Jehovyab . Hallelujah ! De Lord He will purvide ! They repeat the words many times . " De foxes hab holes , " and the succeeding lines , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the chorus - " Jehovyah , Hallelujah " - swells forth triumphantly , in glad contrast . Christmas night , the children came in and had several grand shouts . They were too happy to keep still . " Oh , Miss , all I want to do is to sing and shout ! " said our little pet , Amaretta . And sing and shout she did , to her heart 's content . She read nicely , and was very fond of books . The tiniest children are delighted to get a book in their hands . Many of them already know their letters . The parents are eager to have them learn . They sometimes said to me , - " Do , Miss , let de chil'en learn eberyting dey can . We nebber hab no chance to learn nuttin ' , but we wants de chil'en to learn . " They are willing to make many sacrifices that their children may attend school . One old woman2 who had a large family of children and grandchildren , came regularly to school in the winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at least sixty years old . Another woman - who had one of the best faces I ever saw-caine daily , and brought her baby in her arms . It happened to be one of the best babies in the world , a perfect little " model of deportment , " and allowed its mother to pursue her studies without interruption . While taking charge of the store , one day , one of the men who came in told me a story which interested me much . He was a carjenter , living on this island , and just before the capture of Port Royal had been taken by his master to the mainland , - " the Main , " as the people call it , - to assist in building some houses which were to shelter the families of the Rebels in case the " Yankees " should come . The master afterward sent him back to the island , providing him with a pass , to bring away a boat and some of the people . On his arrival he found that the Union troops were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family instead of returning to his master . Some of his fellow - servants , who had been left on " the Main , " hearing that the Federal troops had come , resolved to make , their escape to the islands . They found a boat of their master 's , out of which a piece six feet square had been cut . In the night they went to the boat , which had been sunk in a creek near the house , measured the hole , and , after several nights ' work in the woods , made a piece large enough to fit in . They then mended and sank it again , as they had found it . The next night five of them embarked . They had a perilous journey , often passing quite near the enemy 's boats . They travelled at night , and in the day ran close up to the shore out of sight . Sometimes they could hear the hounds , which had been sent in pursuit of them , baying in the woods . Their provisions gave out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing all the enemy 's boats , and reached one of our gun-boats in safety . They were taken on board and kindly cared for , and then sent to this island , where their families , whohad nohope of everseeingthem again , welcomed them with great rejoicing . We were also told the story of two girls , one about ten , the other fifteen , who , having been taken by their master up into the country , on the mainland , at the time of the capture of the islands , determined to try to escape to their parents , who had been left on this island . They stole away // at night , and travelled through woods and swamps for two days , without , eating . Sometimes their strength gave out , and they would sink down , thinking they could go no farther ; but they had brave little hearts , and got up again and struggled on , till at last they reached PortRoyal Ferry , in a state of utter exhaustion . They were seen there by a boatload of people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full to take them in ; but the people , on reaching this island , told the children 's father of their whereabouts , and he immediately took a boat , and hastened to the ferry . The poor little creatures were almost wild with joy when they saw him . When they were brought to their mother , she fell down " jes ' as if she was dead , " - so our informant expressed it , - overpowered with joy on beholding the " lost who were found . " New-Year's-Day- Emancipation-Day - was a glorious one to us . The morning was quite cold , the coldest we had experienced ; but we were determined to go to the celebration at Camp Saxton ,  - -  the camp of the First Regiment SouthCarolina Volunteers-whither the General and Colonel iligginson had bidden us , on this , " the greatest day in the nation 's history . " We enjoyed perfectly the exciting scene on board the Flora . There was an eager , wondering crowd of the freed people in their holiday-attire , with the gayest of head - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of faces . The band was playing , the flags streaming , everybody talking merrily and feeling strangely happy . The sun shone brightly , the very waves seemed to partake of ' the universal gayety , and danced and sparkled more joyously than ever before . Long before we reached Camp Saxton we could see the beautiful grove , and the ruins of the old linguenot fort near it . Some companies of the First Regiment were drawn up in line under the trees , near the landing , to receive us . A fine , soldierly-looking set of men ; their brilliant dress against the trees ( they were then wearing red pantaloons ) invested them with a semibarbaric splendor . It was my good fortune to find among the officers an old friend , - and what it was to meet a friend from the North , in our isolated Southern life , no one can imagine who has not experienced the pleasure . Letters were an unspeakable luxury , - we hungered for them , we could never get enough ; but to meet old friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as the people here say , when they are very much in earnest . Our friend took us over the camp , and showed us all the arrangements . Everything looked clean and comfortable , much neater , we were told , than in most of the white camps . An officer told us that he had never seen a regiment in which the men were so honest . " In many other camps , " said he , " the colonel and the rest of us would find it necessary to place a guard before our tents . We never do it here . They are left entirely unguarded . Yet nothing has ever been touched . " We were glad to know that . It is a remarkable fact , when we consider that these men have all their lives been slaves ; and we know what the teachings of Slavery are . The celebration took place in the beautiful grove of live-oaks adjoining the camp . It was the largest grove we had sean . I wish it were possible to describe fitly the scene which met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down on the crowd before us . There were the black soldiers in their blue coats and scarlet pantaloons , the officers of this and other regiments in their handsome uniforms , and crowds of lookers-on , - men , women , and children , of every complexion , grouped in various attitudes under the moss-hung trees . The faces of all wore a happy , interested look . The exercises commenced with a prayer by the chaplain of the regiment . An ode , written for the occasion by Professor Zachos , was read by him , and then sung . Colonel Higginson then introduced Dr. Brisbane , who read the President 's Proclamation , which was enthusiastically cheered . Rev. Mr. French presented to // the Colonel twovery elegant flags , a gift to the regiment from the Church of the Puritans , accompanying them by an appropriate and enthusiastic speech . At its conclusion , before Colonel Higginson could reply , and while he still stood holding the flags in his hand , some of the colored people , of their own accord , commenced singing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a touching and beautiful incident , and sent a thrill through all our hearts . The Colonel was deeply moved by it . He s*dd that that reply was far more effective than any speech he could make . But he did make one of those stirring speeches which are " half battles . " All hearts swelled with emotion as we listened to his glorious words ,  --  " stirring the soul like the sound of a trumpet . " His soldiers are warmly attached to him , and he evidently feels towards them all as if they were his children . The people speak of him as " the officer who never leaves his regiment for pleasure , " but devotes himself with all his rich gifts of mind and heart , to their interests . It is not strange that his judicious kindness , ready sympathy , and rare fascination of manner should attach them to him strongly . He is one 's ideal of an officer . There isin him much of the grand , knightly spirit of the olden time , - scorn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weak , chivalrous devotion to the cause of the oppressed . General Saxton spoke also , and was received with great enthusiasm . Throughout the morning , repeated cheers were given for him by the regiment , and joined in heartily by all the people . They know him to be one of the best and noblest men in the world . His Proclamation for Emancipation-Day we thought , if possible , even more beautiful than the Thanksgiving Proclamation . At the close of Colonel Higginson 's speech he presented the flags to the colorbearers , Sergeant Rivers and Sergeant Sutton , with an earnest charge , to which they made appropriate replies . We were particularly pleased with Robert Sutton , who is a man of great natural intelli gence , and whose remarks were simphe , eloquent , and forcible . Mrs. Gage also uttered some earnest words and then the regiment sang " John Brown " with much spirit . After the meeting we saw the dress-parade , a brilliant and beautiful sight . An officer told us that the men went through the drill remarkably well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movements were wonderful . To us it seemed strange as a miracle , - this black regiment , the first mustered into the service of the United States , doing itself honor in the sight of the officers of other regiments , many of whom , doubtless , " came to scoffi " The men afterwards had a great feast , ten oxen having been roasted whole for their especial benefit . We went to the landing , intending to take the next boat for Beaufort ; but finding it very much crowded , waited for another . It was the softest , loveliest moonlight ; we seated ourselves on the ruined wall of the old fort ; and when the boat had got a short distance from the shore the band in it coinmenced playing " Sweet Home . " The moonlight on the water , the perfect stillness around , the wildness and solitude of the ruins , all seemed to give new pathos to that ever dear and beautiful old song . It came very near to all of us , - strangers in that strange Southern land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tents , - for the night-air , as usual , grew dangerously damp , - and , sitting around the bright wood-fire , enjoyed the brilliant and entertaining conversation . Very unwilling were we to go home ; for , besides the attractive society , we knew that the soldiers were to have grand shouts and a general jubilee that night . But the Flora was coming , and we were obliged to say a reluctant farewell to Camp Saxton and the hospitable dwellers therein , and hasten to the landing . We promehaded the deck of the steamer , sang patriotic songs , and agreed that moonlight and water had never looked so beautiful as on that night . At Beaufort we took the row-boat for St. Helena ; and the boatmen , as they rowed , // sang some of their sweetest , wildest hymns . It was a fitting close to such a day . Our hearts were filled with an exceeding great gladness ; for , although the Government had left much undone , we knew that Freedom was surely born in our land that day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this beginning of the great work we had so longed and prayed for . L. and I had one day an interesting visit to a plantation about six miles from ours . The house is beautifully situated in the midst of noble pine-trees , on the banks of a large creek . The place was owned by a very wealthy Rebel family , and is one of the pleasantest and healthiest on the island . The vicinity of the pines makes it quite healthy . There were a hundred and fifty people on it ,  - -  one hundred of whom had come from Edisto Island at the time of its evacuation by our troops . There were not houses enough to accommodate them , and they had to take shelter in barns , out-houses , or any other place they could find . They afterwards built rude dwellings for themselves , which did not , however , afford them much protection in bad weather . The superintendent told us that they were well-behaved and industrious . One old woman interested us greatly . Her name was Daphne ; she was probably more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sixty-five greatgrandchildren , and three great - great - grandchildren . Entirely blind , she yet seemed very cheerful and happy . She told us that she was brought with her parents from Africa at the time of the Revolution . A bright , happy old face was hers , and she retained her faculties remarkably well . Fifteen of the people had escaped from the mainland in the previous spring . They were pursued , and one of them was overtaken by his master in the swamps . A fierce grapple ensued ,  --  the master on horseback , the man on foot . The former drew a pistol and shot his slave through the arm , shattering it dreadfully . Still , the heroic man fought desperately , and at last succeeded in unhorsing his master , and beating him until he was senseless . He then made his escape , and joined the rest of the party . One of the most interesting sights we saw was a baptism among the people . On one Sunday there were a hundred and fifty baptized in the creek near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aprons and bright frocks and handkerchiefs . As they marched in procession down to the , river 's edge , and during the ceremony , the spectators , with whom the banks were crowded , sang glad , triumphant songs . The freed people on this island are all Baptists . We were much disappointed in the Southern climate . We found it much colder than we had expected , - quite cold enough for as thick winter clothing as one would wear at the North . The houses , heated only by open fires , were never comfortably warm . In the floor of our sitting - room there was a large crack through which we could see the ground beneath ; and through this and the crevices of the numerous doors and windows the wind came chillingly . The church in which we taught school was particularly damp and cold . There was no chimney , and we could have no fire at all . Near the close of the winter a stove came for us , but it could not be made to draw ; we were nearly suffocated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We got so thoroughly chilled and benumbed within , that for several days we had school out-of-doors , where it was much warmer . Our school-room was a pleasant one ,  - -  for ceiling the blue sky above , for walls the grand old oaks with their beautiful moss-drapery ,  --  but the dampness of the ground made it unsafe for us to continue the experiment . At a later period , during a few days ' visit to some friends living on the Milne Plantation , then the head-quarters of the First South-Carolina , which was on picket-duty at Port-Royal Ferry , we had an opportunity of seeing something of PortRoyal Island . We had pleasant rides through the pine barrens . Indeed , riding // on horseback was our chief recreation at the South , and we enjoyed it thorough ly . The " Secesh " horses , though small , poor , and mean-looking , when compared with ours , are generally excellent for the saddle , well - trained and very easy . I remember particularly one ride that we had while on Port-Royal Island . We visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island . It is situated on Broad River . The grounds are extensive , and are filled with ma , nificent live-oaks , magnolias , and other trees . We saw one noble old oak , said to be the largest on these islands . Some of the branches have been cut off , but the remaining ones cover an area of more than a hundred feet in circumference . We rode to a point whence the Rebels on the opposite side of the river are sometimes to be seen . But they were not visible that day ; and we were disappointed in our long-cherished hope of seeii'ig a " real live Rebel . " On leaving the plantation , we rode through a long avenue oaks , - the moss-hung branches forming a perfect arch over our heads , - and then for miles through the pine barrens . There was an Italian softness in the April air . Only a low , faint murmur - hardly " the slow song of the sea - could be heard among the pines . The ground was thickly carpeted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , purple and white , and azaleas of a deeper pink and heavier fragrance than ours . It was leaving Paradise , to emerge from the beautiful woods upon the public road , - the shell-road which runs from Beaufort to the Ferry . Then we entered a by-way leading to the plantation , where we found the Cherokee rose in all its glory . The hedges were white with it ; it canopied the trees , and hung from their branches its long sprays of snowy blossoms and dark , shining leaves , forming perfect arches , and bowers which seemed fitting places for fairies to dwell in . How it gladdened our eyes and hearts ! It was as if all the dark shadows that have so long hung over this Southern land had flitted away , and , in this garment of purest white , it shone forth* transfigured , beautified , forevermore . On returning to the house , we were met by the exciting news that the Rebels were bringing up pontoon-bridges , and were expected to attempt crossing over near the Ferry , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every few moments with various reports . A superintendent whose plantation was very near the Ferry had been watching through his glass the movements on the opposite side , and reported that the Rebels were gathering in large force , and evidently preparing for some kind of demonstration . A messenger was despatched to Beaufort for reinforcements , and for some time we were in a state of expectancy , not entirely without excitement , but entirely without fear . The officers evidently enjoyed the prospect of a fight . One of them assured me that I should have the pleasure of seeing a Rebel shell during the afternoon . It was proposed that the women should be sent into Beaufort in an ambulance ; against which ignoble treatment we indignantly protested , and declared our intention of remaining at our post , if the Colonel would consent ; and finally , to our great joy , the best of colonels did consent that we should remain , as he considered it quite safe for us to do so . Soon a light battery arrived , and during the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the explosion of the shells . It was quite like being in the war ; and as the firing was principally on our side , and the enemy was getting the worst of it , we rather enjoyed it . For a little while the Colonel read to us , in his spirited way , some of the stirring " Lays of the Old Cavaliers . " It was just the time to appreciate them thoroughly , and he was of all men the fittest person to read them . But soon came a courier , " in hot haste , " to make report of the doings without , and the reading was at an end . In the midst of the firing , Mrs. D. and I went to bed , and slept soundly until morning . We learned afterward that the Rebels had not intended // June , to cross over , but were attempting to take the guns off one of our boats , which they had sunk a few days previous . The timely arrival of the battery from Beaufort prevented them from accomplishing their purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been considered a particularly unhealthy place during the summer , and came to " Seaside , " a plantation on another and healthier part of the island . The place c@ntains nearly a hundred people . The house is large and comparatively comfortable . Notwithstanding the name , we have not even a distant glimpse of the sea , although we can sometimes hear its roar . At low tide there is not a drop of water to be seen , - only dreary stretches of marsh - land , reminding us of the sad outlook of Manann in the Moated Grange , - " The level waste and rounding gray . " But at night we have generally a good sea-breeze , and during the hottest weather the air is purer and more invigorating than in many parts of the island . On this , as on several other large plantations , there is a " Praise-House , " which is the special property of the people . Even in the old days of Slavery , they were allowed to hold meetings here ; and they still keep up the custom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sunday afternoons . First , they hold what is called the " Praise-Meeting , " which consists of singing , praying , and preaching . We have heard some of the old negro preachers make prayers that were really beautiful and touching . In these meetings they sing only the church-hymns which the Northern ministers have taught them , and which are far less suited to their voices than their own . At the close of the Praise-Meeting they all shake hands with each other in the most solemn manner . Afterward , as a kind of appendix , they have a grand " shout , " during which they sing their own hymns . Maurice , an old blind man , leads the singing . He has a remarkable voice , and sings with the greatest enthusiasm . The first shout that we witnessed in the Praise - House impressed us very much . The large , gloomy room , with its blackened walls ,  --  the wild , whirling dance of the shouters ,  --  the crowd of dark , eager faces gathered around ,  --  the figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be controlled , and whose attitude and gestures while singing were very fine ,  --  and over all , the red glare of the burning pine - knot , which shed a circle of light around it , but only seemed to deepen and darken the shadows in the other tarts of the room , - these all formed a wild , strange , and deeply impressive picture , not soon to be forgotten . Maurice 's especial favorite is one of the grandest hymns that we have yet heard : - " De tallest tree in Paradise De Christian calls de Tree oh Life , An ' I hope dat trumpet blow me home To my New Jerusalem . Cuonus . " Blow , Gabriel ! trumpet , blow louder , louder ! An ' I hope dat trumpet blow me home To my New Jerusalem ! " Paul and Silas jail-bound Sing God 's praise both night and day , An ' I hope dat trumpet blow me home To my New Jerusalem . CuoRus . " Blow , Gabriel ! trumpet , blow louder , louder ! An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jerusalem ! The chorus has a glad , triumphal sound , and in singing it the voice of old Maurice rings out in wonderfully clear , trumpetlike tones . His blindness was caused by a blow on the head from a loaded whip . He was struck by his master in a fit of anger . " I feel great distress when I become blind , " said Maurice ; " but den I went to seek de Lord ; and eber since I know I see in de next world , I always hab great satisfaction . " We are told that the master was not a " hard man " except when in a passion , and then he seems to have been very crueL One of the women on the place , Old Bess , bears on her limbs many marks of // the whip . Some of the scars are three and four inches long . She was used principally as a house - servant . She says , " Ebery time I lay de table I put cowskin on one end , an ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flab all kinds o ' work to do , and sich a gang of children to look after ! One person could n't git along wid so much work , so it go wrong , and den I git beatin ' . " But the cruelty of Bess 's master sinks into insignificance , when compared with the far-famed wickedness of another slaveholder , known all over the island as " Old Joe Eddings . " There seem to have been no bounds to his cruelty and licentiousness ; and the people tell tales of him which make one shudder . We were once asking some questions about him of an old , half- witted woman , a former slave of his . The look of horror and loathing which overspread her face was perfectly indescribable , as , with upraised hands , she exclaimed , " What ! Old Joe Eddings ? Lord , Missus , he second to none in de world but de IJebil ! " She had , indeed , good cause to detest him ; for , some years befoi*e , her daughter , a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself into the creek and been drowned , after having been severely beaten for refusing to degrade herself . Outraged , despised , and black , she yet preferred death to dishonor . But these are things too heart-sickening to dwell upon . God alone knows how many hundreds of plantations , all over the South , might furnish a similar record . Early in June , before the summer heat had become unendurable , we made a pleasant excursion to Edisto Island . We left St. Helena village in the morning , dined on one of the gun-boats stationed near our island , and in the afternoon proceeded to Edisto in two row - boats . There were six of us , besides an officer and the boats ' crews , who were armed with guns and cutlasses . There was no actual danger ; but as we were going into the enemy 's country , we thought it wisest to guard against surprises . Af ter a deli*htful row , we reached the island near sunset , landing at a place called Eddingsville , which was a favorite summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine beach several miles in length . Along the beach there is a row of houses , which must once have been very desirable dwellings , but have now a desolate , dismantled look . The sailors explored the beach for some distance , and returned , reporting " all quiet , and nobody to be seen " ; so we walked on , feeling quite safe , stopping here and there to gather the beautiful tiny shells which were buried deep in the sands . We took supper in a room of one of the deserted houses , using for seats some old bureau-drawers turned edgewise . Afterward we sat on the piazza , watching the lightning playing from a low , black cloud over a. sky flushed with sunset , and listening to the merry songs of the sailors who occupied the next hou ? se . They had built a large fire , the cheerful glow of which shone through the windows , and we could see them dancing , evidently in great glee . Later , we had another walk on the beach , in the lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stillness was broken only by the low , musical murmur of the waves . The moon shone bright and clear over the deserted houses and gardens , and gave them a still wilder and more desolate look . We went within- doors for the night very unwillingly . Having , of course , no beds , we made ourselves as comfortable as we could on the floor , with boat-cushions , blankets , and shawls . No fear of Rebels disturbed us . There was but one road by which they could get to us , and on that a watch was kept , and in case of their approach , we knew we should have ample time to get to the boats and make our escape . So , despite the mosquitoes , we had a sound night 's sleep . The next morning we took the boats again , and followed the course of the most winding of little creeks . In and out , in and out , the boats went . Sometimes it seemed as if we were going into the very // heart of the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the sound of a Rebel rifle ; The banks were overhung with a thick tangle of shrubs and bushes , which threatened to catch our boats , as we passed close beneath their branches . In some places the stream was so narrow that we ran aground , and then the men had to get out , and drag and pull with all their mi* , ht before we could be got clear again . After a row full of excitement and pleasure , we reached our place of destination ,  --  the Eddin , , s Plantation , whither some of the freedmen had preceded us in their search for corn . It must once have been a beautiful place . The grounds were laid Out with great taste , and filled with fine trees , among which we noticed particularly the oleander , laden with deep rose-hued and deliciously fragrant flowers , and the magnolia , with its wonderful , large blossoms , which shone dazzlingly white among the dark leaves . We explored the house , - after it had first been examined by our guard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found nothing but heaps of rubbish , an old bedstead , and a bathingtub , of which we afterward made good use . When we returned to the shore , we found that the tide had gone out , and between us and the boats lay a tract of marsh-land , which it would have been impossible to cross without a wetting . The gentlemen determined on wading . But what were we to do ? In this dilemma somebody suggested the bathing - tub , a su* estion which was eagerly seized upon . We were placed in it , one at a time , borne aloft in triumph on the shoulders of four stout sailors , and safely deposited in the boat . But , through a mistake , the tub was not sent back for two of the ladies , and they were brought over on the crossed hands of two of the sailors , in the " carry - a - lady - to - London " style . Again we rowed through the windin*s of the creek , then out into the open sea , among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dined again with its hospitable officers , and then returned to our island , which we reached after nightfall , feeling thoroughly tired , but well pleased with our excursion . From what we saw of Edisto , however , we did not like it better than our own island , - except , of course , the beach ; but we are told that farther in the interior it is much more beautiful . The freed people , who left it at the time of its evacuation , think it the loveliest place in the world , and long to return . When we were going , Miss T.  --  the muchloved and untiring friend and physician of the people-asked some whom we met if we should give their love to Edisto . Oh , yes , yes , Miss ! " they said . " Ab , Edisto a beautiful city ! " And when we came back , they inquired , eagerly , - " How you like Edisto ? How Edisto stan ' ? " Only the fear of again falling into the hands of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the summer advanced , the heat became intense . We found it almost overpowering , driving to school near the middle of the day , as we were obliged to do . I gave up riding , and mounted a sulky , such as a single gentleman drives in at the North . It was exceedingly high , and I found it no small task to mount up in.to it . Its already very comical appearance was enhanced by the addition of a cover of black India-rubber cloth , with which a friend kindly provided me . Thus adorned , it looked like the skeleton of some strange creature surmounted by a huge bonnet , and afforded endless amusement to the soldiers we chanced to meet , who hailed its appearance with shouts of laughter , and cries of " Here comes the Calithumpian ! " This unique vehicle , with several others on our island , kindred , but not quite equal to it , would create a decided sensation in the streets of a Northern city . No description of life on these islands would be complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening of spring , and kept constantly " risin ' , " as the people said , until they reached a height the possibility of which // we had never conceived . We had heard and read of fleas . We had never realized them before . Words utterly fail to describe the tortures we endured for months from these horrible little tyrants . Remembering our sufferings " through weary day and weary night , " we warn everybody not gifted with extraordinary powers of endurance to beware of a summer on the Sea Islands . Notwithstanding the heat , we determined to celebrate the Fourth of July as worthily as we could . The freed people and the children of the different schools assembled in the grove near the Baptist Church . The flag was hung across the road , between two magnificent-live-oaks , and the children , being grouped under it , sang " The Star-Spangled Banner " with much spirit . Our good General could not come , but addresses were made by Mr. P. ,  --  the noble-hearted founder of the movement for the benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stanch and much-loved friend , - by Mr. L. , a young colored minister , and ol*hers . Then the people sang some of their own hymns ; and the woods resounded with the grand notes of " Roll , Jordan , roll . " They all afterward partook of refreshments , consisting of molasses and water , - a very great luxury to them , - and hardtack . Among the visitors present was the noble young Colonel Shaw , whose regiment was then stationed on the island . We had met him a few nights before , when he came to our house to witness one of the people 's shouts . We looked upon him with the deepest interest . There was something in his face finer , more exquisite , than one often sees in a man 's face , yet it was full of courage and decision . The rare and singular charm of his manner drew all hearts to him . He was deeply interested in the singing and appearance of the people . A few days afterwards we saw bis regiment on dress-parade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking supper with the Colonel we sat outside the tent , while some of his men entertained us with excellent singing . Every moment we became more and more charmed with him . How full of life and hope and lofty aspirations he was that night ! how eagerly he expressed his wish that they might soon be ordered to Charleston ! " I do hope they will give us a chance , " he said . It was the desire of his soul that his men should do themselves honor , - that they should prove themselves to an unbelieving world as brave soldiers as thou , h their skins were white . And for himself , he was like the Chevalier of old , " without reproach or fear . " After we had mounted our horses and rode away , we seemed still to feel the kind clasp of his hand , - to hear the pleasant , genial tones of his voice , as he bade us goodbye , and hoped that we might meet again . We never saw him afterward . In two short weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful head of the young hero and martyr was laid low in fhe dust . Never shall we forget the heart-sickness with which we heard of his death . We could not realize it at first , - we , who had seen him so lately in all the strength and glory of his young manhood . For days we clung to a vain hope ; then it fell away from us , and we knew that he was gone . We knew that he died gloriously , but still it seemed very hard . Our h*arts bled for the mother whom he so loved , - for the young wife , left desolate . And then we sai ( l , as we say now , - " God comfort them ! He only can . " During a few of the sad days which followed the attack on Fort Wagner , I was in one of the hospitals of Beaufort , occupied with the wounded soldiers of the FiftyFourth Massachusetts . The first morn*ng was spent in mending the bulletholes and rents in their clothing . *Vhat a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellows were literally cut in pieces . It was pleasant to see the brave , cheerful spirit among them . Some of them were severely wounded , but they uttered no complaint ; and in the letters which they dictated to their absent friends there was no word of regret , but the same // cheerful tone throughout . They expressed an eager desire to get well , that they might " go at it again . " Their attachment to their young colonel was beautiful to see . They felt his death deeply . One and all united in the warmest and most enthusiastic praise of him . He was , indeed , exactly the person to inspire the most loyal devotion in the hearts of his men . And with everything to live for , he had given up his life for . them . Heaven 's best gifts had been showered upon him , but for them he had laid them all down . I think they truly appreciated the greatness of the sacrifice . May they ever prove worthy of such a leader ! Already , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have shown that true manhood has no limitations of color . Daily the long - oppressed people of these islands are demonstrating their capacity for improvement in learning and labor . What they hare accomplished in one short year exceeds our utmost expectations . Still the sky is dark ; but through the darkness we can discern a brighter future . We can not but feel that the day of final and entire deliverance , so long and often so hopelessly prayed for , has at length begun to dawn upon this much-enduring race . An old freedman said to me one day , " De Lord make me suffer long time , Miss . Peared like we nebber was gwine to git troo . But now we s free . He bring us all out right at las ' . " In their darkest hours they have clung to Him , and we know TIe will not forsake them . " The poor among men shall rejoice , For the terrible one is brought to nought . " While writing these pages I am once more nearing Port Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall again tread the flower-skirted woodpaths ofSt . Helena , and the sombre pines and bearded oaks shall whisper in the sea-wind their grave welcome . I shall dwell again among " mine own people . " I shall gather my scholars about me , and see smiles of greeting break over their dusk faces . My heart sings a song of thanksgiving , at the thought that even I am permitted to do something for a longabused race , and aid in promoting a higher , holier , and happier life on the Sea Islands .
