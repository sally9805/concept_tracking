ANTHONY TROLLOPE ON AMERICA . Mn . AnTHONY TEOLLOPE 'S work entitled North - America has been republished in this country , and curiosity has at length been satisfied . Great as has been this curiosity among his friends , it can not , however , be said to have been wide-spread , inasmuch as up to the appearance of this book of travels , comparatively few were aware of the presence of Mr. Trollope in this country . When Charles Dickens visited America , our people testified their admiration of his homely genius by going mad , receiving him with frantic acclamations of deligI*t , dining him , and suppering him , and going through the pump-handle movement ' with him . Mr. Dickens was , in consequence , intensely bored by this attestation of popular idolatry so peculiar to the United States , and looked upon us as officious , absurd , and disgusting . Officious we were , and absurd enough , surely , but far from being disgusting . He ought hardly to beget disgust whose youth and inexperience leads him to extravagance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went home rather more impressed by our faults , which he had had every opportunity of inspecting , than by our virtues , which possessed fewer salient features to his humorous eye* Two books-American Notes and . Miartin Chuzzlezoit - were the product of his tour through America . Thereupon , the American people grew very indignant . Their Dickens-love , in proportion to its intensity , turned to Dickens - hate , and ingratitude was considered to be synonymous with the name of this novelist . We gave him every chance to see our follies , and we snubbed his cherished and chief object in visiting America , concerning a copyright . There is little wonder , then , that Dickens , are Englishman and a caricaturist , should have painted us in the colors that he did . There is scarcely less wonder that Americans , at that time , all in the white - heat of enthusiasm , should have waxed angry at Dickens ' cold return to so much warmth . But , reading these books in the light of 1862 , there are few of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We see an uproariously funny extravaganza in iAlartin Ohuzzlewit , which we can well afford to laugh at , having grown thicker-skinned , and wonder what there is to be found in the Arotes so very abominable to an American . Mr. Dickens was a humorist , not a statesman or philosopher , therefore he wrote of us as a disappointed humorist would have been tempted to write . It is not likely that Mr. Trollope 's advent in this country would have given rise to any remark or excitement , his novels , clever though they be , not having taken hold of the people 's heart as did those of Dickens . He came among us quietly ; the newspapers gave him no flourish of trumpets ; he traveled about unknown ; hence it was , that few knew a new book was to be written upon America by one bearing a name not over-popular thirty years ago . Curiosity was confined to the friends and acquaintances of Mr. Trollope , who were naturally not a little anxious that he should conscientiously write such a book as would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and render him personally as popular as his novels . For there are , we believe , few intelligent Americans ( and Mr. Trollope is good enough to say that we of the North are all intelligent ) who are not ready to faire *aima*le'to the kindly , genial author of North-America . It is not being rash to state that Mr. Trollope , in his last book , has not disappointed his warmest personal friends in this country , and this is saying much , when it is considered that many of them are radically opposed to him in many of his // opinions , and most of them hold very different views from him in regard to the present war . They are not disappointed , because Mr. Trollope has labored to be impartial in his criticisms , He has , at least , endeavored to lay aside his English prejudices and judge us in a spirit of truth and good-fellowship . Mr. Trollope inaugurated a new era in British book - making upon America , when he wrote : If I could in any small degree add to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to love each other so well , and which do hang upon each other so constantly , I should think that I had cause to be proud of my work . ' In saying this much , Mr. Trollope has said what others of his ilk-Bulwer , Thackcray , and Dickens - would not have said , and he may well be proud , or , at least , he can afford not to be proud , of a superior honesty and frankness . He has won for himself kind thoughts on this side of the Atlantic , and were Americans convinced that the body English were imbued with the spirit of Mr. Trollope , there would be little left of the resuscitated soreness. * In his introduction , Mr. Trollope frankly acknowledges that it is very hard to write about any country a book that does not represent the country described in a more or less ridiculous point of view . ' He confesses that he is not a philosophico-political or politico-statistical or a statistico-scientific writer , and hence , ridicule and censure run glibly from the pen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the reader . Whereas , eulogy is commonly dull , and too frequently sounds as though it were false . ' We agree with him , that there is much difficulty in expressing a verdict which is intended to be favorable , but which , though favorable , shall not be falsely eulogistic , and though true , not offensive . ' Mr. Trollope has not been offensive either in his praise or dispraise ; and when we look upon him in the light in which he paints himself- that of an English novelist - he has , at least , done his best by us . We could not expect from him such a book as Emerson wrote on English Traits , or such an one as Thomas Buckle would have written had death not staid his great work of Civilivation . Nor could we look to him for that which John Stuart Mill - the English De Tocqueville - alone can give . For much that we expected we have received , for that which is wanting we shall now find fault , but good-naturedly , we hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North - America , is its extreme verbosity . Had it been condensed to one half or at least one third of its present size , the spirit of the book had been less weakened , and the taste of the public better satisfied . The question naturally arises in an inquiring mind , if the author could make so much out of a six months ' tour through the Northern States , what would the consequences have beer* had he remained a year , and visited Dixie 's land as well ? The conclusions logically arrived at are , to say the least , very unfavorable to weak-eyed persons who are condemned to read the cheap American edition . Life is too short , and books are too numerous , to allow of repetition ; and at no time is Mr. Trollope so guilty in this respect as when he dilates upon those worthies , Mason and Slidell , in connection with the Trent affair . It was very natural , especially as England has come off first-best in this matter , that Mr. Trollope should have made a feature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereon . One reference to the controversy was desirable , two endurable , but the third return to the charge is likely to meet with impatient exclamations from the reader , who heartily sympathizes with the author when he says : And now , I trust , I may finish my book without again naming Messrs . Slidell and Mason . ' It certainly was rash to rave as we did on this subject , but it was quite natural , when our jurists , ( even the Hon. Caleb Gushing ) who were supposed to know their business , assured us that we // had right on our side . It was extremely ridiculous to put Captain Wilkes upon a pedestal a little lower than Bunker-Hill monument , and present him with a hero 's sword for doing what was then considered only his duty . But it must be remembered that at that time the mere performance of duty by a public officer was so extraordinary a phenomenon that loyal people were brought to believe it merited especial recognition . Our Government , and not the people , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered on his fieldday , ' been the verdict of the Washington Cabinet previous to the reception of England 's expostulations , the position taken by America on this subject would have been highly dignified and honorable . As it is , we stand with feathers ruffled and torn . But if ; as we suppose , the Trent imbroglio leads to a purification of maritime law , not only America , but the entire commercial world will be greatly indebted to the super-patriotism of Captain Wilkes . The charming women of Boston ' are inclined to quarrel with their friend Mr. Trollope , for ridiculing their powers of argumentation apropos to Captain Wilkes , for Mr. Trollope must confess they knew quite as much about what they were talking as the lawyers by whom they were instructed . They have had more than their proper share of revenge , however , meted out for them by the reviewer of the London Critic , who writes as follows : Mr. Trollope was in Boston when the first ne about the Trent arrived . Of course , every body was full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not excluded - albeit he is rather sarcastic upon the young ladies who began immediately to chatter about it . Wheaton is quite clear about it , ' said one young girl to me . It was the first I had beard of Wheaton , and so far was obliged to knock under . ' Yet Mr. Trollope , knowing very little more of Wheaton than he did before , and obviously nothing of the great authorities on maritime law , inflicts upon his readers page after page of argument upon the Trent affair , not half so delightful as the pretty babble of the ball-room belle . With all due respect to Mr. Trollope , and his attractions , we are quite are th t we would much sooner get our international law from the lips of the fair Bostonian than from kis . ' After such a champion as this , could the fair Bostonians have the heart to assail Mr. Trollope ? Mr. Trollope treats of our civil war at great length ; in fact , the reverberations of himself on this matter are quite as objectionable as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment of this subject that must ever be a source of regret to the earnest thinkers who are gradually becoming the masters of our Government 's policy , who constitute the bone and muscle of the land , the rank and file of the army , and who are changing the original character of the war into that of a holy crusade . It is to be deplored , because Mr. Trollope 's book will no doubt influence English opinion , to a certain extent , and therefore militate against us , and we already know how his mistaken opinions have been seized upon by pro-slavery journals in this country as a lonne 6ouche which they rarely obtain from so respectable a source ; the more palatable to them , coming from that nationality which we have always been taught to believe was more abolition in its creed than William Lloyd Garrison himself ; and from whose people we have received most of our lectures on the sin of slavery . It is sad that so fine a nature as that of Mr. Trollope should not feel consciencestricken in believing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war must be the work of a man too ignorant to understand the real subject of the war , or too false to his country to regard it . ' Yet it is strange that these too ignorant ' or too false ' men are the very ones that Mr. Trollope holds up to admiration , and declares that any nation might be proud to claim their genius . Longfellow and Lowell , Emerson and Motley , to whom we could add almost all the well- known thinkers of the country , men after his own heart in most things , belong to this ignorant ' or false ' sect . Is it their one madness ? // That is a strange , e madness which besets our greatest men and women ; a marvelous anomaly surely . Yet there must be something sympathetic in abolitionism to Mr. Trollope , for he prefers Boston , the centre of this ignorance , to all other American cities , and finds his friends for the most part among these false ones , by which we are to conclude that Mr. rfrollope is by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his proper development . And these circumstances we ascribe to a hasty and supefficial visit to the British West-India colonies . It is well known that in his entertaining book on travels in the West-Indies and Spanish Main , Mr. Trollope undertakes to prove that emancipation has both ruined the commercial prosperity of the British islands and degraded the free blacks to a level with the idle brute . Mr. Trollope is still firm in this opinion , notwithstanding the statistics of the Blue Book , which prove that these colonies never were in so flourishing a condition as at present . We , in America , have also had the same fact demonstrated by figures , in that very plainly written book called the Ordeal of Free La6or . Mr. Trollope , no doubt , saw some very lazy negroes , wallowing in dirt , and living only for the day , but later developments have proved that his investigations could have been simply those of a dilettante . It is highly probable that the planters who have been shorn of their riches by the edict of Emancipation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing but rosecolors , and we , of course , believe that Mr. Trollope 4elieves what he has written . He is none the less mistaken , if we are to pin our faith to the Blue Book , which we are told never lies . And yet , believing that emancipation has made a greater brute than ever of the negro , Mr. Trollope rejoices in the course which has been pursued by the home government . If both white man and black man are worse off than they were before , what good could have been derived from the reform , and by what right ought he to rejoice ? Mr. Trollope claims to be an anti-slavery man , but we must confess that to our way of arguing , the ground he stands upon in this matter is any thing but terra firma . Mr. Trollope was probably thinking of those dirty West-India negroes when he made the following comments upon a lecture delivered by Wendell Phillips : I have sometimes thought that there is no being so venomous , so bloodthirsty , as a professed philanthropist ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ward , it then assumes the deepest die of venom and bloodthirstiness . There are four millions of slaves in the Sonthern States , none of whom have any capacity for self-maintenance or self- control . Four millions of slaves , with the necessities of children , with thc passions of men , and the ignorance of savages ! And Mr. Phillips would emancipate these at a blow ; would , were it possible for him to do so , set them loose upon the soil to tear their masters , destroy each other , and make such a hell upon earth has never even yet come from the uncontrolled passions and unsatisfied wants of men . ' Mr. Trollope should have thought twice before he wrote thus of the American negro . Were he a competent authority on this subject , his opinion might be worth something ; but as he never traveled in the South , and as his knowledge of the negro is limited to a surface acquaintance with the West-Indies , we maintain that Mr. Trollope has not only been unj ust , but ungenerous . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for self- maintenance or self-control ! Whom are we to believe ? Mr. Trollope , who has nevcr been on a Southern plantation , or Frederick Law Olmsted ? Mr. Pierce , who has been superintendent of the contrabands at Fortress Monroe and at Hilton Head , officers attached to Burnside 's Division , and last and best , General David Hunter , an officer of the regular army , who went to South- Carolina with anti - abolition antecedents ? All honor to General Hunter , who , unlike many others , has not shut his eyes upon facts , and , like a rational being , has yielded to the logic of events . It is strange that these authoritice , all of whom possess the confi // dence of the Government , should disagree with Mr. Trollope . None selfmaintaining ? Robert Small is a pure negro . Is he not more than self-maintaining ? Has he not done more for the Federal Government than any white man of the Gulf States ? Tillman is a negro ; the best pilots of the South are negroes : are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves to her hospitable doors , not as paupers , but as laborers , who have taken the place of those white men who have gone to fight the battles which they also should be allowed to take part in . The women have been gladly accepted as house - servants . Does not this look like self-maintenance ? Would negroes be employed in the army if they were as Mr. Trollope pictures them ? He confesses that without these four millions of slaves the South would be a wilderness , therefore they do work as slaves to the music of the slave-drivers ' whip . How very odd , that the moment men and women ( for Mr. Trollope does acknowledge them to be such ) own themselves , and are paid for the sweat of their brow , they should Korget the trades by which they have erkiched the South , and become incapable of maintaining themselves - they who have maintained three hundred and fifty thousand insolent slave-owners ! Given whip-lashes and the incubus of a white family , the slave will work ; given freedom and wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated a more palpable fallacy ? Is it necessary to declare further that the Hilton Head experiment is a success , although the negroes , wanting in slave-drivers and in their musical instruments , began their planting very late in the season ? Is it necessary to give Mr. Trollope one of many figures , and prove that in the British West-India colonies free labor has exported two hundred and sixty-five millions pounds of sugar annually , whereas slave labor only exported one hundred and eightyseven millions three hundred thousand ? and this in a climate where , unlike even the Southern States of North-America , there is every inducement to indolence . Four millions of slaves , none of whom are capable of self-control , who possess the necessities of children , the passions of men , and the ignorance of savages ! We really have thought that the many thousands of these four millions who have come under the Federal jurisdiction , exercised considerable self-control , when it is remembered that in some localities they have been left entire masters of themselves , have in other instances labdred months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had that pay prove a delusion . Certainly it is fair to judge of a whole by a part . Given a bone , Professor Agassiz can draw the animal of which the bone forms a part . Given many thousands of negroes , we should be able to judge somewhat of four millions . Had Mr. Trollope seen the thousands of octoroons and quadroons enslaved in the South by their own fathers , it would have been more just in him to have attributed a want of self-control to the masters of these four millions . We do not know what Mr. Trollope means by the necessities of children . ' Children need to be sheltered , fed , and clothed , and so do the negroes , but here the resemblance ends ; for whereas children can not take care of themselves , the negro can , provided there is any opportunity to work . It is scarcely to be doubted that temporary distress must arise among fugitives in localities where labor is not plenty ; but does this establish the black man 's incapacity ? Revolutions , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distress to laborers . Then we are told that the slaves are endowed with the passions of men ; and very glad are we to know this , for , as a love of liberty and a willingness to sacrifice all things for freedom , is one of the loftiest passions in men , were he devoid of this passion , we should look with much less confidence to assistance from the negro in this war of freedom versus slavery , than we do at present . In stating that // the slaves are as ignorant as savages , Mr. Trollope pays an exceedingly poor compliment to the Southern whites , as it would naturally be supposed that constant contact with a superior race would have civilized the negro to a certain extent , especially as he is known to be wonderfully imitative . And such is the case ; at least the writer of these lines , who has been born and bred in a slave State , thinks so . As a whole , they compare very favorably with the poor white trash , ' and individually they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they can not read or write , not from want of aptitude or desire , as the teachers among the contrabands write that their desire to read amounts to a passion , in many cases , even among the hoary-headed , but because the teaching of a slave to read or write was , in the good old times before the war , regarded and punished as a criminal offense . What a pity it is that we can not go back to the Union as it was ! In this ignorance of the rudiments of learning , the negroes are not unlike a large per percentage of the populations of Great Britain and Ireland . And Mr. Phillips would let these ignorant savages loose upon the soil to tear their masters , * ? estroy each other , and make such a hell upon earth as has never even yet come from the uncontrolled passions and unsatisfied wants of men ! ' If Mr. Trollope were read in the history of emancipation , he would know that there has not been an instance of such a hell upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a singularly docile , affectionate , and goodnatured creature , not at all given to destroying his kind or tearing his master , and the least inclined to do these things at a time when there is no necessity for them . A slave is likely to kill his mas ter to gain his freedom , but he is not fond enough of murder to kill him when no object is to be gained except a halter . The record so far proves that the masters have shot down their slaves rather than have them fall into the hands of the Union troops . Even granting Mr. Trollope 's theory of the negro disposition , no edict of emancipation could produce such an effect as he predicts , to the masters , at least . They , in revenge , might shoot down their slaves , but , unfortunately , the victims would be unable to defend themselves , from the fact that all arms are sedulously kept from them . The slaves would run away in greater numbers than they do at present , would give us valuable information of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if permitted , and kill their rebel masters in the legal and honorable way of war . It is likely that Mr. Trollope , holding the black man in so little estimation , would doubt his abilities in this capacity . Fortunately for us , we can quote as evidence in our favor from General Hunter 's late letter to Congress , which , for sagacity and elegant sarcasm , is unrivaled among American state papers . General Hunter , after stating that the loyal slaves , unlike their fugitive masters , welcome him , aid him , and supply him with food , labor , and information , working with remarkable industry , ' concludes by stating that the experiment of arming the blacks , so far as I have made it , has been a complete and even marvelous success . They are sober , docile , attentive , and enthusiastic , displaying great natural capacity for acquiring the duties of the soldier . They are eager beyond all things to take the field and be led into action , and it is the unanimous opinion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peculiarities of this climate and country , they will prove invaluable auxiliaries , fully equal to the similar regiments so long and successfully used by the British authorities in the West-India Islands . In conclusion , I would say that it is my hope , there appearing no possibility of other reinforcements , owing to the exigencies of the campaign on the peninsula , to have organized by the end of next fall , and to be able to present to the Government , from forty- eight to fifty thousand of these hardy and devoted soldiers . ' Mr. Trollope declares that without the // slaves the South would be a wilderness ; he also says that the North is justified in the present war against the South , and although he doubts our ability to attain our ends in this war , he would be very glad if we were victorious . If these are his opinions , and if further , he considers slavery to be the cause of the war , then why in the name of commonsense does he not advocate that which would bring about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probability of emancipation in Missouri , Kentucky , and Virginia , and yet rather than that abolition should triumph universally , he would have the Gulf States go off by themselves and sink into worse than South - American insignificance , a curse to themselves from the very reason of slavery . This , to our way of thinking , is vastly more cruel to the South than even the hell upon earth , ' which , supposing it were possible , emancipation would create . A massacre could affect but one generation : such a state of things as Mr. Trollope expects to see would poison numberless generations . The Northern brain is gradually ' ridding itself of mental fog , begotten by Southern influences , and Mr. Trollope will not live to see the Gulf States sink into a moral Dismal Swamp . The day is not far distant when a God-fearing and justice-loving people will give these States their choice between Emancipation and death in their last ditch , ' which we suppose to be the Gulf of Mexico . Repulses before Richmond only hasten this end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trollope . Has martial law no virtue ? We object to the title , An Apology for the War , ' which Mr. Trollope has given to one of his chapters ; and with the best of motives , he takes great pains to prove to the English *public how we of the North could not but fight the South , however losing a game it might be . No true American need beg pardon of Europe for this war , which is the only apology we can make to civilization for slavery . Mr. Trollope states the worn-out cant that the secessionists of the South have been aided and abet ted by the fanatical abolitionism of the North . Of course they have : had there been no slavery , there would have been no abolitionists , and therefore no secessionists . Wherever there is a wrong , there are always persons fanatical enough to cry out against that wrong . In time , the few fanatics become the majority , and conquer the wrong ,  --  to the infinite disgust of the easy-going present , but to the gratitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican party , and of course the triumph of the Republican party was the father to secession ; but we see no reason to mourn that it was so ; rather do we thank God that the struggle has come in our day . We can not sympathize with Mr. Trollope when he says of the Bell and Everett party : Their express theory was this : that the question of slavery should not be touched . Their purpose was to crush agitation , and restore harmony by an impartial balance between the North and South : a fine purpose - the finest of all purposes , had it been practicable . ' We suppose by this , that Mr. Trollope wishes such a state of things had been practicable . The impartial balance means the Crittenden Compromise , whose impartiality the Norm fails to see in any other light than a fond leaning to the South , giving it all territory South of a certain latitude , a latitude that never was intended by the Constitution . It seems to us that there can be no impartial balance between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right , or they sin before God . Mr. Trollope tells us that the South is secedinig from the North because the two are not homogeneous . They have different instincts , . different appetites , different morals , and a different culture . It is well for one man to say that slavery has caused the separation , and for another to say that slavery has not caused it . Each in so saying speaks the truth . Slavery has caused it , seeing that slavery is the great point on which the two have agreed to differ . But slavery has not caused it , seeing that other points of // difference are to be found in every circumstance and feature of the two , people . The North and the South must ever be dissimilar . In the North , labor will always be honorable , and because honorable , successfuL In the South , labor has ever been servile - at least in some sense - and therefore dishonorable ; and because dishonorable , has not , to itself been successful . ' Is not this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South . Why ? Because labor is honorable in the former , and dishonorable , because of its servility , in the latter . The servility removed , in what are the two dissimilar ? One third of the Southern whites are related by marria.ge to the North ; a second third are Northerners , and it is this last third that are most violent in their acts against and hatred of the North . They were born with our instincts and appetites , educated in the same morals , and received the same culture ; and these men are no worse than some of their brothers who , though they have not emigrated to the South , have yet fattened upon cotton . The parents of Jefferson Davis belonged to Connecticut ; Slidell is a New-Yorker ; Benjamin is a Northerner ; General Loyell is a disgrace to Massachusetts ; so , too , is Albert Pike . It is utter nonsense to say that we are two *people . Two interests have been at work - free labor and slave labor ; and when the former triumphs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor will the refrain of agriculture versus manufacture be sung . The South , especially Virginia , has untold wealth to be drained from her great water - power . New - England will not be alone in manufacturing , nor Pennsylvania in mining . We think that Mr. Trollope fails to appreciate principle when he lik*s the conflict between the two section* of our country to a quarrel between Mr. and Mrs. Jones , in which a mutual friend ( England ) is , from the very nature of the case , obliged to maintain neutrality , leaving the matter to the tender care of Sir Creswell Creswell . There never yet existed a mutual friend who , however little he interfered with a matrimonial difference , did not , in sympathy and moral support , take violent sides with one of the combatants ; and Mr. Trollope would be first in taking up the cudgels against private wrong . The North has never wished for physical aid from England ; but does Mr. Trollope remember what Mrs. Browning has so nobly and humanely written ? Non - intervention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue ; but non-intervention does not mean passing by on the other side when your neighbor falls among thieves , or Phariseeism would recover it from Christianity . ' England , the greatest of actual nations , had a part to act in our war , and that part a noble one . Not the part of physical intervention for the benefit of Lancashire and of a confederacy founded upon slavery , which both Earl Russell and Lord Palmerston inform the world will not take place at present . ' Not the part of hypercriticism and misconstruction of Northern Orders , ' and affectionate blindness to Southern atrocities . But such a part as was worthy of the nation , one of whose greatest glories is that it gave birth to a Clarkson , a Sharpe , and a Wilberforce . And England has much to answer for , in that she has been found wanting , not in the cause of the North , but in the cause of humanity . Had she not always told us that we were criminals of the deepest dye not to do what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always held out to the world the beacon - light of emancipation , there could be little censure cast upon the British ermine ; but having laid claim to so white and moral a robe , she subjects herself to the very proper indignation of the anti- slavery party which now governs the North . Mr. Trollope confesses that British sympathy is with the South , and further writes : It seems to me that some of us never tire in abusing the Americans and calling them names , for having allowed themselves to be driven into this civil war . We tell them that they are fools and idiots ; we speak of their doings as though there had been some plain // course by which the war might have been avoided ; and we throw it in their teeth that they have no capability for war , ' etc. , etc . Contact with the English abroad sent us home convinced of English animosity , and this was before the Trent affair . A literary woman writes to America : There is only one person to whom I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England , they say I have lived so long in Itcdy that I have J*ecome and American . ' We have had nothing but abuse from the En0lish press always , excepting a few of the liberal journals . Mill and Bright and Cobden alone have been prominent in their expression of good - will to the North . And this is Abolition England ! History will record , that at the time when America was convulsed by the inevitable struggle between Freedom and Slavery , En*land , actuated by selfish motives , withheld that moral support and righteous counsel which would have deprived the South of much aid and comfort , brought the war to a speedier conclusion , gained the grateful . confidence of the anti slavery North , and immeasurably . aided the abolition of human slavery . It may be said that we of the North have no intention of touching the institution , ' and therefore England can not sympathize with us . Whatever the theory of the administration at Washington may have been , he is insane as well as blind who does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of time , this tendency would have been much farther on the road to right had the strong arm of England wielded the moral power which should belong to it . Mr. Trollope says : The complaint of Americans is , that they have received no sympathy from England ; but it seems to me that a great nation should not require an expression of sympathy during its struggle . Sympathy is for the weak , not for the strong . When I hear two powerful men contending together in argument , I do not sympathize with him who has the best of it ; but I watch the precision of his logic , and acknowledge confess , ' wrote Mrs. Browning - dead the effects of his rhetoric . There has been a whining weakness in the complaints made by Americans against England , which has done more to lower them , as a people , in my judgment , than any other part of their conduct during the present crisis . ' It is true that at the beginning of this war the North did show a whining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hoped we have been thoroughly cured . We paid our mother-land too high a compliment - we gave her credit for virtues which she does not possess - and the disappointment incurred thereby has been bitter in the extreme . We were not aware , however , that a sincere desire for sympathy was an American peculiarity . We have long labored under the delusion that the English , even , were very indignant with Brother Jonathan during the Crimean war , when he failed to furnish the quota of sympathy which our cousins considered was their due , but which we could not give to a debauched sick man ' whom , for the good of civilization , we wished out of the world as quickly as possible . But Enggland was strong ; ' why should she have desired sympathy ? For , according to Mr. Trollope 's creed , the weak alone ought to receive sympathy . It seems to be a matter entirely independent of right and wrong with Mr. Trollope . It is sufficient for a man to prove his case to . be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponent . Demonstrate your weakness , whether it be physical , moral , or mental , and Mr. Trollope will fight your battles for you . On this principlewhich , we are told , is English - the exiled princes of Italy , especially the Neapolitan-Bourbon , the Pope , Austria , and of course the Southern confederacy , should find their warmest* sympathizers among true Britons , and perhaps* they do ; but Mr. Trollope , in spite of his theory , is not one of them . The emancipationist should not look to England for aid or comfort , but it will be none the worse for England that she has been false to her traditions . I // qwq than guilty , when even now a Senator of the United States stands convicted of a miserable betrayal of his office ? Will America heed the voice of Europe , as well as of her best friends at home , before it is too late ? Again writes Mr. Trollope : It is better to have little governors than great governors , ' an American said to me once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live without having great men over us to rule us . ' That glory , if ever it were a glory , has come to an end . It seems to me that all these troubles have come upon the States because they have not placed high men in high places . ' Is there a thinking American who denies the truth of this ? And of our code of honesty - that for which Englishmen are most to be commended-what is truly said of us ? It is not by foreign voices , by English newspapers , or in French pamphlets , that the corruption of American politicians has been exposed , but by American voices and by the American press . It is to be heard on every side . Ministers of the Cabinet , Senators , Representatives , State Legislatures , officers of the army , officials of the navy , contractors of every grade-all who are presumed to touch , or to have the power of touching , public money , are thus accused The leaders of the rebellion are hated in the North . The names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are mentioned with execration by the very children . This has sprung from a true and noble feeling ; from a patriotic love of national greatness , and a hatred of those who , for small party purposes , have been willing to lessen the name of the United States . But , in addition to this , the names of those also should be execrated who have robbed their country when pretending to serve it ; who have taken its wages in the days of its great struggle , and at the same time have filched from its coffers ; who have undertaken the task of steering the ship through the storm , in order that their hands might be deep in the meal - tub and the bread - basket , and that they might stuff their own sacks with the ship 's provisions . These are the men who must be loathed by the nation - whose fate must be held up as a warning to others-before good can come . ' How long are the American people to allow this pool of iniquity to stagnate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 0 Lord ! how long ? On the subject of education , Mr. Trollope-though indulging in a little pleasantry on young girls who analyze Milton - does us full justice . The one matter in which , as far as my judgment goes , the people of the United States have excelled us Englishmen , so as to justify them in taking to themselves praise which we can not take to ourselves or refuse to them , is the matter of edu cation The coachman who drives you , the man who mends your window , the boy who brings home your purchases , the girl who stitches your wife 's dress - they all carry with them sure signs of education , and show it in every word they utter . ' But much as Mr. Trollope admires our system of public schools , he does not see much to extol in the at least Western way of rearing children . I must protest that American babies are an unhappy race . They eat and drink just as they please ; they are never punished ; they are never banished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children are kept with us ; and yet they are wretched and uncomfortable . My heart has bled for them as I have heard them squalling , by the hour together , in agonies of discontent and dyspepsia . ' This is the type of child found by Mr. Trollope on Western steamboats ; and we agree with him that beef-steaks , with piclcle8 , produce a bad type of child ; and it is unnecessary to confess to Mr. Trollope what he already knows , that pertness and irreverence to parents are the great faults of American youth . No doubt the pickles have much to do with this state of things . While awarding high praise to American women en ma8se , Mr. Trollope mourns over the condition of the Western women with whom he came in // contact , and we are sorry to think that these specimens form the rule , though of course exceptions are very numerous . A Western American man is not a talking man . He will sit for hours over a stove , with his cigar in his mouth and his hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A dozen will sit together in the same way , and there shall not be a dozen words spoken between them in an hour . With the women , one 's chance of conversation is still worse . It seemed as though the cares of this world had been too much for them They were generally hard , dry , and melancholy . I am speaking , of course , of aged females , from five-and-twenty , perhaps , to thirty , who had long since given up the amusements and levities of life . ' Mr. Trollope 's malediction upon the women of NewYork whom he met in the street-cars , is well merited , so far as many of them are concerned ; but he should bear in mind the fact that these many are foreigners , mostly uneducated natives of the British isles . Inexcusable as is the advantage which such women sometimes take of American gallantry , the spirit of this gallantry is none the less to be commended , and the grateful smile of thanks from American ladies is not so rare as Mr. Trollope imagines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rude women may learn a better appreciation of this gallantry by its abolition in flagrant cases only . Had Mr. Trollope once learned the ways ' of New - York stages , he would not have found them such vile conveyances ; but we quite agree with him in ' advocating the introduction of cabs . In seeing nothing but vulgarity in Fifth Avenue , and a thirst for gold all over New-York City , we think Mr. Trollope has given way to prejudice . There is no city so generous in the spending of money as New - York . Art and literature find their best patrons in this much-abused Gotham ; and it will not do for one who lives in a glass house to throw stones , for we are not the only nation of shopkeepers . We do not blame Mr. Trollope , however , for giving his love to Boston , and to the men and women of intellect who have homes in and about Boston . We are of opinion that Mr. Trollope is too severe upon our hotels ; for faulty though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those of any other country , if we are to believe our own experience and that of the majority of travelers . Mr. Trollope sees no use of a ladics ' parlor ; but Mr. Trollope would soon see its indispensability were he to travel as an unprotected female of limited means . On the matter of the Post - Office , however , he has both our ears ; and much that he says of our government , and the need of a constitutional change in our Constitution , dcserves attention - likewise what he says of colonization . We do elevate unworthy persons to the altar of heroism , and are stupid in our blatant eulogies . It is sincerely to be regretted that so honest a writer did not devote two separate chapters to the important subjects of drunkenness and artificial heat , which , had he known us better , he would have known were undermining the American *kysigue . He does treat passingly of our hot-houses , but seems not to have faced the worse evil . Of our literature , and of our absorption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ; and in his plea for a national copyright , he might have further argued its necessity , from the fact that American publishers will give no encouragement to unknown native writers , however clever , so long as they can steal the brains of Great Britain . To conclude . We like Mr. Trollope 's book , for we believe him when he says : I have endeavored to judge without prejudice , and to hear with honest ears , and to see with honest eyes . ' We have the firmest faith in Mr. Trollope 's honesty . We know he has written nothing that he does not conscientiously believe , . and he has given unmistakable evidence of his good-will to this country . We are lost in amazement when he tells us : I know I shall never again be at Boston , and that I have said that about the // Americans which would make me unwelcome as a guest if I were there . ' Said what ? We should be thin-skinned , indeed , did we take umbrage at a book written in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Americans who are interested in it are agreeably disappointed in the verdict which he has given of them ; and though they may not accept his political opinions , they are sensible enough to appreciate the right of each man to his honest convictions . Mr. Trollope , though he sees in our future not two , but three , confederacies , predicts a great destiny for the North . We can see but a union of all - a Union cemented by the triumph of freedom . in the abolition of that which has been the taint upon the nation . If Mr. Trollope 's prophecies are fulfilled , ( and God forbid ! ) it will be because we have allowed the golden hour to escape . Pleased as we are with Mr. Trollope the writer-who has not failed to appreciate the selfsacrifice of Northern patriotism - Mr. Trollope the man has a far greater hold upon our heart ; a hold which has been strengthened , rather than weakened , by his book . The friends of Mr. Trollope extend to him their cordial greeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand to the writer of North - America , whenever he chooses to take that hand again .
