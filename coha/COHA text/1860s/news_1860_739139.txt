txt The position of being between the upper and nether millstone has long been proverbially unpleasant . Perhaps new forms of old ideas are all that we can expect in these days . Certainly , that idea remains the same , when put into the shape of being " between a Collector and a District-Attorney , " au instance of which our readers will find in. our taw reports this morning . It seems that . in January last , a nun of this City imported a lot of plate-glass , of which they made entry at the Customhouse , valuing it at about $4,400 . The . Custom-house appraisers raised its value to upwards of $7,000 . This appraisement was naturally distasteful to the importers , who appealed from it , and on a new appraisal , by merchant appraisers , it was cut down to about $5,400 , and , thereupon , the Collector , in April ? for all these proceedings had taken ? some time  --  instituted a suit to forfeit the glass for undervaluation . This suit , of course , was brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being desirous of having their goods to use in their business , applied to the District-Attorney , stating that they wished to give bonds for the value of the goods and . tape them , and would fix the value at either of the appraised values , as he should choose . " Oh , no , " says the District-Attorney , " I do n't know an thing about those appraisements . You must have new appraisers appointed by the Court , under the statute , to get at the amount for - which you must give bonds . So , after some further delay the new appraisers were appointed by the Court , and they fixed the value at about $4,200 , being less than the invoice value . For this amount , then , the importers gave their bonds , and then went to the collector to pay him the duties , and take their goods . " Oh , no , " says the collector , " I do n't know anything about that Court appraisement , and I wo n't take your duties , nor let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of the highest of my appraisements . " The importers thereupon apply to the Court to help them , but the Court says , " I have no power to give you your goods unless you furnish a certificate from the Collector that you have paid your duties , and if the Collector wo n't give you one , I ca n't make him . Your ease seems to be hard , but the act has not given me the power . " What is an importer to do la such a case Certainly such an arbitrary exercise of power does not exactly consist with our republican ideas . The Collector might as well have required bonds in five times the appraised value of the goods as in the amount he did . That officers of the Government who apply to the Courts to aid them in enforcing the laws , should refuse to be governed themselves by the laws , which relate to the wocecdings in Courts , and shield themselves behind the lack of power in the Courts over them , can not but have an injurious effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to authority . Publie op'nion should be prompt to follow with condemnation every such arbitrary and oppressive act on the part of a public servant which is made known , not only for itself , but because every such one is pretty surely one of a class : nine out of ten of which remain unknown . The victhns are slow to make their difficulties public , because they are at the mercy of the official who may grind them with more harshness even the next time they come within his reach . But this makes it all the more necessary for the Press to call the public attention to such cases when they come before it .
