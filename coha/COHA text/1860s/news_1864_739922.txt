txt On Jan. 26 , Hon. JOHN BRIGHT addressed his constituents at Birmingham  --  making the first speech that he has delivered since the famous Cobden-Delane controversy . Mr. SCHOLEPIELD , M. P. , of the same borough , preceded Mr. BRIGHT , and said , in the source of his speech on America , that the present war was not a war for the emancipation of the slaves , as d if it were , it was not the less on that account an moral and unjustifiable war . Cheers and hisses . The preservation of the Union was the great idea which pervaded the minds of the Northerners , from the President downward . The President on one oc ? asion declared : " My promised object in this strugfreeing was to save the Union . Cheers . Without freeing any slave I would do it ; and it I could save it by treeing all the slaves , I would ; and it I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone , I would do that . What I would do about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it helps to Save the Union . " Cheers . After such an expresdon of opinion he was surprised to hear people say *at the object of the President was to put down Slavery . L " Hear , hear , " and marks of disapprobation . ) The proclamation emancipating the slaves was issued by the President solely as a war measure to crush the rebellion and restore the Union . lie believed that it was impossible to restore the Union by war . Cheers and uproar . If this was a war for the emancipation of the stale , then he said most emvhatfealty that It was an immoral war . If it was morally Tight in America to put down Slavery in that country , It was equally morally right for this country to snake war upon Spain to put down Slavery in Cuba , upon Russia to put down serfdom , or upon the Mug of Dahomey to put down infanticide . Cheers , Hisses and great uproar . He had never been an advocate for peace at any price , but ke had always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An aggressive war was to his mind a great crime , and would never meet with his sanction and assent . He was told that he was blamed clot so much for the opinions he had expressed in 1862 , but for having joined a Confederate association . Me thought he should have been more open to condemnation it after expressing his views he had not had the courage to carry them out : He was told that in consequence of the course he had taken he would lose his seat . Deeply as he valued the honor they bad conferred upon him , there was something he valued still more highly than a seat in Parliament , and that was the right to speak and act freely and Independently within the scope of the powers with which they themselves had intrusted him . If for the course he : tad taken they deemed bun no longer worthy of representing them , he should bow to their decision without a murmur . Loud cheers . Mr. BRIGHT was introduced after Mr. SCHOLEFIELD bad closed , and was received with overwhelming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend , ng to say no single word as to the question between North and South in the United States . My opinion is that the unanimous ssidgment of the people of England , so far as that is suer shown on any public occasion , is in favor of the course which Her Majesty 's Government have publicly declared it to be their intention to pursue . Gi eat cheering . I believe that my honorable friend is mistaken in the view which he takes of the meaning and of the result of what he called the recognition of the South . Cheers . I nave seen it stated by authority , North as well as South , and by authority which I may term English , and by authority from Prance , that In the present condition of the quarrel , recognition by all the usages of nations must necessarily lead to something more cheers ; and , therefore , although there were DO question of Slavery , although it were simply a political revolt , and that there were no special moral question connected with it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country with regard to the rebellion of the Greeks against the Turks , and with regent to the revolt of the Colonies of South America against Spain , that it can be demonstrated that these cases afford no support whatever to the argument that we are permitted to recognize the South , and that if such recognition did take , lace now it could only czar . prate still more the terrible strife which exists on the North American continent , and would spread that strife over Europe iCheers . Now . I am myself of opinion , and have been from the first , that the people of America , so numerous , so powerful , so instructed , so capable in every way , wont ( ' settle the difficulties of that continent without asking the old countries of Europe to take any Share in them . I believe that In the providence of the Supreme , the slaveholder , unMorel and unreachable by fact or argument , or Chris . : ta- precept , has been permuted to commit will not call it the crime , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LINCOLN will be in favor of abolition , whether the North are unanimous against Slavery , whatever may be said or thought with regard to the transactions on that continent , he must be deaf and blind , and worse than deaf and blind , who does not perceive that through the instrumentality of this strife , that most odious and most indescribable offence against man and against Heaven , the slavery and bondage of four millions of our fellowereatices , is coming to a certain and rapid end . Loud Cheers . ) Sir , I will say of this question that I look forward to the time when I shall stand on this Platform with my honorable colleague , and when he will join with tree  --  for he is honest enough and frank enough to do that  --  when he will join with me in rejoicing that there does not breathe a slave on the North-American continent , loud cheers , that the Union has been comeletely restored , and not less will he rejoice that England did not in the remotest manner , spa word or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the settling of a Question , do one tingle thing to promote the atrocious object of the leaders of this accursed insurrection . Continued cheering . ) Mr. BRIGHT then stated the facts in the cobdenDelane controversy , and remarked : I w undertake to say , if there be two men in England who have more constantly and more earnestly for twenty-five years preached the doctrine of absolute honesty , with regard to legislation , those two men are Mr. COBDEN and myself ; cheers ; but when Mr. CossaN came forward to assail Mr. DELAYS with regard to this charge against me , he found a man in a mask endeavoring to stab me in the back , for he had not seen that the same man had been in the previous article also stabbing him , and he came forward aim dragged his mask from him , and showed him with whatever lineaments he is distinguished to the gaze of the whole nation and the whole world . After denial and equivocation of every kind , this unmasked editor of this great journal was obliged to retke from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the anonymous , which sults him better . Laughter and cheers . ) Weithnr Mr. COBMIN nor I have ever said .. sorlDIAn to show that ? we shallow it daeivaota Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner . to abolish by force of law anonymous writing In our newspapers ; but Mr. COBDEN laments , as I do , and as you all do , that the anonymous system inevitably 113 a shelter for a man who has no sense of honor . I recollect a description which will suit Mr. DELANE admirably . It was published some time ago in the City of New-York , and describes a notorious politician there , who , if I am not mistaken , has been at the elbow of the New-York correspondent of the Times for the last twelve months , with what happy success to the forecast and honesty of that paner we all know . It was said of him that he was a just man and a righteous , and he walked uprightly before the world ; but when he was not before the world his walk was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Times newspaper , notwithstanding all this , is a power in this country , hear , hear , and a power in Europe . No man laments more than I do that so much power should be associated with what I call a godless intellect and a practical atheism . No one laments more than I do that a paper that was once great in its independence has become now  --  what shall I say ? ? domesticated , for the editor of the nines is now domesticated in the houses of Cabinet Ministers and members of high families in London . He has learnt now in this day , when that paper might have been more useful than ever , to fetch and carry for Cambridge-houseaaughter and cheers , and , Sir , for aught I know , looking to what is said in the clubs in London of the dispensation of patronage to men who have been writers'in that journal , I am not sure , unless what I say now may make it difficult , that some day or other Mr. WALTER , the proprietor or chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the House of Peers as a compensation for the services offered to the present Prime Minister of England . Then after reviewing the land question at **25;32;TOOLONG , Mr. BRIGuT referred as follows to this ? " America , though 8,000 miles off , is not so far off but that people may go over there in about 12 days , and they may go there for a sum varying from ? 2 to ? 5 . During the year that has just passed I think 150,000 or 160,000 persons have sailed from this country to New-York . Bravo and cheers . Every man who settles tt ere is not blinaed by the mystifications and falsehoods of the New-York correspondent of The Times . Cneers . He is there and can see what the working man gets , how he is considered , and what he is , and he writes over to his friends in this country , as has been the case for years in Ireland , and the result has been that Ireland has been drained , not of its surplus population . but of the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheers . ) Now let me tell you a fact , and if you do n't treasure it up in your minds , hope one of those gentlemen , the landowners , who , think I am very hostile to them , will just think it over , if he has time , as he eats his breakfast to-morrow or next day . Laughter . ) In America there are at this moment 140,000 , - 000 acres of land , surveyed , mapped . set apart for those who are ready to settle upon them . In the year 1861 ? that was the first year after this war attained Its present proportions  --  there were not less than 40,000 new farms , over 80 acres each , occupied in the Western States ; but the Government of the United States , not content with that measure of progress , passed an act , which came into operation on the 1st of January , 1863 , which was called " The Homestead Act . " I have a copy of the act here , and I have a copy also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is that Homestead Act ? It is this . It says that any man or woman of twenty-one years of age , or younger , if the man happened to have been for a fortnight or a month in the service of the United States , whether in the army or navy , may go into these territories , may choose what is called a " section , " which is 160 acres of land , being one-fourth of a square mile , and on payment of a fee of $10 , which is eaual to ? 2 , English , he ' nay apply and have this land conveyed to him for no other payment for five years . It can not be alienated . He is not allowed to sell it . It remains in his possession , and at the end of five years , he having done to it Iv Sat the Government requires  --  that is , settled ' , ion it  --  and began cultivation and so forth , then the law raves him what is called a patent , but which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is absolute freehold for ever . Cheers , Now , it could riot take more than ? 15 for a man logo from Birmingham to the territory where this land is to be . disposed of . If he had not got any money by which he could take up the 160 acres , and begin to cultivate it , if he would engage himself a neighboring farmer he would get , I believe , now about 20s. per week wares , besines his board and lodgings , and if he worked as a laborer for two or three years he would be able to save a small sum sufficient for him to commence the cultivation of a portion of this farm , and he would be settled down there as a farmer and as a freeholder of his own . Loud cheers . Now , do n't let me leave you with the idea that there is no rough and rugged career in this . But there is a good deal of that sort in this country Pow . Cheers . When a man looks upon those children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . roy  --  when he thinks what those boys and girls must be in this country , never to rise one step higher than that which he occupies now as an agricultural laborer , and then looks abroad and sees them not taborer. , in the sense that we use the word here  --  not tenants even , but freeholders and land-owners and farmers of their own property . Then , I say , dirt the temptation held out to men tare to Emigrate , if we knew all the facts , would be irresistible to hundreds and thousands who have now no thought of moving to another country . Even the agricultural labofer is not as he once was in some respects . There are some feeble efforts made to give him a little instruction . There are newspapers published at a price which was at one time deemed impossible . They find their way into the agricultural villages , and the laborers will gradually begin to open their eyes , and to see that a change of their position is not so impossible as they once thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States offer more ? Theo offer social equality . They offer political equality . They offer to every child of every man into whose face I ant now looking education from the very learning of his alphabet up to , if he has the capacity to travel so tar , the highest knowledge of classics and mathematics which is offered to the best students in Colleges of this country ; and all that without the Payment of one single farthing except the general payment to which all ' the people participate In the school rate of the various States of the Union . Well , now , I ask you if I am wrong in saying to the rich and to the great what I believe , if they knew their own interest , it would be worth their while to try to make this country a more dosirable one for the poor to live in . Cheers . ) If tney disregard this great question , we , who are of the middle class , or not absolutely powerless class , shall have to decide between the claims of territorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . tCheers , There are some men ? I meet them now and then , and I wonder where they were born and why they came into the world  --  who regard these territorial magnates as idols before whom we are all to bow down in humble submission . I think travelers toll us that there is a tribe in Africa so given up to superstition that they fill their huts and hovels with so many idols that they do not leave room for their families . It may he so in this country  --  that we build up a system which is detrimental to our political freedom and is destructive of the best interests of the great mass of our producing and working classes . Cheers . Now am I the enemy of any class it I come for ward to state facts like these , and to explain principles such as these ? Shall we go groping continually in the dark and making no effort to strengthen our position ? Do n't suppose because I stand here I love to find fault with the laws of my country rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less patriotic , or that I have less sympathy with my country and my countrymen , than other men have . ( Cheers . ) I want our country to be populous , to be powerful , and to be happy , but this end can only be attained , a ' I never has been attained in any country , but lust laws , justly administered . I plead only for what I believe to be just . I wish to do wrong to no man . For twenty-five years I have stood before audiences , great meetings of my countrymen , plead4ng only for justice . Loud cheers , During that time , as you know , I have endueed measureless insults , and have passea through hurricanes of abuse . I need not tell you that my clients have not generally been the rich and the great , but rte her the poor and the lowly hear , hear ) ; they can not give me place , and dignities and wealth , bat their honorable service yields me that which is of far higher and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and upholding laws which , though they were not given amid the thunders of Sinai , are not less the commandments of God , and not less Intended to promote and secure the happiness of men . " The Hon. gentleman resumed his seat amid great cheering . A vote of thanks to Mr. SCUOLEPIELD and 31r . BRIOnT Was subsequently carried , and the proceedings were brought to a termination at 1034 o'clock .
