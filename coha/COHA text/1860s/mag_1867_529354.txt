txt AMONG THE WORKERS IN SILVER . E XCURSIONISTS to Lake Superior , when they get away up in the northern part of Lake Huron , where are those " four thousand islands " lying flat and green in the sun , without a tree or a hut upon them , see at length , in the distance , a building like a large storehouse , evidently not made by Indian hands . The thing is neither rich nor rare ; the only wonder is , how it got there . For many hours before coming in sight of this building , no sign of human life is visible , unless , perchance , the joyful passengers catch sight of a dug-out canoe , with a blanket for a sail , in which an Indian fisherman sits solitary and motionless , as though he too were one of the inanimate features of the scene . On drawing near this most unexpected structure , the curiosity of the travellers is changed into wild wonder . It is a storehouse with all the modern improvements , and over the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JAM . If the present writer , when he first beheld this sign , had read thereon , " Opera-Glasses for hire , " or " Kid Gloves cleaned by a new and improved method , " he could not have been more surprised or more puzzled . The explanation , however , was very simple . Many years ago , it seems , a Yankee visiting that region discovered thousands upon thousands of- acres of raspberry-bushes hanging full of fruit , and all going to waste . He also observed that Indian girls and squaws in considerable numbers lived near by . Putting this and that together , he conceived the idea of a novel speculation . In the summer following he returned to the place , with a copper kettle , many barrels of sugar , and plenty of large stone jars . For one cent a pail he had as many raspberries picked as he could use ; and he kept boiling and jarring until he had filled all his vessels with jam , when he put them on board a sloop , took them down to Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the speculation being profitable , he returned every year to the raspberry country , and the business grew to an extent which warranted the erection of this large and well-appointed building . In the Western country , the raspberry jam made in the region of Lake Huron has been for twenty years an established article of trade . We had the curiosity once to taste tarts made of it , and can testify that it was as bad as heart could wish . It appeared to be a soggy mixture of melted brown sugar and small seeds . But that is neither here nor there . The oddity of our adventure was in discovering such an establishment in // such a place . Since that time we have often had similar surprises , especially in New England , where curious iuidustries have established themselves in the most out-of-the-way nooks . In a hamlet of three or four houses and a church , we see such signs as " Melodeon Manufactory . " At a town in Northern Vermont we find four hundred men busy , the year round , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple or a train of cars . There is nothing in St. johnsbury which marks it out as the town in the universe fittest to produce huge scales for mankind . The business exists there because , forty years ago , there were three excellent heads in the place upon the shoulders of three brothers , who put those heads together , and learned how to make and how to sell sc*iles . All over New England , industries have rooted themselves which appear to have no congruity with the places in which they are found . We heard the other day of a village in which are made every year three bushels of gold rings . We ourselves passed , some time ago , in a remarkably plain New England town , a manufactory of fine diamond jewelry . In another town - Providence - there are seventy-two manufactories of common jewelry . Now what is there in the character or in the situation of this city of Roger Williams , that should have invited thither so many makers of cheap trinkets ? It is a solid town , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than the average number of people capable of wearing tawdry ornaments . Nevertheless , along with machine-shops of Titanic tower , and cotton-mills of vast extent , we find these seventy-two manufactories of jewelry . The reason is , that , about the year 1795 , one man , named Dodge , prospered in Providence by making such jewelry as the simple people of those simple old times would buy of the passing pedler . His prosperity lured others into the business , until it has grown to its present proportions , and supplies half the country with the glittering trash which we all de spise upon others and love upon ourselves . But there is something at Providence less to be expected even than seventy-two manufactories of jewelry : it is the largest manufactory of solid silver-ware in the world ! In a city so elegant and refined as Providence , where wealth is so real and stable , we should naturally expect to find on the sideboards plenty of silver plate ; but we were unprepared to discover there three or four hundred skilful men making silver-ware for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - that of the Gorham Manufacturing Company . This is not only the largest concern of the kind in existence , but it is the most complete . Every operation of the business , from the melting of the coin out of which the ware is made , to the making of the packing-boxes in which it is conveyed to New York , takes place in this one congregation of buildings . Nor do we hesitate to say , after an attentive examination of the products of European taste , that the articles bearing the stamp of this American house are not equalled by those imported . There is a fine simplicity and boldness of outline about the forms produced here , together with an absence of useless and pointless ornament , which render them at once more pleasing and more useful than any others we have seen . It was while going over this interesting establishment , that the raspberryjam incident recurred to us . This thing , however , is both rich and rare ; and yet the wonder remains how it got there . It got there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there a business which has grown steadily to this day . It got there just as all the rooted businesses of New England got where we find them now . In the brief history of this one enterprise we may read the history of the industry of New England . Not the less , however , ought the detailed history to be written ; for it would be a book full of every kind of interest and instruction . // It was an honest man , we repeat , who founded this establishment . We believe there is no house of business of the first class in the world , of thirty years ' standing , the success of which is not clearly traceable to its serving the public with fidelity . An old clerk of Mr. A. T. Stewart of New York infoirmed us that , in the day of small things , many years ago , when Mr. Stewart had only a retail dry-goods store of moderate extent , one of the rules of the establishment was this : " Do n't recommend goods ; but never fall to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difficulties of a new business , who lays down a rule of that nature , must be either a very honest or a very able man . He is likely to be both , for sterling ability is necessarily honest . It is not surprising , therefore , that Mr. Stewart is now the monarch of the dry-goods trade in the world ; and we fully believe that the history of all lasting success would disclose a similar root of honesty . In all the businesses which have to do with the precious metals and precious stones , honesty is the prime necessity ; because in them , though it is the easiest thing in the world to cheat , the cheat is always capable of being detected and proved . A great silverhouse holds itself bound to take back an article of plate made forty years ago , if it is discovered that the metal is not equal in purity to the standard of the silver coin of the country in which it was made . The entire and perfect natural honesty , therefore , of J abez Gorham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house which he founded . He is now a serene and healthy man of eighty-two , long ago retired from business . He walks about the manufactory , mildly wondering at the extent to which its operations have extended . " It is grown past me , " he says with a smile ; " I know nothing about all this . " In the year 1805 , this venerable old man was an apprentice to that Mr. Dodge who began in Providence the manufacture of ear-rings , breastpins , and rings , - the only articles made by the Providence jewellers for many years . In due time Jabez Gorham set up for himself ; and he added to the list of articles the important item of watch-chains of a peculiar pattern , long known in New England as the " Gorham chain . " The old gentleman gives an amusing account of the simple manner in which business was done in those days . When he had manufactured a trunkful of jewelry , be would jog away with it to Boston , where , after depositing the trunk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewellers in the city to inform them of his arrival , and to say that his jewelry would be ready in his room for inspection on the following morning at ten o'clock , and not before . Before the appointed hour every jeweller in the town would be at his door ; but as it was a point of honor to give them all an equal chance , no one was admitted till the clock struck , when all pushed in in a body . The jewelry was spread out on the bed , around which all the jewellers of Boston , in 1820 , could gather without crowding . Each man began by placing his hat in some convenient place , and it was in his hat that he deposited the articles selected by him for purchase . When the whole stock had been transferred from the bed to the several hats , Mr. Gorham took a list of the contents of each ; whereupon the jewellers packed their purchases , and carried them home . In the course of the day , the bills were made out ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money . The business being thus happily concluded , he returned to Providence , to work uninterruptedly for another six months . In this manner , Jabez Gorham conducted business for sixteen years , before he ever thought of attempting silver-ware . Such was his reputation for scrupulous honesty , that , for many years before he left the business , none of his customers ever subjected his work to any test whatever , not even to that of a pair of scales . It is his boast , that , during the whole of his business career of more // than half a century , he never sold an article of a lower standard of purity than the one established by law or by the nature of the precious metals . About the year 1825 , some Boston people discovered that a tolerable silver spoon could be made much thinner than the custom of the trade had previously permitted , and that these thin spoons could be sold by pedlers very advantageously . The consequence of this discovery was , that silver spoons became an article of manufacture in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New England . One day , in 1830 , the question occurred to Jabez Gorham , Why not make spoons in Providence , and sell them to the pedlers who buy our jewelry ? The next time he took his trunk of trinkets to Boston , he looked about him for a man who knew something of the art of spoon-making . One such he found , a young man just " out of his time , " whom he took back with him to Providence , where he established him in an odd corner of his jewelry shop . In this small way , thirty-seven years ago , the business began which has grown to be the largest and most complete manufactory of silver-ware in the world . For the first ten years he made nothing but spoons , thimbles , and silver combs , with an occasional napkin-ring , if any one in Providence was bold enough to order one . Businesses grew very slowly in those days . It was thought a grand success when Jabez Gorham , after nearly twenty years ' exertion , had fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ napkin-rings , children 's mugs , and such small ware . Nor would Mr. Gorham , of his own motion , have ever carried the business much farther ; certainly not to the point of producing articles that approach the rank of works of art . We have heard the old gentleman say , that he often stood at a store-window in Boston , wondering by what process certain operations were performed in silver , the results of which he saw before him in the form of pitchers and teapots . But in due course of time Mr. John Gorham , the present head of the house , eldest son of the founder , came upon the scene , - an aspiring , ingenious young man , whose nature it was to excel in anything in which he might chance to engage . The silversmith 's art was then so little known in the United States that neither workmen nor information could be obtained here in its higher branches . Mr. John Gorham crossed the ocean soon after coming of age , and examined every leading silver establishment in Europe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business had ever thought of America as a possible competitor ; still less did any one see in this quiet Yankee youth the person who was to annihilate the American demand for European silver-ware , and produce articles which famous European houses would servilely copy . From the time of Mr. John Gorham 's return dates the eminence of the present company , and of the production of the costlier kinds of silver-ware , on a great scale , in the United States . From first to last , the company have induced sixtythree accomplished workmen to come from Europe and settle in Providence , some of whom might not unjustly be enrolled in the list of artists . The war gave an amazing development to this business , as it did to all others ministering to pleasure or the sense of beauty . When the war began , in i86i , the Gorham Company employed about one hundred and fifty men ; and in 1864 this number had increased to four hundred , all engaged in making articles of solid silver . Even with this great force the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products . On Christmas morning , 1864 , there was left in the store in Maiden Lane , New York , but seven dollars ' worth of ware , out of an average stock of one hundred thousand dollars ' worth . Perhaps we ought not to be surprised at this . Consider our silver weddings . It is not unusual for several thousands of dollars ' worth of silver to be presented on these occasions , - in one recent instance , sixteen // thousand dollars ' worth was given . And what lady can be married , now-a-days , without having a few pounds of silver given to her ? For Christmas presents , of course , silver-ware is always among the objects dangerous to the sanity of those who go forth , just before the holidays , with a limited purse and unlimited desires . What particularly surprises the visitor to the Gorham works at ' Providence is to see labor-saving machinery - the ponderous steam-hammer , the stamping and rolling apparatus - employed in silver work , instead of the baser metals to which they are usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done by machinery ; so that the three hundred men usually employed in solid ware are in reality doing the work of a thousand . The first operation is to buy silver coin in Wall Street . In a bag of dollars there are always some bad pieces ; and as the company embark their reputation in every silver vessel that leaves the factory , and are always responsible for its purity , each dollar is wrenched asunder and its goodness positively ascertained before it is thrown into the crucible . The subsequent operations , by which these spoiled dollars are converted into objects of brilliant and enduring beauty , can better be imagined than described . New forms of beauty are the constant study of the artist in silver . One large apartment in the Gorham establishment - the artists ' room - is a kind of magazine or storehouse of beautiful forms , which have been gathered in the course of years by Mr. George Wilkinson , the member of the company who has charge of the designing , and who is himself a designer of singular taste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawings of all the former products of the establishment . Here is a large and most costly library of illustrated works in every department of art and science . Mr. Wilkinson gets ideas from works upon botany , sculpture , landscape , - from ancient bass-reliefs and modern porcelain ; but , more frequently , from those large vol 733 umes which exhibit the glories of architecture . " The first requisite , " he maintains , " of a good piece of silver-plate is that it be well bzuY/ . " The artist in silver has also to keep constantly in view the practical and commercial limitations of his art . The forms which he designs must be such as can be executed with due economy of labor and material , such as can be easily cleaned , and such as will please the taste of the silver-purchasing public . It is by his skill in complying with these inexorable conditions , while producing forms of real excellence , that Mr. Wilkinson has given such celebrity to the articles made by the company to which he belongs . Few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dinner-sets , the tea-sets , the gorgeous salvers , and the tall 6pergnes with which the warerooms of this manufactory are filled . A silver salver of large si ? e costs a thousand dollars . A complete dinner-set for a party of twenty-four costs twelve thousand dollars . The price of a nice tea-set can easily run into three thousand dollars . We noticed one small vase ( six or eight inches high ) exquisitely chased on two sides , which Mr. Wilkinson assured us it cost the company about seven hundred dollars to produce . There are , as yet , but two or three persons in all America who would be likely to become purchasers of the articles in silver which rank in Europe as works of art , and which are strictly entitled to that distinction . The wonder is who buys the massive utilities that are stacked away in such profusion in Maiden Lane . The Gorham Company have always in course of manufacture about three tons of silver , and usually have a ton of finished work for sale . An important branch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a very superior kind of plated ware , intended to combine the strength of baser metal with the beauty of silver . The manufacture of such ware has attained great development in England of late years , owing chiefly to the Among ike Workers in Silver . // application of the mysterious power of electricity to the laying-on of the silver . We must discourse a little upon this admirable application of science to the arts . Hamlet amused his friend Horatio by tracing the noble dust of Alexander till he found it stopping a bunghole . If we trace the course of discovery that resulted in this beautiful art , we shall have to reverse Hamlet 's order : we must begin with the homely object , and end with magnificent ones . Electroplating , electrotyping , the electric telegraph , and many other arts and wonders , all go back to that dish of frogs which the amiable and fond Professor Galvani was preparing for his sick wife 's dinner one day , about the year 1787 . It was a curious reflection , when we were illuminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable , that this bewildering and unique triumph of man over nature had no more illustrious origin than the legs of an Italian frog . We are aware that the honor has been claimed for a Neapolitan mouse . There is a story in the books of a mouse in Naples that had the impudence , in 1786 , to bite the leg of a professor of medicine , and was caught in the act by the professor himself , who punished his audacity by dissecting him . While doing so , he observed that , when he touched a nerve of the creature with his knife , its limbs were slightly convulsed . The professor was struck with the circumstance , was puzzled by it , mentioned it , and it was recorded ; but as nothing further came of it , no connection can be established between that mouse and the splendors of silver-plated ware and the wonders of the telegraph . The claims of Professor Galvani 's frog rest upon a sure foundation of fact . Signora Galvani - so runs one version of the story - lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that chaos of domestic utensils and philosophical apparatus that may still be observed sometimes in the abodes of men addicted to science . The Professor himself had prepared the frogs for the stew-pan , and left them upon a table near the conductor of an electrical machine . A student , while experimenting with the machine , chanced to touch with a steel instrument one of the frogs at the intersection of the legs . The sick lady observed that , as often as he did so , the legs were convulsed , or , as we now say , were galvanized . Upon her husband 's return to the room , she mentioned this strange thing to him , and he immediately repeated the experiment From 1760 to 1790 , as the reader is probably aware , all the scientific world was on the qul vive with regard to electricity . The most brilliant reputations of that century had been won by electric discoveries . Franklin was still alive , to reward with his benignant approval those who should contribute anything valuable after his own immense additions to man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , therefore , as much the spirit of the time as the genius of the man , that made Galvani seize this new fact with eagerness , and investigate it with untiring enthusiasm . It was a sad day for the frogs of the Pope 's dominions when Signora Galvani observed those two naked legs fly apart and crook themselves with so much animation . There was slaughter in the swamps of Bologna for many a month thereafter . For mankind , however , it was a day to be held in everlasting remembrance , since it was then that was taken the first step toward the galvanic battery ! As fortune favors the brave , so accident aids the ingenious . After Professor Galvani had touched the muscles and nerves of many frogs with the spark drawn from the electrical machine , another accident occurred which led directly to the discovery of the galvanic battery . Having skinned a frog , he chanced to hang it by a co**er hook upon an iron nail ; and thus , without knowing it , he brought together the elements of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His object in hanging up this frog was to see if the electricity of the atmosphere would produce any effects , however slight , similar to those pro- // duced when the spark of the machine was applied to the creature . It did not . After watching his frog awhile , the Professor was proceeding to take it down , and while in the act of doing so the legs were convulsed ! Struck with this occurrence , he replaced the frog , took it down again , put it back , took it down2 until he discovered that , as often as the damp frog ( still hanging upon its copper hook ) touched the iron nail , the contraction of the muscles took place , as if the frog had been touched by a conductor connected with an electrical machine . This experiment was repeated hundreds of times , and varied in as many ways as mortal ingenuity could devise . Galvani at length settled down upon the method following : he wrapped the nerves taken from the loins of a frog in a leaf of tin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of copper ; then , as often as the leaf of tin was brought in contact with the plate of copper , the legs of the frog were convulsed . People regard Charles Lamb 's story of the discovery of roast pig as a most extravagantand impossible fiction ; but , really , Professor Galvani comported himself very much in the manner of that great discoverer . It was no more necessary to employ the frog 's nerves in the production of the electricity , than it was necessary to burn down a house in roasting pig for dinner . The poor frog contributed nothing to it but his dampness , - as every boy in a telegraph office now perceives . He was merely the wet in the small galvanic battery . Professor Galvani , however , exulting in his discovery , leaped to the conclusion that this electricity , was not the same as that produced by friction . He thought he had discovered the longsought something by which the muscles move obedient to the will . " All creatures , " he wrote , " have an electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves , and is by the nerves communicated to the whole body . It is secreted *by the brain . The interior substance of the nerves is endowed with a conducting 735 power for this electricity , and facilitates its movement and its passage from one part of the nervous system to another ; while the oily coating of these organs hinders the dissipation of the fluid , and permits its accumulation . " He also thought that the muscles were the Leyden jars of the animal system , in which the electricity generated by the brain and conducted by the nerves was hoarded up for use . When a man was tired , he had merely used his electricity too fast ; when he was fresh , his Leyden jars were all full . The publication of these experiments in 1791 , accompanied by Galvani 's theory of animal electricity , produced a sensation in scientific circles only inferior to that caused by Franklin 's demonstration of the identity of lightning with electricity , thirty years before . The murder of innocent frogs extended from the marshes of Bologna to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says a writer of the time , " frogs were to be found and two different metals could be procured , every one was anxious to see the mangled limbs of frogs brought to life in this wonderful way . " Or , as Lamb says , in the dissertation upon Roast Pig : " The thing took wing , and now there was nothing to be seen but fire in every direction . " At first the facts and the theory of Galvani were equally accepted ; and a grateful world insisted upon styling the new science , as it was deemed , " Galvanism . " Thus a word was added to all the languages , which has been found useful in its literal sense , and forcible in its figurative . Whatever we may think of Galvani 's philosophy , we can not deny that he immortalized his name . He died a few years after , fully satisfied with his theory , but having no suspicion of the many , the peculiar , the marvellous results that were to flow from the chance discovery of the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a kind of electrical machine . Among the Italians who caught at Galvani 's discovery , the most skilful and learned was Professor Volta , of // Como , who had been an ardent electrician from his youth . Many of our readers have seen this year the colossal statue of that great man , which adorns his native city on the southern shore of the lake . The statue was worthily decreed , because the man who contributes ever so little to a grand discovery in science - provided that little is essential to it - ranks among the greatest benefactors of his species . And what did the admirable Volta discover ? Reducing the labors of his long life to their simplest expression , we should say that his just claim . to immortality consists in this , - he found out that the frog had nothing to do with the production of electricity in Galvani 's experiment , but that a wet card or rag would do as well . This discovery was the central fact of his scientific career of sixty-four years . It took all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of entire devotion to the study , to enable him to interpret Galvani 's apparatus so far as to get rid of the frog ; and he spent the remaining thirty-seven years of his existence in varying the experiment thus freed from that " demd , damp , moist , unpleasant body . " It was a severe affliction to the followers of Galvani and to the University of Bologna to have their darling theory of the nervous electricity so rudely yet so unanswerably refuted . " I do not need your frog ! ' * exclaimed the too impetuous Volta . " Give me two metals and a moist rag , and I will produce your animal electricity . Your frog is nothing but a moist conductor , and in this respect is not as good as a wet rag . " This was a decisive fact , and it silenced all but a few of the disciples of the dead Galvani . Volta was led to discard the frog by observing that no electric results followed when the two plates were of the same metal . Suspecting from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the generator ) of the . *electric fluid , he tried the experiment with a wet card placed between two pairs of plates , and thus discovered that the secret lay in the metals being hetero geneous . But it cost thousands of experiments to reach this result , and ten years of ceaseless thought and exertion to arrive at the invention of the " pile , " which merely consists of many pairs of heterogeneous plates , each separated by a moist substance . The weight of so much metal squeezed the wet cloth dry , and this led to various contrivances for keeping it wet , resulting at last in the invention of the familiar " troughbattery , " now employed in all telegraph offices and manufactories of electroanything . Instead of Galvani 's frog or Volta 's wet rag , the conduc torisa solution of sulphuric acid , which Volta himself suggested and employed . The negative electricity is conveyed to the earth by a wire , and the positive is conducted from pair to pair , increasing as it goes , until , if the battery is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a message round the world . And the current is continuous . The galvanic battery is an electrical machine that goes without turning a handle . By the galvanic battery , electricity is made subservient to man . Among other things , it sends his messages , faces hi s type with copper , silvers his coffee-pot , and coats the inside of his baby 's silver mug with shining gold . The old methods of covering metals with a plating of silver were so difficult and laborious , that durable ware could never have been produced by them except at an expense which would have defeated the object . In those slow and costly ways plated articles were made as late as the year 1840 ; and thus they might be made at the present moment , if Signora Galvani had been looking the other way when the student touched the frog with his knife . More than fifty years elapsed before that chance discovery was made available in the art we are considering . For many years the discoveries of Galvani and Volta did not appear to add much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " special wonder . " Elderly readers can perhaps remember the appalling accounts that used to be published , forty years ago or more , of the gal- // 737 vanizing of criminals after execution . in i8ii , at Glasgow , a noted chemist tried the effect of a voltaic " pile " of two hundred and seventy pairs of plates upon the body of a murderer . As the various parts of the nervous system were subjected to the current , the most startling results followed . The whole body shuddered as with cold ; one of the legs nearly kicked an attendant over ; the chest heaved , and the lungs inhaled and exhaled . At one time , when all the power of the instrument was exerted , we are told that " every muscle of the countenance was simultaneously thrown into fearful action . Rage , horror , despair and anguish , and ghastly smiles , united their hideous expression on the murderer 's face , surpassing far the wildest representations of a Fuseli or a Kean . At this period several of the spectators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one gentleman fainted . " The bodies of horses , oxen , and sheep were galvanized , with results the most surprising . Five men were unable to hold the leg of a horse subjected to the action of a powerful battery . So far as we know , nothing of much importance has yet been inferred from such experiments as these . Davy and Faraday , however , and their pupils , did not confine their attention to these barren wonders . Sir Humphry Davy took the " pile " as invented by Volta , in i8oo , and founded by its assistance what may be styled a new science , and developed it to the point where it became available for the arts and utilities of man . The simple and easy process by which silver and gold are decomposed , and then deposited upon metallic surfaces , is only one of many ways in which the galvanic battery ministers to our convenience and pleasure . If the reader will step into a manufactory of plated ware , he will see , in the plating-room , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teapot . Avoiding scientific terms , we may say that this liquid is a solution of silver , and contains about four ounces of silver to a gallon of water . There are also thin plates of silver hanging along the sides of the trough into the liquid . The galvanic battery which is to set this apparatus in motion is in a closet near by . The vessels to be plated , after being thoroughly cleaned and exactly weighed , are suspended in the liquid by a wire running along the top of the trough . When all is ready , the current of electricity generated by the small battery in the closet is made to pas* through the trough , a1*d along all the metallic surfaces therein contained . When this has been done , the spectator may look with all his eyes , but he can not perceive that anything is going on . There is no bubbling , nor fizzing , nor any other noise or motion . The long row of vessels hank silentLy at their wire , immersed in their tea , and nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they continue to hang for hours , - for five or six or seven hours , if the design is to produce work which will answer some other purpose than selling . All this time a most wonderful and mysterious process is going on . That gentle current of electricity , noiseless and invisible as it is , is taking the silver held in the solution , and laying-it upon the surfaces of those vessels , within and without ; and at the same time it is decomposing the plates of silver hanging along the sides of the trough in such a way as to keep up the strength of the solution . We can not recover from the wonder into which the contemplation of this process threw us . There are some things which the outside and occasional observer can never be done marvelling at . For our part , we never hear the click of a telegraphic apparatus without experiencing the same spasm of astonishment as when we were first introduced to that mystery . The beautiful manner , too , in which this silvering work is done ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lay on the colors of the palette so evenly , nor could a crucible melt the metals into a completer oneness . And here is the opportunity for // 738 fraud . In five minutes an article is coated with silver in every part , inside and out ; and that mere " blush " of silver , as the platers term it , will receive as brilliant a polish , and look as well ( for a month ) as if it were solid plate . Nay , it will look rather better ; since the silver deposited by this exquisite process is perfectly pure , while the silver employed in solid ware is of the coin standard , - one tenth alloy . The plater can deposit upon his work as little silver as he chooses , either by weakening his solution , or by leaving the articles in it for a very short time ; and no man can detect the cheat with certainty except by an expensive and troublesome process . Nor will it suffice for the operator to attend to the strength of his solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in certain conditions of the atmosphere we can scarcely get a spark from the electrical machine , so there are times when the galvanic battery works feebly , and when the silvering goes on much more slowly than usual . To guard against errors from this cause , there is no sure resource but a system of careful weighings . In such establishments as that of the Gorham Company of Providence , Tiffany 's or Haughwout 's of New York , Bailey 's of Philadelphia , and Bigelow Brothers and Kennard 's , or Palmer and Batchelder 's , of Boston , each article is weighed before it is immersed in the solution , its weight is recorded , and it is allowed to remain in the solution until it has taken on the whole of the precious metal it was designed to receive . There was a lawsuit the other day in New York , which turned upon the quantity of silver deposited upon sundry gross of forks and spoons . The plater agreed to put upon them twelve ounces of silver to the gross , which is about as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he had performed his contract , he would have spread over each table-spoon about as much silver as there is in a ten-cent piece ; and such is the nature of silver that these spoons would have worn well for five or six years . In fact , there are no better plated spoons yet in use than these were designed to be . The plater meant to comply with the usages of the trade . He meant to put upon those spoons the quantity of silver which , in the trade , stands for twelve ounces to the gross , which is about ten ounces to the gross . Such was probably his virtuous intention , and he supposed he had carried out that intention . But when the spoons were put to the test , it was discovered that upon one hundred and fortyfour table-spoons there were but three ounces and a half of silver . It came out on the trial that the plater never weighed his work , and trusted wholly to the length of time he left it in the solution . He appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had been left four hours subject to the action of the battery , had acquired only a film of silver . To the eye of the purchaser , these spoons would have presented precisely the same appearance as the best plated ware in existence . For two or three months , or even for six months , they would have retained their brilliancy . What their appearance would have been at the end of a year or two we need not say , for most readers have encountered the spectacle in their pilgrimage through a world which is said to resemble plated articles of this quality in being " all a fleeting show . " Every one is familiar with the gold lining that is now so generally seen in silver vessels . This is laid on by the same process as that which covers the outside with silver . The vessel is filled with a solution of gold , and in this solution a thin plate of gold is suspended . The electric current being made to pass through the interior thus prepared , the liquid bubbles up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold is deposited upon the inside surface for the purpose designed . When this is accomplished , nothing remains but to polish the vessel , within and without , and we have // a piece of ware which is silver when we look at it , and golden when we drink from it . The obstacle to the introduction of the superior plated ware now made by the Gorham Company is its costliness . The best plated ware costs five times as much as the worst , and one fourth as much as solid silver . We saw the other day three large salvers , which , at a distance of six feet , looked very nearly alike . All of them bore a most brilliant polish , and all were elaborately decorated . One of them was a trashy article , made of an alloy of lead and tin , covered with a " blush " of silver . It had been stamped out and shaped at one blow by a stamping-machine , and left in the silver solution subject to the action of the battery for perhaps fifteen minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended and struck it gave forth a dull leaden sound . The price of this abomination was thirty-seven dollars and a haW and it would last , with careful occasional usage , for a year . Daily use would disclose its real quality in a few weeks . Another of these salvers was of solid silver , to which no objection could be made except that its price was nine hundred and fifty dollars . The third was of that superior plated ware introduced recently by the Gorham Company of Providence . The base of this article was the metal now called nickel silver , - a mixture of copper , nickel , and zinc , - a very hard and ringing compound , perfectly white , and capable of a high polish . Upon this hard surface as much silver had been deposited 739 as upon the best Sheffield plated ware , which is about as much as can be smoothly put upon it by the electroplating process . When this salver was struck , it rang like a bell , and it would not bend under the weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will relain its lustre for a whole generation , and when , after that long period , it begins to lose its silver coating , it can be re-silvered and made as good as ever . But the price of this article was two hundred dollars , - more than five times the cost of the leaden trash , and a fourth of the price of the solid salver . Nevertheless , plated ware of this quality is the only kind which it is good economy to buy . There are few more extravagant purchases we can make in housekeeping than lead and brass ware , covered with a film of silver so thin that one ounce of the precious metal can actually be spread over two acres of it . One fact can easily be borne in mind : good serviceable plated articles cost , and musi ! cost , from one fourth to one third as much as similar articles of solid silver . Anything of a much lower standard than this is trash and vulgarity . For our part , we prefergood plated ware to solid plate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of form , all the brilliancy of surface , all the durability and utility of solid silver , without its excessive costliness , without appearing to be guilty of ostentation , without putting our neighbors to shame , and without offering a perpetual temptation to burglars .
