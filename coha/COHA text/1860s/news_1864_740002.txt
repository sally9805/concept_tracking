txt A HEAVY FIRE was opened front the rebel works on James and , Sullivan Islands on our , land and naval batteries , Tuesday the 7th inst . The object of the firing has not been ascertained , although we suspect the enemy had in view the making of a great show of strength , lest the information we have received respecting his leebie numbers about Charleston and Savannah should influence us to make an attack . Several of the shot struck the water some distance In the rear of the supply vessels of the fleet , but they all sank harmlessly to the bottom . The shot aimed at the batteries on Morris Island effected no damage whatever . Our guns , troth on land and water , replied with great energy , so that within a short time tae rebels were glad to close the entertaintnent by suspending the wonting of their pieces . TDE DESTRUCTION OF A REBEL STEAMER was an event which happened early on Wednesday morning . During the night , the gunners of Fort Putnam observed , through the darkness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sumter . The object soon developed itself into a low side-wheel steamy  --  the same which we have been wont to observe gliding around the inner harbor for several months past . A number of shot were fired at her from Fort Putnam , one of which it is believed struck the rudder , as the vessel became disabled and went aground on the Sullivan 's Island shore . Day . Light thoroughly exposed her condition to our gunlen , and in lest time than it occupies to pen this aaragraph , they put so many shot through her hull ; hat it would have been difficult to determine if it ever formed a portion of a steamer . She was riddled Into fragments . We recognized the vessel as the ) ne the rebels employed to carry troops and supplies , o Fort Sumter . She has carried her last load . TWENTY-ONE DESERTERS from the enemy came into Fort Pulaski a day or two Igo . They are expected to arrive at Hilton Head his morning . They brought a Savannah paper of he 10111 and a Charleston paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major-Gen. 5Am . JONES is announced as the Military Commander in Charleston . The deserters know nothing if the details concerning late movements . They all agree that the people place little confidence in the , kill of JOHNSTON , or the ability of his army . The ' aces of noted Seceselonists are downcast , haggard , ' ejected , which to the deserters is a sure sign that rouNsroN 's retrograde movements are not considered , in the whole , as a pleasing circumstance . THE NEW IRONSIDES bas been in Hilton Head harbor for several days . Her nests have been in , and her rigging and other . sailing Ixtures adjusted , preparatory to her going North . . t has been remarked that now this monster has been emoved from Charleston harbor the rebels will not iesitate to send out their rams. upon whose merits hey have expatiated so much . Nothing would please he officers and men of the monitors more than to te the rams take a turn in the outer harbor . Admiral ) Aatoame is bully prepared for just such an einergen:y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AT/tether the New fronsides will return to Charleston ' arbor or take a position at some other point , has Lot transpired . We may depend upon it , wherever he is , she will do good execution . CHANGE OF PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERALS . By a recent order from the Department Headquarters , Lieut. - Col . James F. Heee has been again assigned to the position of Provost  --  Marshal-General . The long experience of Lieut. - Col . Run in that Capacity justly entitles him to that Post , and the faithful and impartial manner in which he nu discharged his duties should influence the authorities to bestow upon him an equal rank with that of other officers who hold a similar position In other departments . A CAMP OF INSTRUCTION is about to be established under very favorable auspices , either at Hilton Head or Beaufort : Gen. Potvia will take charge . Gen. roma has implicit confidence in the soldierly qualities of the colored troops , and is determined they shall not want for the proper military instruction . Since Gen. FOSTER 'S arrival in the department he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yesterday he returned from a visit to Morris and Folly Islands . A short time ago he proceeded to Florida . Titus , it will be seen , he has been the rounds of the department . UNPLEASANT WEATHER . At the present writing we are having a fall of cold drizzling rain , making the use of an overcoat an almost imperative necessity , although three clays ago the thermometer marked 100 ? . June is looked upon as one of the warmest months of the year , and such , in fact , we all considered it until this cold rain has shuwered upon us . WHIT . it Heavy Cannoande  --  A Blockade-Bonner Skink . By the arrival of the Fulton from Hilton Head , June 15 , we have the Port Royal New South for the week ending June 18 . It furnishes us the following items of news : A REBEL STEAMER SUNK . On Tuesday , the 7th inst. , the rebels opened a very heavy fire on our land and naval batteries from their works do James and Sullivan Islands . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fleet . Our batteries ' returned the fire with equal vigor . We have not heard of any damage being sustained by the Union side . During the night the gunners at Fort Putnam espied a repel steamer approaching Sumter from the Charleston side . A number of shots were directed at her , one or more of which took effect in her lower part , causing her to run aground . In this condition she was dist overed at daylight by our men , who again , opened a hot fire upon her , and , as far as could be observed , completely ruined her . The hull of the steamer was so thoroughly shattered that our men could get an unobstructed view through the apertures made . The steamer is bell ved to have been the same that has been noticed on several occasions working her way down to Sumter . She was used to convey troops and supplies . The bombardment of Charleston is still continued . A statement to the effect that the shells do not go beyond the edge of the city is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most emphatically that they saw several shells reach a point a long distance inland . The object of the rebels in opening so vigorously on Tuesday was ? probably to deceive us as regards their numerical strength . Doubtless that same day they sent troops ether to JOHNSTON or Lsx . THE NEW IRONSIDES . This favorite old war vessel has been in our tabor for about a week . Her crew have since been . busily engaged in putting in her masts and other sailing fixtures , and it will not be many days probably before she will take her departure . We had the pleasure of paying her a visit a few days ago , and were highly pleased , with the neat and tidy condition of the vessel and everything on board . The hospitality of the officers was all that could be desired . We regretted not having the gratification of meeting Commodore ROWAN . who happened at the time to be absent on another vessel of the fleet . It is presumed that nearly every one knows the history of the New lronsidea . Her career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebel works on the several islands in that vicinity is full of instructive interest . Never yet did , she open her broadside of eight guns on the foe without hurting somebody or inflicting an immense deal of damage . We doubt not the rebels will hear more from her powerful guns and witness other effects of her destructive fire , before many weeks shall have elapsed .
