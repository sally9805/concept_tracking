ble contribution to that material from which histories , popular or otherwise , are manufactured . It has long been known that George III . wrote many letters to Lord North during the time that . the latter held high offices in the British Cabinet . Sir James Mackintosh was allowed to examine these letters ; and he transcribed from them matter sufficient to make a manuscript volume , which , however , very imperfectly represents the collection . This volume passed into the hands of Lady Charlotte Lindsay , then Lord North 's surviving daughter , and thence into possession of Lord Brougham . In 184T it was obtained by Earl Stanhope , with full permission to make any use of it that he might deem proper . Both these noble writers made good use of the volume ; and Earl Russell and Mr. Bancroft have given extracts from the letters in some of their historical writings . But these samples of the king 's letters , as Mr. Bodham Donne says , and as a close examination of his book enables us also to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although he had the whole Correspondence before him , " says the editor of that Correspondence , " selected from it such portions only as may have seemed to him most important , or as best suited to a particular purpose , - perhaps the history of a period or a reign . In many instances , he has taken only a single sentence from a letter ; in others , he has combined sentences that originally were unconnected ; while he has passed over a considerable number of the king 's letters , as either of little moment in themselves , or of none to his object in transcribing them . By such combinations or omissions , the context is sometimes disturbed and the series rendered incomplete . In the following pages entire and exact copies of the letters are for the first time published . With the exception of a few brief notes of appointment of time or place , I have printed all the letters preserved in the Queen 's Library at Windsor Castle , omitting and transposing nothing in the series now for the first time presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bodham Donne has published , and its high value can not be questioned , as it throws a flood of light over one of the most interesting periods of modern history , one that is of peculiar importance to Americans . It helps remove errors that have prevailed concerning our Revolutionary // history , and assigns to some of the principal English actors their proper parts in the great drama . The ordinary American opinion concerning the origin of the Revolution was , that it was brought about by British Ministers , and that George III . was no further responsible for it than that he was the victim of bad advice . " An excellent sovereign , but badly advised , " was constantly said of him by Americans of the Revolutionary age and of the age that followed it . The Ministers were held answerable for all the evil done in his reign , and the most arbitrary and resolute of English sovereigns since Henry VIII . was spoken of as if he had been the simplest of tools in their hands . Of all these Ministers , Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the war was waged while he was Premier . Writs of assistance , the Stamp Act , the tea tax , the Boston Port Bill , the employment of Hessians and Indians , and many other sins of the English government toward America for more than twenty years , were laid to his account , in violation alike of chronology and of common sense . As time went on , and " the dead grew visible from the shades of time , " more correct views began to prevail ; and when this correspondence first was publicly mentioned , now many years since , it had already come to be understood that Lord North was something very different from the bad Minister he had been through more than half a century supposed to be . His chief fault was in serving his royal master with too much regard for that master 's prejudices , and with little concern for the Constitution of his country , or regard for the principles of good government . He was a very good-natured man , and , caring little for office in itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assert the rights and the dignity of his position against the encroaching disposition of the king . The characters of these two men , and their relations to each other , are well described in the following extract from Mr. Bodham Donne 's Introduction - His the king 's proper character had now 1768 displayed itself ; he was terribly alert ; he was indefatigable in business , small or great ; he was no longer under the dominion of a parent or a favorite ; neither is there , so far as I can discover , any trace or record of the sullen fits // of his boyhood . On the other hand , there can be no doubt that his understanding , although active , was narrow , his prejudices numerous , his obstinacy great . His theory of royal duties was unsound , however specious it may have seemed to himself ; he interfered too much with the machinery of Parliament , and the responsibility of his Ministers ; nor was he averse from cabals or intrigues , when he had points to gain . To many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his real thoughts or wishes to persons who were not constitutionally entitled to aid or advise him . In all his intercourse with Lord North , however , there are no tokens of reticence or imperfect trust . In his own recurring phrase , he unbosoms ' himself to his Minister as to a friend . He dreads nothing so much , in the worst of times , as Lord North 's resignation ; he is full of gratitude for his services ; he has infinite reliance upon his ministeral and financial ability . He is vexed when the Minister is slackly supported , and indignant when he is rudely assailed . Never was a public servant more implicitly trusted by his master . It was the faith of Henry IV . in Sully , of Charles V. in Granvelle , revived . His affection for Lord Bute was grounded upon the habits or the sentiments of boyhood ; his affection for Lord North was the deliberate choice of manhood . Their joint administration - for the king was a part of his own government - was indeed disastrous for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their common loyalty to each other . It was , indeed , most unfortunate that the stronger understanding and the wider experience should have been curbed and controlled by the narrower judgment and the stronger will ; that the Minister so often submitted his own convictions to the prejudices of the king . This weakness on the one side , and this pertinacity on the other , rendered the period to which this correspondence relates a painful one to contemplate ; and neither the master nor the servant can be excused for having so largely contributed to sever from one another the eastern and the western branches of the English nation , for having persevered in a struggle which none better than themselves must have known to be hopeless long before its close . Upon Lord North and the king must ever rest a large measure of the blame of alienating a vast , and not at first disloyal , portion of the inheritance , bequeathed by their ancestors and enlarged by Pitt , of the sovereign and people of Great Britain , of making that which was strong feeble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of all Europe for many years to come . " - pp. lxxxiv. , lxxxv . The letters of the king to Lord North show that George Ill. was , for almost twelve years , welinigh as much his own first // minister as Louis XIV . was during the long period that he reigned after the death of Mazarin . We think there ought to be no doubt that George III . meant not to be a constitutional king of Great Britain , at the time these letters were written . If we would know what he wished to be as a sovereign , we should judge him by his conduct during the North Ministry , and not by his conduct during the first Pitt Ministry . Pitt , as Minister , was " master of the situation , " because he alone stood between the king and " the Coalition " ; and the king had treated the leaders of " the Coalition " so badly , that he could not even think of the possibility of their return to office . Therefore he allowed Pitt to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which would have seemed improper even to George Grenville , who was the king 's Old Man of the Sea . The one special point settled by the publication of these letters in their perfect state is this , - that down to the close of 1783 , when he had been on the throne more than twenty-three years , the king had not accepted that place in the British polity which it was intended should be occupied by the gentleman who is honored with the royal title in that polity , intended , we mean , by the aristocratical revolutionists of 1688 and their successors . The number of these letters is seven hundred and fifty-four . The first is dated February 28 , 1768 , Lord North being then Chancellor of the Exchequer ; the last , December 9 , 1783 , when the Coalition Ministry , in which Lord North was Secretary of State for the Home Department , was drawing fast toward its end . With very few exceptions , they are written by the king to Lord North . Though valuable as historical material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters so dreary and unreadable as this ; and nothing but Mr. Bodham Donne 's ample and lucid explanatory notes enables the reader to get through the volumes in which they appear . " The good old king " - he was not thirty when this correspondence began - never had any idea of style ; and he wrote to Lord North much after the manner in which Mr. Gabriel Varden would have written to Sim Tappertit , had their communications not been carried on by word of mouth . There is not the slightest pretence to dignity in any of the king 's letters ; and we pre // sume the monarch thought dignity was quite out of place in a confidential correspondence with one who united in his person , in a very unusual manner , the characters of a minister and a favorite . Kings of an arbitrary disposition are fond of favorites , but mostly they select them from among men of humble birth . The course of George III . was a striking exception to the rule , for Lord North belonged to a patrician family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded him , not as a constitutional minister , such as English sovereigns long had been accustomed to transact business with , but as his agent for carrying out the royal plans , without regard to the sense of Parliament . His Majesty , whenever Lord North wished to retire from office , - and he desired to resign his places on various occasions , - always appealed to him as a gentleman not to desert his sovereign , - a mode of treating the matter that showed he had no clear conception either of his own position in the state or of the power of Parliament . Lord North would have thrown up office long before the surrender of Cornwallis , which event virtually closed the American war , but for his master 's representations that no gentleman could act as an English Prime Minister thus situated , supposing him to be an honest man , was bound to act . Even so late as the 19th of March , 1782 , exactly five months after Yorktown , the king could write to Lord North as follows : " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sentiments of honor will not permit me to send for any of the leaders of Opposition and personally treat with them , I could not but be hurt at your letter of last night . Every man must be the sole judge of his feelings ; therefore whatever you or any man can say on that subject has no avail with me . " This extraordinary letter was written in reply to one which had been called forth from Lord North in consequence of a significant vote in the House of Commons on the 15th of March . Sir John lions , an old supporter of the Ministry and a country gentleman , had moved a vote of want of confidence in Ministers ; and this motion was negatived by a majority of only nine in a very full House . * He became Earl of Guildford in 1790 , and died in 1792 , in his sixtieth year . He was blind for the last five years of his life . From all accounts , he was a man of great private worth . // Such a vote was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last century it would have been followed by an immediate resignation of Ministers ; but the king would not admit that it should be regarded by Lord North in the only light in which it was suitable for a British Minister to regard it . In the same letter from which we have already quoted , he wrote to the Premier , " If you resign before I have decided what I will do , you will forever forfeit my regard " ; and , if horace Walpole can be taken as an authority , he said to Lord North , when he went to take formal leave of him , " Remember , my Lord , that it is you desert me , not I you . " A more unworthy observation never was made , or one that had less of truth in it ; for Lord North , though for years desirous to leave office , and even anxious to be permitted to retire , did not " desert " the king till the House of Commons had deserted him . " Desert " the king the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had himself been deserted by those thickly arrayed majorities which for twelve years had supported him . It has been often said that the British people , though ardent supporters of the war when it began , soon became disgusted with it , and would have abandoned its prosecution , and that it was ma*intained only through the obstinacy of the king ; but the facts do not support this view of the character of the contest . Parliament was suddenly and unexpectedly dissolved in September , 1780 , and the result of the elections was a new House of Commons , in which Ministers were stronger than they had been in the old one . The amendment to the Address proposed by Opposition in the Commons was rejected by a majority of 82 ; the supplies voted for 1781 exceeded ? 25,000,000 ; and new taxes were readily created . " These signal defeats in the first session dispirited Opposition again , " says Mr. Bodham Donne , " at least until the Christmas recess , and again Opposition was a house divided against itself . The Duke of Richmond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Greek Kalends , until the nation recovered its senses ' ; Lords Camden and Shelburne would have no more to do with the Rockinghams I " To all appearance the war party was as strong in the autumn of 1780 , three years after Saratoga , as it had been in the autumn of 1776 , when Sir William Howe seemed on the point of // subduing " the rebels . " If the king had been in search of an excuse for persevering in the prosecution of a hopeless contest , he could have found one in the apparent determination of his subjects to conquer America . But he never thought of seeking an excuse for his conduct , being so well satisfied that he was in the path of duty that he would have carried on the war , even if the English people had been opposed to his purpose , could he have overcome their opposition . At the opening of 1781 , however , the year destined to bring the trial of arms to a decision , king and people were of one mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long supported the sovereign , were as much devoted to him as ever they had been , and no one could have expected an early change in their sentiments . Yet before the year closed their faith underwent a great change ; and in the winter of 1782 , the very men who had blindly voted for every court measure were seen passing over to the Whig side of the House of Commons . On the 27th of November , 1781 , two days after news of Lord Coruwallis 's surrender had reached London , Parliament met , and an amendment to the Address in the House of Commons was moved by Mr. Fox , and lost , the Ministerial majority being 89 . The Commons had not had time to digest the news . The king was greatly elated by the action of the Commons , and on the 28th of November wrote to the Minister : " Lord North 's account that the Address was carried this morning by a considerable hiajority is very pleasing to me , as it shows the House retains that spirit for which this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserve it in its difficulties . That some principal members have wavered in their sentiments as to the measures to be pursued does not surprise me . Many men choose rather to despond on difficulties than see how to get out of them . I have already directed Ld . G. Germain to put on paper the mode that seems most feesible sic for conducting the war , that every member of the Cabinet may have his propositions to weigh by themselves , when I shall expect to hear their sentiments separately , that we may adopt a plan and abide by it ; fluctuating counsels , and taking up measures without connecting them with the whole of this complicated war , must // n*ake us weak in every part . With the assistance of Parliament , I do not doubt , if measures are well connected , a good end may yet be made to the war , but if we despond certain ruin ensues . " On the 28th of November , Ministers obtained another victory in the House of Commons , their majority being 77 , on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was certainly a very good one ; and I have no doubt , when men are a little recovered of the shock felt by the bad news , and feel that if we recede no one can tell to what a degree the consequence of this country will be diminished , that they will then find the necessity of carrying on the war , though the modes of it may require alterations . " It is certain that the king had no more intention of abandoning the American war after the fall of Yorktown , than Mr. Jefferson Davis had of abandoning the Secession war after the fall of Richmond ; and equally certain is it that he believed - as he had the right to believe after the votes of the House of Commons on the 27th and 28th of November - that he would be supported in his purpose by Parliament . Horace Walpole , writing to Sir Horace Mann on the 29th of November , says : " The warmth in the House of Commons is prodigiously rekindled ; but Lord Cornwallis 's fate has cost the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sir James Lowther , seconded by Mr. Powys , eminent as a country gentleman , moved that the war carried on in North America had been ineffectual , which motion was lost by only 41 majority in a House of 404 members ; but against this rather alarming vote the king could cite the vote of December 14th , when , on the army estimates , Ministers had a majority of 82 , the vote being 166 to 84 , or almost two to one . This last vote contributed to keep up the illusion under which the king labored , for he wrote to Lord North : " The account of the very great majority on the first motion on the army estimates last night gives me much pleasure , and shows the country gentlemen begin to see that , though internal Continental opperations sic in North America are not advisable , the prosecution of the war can alone preserve us from a most ignominious peace , which , when once concluded , would certainly occasion much greater internal uneasiness than any difficulties at present to be contended with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the obstinate monarch was to learn that even country gentlemen could no longer be depended upon to uphold a doomed cause . The recess of Parliament begun on the 21st of December , and lasted for more than a month . During that month members of the House learnt all the details of the disaster in America , and ascertained that their constituents were desirous that the war should be brought to a close . Contact with the people had its usual effect . Accordingly , they came up to Westminster in a mood very unlike that which had existed in the preceding autumn . The Opposition were in high spirits , and a vote of censure , which Mr. Fox moved , on the Earl of Sandwich , First Lord of the Admiralty , was lost by a majority of only 22 , though , if the motion had been carried , the Ministry must have resigned . The king was much vexed , and wrote to Lord North , on the 21st of February : " I am very sorry to find so many persons could view the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to swell the minority last night . I trust they can not have lost the feelings of Englishmen so much as to support the motion of General Conway on Friday . " His Majesty found his trust was unfounded . General Conway , on the 22d , made a motion against the continuance of the American war , and the motion was lost by a majority of one , - the vote standing 194 to 193 . On the 27th he renewed the motion , and it was adopted by a majority of 19 , in a House of 454 members , the Commons then consisting of 558 members , Ireland having her own Parliament . This vote was , in point of fact , on a Ministerial motion to adjourn ; but that covered the main question , which was immediately carried , together with an Address to the throne , with shouts of acclamation . The Ministry were completely beaten on every point . But the king showed no more signs of yielding than he had exhibited after he had news of Yorktown . The same night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister : " Lord North can not be surprised at my being much hurt at the succession sic of Mr. Conway 's motion , though in some degree prepared by what he said yesterday . An answer must be given when the House of Commons bring it up . It is highly delicate to find any words not liable to the greatest objections . Ld . North will therefore certainly wish to have the opinion of // all the Ministers on the wording of it ; wherefore the Address can not be received till to-morrow . IL am mortified Ld . North thinks he can not now remain in office . I hope I shall see him after the drawing-room , that I may explain my mind to him . " The king 's mortification because Lord North thought he could not longer serve him as Prime Minister after his ministerial course had been condemned by the House of Commons shows , either that his Majesty had no conception of the character of the British Constitution , or that he was indifferent to its requirements , or that he was resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have kept Lord North long at the head of the Treasury after the votes of the 28th of February , and yet the king was mortified because the First Lord of the Treasury mentioned this self-evident fact , - as if he had any choice in the matter ! On the 8th of March the House of Commons rejected a vote of censure on the war by a majority of 10 only , which called forth from the king these words " Lord North may easily conceive that I am much hurt at the appearance of yesterday in the House of Commons , and at his opinion that it is totally impossible for the present Mini&amp;try to conduct public business any longer . This leads so much , after the trials I have made of late , to my taking so decisive a step , that I certainly must maturely deliberate before I can return any answer . " Then came the motion of Sir John Rous , already mentioned ; and Lord Surrey gave notice of a motion , for the 20th of March , asking the king to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanover , and the royal yacht was fitting out at Deptford ; but on the afternoon of the 20th he said to Lord North , that , " considering the temper of the Commons , he thought the administration at an end . " " Then , sir " said Lord North , " had I not better state the fact at once ? " " Well , you may do so , " replied the king . The Minister went to the House of Commons , where he succeeded in preventing the presentation of Lord Surrey 's resolution , by declaring that its object had been attained . This news he conveyed in a sentence that should have come from an Irishman , - " The present administration is no more . " From a desire to show the manner in which these letters illustrate the king 's idea of the power he supposed himself to // possess , and his resolution to carry on the war in America under all circumstances , we have departed from the regular order of their examination , to which we now return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been exp.ected , considering how important an incident was the American contest during the fifteen years and upward over which they extend . It is not until we have arrived at the two hundred and fourth letter , - written on the 4th of February ,   , six years after the first was written , - that we find anything of moment in relation to the Colonial troubles . That letter is so characteristic of the writer of it , and shows so well the strange ignorance of eminent Englishmen of everything that related to America , - an ignorance consistently maintained throughout the last ninety-four years , - that we copy it . " LORD NORTH - Since you left me this day , I have seen Lieutenant-General Gage , who came to express his readiness , though so lately come from America , to return at a day 's notice , if the conduct of the Colonies should induce the directing coercive measures . His language was very consonant to his character of an honest , determined man . He says they will be lyons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolute part , they will undoubtedly prove very meek : He thinks the four regiments intended to relieve as many regiments in America , if sent to Boston , are sufficient to prevent disturbance . I wish you would see him , and hear his ideas as to the mode of compelling Boston to submit to whatever may be thought necessary ; indeed , all men seem now to feel that the fatal compliance in 1766 has encouraged the Americans annually to increase in their pretensions to that thorough independency which one state has of another , but which is quite subversive of the obedience which a colony owes to its mother country . " - Vol . I. p. 1 65 . Gage was an excellent specimen of those Englishmen who did so much toward effecting the separation of America from the British empire , - far more than all Americans could have done . He had served much here , and for many years he had held the highest military command in British America . He ought to have been able to give his master sound advice con* cerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the close of so long an intimacy with its people ; but he was as ignorant of the men with whom he had served and lived , and // whom he had helped misgovern , as if he had been living in India . The language he held to the king shows his ignorance of the people he was supposed to be the most competent to speak of with sense and intelligence . Instead of four regiments being " sufficient to prevent any disturbance , " it was soon made certain that forty regiments would not put an end to a disturbance that was destined to become a revolution . It is possible that Gage was not deceived , and that he played the courtier 's part , instead of the soldier 's , when face to face with his sovereign . But a more important visitor than General Gage entered the king 's closet , and did much to confirm the king 's conviction that he had to deal only with a wretched rabble in America . This was Thomas ilutchinson , one of the ablest and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might have prevented the Revolution , but he made it inevitable . The truth from his tongue might have caused even George III . to hesitate , and to seek a reconciliation with his American subjects . But the truth was the last thing that he thought of uttering in the royal closet . Whether it was that he did not understand the character of the crisis , or that irritation had lessened the powers of a great mind , he proceeded to talk to the king in the most absurd manner . On the 1st of July , 1774 , the king wrote to Lord North : " Lord Dartmouth brought Mr. ilutchinson , late Governor of Massachusetts Bay , too late to be presented at my levee ; but I desired he would introduce him in my closet , as I was desirous of hearing his account how matters were when he left his government , and am now well convinced they will soon submit ; he ownes the Boston Port Bill was the only wise and effectual method that could have been suggested for bringing them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislature will be a means of establishing some government in that Province , which till now has been one of anarchy . One of the regiments arrived the 1st of June , the day he sailed , and the people of Boston seemed much dispirited . " Such was the stuff with which the king 's mind was fed , and which was greedily swallowed , because it harmonized with his fixed opinions concerning America , - opinions which he could not bear // to have disturbed . This state of the royal mind must have been well known to the men who went to court ; and they were careful not to say anything that was calculated to disturb it . What the king wished to hear , that he heard . ilutchinson was too clever to be deceived to the extent of believing all that he said to the king , according to the king 's report of his representations . That he was to some extent the victim of self-deception may be admitted , without supposing he believed " the Boston Port Bill was the only wise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonists to a speedy submission . " If ilutchinson really was deceived to the extent the king 's letter implies , he must have begun early to suffer from the proverbial malady of exiles , that moral calenture which causes them to see in the land they have left whatever they wish there to see . In one sense he was not an exile , as he had been recalled by Lord North early in 1774 , " and both as a native of New England and from his official experience was justly regarded as able to advise on Colonial matters . " If the Premier required his presence from the belief that he could afford useful information to the home government , he made a fatal mistake , for Hutchinson was destined to be almost as effective an agent in bringing about the ruin of the ' English ascendency in America , as Father Petre had been in bringing about the ruin of the house of Stuart . There is no other important allusion to American affairs in his Majesty 's letters till the 18th of November , 1774 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fame . " The New England governments , " he then wrote , " are in a state of rebellion ; blows must decide whether they are to be subject to this country , or independent . From the time you first mentioned a wish that a major-general might be sent , I have had it in my thoughts , and am clear that Major-General Gisborne is the best qualified for the particular service ; if a second be necessary , Major-General Cunningham will do well ; but if it is absolutely necessary to send one who has already been in that country , Major-General Mackay is very proper ; but I should rather pitch on one of the others , as it is not a desirable commission . " The names of the military gentlemen preferred by // the king for command in America are unknown to history , and neither of the three had the post mentioned . It is a theme for speculation , what might have taken place had one of them been sent to Massachusetts at the close of 1774 . He could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to America , and by this date was falling under the royal displeasure ; for the king , on the 19th of November , wrote : " I return the private letters received from Lieutenant-General Gage ; his idea of suspending the acts appears to me the most absurd that can be suggested . The people are ripe for mischief , upon which the mother country adopts suspending the measures she has thought necessary : this must suggest to the Colonies a fear that alone prompts them to their present violence ; we must either master them , or totally leave them to themselves and treat them as aliens . I do not by this mean to insinuate that I am for advise advising new measures ; but I am for supporting those already undertaken . " Gage had found that the " lyons " were in no lamb-like humor , and saw reason for regretting he had used language of so sanguine a character in the royal closet ; his suggestions changed from day to day , and the king began to look upon him with contempt . Few important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ; but the character of the knowledge the king had of America can be judged from the gravity with which he declares ( January 23 , 1775 ) that " nothing can be more calculated to bring the Americans to a due submission than the very handsome majority that at the outset have appeared in both Houses of Parliament . " This was mistaking his own feelings for those of " the Americans . " The majorities in the Commons were indeed great , being 199 and 190 on two leading questions , and 190 on a third . The bill to restrain the trade and commerce of the New England Colonies was carried by a majority of 176 . Had it been possible to settle the dispute by the weight of Parliamentary majorities , there would have been no hope for the Colonists . These majorities had the effect of confirming the royal purpose , but , on the other hand , ' their effect in America was to confirm the purpose of the patriots to persist in resistance , because they showed that nothing could be had from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from these letters of all allusion to events which Americans consider of the first importance , and which had a great effect on the decision of the contest , is surprising . In those written in the summer and autumn of 1775 , nothing is said of the battles of Lexington and Bunker Hill , or of the operations of the Americans against Boston , then the only place held by the royal troops in force . The king has a great deal to say about recruiting , which did not go on well ; and as much about the hiring of German mercenaries , which went on better . Lord Barrington , Secretary at War , would have had operations confined to the sea and the American coast , believing that that would suffice to reduce " the rebels . " On the 8th of August , 1775 , he wrote to Lord North : " As it is the measure of government to have a large army in North America , it is my duty and inclination to make that measure succeed to the utmost ; though my opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans may be reduced by the fleet , but never can be by the army . " The king thought differently , and he took great interest in the business of buying mercenaries from those small German princes who dealt in men . The attempt to hire a large Russian force had failed ignominiously , probably because George III . did not know the kind of bribe that could not have failed with Catherine II. , or may have been disinclined to grant it . Had he told her that in return for aid in America he would give her aid in Turkey , there would have been no difficulty in coming to an understanding ; and Constantinople and the Bosporus might have been conquered ninety years since at New York and on the Hudson . No Russians being attainable , the German purchases were made with great rapidity , and on such terms as the men-sellers saw fit to ask . Some of the royal letters on this subject are literally disgusting , and are written in the spirit that moved . the slave-traders of Liverpool and Bristol when giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is right in saying that " the market-style " of one written on the 26th of August , 1775 , is worth comment . " As to the proposals transmitted by Mr. Rdmer , " writes the king , " they all end in corps of officers , which can not be done but by act of Parliament ; the only idea those Germans ought to addopt sic is // the being contractors for raising recruits and fixing the price they will deliver them at Hamburg , IRotterdam. , and any other port they may propose . Mr. Thmer seems alone to want to finger English money ; but that , I think , should be prevented by giving no money in hand , but promising to pay ? 10 per man ready money on the recruits being approved by the officers sent to receive them in those ports . " As the king knew that " the contractors for raising recruits " were kidnappers , and that many of the recruits " delivered " at certain ports were stolen , he was a party to transactions that were as dishonorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his doings in the American contest , this connection with the most odious ruffians of the European continent was the worst . His action brought its own punishment , for it exasperated the Americans , and made their reduction impossible . They saw that without the purchase of mercenaries the king could not have kept up an effective force in their country for six months , and they knew that the supply of such tools could not be maintained . They had but to persevere to be victorious , and they did persevere until they had beaten the sovereign who had given them up to be butchered . A change that took place in the British Cabinet in November , 1775 , showed that the king was firm in his intention to subdue the Colonists to his will . The Duke of Grafton , who disapproved of his policy , resigned the Privy Seal , and was succeeded by Lord Dartmouth , whose place as American Secretary was given to Lord George Germaine , the most unpopular man in the empire , but who was a man after the king 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well for the Americans that we can afford to let him pass . Surprisingly little is said about American* affairs in the letters written during the critical year 1776 . The Declaration of Independence is not mentioned . On the 4th of November the king writes : " Nothing can have been better planned , nor with more alacrity executed , than the taking of the city of New York , and I trust the rebell army will soon be dispersed . " On the 13th of December he wrote a letter that shows the troubles that existed in the royal army , and that General Carleton , the ablest of its officers , was suffering from " great // prejudice , perhaps not unaccompanied with rancor , in a certain breast , " meaning Lord George Germaine . This animosity of the American Secretary toward Carleton had grave consequences , as it prevented that commander from having sole charge of the movement which was conducted to so disastrous a close by General Burgoyne , in 177L* " Perhaps Carleton may be too cold , " wrote the king , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may make it advisable to have the part of the Canadian army which must attempt to join General Howe led by a more enterprising commander Burgoyne may command the corps to be sent from Canada to Albany , and Phillips must remain with Carleton in Canada . " A more fatal decision than this was never taken in war . It shows that the king and Lord George Germaine were as ignorant of the characters and capacities of their chief military agents as they were of the country in which those agents were employed . On the 1st of January , 1777 , the king was so confident that he expressed the hope that war might be made to support war in America , being moved by the discovery that the contractors continued to deliver " such bad biscuit and flour after the repeated directions given by the Board of Treasury ; but I trust , " he proceeds to say , " Sir William Howe is now in possession of so extensive a country that he will not require to be entirely provided from Europe ; I have seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extend from the river Delaware to Rhode Island ; consequently my opinion seems well grounded . " The first news of Trenton did not disturb him , as he wrote encouragingly about it on the 24th of February , adding : " I wish * Carleton had been one of the witnesses against Lord George Germaine ( then Lord George Sackville ) , when he was before a conrt-martial , in 1760 , on the charge , virtually , of cowardice at the battle of Minden . He was not the man ever to forgive one who had borne testimony against him , and it is certain that his enmity for Carleton had great effect on the course of the American war . Carleton never would have got the army into the predicament that followed from Burgoyne 's bad generalship , and which forced it to surrender ; and if that surrender had not taken place , the French alliance would have been postponed , perhaps never would have become an historical fact . Without the French alliance , though the English never could have conquered America , the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus the appointment of Lord George Germaine to the American Secretaryship became one of the gravest incidents of the war , the effect of which never will cease to be felt . // Sir W. Howe had placed none but British troops in the outposts ; but I am certain by a letter I have seen from Lord Cornwallis that the rebells will soon have sufficient reason to fall into the former dejection . " That very extension of the royal posts over which his Majesty had rejoiced was the cause of the defeat at Trenton ; and what happened immediately afterward at Princeton showed that it was not Hessians alone who could be surprised and beaten . During 1777 , the references in this correspondence to the American war are very meagre , though it was the year of Brandywine , Saratoga , and Germantown , and of the occupation of Philadelphia by Sir William Howe . On the 4th of December , after news of Burgoyne 's surrender had reached England , the king wrote : " I can not help just taking up your time for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your . speech ; the manly , firm , and dignified part you took brought the House to see the present misfortune in true light , as very serious , but not without remedy ; it may very probably on due consideration , which I trust all in my service will be willing to give , in the end prove the wisest step in our present situation to act only on the defensive with the army , and with great activity as to the troops . Canada , Nova Scotia , the Floridas , New York , and Rhode Island must probably be the stations ; but those who have served in those parts , particularly Lord Amherst , must be consulted , and will be able to point out what is best . " The subdued tone of this letter , written two days after news of Saratoga had been received in London , shows that the royal mind was not altogether inaccessible to the logic of kings . On the British people the effect of the news was different . They came forward with men and money , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fifteen thousand soldiers added to the forces of the state . " But fifty thousand new soldiers would not have sufficed to meet the new demands that were to be made on British exertions . France now became a principal party to the war , and was followed by Spain , and then by Holland ; and Ireland , taking charge of her pwn affairs , raised an army for her own defence , but one which was as dangerous to England as to England 's enemies . Such were the consequences of the king 's folly in seeking to enslave America , and in resolving to rule as well as to reign . // George III . did not approve of his Minister 's famous attempt to conciliate the Americans , made in 1778 , though he submitted to it , so much had misfortune changed his purpose . " You will remember , " he wrote on the 31st of January , 1778 , " that before the recess I strongly advised you not to bind yourself to bring forward a proposition for restoring tranquillity to North America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind never harbored , but from perceiving that whatever can be proposed will be liable not to bring America back to a sense of attachment to the mother country , yet to dissatisfy this country , which has in the most handsome manner chearfully carried on the contest , and therefore has a right to have the struggle continued untill convinced that it is in vain . " It must be admitted that on this point the king was wiser than his Minister . He anticipated the contemptuous reception the conciliatory project was destined to find in America , and which greatly injured England 's reputation . That Lord North , who despaired of success , should have taken a different view , is not the least of the proofs which these volumes afford that he was out of his place when he was at the head of the British Ministry . Nine days later , alarmed by the prospect of a French war , the king urged Lord North not to delay bringing forward his American proposition . On the 13th of March he wrote that " it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all for a defensive war , except that he would attack the French islands , and employ the fleet and a small military force " to destroy the ports and warfs of the rebels . " Such was his notion of " great war . " He had no plan of operations , and changed his mind as to the best mode of proceeding every week , or oftener . In August , after it had become clear that the British Commissioners had failed , he said the news seemed " to put a final stop to all negotiation , " adding , " Further negotiation is a joke* ' ; and expressing his readiness to abandon even New York . He would close the French war first , and , if that should be successful , " the rebels " would be obliged to submit to more reasonable terms than could be obtained in 1778 . He was hopelessly beaten , and all the after bloodshed that took place was nothing but a tribute to his vanity and egotism . He had succeeded in nothing but in keeping Lord North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it shows how great was his power that he was able to carry on the conflict for almost four years after it must have been known to every public man in the kingdom that it could have but one issue , and when he had admitted to his chief Minister that success could not be expected . The events of the war in 1779 and 1780 , especially in the latter year , were of a character to encourage the king to keep up his armies in America , on the chance that the Americans might be worn out , and , to borrow a modern form of words , demand peace at any price . The successes that attended British operations in Georgia and the Carolinas gave rise to the delusion that the Southern Colonies , as the king persisted in calling them , might be separated from their associates , and perhaps the latter be conquered in time . There was something plausible in this view of the subject , and it tended to keep the king hopeful . What his ideas were in 1779 appears from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deliberation , and which is the most remarkable epistle in this collection . We give most of it , as it must be considered the king 's statement of his case , set forth under circumstances and conditions which preclude the possibility of hypocrisy , as the writer of it , with his notions of the sacredness of everything that pertained to royalty , never could have supposed it would be placed before the world . It is one of the most curious of those revelations which modern research among old papers is constantly laying open to the eyes of mankind , in illustration of Oxenstiern 's creed , that but a small amount of wisdom goes to the government of men . " I should think it the greatest instance among the many I have met with of ingratitude and injustice , if it could be supposed that any man in my dominions more ardently desired the restoration of peace and solid happiness in every part of this empire than I do ; there is no personal sacrifice I could not readily yield for so desirable an object ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the present difficulties , which certainly keep my mind very far from a state of ease , can incline me to enter into what I look upon as the destruction of the empire . I have heard Lord North frequently drop that the advantages to be gained by this contest could never repay the expense ; I owne that , let any war be ever so successful , if persons will sit down and weigh the ex // 378 Oct. penses , they will find , as in the last , that it has impoverished the state , enriched individuals , and perhaps raised the name only of the conquerors ; but this is only weighing such events in the scale of a tradesman behind his counter ; it is necessary for those in the station it has pleased Divine Providence to place me to weigh whether expenses , though very great , are not sometimes necessary to prevent what might be more ruinous to a country than the loss of money . The present contest with America I can not help seeing as the most serious in which any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consequences that they must be examined to feel its real weight . Whether the laying a tax was deserving all the evils that have arisen from it , I should suppose no man could alledge that without being thought more fit for Bedlam than a seat in the senate ; but step by step the demands of America have risen : independence is their object ; that certainly is one which every man not willing to sacrifice every object to a momentary and inglorious peace must concur with me in thinking that this country can never submit to : should America succeed in that , the West Indies must follow them , not in independence , but must for its own interest be dependent on North America . Ireland would soon follow the same plan and be a separate state ; then this island would be reduced to itself ; and soon would be a poor island indeed , for , reduced in her trade , merchants would retire with their wealth to climates more to their advantage , and shoals of manufacturers would leave this country for the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can arise should the Almighty permit every event to turn out to our disadvantage ; consequently this country has but one sensible , one great line to follow , the being ever ready to make peace when to be obtained without submitting to terms that in their consequences must annihilate this empire , and with firmness make every effort to deserve success . " - Vol . II . pp. 253 , 254 . The editor says : " Sir James Mackintosh observes that the letter of the 11th of June is not the composition of George the Third . ' The original is , however , in his Majesty 's handwriting ; and as he intimates that it was deliberately composed , the absence of ungrammatical or confused sentences may be ac - counted for without resorting to Sir James 's supposition . The king , when he took time , did not write ill. " lie is right . The letter is the king 's own . We attach no weight to the circumstance that the handwriting is his , for he might have copied it from another 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is irresistible . It is the most characteristic letter // in the whole series . It is the king 's work , both in matter and in manner ; and , looking back over the ninety years ' advantage we have of him , we are astonished that even he should have been of the opinion that the greatness , or rather the very existence , of England should depend upon the favorable issue of a contest in which marked success for her was impossible . But he was not more ignorant of the future than were most of his subjects , including the greater number of leading statesmen . Even Lord Shelburne , echoing Lord Chatham , took the king 's view of the necessity of retaining America in order that England might not sink into insignificance ; but Lord Shelburne was the wisest political economist of his time , while the king and Lord Chatham knew nothing of economical science . It would have required that one should return from the dead to convince the king of Great Britain and the Earl of Chatham that what they most dreaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Heaven could send upon it . Yet so it was , and the king lived long enough , and had the enjoyment of his senses long enough , to see that such was the fact . But the king 's letter is of value as showing that he was not altogether selfish in his obstinate purpose of not admitting the independence of America . He assumes something of the patriotic character , even in Ameri*can eyes , when we learn that it was not for his personal dignity he was contending , according to the common opinion , but for the welfare of his country , as he understood it . It is not necessary to make further extracts from the king 's letters , nor do they contain much more that relates specifically to American business . Other matters were pressing upon the royal mind with a force that would not be denied . Occasionally the king expresses a sort of Micawberish belief that something will " turn up " in America to his advantage . Thus , in December , 1779 , he writes : " II do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than perhaps at any other period , " - a belief in which , we may be sure , Lord North did not share . On the 26th of September , 1780 , he says : " The French never could stand the cold of Germany ; that of America must be more fatal to them . America is distressed to the greatest degree . " In the same letter he says the number of // troops sent to America that year was prodigious . Referring to an attempt to bring the war to a close , he wrote , October 31 , 1780 : ' " Whilst the House of Bourbon make American independency an article of their propositions , no event can ever make me a sharer in such a negociation . " The time , however , was close at hand when an event compelled him to treat , with that article of the highest prominence in the propositions that came from his foes , including the House of Bourbon . Perhaps the only specimen of humor that can lie found in these letters occurs in one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Lord North was one of the Secretaries of State in the Coalition Ministry . " Undoubtedly , " writes the king , " the Americans can not expect , nor ever will receive , any favor from me ; but the permitting them to obtain men unworthy to remain in this island I shall certainly consent to . " This must refer to some project for disposing of those convicts of which England has for ages produced so large annual crops , - a subject that gave her government much trouble after the loss of her American Colonies . The humor is grim , and bears no resemblance to that of which his son and successor was so great a master ; but Americans can smile over it , knowing that the joke was not entirely on the side of the vanquished monarch . This Correspondence is admirably edited , the manner in which Mr. Bodham IDonne , has performed an important task showing how judicious was the selection of a man of so much scns3 and knowledge for its performance . Duller letters than those of George III. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the momentous nature of many of the subjects . to which they relate suffices to make them interesting . But the political history of a most important part of one of the most important reigns in English history is given by the editor of the Correspondence in a manner as entertaining as it is instructive . Familiar with the historical and political literature of the reign of George III. , Mr. Bodham Donne has used his knowledge so as to keep his readers well advised of all that is going on while the king is writing to his Minister . Many of the letters serve as texts for statements of facts , or for judicious comments or remarks . The elaborate Introduction which prefaces the Correspondence enables even the most superficially // informed reader to understand the state of affairs when the king has at last obtained a Minister after his own mind , and from whom he never would have parted could he have had his own way in all things . The Introduction is indeed an excellent piece of political and historical writing , and its perusal creates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose acquaintance with English history is so extensive , and whose mind is at once critical and liberal , may employ his time and his powers on a higher work than that through which he is now known to the world . The opinions of the editor are of the liberal school of politics . He writes of the American contest with as much sense as spirit . In thus writing , he represents the sentiments of enlightened men of all parties , in both England and America . It is very seldom that men come to one opinion concerning the character and the consequences of a great contest , the event of which was decided by the sword , after a long war , which had been preceded by a much longer and not less bitter combat of words and phrases . The judgment of the world with respect to the American Revolution is one of the very few exceptions to the rule . We can not agree as to the merits of that conflict of opinion which had its decision at Pharsalia ; but among reasonable men there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was successful at Saratoga . Englishmen and Americans are at one on this point . And why should they not be ? The . war of the American Revolution , so far as it concerned Americans and Englishmen , was a civil war , and whatever is of great and good in its history is the common property of both . The valor of the two armies belongs to the common stock of the martial virtues of that race . It is the belief of all intelligent , reasonable Englishmen , that their country 's failure here was the best thing that could have happened for themselves . Their cause triumphed as much as ours . Nor is there anything in the military history of the Revolutionary war that ought to be mortifying to Englishmen . The event was adverse to their country 's arms , but it was so under circumstances that made success impossible from the first ; and victory and defeat were not unequally distributed between the contending armies . Men of no mean intellectual // rank - Lord Macaulay and Mr. Thackeray were of their number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British forces been better commanded , - had Wolfe not been shot by the French , or had Clive not shot himself , - or if the wind had blown from the northeast for a month in a certain year , instead of blowing from the southwest ; but it is idle talking , for the issue of the contest was fixed by physical facts before a gun was fired . The English were too far removed from the scene of action to admit of their superiority in numbers and wealth being made available in an age when steam-navigation was unknown . They were beaten by the same pptent foes fhat overcame Napoleon 's power in Russia , - space and time . They would have been beaten had they been led by Marlborough or Wellington . Such being the fact , Englishmen of to-day can look back to the American Revolution , if not with complacency , at least with calmness , and deduce from its history the sound conclusion never again to engage in a distant contest with men of their own blood , who are as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be impossible to enslave , even were they overcome in the field .
