txt LKOLI . InCISION ON TON WARICHOUSING SYSTEM . ? New-York importers will be interested in a decision which we publish this morning , made by Judge NELSON , in the United States Circuit Court . It seems that since the warehous.ing system was introduced , it has been not an unfrequent thing fur merchants to enter their goods for warehousing , but before the goods were discharged from the vessels , to change their minds , and desire to enter them for consumption , possibly having sold them . On application to the Collector for liberty to change the entry of their goods in this way , they are informed that they can be allowed to do it upon payme:tt of half a month 's storage . This is in accordance with a regulation of the Treasury Department , made some years ago . The'plaintiffs in the case in question , being in this kosition , paid the half-month 's storage to Mr. SCUELL , who was then Collector , but they paid it under protest , and brought suit against hire to recover it as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , decides that there is no shadow of law for any such charge , and that the Collector might as well demand $100 or any other sum as the half month 's storage ; but he gives judgment for the defendant on the ground that it was not an involuntary payment , because the plaintiffs could have got their goods through the warehouse ; and , moreover , as the charge " is imposed by a regulation of the Treasury , it is fair to presume that it goes to the Government , " and the Collector ought not to be sued for it . We incline , for our part , to think that the presumption is fully as strong that it does not go to the Government , especially when . we see in another part of the Judge 's opinion that " the Government has no interest in the warehousing business . " The result of the Judge 's view of thelaw , however , will be . that for all sums so paid heretofore the importers are without remedy . Whether they can , by the aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties which appeared in this case , remains to be seen . But we submit , to the Secretary of the Treasury that this regulation should not be allowed to stand a moment after such a decision as this . Here is a charge decided by the Circuit Court to be entirely without law  --  a mere taking of money from the pockets of importers simply because they desire something which the Government is not , perhaps , compelled to give , but the giving of which , as Judge NeeSON says , " adds nothing to the labor or trouble of the ? Moors of the Customs . " it Is hence* the dignity of a Glovemmest like oars It should rather be earnest to accommodate the citizen without extra charge , where there is no extra trouble . And the Secretary of the Treasury should lose no time in ordering the discontinuance of this " imposition , " as Judge NIMSON , with a doubtless unconscious double entendre , calls it .                  @ @ @
