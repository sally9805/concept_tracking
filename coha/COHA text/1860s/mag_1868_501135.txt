IN these latter days , when , all things tend so strongly to a positive and unbounded materialism ; when we believe what we see , and touch , and taste ; when we note that gold represents , as it never did so fully before , the sum total of earthly bliss , it may not be unwise torecall the fact that there is an unseen , a strange , a mysterious , a potent influence , which from time to time sweeps across the field of earthly experience , producing profound and inexplicable results ; it may be well to know that at such times men have been moved by ternble throes , mastered , apparently , and controlled by influences stronger than their own powerful natures , and that then aspiration soars , while the soul glows as if touched by fire . XVe can hardly hope to solve , to explain this mysterious riddle ; but by briefly recounting some of these surprising manifestations , something may be done toward provoking other minds more able to cope with it , to make all plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year of financial distress and wide-spread ruin to the mercantile world . In August of that year the Ohio Life and Trust Company collapsed , and many men found they had built up heaps of sand which were suddenly swept away from under their feet , leaving them prostrate . The distress arising from the ruin of prosperity is probably more poignant than actual hunger , when it does not reach starvation ; who , except those who have felt it , can describe it ? It was in October of this year that Mr. Lamphier , a missionary of the Dutch Reformed Church , thought , in his own heart , that an hour of daily prayer would bring consolation to afflicted business men . He proceeded , in his small way , to make his thought a fact . He invited a few to meet in the consistory of the church in William street ; three persons came , and they prayed . The next meeting was of six , the next of twenty . But a few weeks saw a crowd of anxious and earnest men , assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper room of this old church . Bear it in mind that these were men , hard business men , not sentimentalists , or women of leisure looking for excitement ; men who all their lives had been dealing with cotton and molasses and iron and stocks ; men who had believed in the gospel of gold . Yet here they were on their knees , and among them were those whose lips were unsealed , out of whose mouths came strange , unaccustomed words of longing and prayer . This influence spread , and in a few days the passages were crowded , so that they could not get in . Then the Methodist church in John street , and the Reformed Dutch church in Fulton street were opened daily . The hour of noon struck , and crowds were seen thronging the lately-neglected aisles ; crowds marked by what ? Not those who came to see a fine spectacle , to hear entrancing music , to listen to eloquent sermons : not at all ; but simply to hear // some earnest soul pour forth the burning longings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for blessedness , for salvation . Too often these are formal , canting words , which mean almost nothing ; and they fall upon stony ground , ears filled with other sounds . Now it was not so ; a strange influence went forth with them ; men heard , they heeded ; poor as the words too often were , they seemed radiant with a kind of holy light which made them to glow and burn and warm ; so that men heard them , and pondered them , and , indeed , made them tapers to light up within their own souls the fires which had so long lain dark and smouldering . The fires spread , and , indeed , started up spontaneously . The merchants of Chambers street went to Mr. Burton ( March , 1858 ) , and proposed to hire his theatre . " XVhat for ? " " For a prayer-meeting . " " A w-h-a-t ? " " For a prayer-meeting . " Burton was a rough man , not used to the praying mood ; but he not only leased them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For an hour before noon the crowd began to assemble , so that by twelve o clock the house was packed from pit to gallery , with such a crowd as never was seen in that theatre before ; carriages lined the street , and often as many as fifty clergymen were present to join in the exercises . Noonday prayer-meetings were now held all through the winter at various points , at Centre street near the Tombs , at Duane street , at Greenwich street ; in many other places near the business centre of the city . Not only came merchants to spend their hour of noon here , but mechanics stole half of their dinner time to come ; and all over the city this thing went on . Various agencies set themselves to work ; energetic business men , energetic aldermen even , organized themselves into a " flying artillery , " and went from place to place , from church to church , all over the town , to move forward or to initiate this surprising work . The firemen held prayer-meetings , so did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places for public prayer , in printing offices and other places where were large numbers of workmen , impromptu prayer-meetings were organized , and it is doubtful whether under heaven ever was seen such a sight as went on in the city of New York in the winter and spring of the year 1857- ' 58 . Brooklyn followed , and soon , indeed , led ; so that a weekly bulletin of the places for midday prayer was posted at the ferry landings , at the railroad offices , and at other public places . We come now to another fact in this curious history . It is this : that from New York as the centre , the mysterious influence spread abroad till it penetrated all New England in the East , southward as far as Virginia and even beyond , westward to Buffalo , Cincinnati , Chicago , St. Louis ; and in every great town and small town the thing went on , in open day and now at various hours of the day . Those who could not come at noon came in the morning* and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Philadelphia , over three thousand met daily in Jayne 's Hall , at the hour of noon . In Cleveland , two tho9sand met daily , in the mornings , on the way to their business . In Chicago , assemblages of more than two thousand met daily at midday ; and so it went on , until it became literally true that there was a line of prayer-meetings all the way from Omaha to Washington City . Even the 23 // Unitarians of Boston , fastidious and conservative as they are reputed to be , held meetings like the rest . It would be impossible here to begin to tell of all that was done ; and , indeed , we must hasten forward to touch upon some other interesting points of this interesting subject . But many may say , " But all this subsided , and men went on as before ; and was nothing accom-plished ? " Who can tell what was accomplished ? It is possible only to give a few of the statements made at the time , which seem worthy of credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , based upon answers to inquiries made to various ministers of churches , which said that in that town were some " twenty-eight hundred hopeful conversions . " In Cleveland , " eight hundred persons have recently been received into the evangelical churches . " " In the Congress street Methodist Church ( Detroit ) over one hundred and forty conversions have taken place . " " A man in Bath converted his bar-room into a place of prayer. ** Now this went on all over the land , and thousands , perhaps hundreds of thousands , were converted to what is termed a religious life . Members of churches were multiplied , and , for a time at least , men and women forgot their earthly and sordid desires , and were moved by heavenly hopes . What number fell away and went back to earthly and sordid pursuits it would be impossible to say ; doubtless it was large . But surely a large number also remained , and lived a certain new life . The peculiarity of this " Revival "  --  and it is a striking one-is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery , no preaching , no shouting , no sensuous appliances , no appeal to fears . It may be said , if it can ever be said , that there was a peculiar influx of divine spirit , and that the Wind of God sw'ej5t over the earth . Sceptical persons may here say- " Why should God 's spirit be poured out at one time and upon one people more than another , " and may deny that it is so . That question will be touched upon hereafter ; it will hardly be answered . This strange movement of the soul subsided , and has not been since repeated . Let us now touch upon another phase of this matter . In the early part of the eighteenth century , as all know , appeared in England and America two remarkable and most irregular preachers , John Wesley* and George Whitefleld.j Both were in and of the English Church , but both worked outside the church . Both went out into highways and hedges to preach salvation , and repentance , and faith , and hope . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sect of Arminian Methodists , and Whitefield originated and established another form-that of Calvanistic Methodism . At the outset of their work they cooperated ; afterward Whitefleld went through the then settled portions of America , drawing vast crowds to his open-air preaching , while Wesley drew equally great crowds to hear him in the fields and lanes of Old England . Whitefield was unquestionably the greater sensational preacher of the two , perhaps as great as any who ever lived , but his preaching was not attended by such surprising phenomena as marked the calmer and more logical preaching of Wesley . These were some of the surprising phenomena : On the common at Bristol he preached from the text , " When they had nothing to pay , he frankly forgave * Born 1703. t Born 1714. // them both . " Some six persons sank down in great agony , and uttered piercing cries for mercy . On the same day , at Gloucester lane , some nine others were thus affected , one of whom was a young woman of the better class , whose mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few moments this mother herself dropped down and lost her senses suddenly , and at last went home with her daughter singing praises of joy . Not only were women so affected , but strong , bold , bad men were felled as by a blow , and as many as twenty at a time might be seen lying on the ground as if dead . There are many such instances as these . A weaver , who had a great dislike to dissenters , used his efforts to discourage them ; one of the converts lent him one of Wesley 's sermons ; while reading it , he turned pale , fell to the floor , and cried out , K'vlercy , mercy . " When he recovered his self-possession he praised God . Another case was that of a woman who remonstrated with some of her sex for giving way to such foolish excitement . She escaped from the meeting in some disgust , when she , too , fell to the ground in as violent agony as any . Why multiply examples ? Whitefield was astonished at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen no such results from his own preaching . But it came Whitefleld 's day for preaching . No sooner had he begun to invite all sinners to believe in Christ than four persons sank down close to him almost in the same moment . One of them lay without either sense or motion . The third had strong convulsions all over his body , but made no noise unless by groans . The fotfrth , equally convulsed , ( : alled upon God with strong cries and tears . " From this time , " continues Wesley , " I trust we shall all suffer God to carry on his own work in the way that pleaseth him . " Here , then , we have a class of phenomena differing from those of the great revival of i857 ; in that they were clearly j5roduced by the preaching of powerfully excited men . They were produced by words , gestures , voice , eye-by the personal magnetism of such men as Whitefield and Wesley . If not produced , they were developed , in some such way as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , causing explosion . They were produced , and , what is still more remarkable , they were unintentional results , uneay5ectec4 not sought for on the part of the preachers themselves . They were as unaccountable to them as to the subjects themselves . But one and all were ready to believe them caused by an especial and peculiar outpouring of the Spirit of God , and in some inexplicable way , a manifestation of God in response to the prayers and preachings of men . They were ready to believe that except for these prayers and this preaching God would not have so shown himself and , therefore , that sklch a number of conversions would not have been made , or such a number of souls been saved . They were thus encouraged and upheld in their work of evangelizing mankind , and went on with renewed zeal and power in their peculiar undertaking . We come now to another class of phenomena  --  to Revivals or Awakenings to produce conversions , and to insure salvation , which were the result of t5redetermination ; to Revivals which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood ! " There have sprung up from time to time in America , more than elsewhere , a class of men who are known as " Revival Preachers . " They are well represented by Cartwright , Finney and Elder Knapp . What moved them to enter upon the task of an Evangelist we need not here inquire . But the fact remains that entering upon it , following it , and persisting in it , they produced startling results . // They were wont to go to-day to the most benighted or the most incredulous region , there to begin to preach and to pray , to shout , to sing , to indulge in violent gestures , to excite the ears and assault the brain not only with argument and appeal , hut with noise and clamor also . They induced people to come to hear in every possible way ; they furnished novelty , excitement , and at times almost descended to burlesque , to attract those who could be drawn by no higher motive . They succeeded . People came , and often in crowds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " babbler " Paul would say . These preachers had few or none of the graces and arts of oratory ; they were not always select in their words ; they might sometimes make the judicious grieve , but they were strong , earnest , impetuous , moving , pathetic , fierce , tender , terrific-any or all of these at times to suit the occasion or to impress the audience . In their own way they preached " Christ crucified ; " in their own way they bore down upon the hearts and consciences of men , and they bore hard to move them to abandon the lusts of the flesh , and the lusts of the eye , and the pride of life , and to put on them the white robes of godliness . In their own way . they set forth the wretchedness of the selfish and worldly-minded , and pictured the blessedness , and peace and glory of the converted soul ; and in all ways they were masters of ; they moved men to turn their backs upon the low and beastly , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To show how these men worked , let us read a few passages from the " Autobiography of Elder Jacob Knapp , ' just published : About this time ( 1832- ' 34 ) I attended a meeting at Rutland Hill , Jefferson County preachii*g in the Congregational church . I labored ten days , and was blessed with only five converts . The place was overrun with infidelity and Universalism . In the evening all turned out and filled the house . Many were somewhat affected , but they did not break down . In those days , ten days were thought to be a long time in which to protract religious services . Three days ' meetings were considered all that could be profitably sustained . During these ten days we had all worked very hard , and were greatly worn down . We had not husbanded our strength . I had preached three times every day ; and the brethren had prayed as long and as loud as they could , and some half dozen of them had kept it up day and night . We were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took counsel of ourselves and of God as to what course to pursue . We remembered the promise , " In due time we shall reap if we faint not . " So we concluded to take God at his word , and " go forward . " I wept to the pulpit , and the helpers went to the anxious-room . About twenty inquirers were present . They induced them all to kneel down ; one of the inquirers summoned courage to open his mouth in prayer . He was at once set at liberty , and broke forth into earnest prayer for the salvation of others ; these in turn went to praying for themselves , and as " God turned their captivity " they , too , prayed for their friends , until the whole twenty were brought to rejoice in the Saviour . After I had concluded the preachin* service , many of the unconverted , attracted by the voice of prayer , went into the anxious-room . Several of them fell on their knees and cried aloud for mercy . The converts began to plead with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrender their hearts to Christ . The brethren could only " stand still and see the salvation of God . " The good work went on with increasing power , much as on the day of Pentecost . Infidelity turned pale , and Universalism gave up the ghost . It was a time of deep heart-searching among Christians . One lady , a member in good standing in the Congregational church , came to me and said she thought she was not a Christian , and wanted to know what she should " do to be // saved . " I told her to go to God and cry for help . She went to her chamber , in the same nouse in which I was boarding . and , falling on her knees , continued in prayer for the space of two hours , when a sister came to me , and expressed her fears that the lady was *ving , and asked me to go to her room and see what could be done . I found her still in a pleading posture , agony depicted on her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak above a whisper . At first , I was alarmed , fearing she might die , and that her death would be attributed to me . I was on the point of requesting her to cease her supplications ; but this text broke upon my ears in peals of thunder , " The bruised reed he will not break , and the smoking flax he will not quench till he send forth judgment unto victory . " I then said , " God will not break the bruised reed , and God forbid that I should quench the smoking flax ; let judgment come forth unto victory . " In a few moments , her countenance changed , a haavenly smile came over her whole face , and she began to whisper , " Blessed Saviour ! sweet Jesus all is well-all is well ! " From that day to the *ast of my knowledge of her , she testified her conviction that never till then had she seen the preciousness of Christ as her atoning Saviour . To some this story will seem the work of a canting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it intolerable . They will say that all such things ought to be put a stop to ; that they are the work of the devil rather than of God . I have given so much of the Elder 's account because it showsFirst , the machinery and sensuous methods which he employed ; Second , that persistence in all this produced results ; and Third , that these things did produce a conviction of sin and a conversion to holiness , or something very like it . For myseW while I could do nothing of the sort , I am not prepared to say that Elder Knapp ought not to have done it . I am not prepared to say that it was all excitement , and produced no permanent good ; hut , on the contrary , I can not doubt that many did from this time date " a change of heart , " and did live a better life . I am convinced , also , that so long as men have bodi*s as well as minds and souls , so long their sensuous natures will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hearts will be reached , i*z a degree , by arousing their sensuous natures . For this reason , I can not but believe in a harmony of colors , in a harmony of sounds , and in the persuasive influences of pleasant surroundings . It is unquestionably true that men are much more likely to receive your truth favorably with well-filled stomachs than with empty ones ; the benign influence of dinners ms well known ; soup may be a vehicle of Christian truth to the hungry hotly ; strawberries do make children good , kind , obedient ; sugar soothes the sorrows of the heart . He is a dull soul , then , who neglects these things who says only pooh-pooh when he hears strange stories . Why may not Elder Knapp and his friends shout themselves hoarse ? Why may he not do it for ten days without stopping if he believes he can thus penetrate the ears of the ungodly ? Why may not the fervent Methodists call in the aid of delicious groves to help them in getting their people together ? As at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groves ? Why may not the devout Catholic fill his temple with glorious pictures , which , through the eye , may carry sense to the brain ? Why may we not , any of us who can , shout and sing , with such voices as we have-Glory Hallelujah ! All these things may he foolishness to God , and may seem foolishness to the highly intellectual saint ; but does not the Bible speak of/ireacking , too , as foolishness ? // These things , if they do not help God , may help us ; and if they do , who is to gainsay it ? The mystery of this complex creature called man no one has yet been able to fathom , nor is it likely that any one ever will . What is soul and what is body no man can define . It is one of the old mysteries , and it is even a present mystery , why mind and soul grow out of weakness into strength just as fast and in the same measure as the body grows out of weakness into strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decay and even seem to go to nothing , just as the body decays and sinks into weakness and age . Whence comes the soul ? XVhv is it so intermingled with this earthly body ? What becomes of the soul in so many cases , when it seems to have vanished while the body still lives on ? These are questions which have never been answered . But are we materialists therefore ? And do we say that there is no soul-that it is all body , all material , all earthly ? We do not ; we know , if we know anything , through our profoundest consciousness , that it is not so . We do not argue it , we do not attempt to prove what , perhaps , can not be proven , because the soul is intangible , immortal . But we rest assured that there is in each and all of us soul or spirit-that it interpenetrates and coexists with body , and that in some way it continues when the body ceases to live . No man fully comprehends his own nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detect his selfish from his generous motives ; no man can be thoroughly unselfish , no man thoroughly spiritual . It is simply impossible while the earthly nature , with all its earthly wants , envelops us as a cloud . We eat , we breathe , we taste , we smell the beautiful earth ; we desire it , we use it , we can not live without it ; we should not be men if we were not earthly as well as heavenly . To speak roughly , man seems to be a combination of God and , devil . There are in every man the two natures , the carnal and the spiritual . He is capable of being more beastly than the beast , or as holy , almost , as an angel of light . There seems to be on in each man a contest between the hWh and the going low , between the spiritual and the sensual , the noble and the base , the generous and the mean , the light and the dark ; and this has been going on through all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in India as Brahma and Siva ; in Persia as Ormuzd and Ahriman ; in Egypt as Osiris and Typho ; in Scandinavia as Odin and Loke ; with us as God and Satan . It has even come to pass that men have believed the evil deity the stronger , as among the iVlanicheans , and have offered their children to it , as to Moloch . Now , as all men seek their own good and love their own blessedness , it is safe to say that men would choose good rather than evil , it they were only wise enough to know what was good , what evil . The selfishness of man 's nature is after a sort of divine instinct , which , if enlightened by the heavenly spirit . would make us seek the good rather than the bad , would make virtue sweet and vice bitter , would make the hurt of another a wound to ourselves . But there has been no way yet discovered to make men wise ; no contrivance has yet been bit upon which will convince a Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , none to persuade an American not to barter soul and body for wealth , none to induce an Irishman not to drink whiskey , none to satisfy a woman that it is better to be browned by the sun than to be bleached like a ghost , none to stop a child from gorging itself with candy . Why God , who made us , should have left us so foolish , is one of the mysteries // which has never been solved ; one which I shall not attempt to solve . It is only so . When we are young we have ideas , more or less vague , that the perfection of humanity on this earth is to be in the progress of the ages ; as we grow old we abandon the idea , for we see that each child born begins , as his father began , in weakness and ignorance , and stumbles and blunders through life . It knows nothing , and it has what ? Appetites . It has no instinct to teach it as the ox has , what is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe its father and mother , even if its father and mother knew , as so few do . Half of all children then die before they are five years old , the other half grow up with weakened or ruined digestions , with nerves on edge , with minds clouded , with souls jangled . Out of these darkened and disordered bodies and souls , come all sorts of foul beliefs , and inordinate desires , and wretched fears , and perhaps-fearful crimes . So I conclude that he who at the age of twenty starts with a good digestion , with a harmonious body , is blessed ; and that to him all things are possibleeven a great measure of enjoyable work , even high and gratified aspirations . I would never despair of such a man or woman , and they will never despair of themselves . If I were king of a country I would encourage that breed ; and if I were a despot no others should marry in my dominions . What an inconsistent thing ! Man will travel miles , will spend years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve a good breed of sheep , or a fine stock of cows ; no labor is too great , no cost too heavy . It is not unlikely that this very man will marry a poor , nervous , feeble woman , and raise up around his altar a poor , feeble , nervous race of boys and girls . And yet one noble , brave man , one beautiful , generous woman , is worth all the oxen and ewes that ever browsed on any man 's hill-sides . Such creatures we are ! Assuming , then , that there is and has ever been this strnggle going on in every man and in every woman , such as I have endeavored to make plain , we come to the subject of conversion , as hidden a mystery as any , yet a fact . Every kind of definition and explanation have been made for conversion . It has been described as " spiritual motion ; " while the next step , regeneration , has been called " spiritual change " - that is , regeneration is the completion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the author of it , " has been generally held ; in other words , man can not convert and regenerate himself . So then his conversion and regeneration would seem to be the act of God , not of man . This is an awkward dilemma for man , and a singular one for God , whom we hold to be a beneficent and heavenly being . It is an awkward dilemma for man , because either he is , or he is not responsible for his own salvation ; which means the knowin*-imperfectly , it may beand obeying God 's laws on earth . If he is not responsible , then let us become fatalists and give up the insane struggle . For myself I prefer to believe that man can know and ought to study to know , what God 's laws are ; and then , not being a fool , he will obey , and thus secure some measure of blessedness on earth . No other theory of existence , it strikes me , can be made to consist with the idea of a just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle which goes on in man between the beastly and the heavenly , and , however he is inspired , man decides to know God 's laws and to obey them , that moment is the point of conversion . Up to this time he has known and obeyed the earthly , sensual , and devilish ; and he has cared to know and obey no other . From this time he tries to be wise , and // in being wise to be good , and in being good to be happy . A man of this sort once said to me , " I try to discover the truth ; I endeavor to follow it ; I try to show a// whom I can reach the same truth ; then , having done my best , I remain content . I regret only that the rest of mankind do not or will not see it as I do ; I regret that the world will remain ignorant , foolish , or wicked ; but I am not wretched or morbid about it . I conclude that if God is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had better be ; and so I enjoy my frugal meal and sleep my quiet sleep . I enjoy the sunshine , and the birds , and the grass , and the cowsand praise God . " This man was neither Wendell Phillips , nor Cornelius Vanderbilt , nor Thomas Carlyle , nor Thad . Stevens . Nor was he one of their kind . He was neither poor nor rich , but he had found work , which he knew was good and useful ; and he did it faithfully , easily , with satisfaction . He was a converted , a regenerate man . He was not a fanatic , or a grasper , or a dogmatist , or a ravager ; not a very great man , but a simple , wise one . But how he was converted-whether by the " wind of God " sweeping across his soul ; whether by his own will and determination ; whether by the preaching and praying of men , I do not know , and I doubt if he does . Believing , as I do , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him , it would seem that man by his own act , might come into such harmony . Accepting the statement of Jesus of Nazareth , that God is a father , I do not see why a child might not know his father 's will or l*iw , and obey it ; and it would seem to be possible , too , without the awful throes which men have so often suffered in arriving at a change of heart . There are books full of the dreadful sufferings of converted souls , experiences which we can not doubt are in a great measure , true , though some times exaggerated . We read of Bunyan , and Wesley , and Fox , and a thousand more , who suffered tortures before they could come to accept God 's will and believe themselves accepted by God ; we read , and can not doubt , of men and women who fought against it , would not be good , would not be friends with God , would not consent to go along the good ways , would do desperate things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace , " as the preacher calls it , which was working within them . We read of a woman , illustrative of this , who came home from a religious meeting , and finding her servant reading a Bible , snatched it from her , and threw it across the room , with violence of action and voice ; and yet at this very moment something was at work with her , which brought her the next day to the anxious-seat full of tears and groans , and convulsed with despair . Most *. have read of the conversion of Saul of Tarsus , which they consider a kind of miracle ; why more than the thousands of other like things it would be hard to say . It is certain , of the many thousands of violent conversions , that most of them were not simulated ; it is certain that the cataleptic state was superinduced . It is certain , too , that many of these " machine conversions , " as some call them , did result in a change of life , in real conversion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is unquestionably true that thousands who experience a conversion do not remain true to their convictions ; they fall away , and , as some say , are worse than before , though this last I doubt . The Methodist Church suffered a loss of over fifty thousand members between the years 1844 and m847 ; and this , no doubt , was mainly from among the vast army of converts of the years 1843 and // 1844 , amounting to 257,465. * These were years of great awakening , when Miller startled the world with his positive assertions that " Christ was at hand , " about to descend again upon earth to judge men . But while so many fell off when their fears abated , what an army remained ! Without being charged with credulity , we can understand that conversion may be caused by an outpouring of the Holy Spirit ; that it may be brought about , involuntarily or premeditatedly , by the preaching of men . But there remains still another mystery , which is illustrated by the case of Col. Gardiner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reckless , immoral life until July , 1719 , when he had come to be *i years of age . His whole thought and life seems to have been in eating and drinking , in love and gallantry , so that his companions had called him " the happy rake . " This man , at this age , would not seem to have been a good subject for conversion . He was sitting in his room one night waiting the hour for one of his dark appointments , when , to pass the time , he took up a hook which his mother had given him . While he was reading , he saw , or thought he saw , a great blaze of light upon his book . He looked up and found his room filled , and before him , suspended in the air , the appearance of a Christ upon the cross . He heard , or thought he did , a voice saying , " 0 , sinner , did I suffer this for thee , and are these the returns ? " He fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he came to himself ; the impression remained burned in upon his soul . His companions attempted to rally him , to laugh it off ; but not so . He spent the next month in an agony of soul , not so much , he said , from a fear of hell , " as from a sense of that horrible ingratitude he bad shown to the God of his life , and to that blessed Redeemer who had been in so affecting a manner set forth as crucified before him . " From this day this man remained " virtuous , pure and godly as he had of old been licentious and profane ; " and after twenty-six years he died fighting at the battle of Preston Pans , strong in his new faith . This man then was converted , changed from bad to good , by no perceptible agency . He had not been to a camp-meeting or a church , he had not been preached to , he had not been claimed in any way , he had not lived in a spiritual atmosphere ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scales fell from his eyes , and he saw that he was vile . He turned his back upon the beastly life and marched out upon the heavenly way . Now did Jesus Christ appear to him , or was it a dream ? If he did , why not to other men who desire salvation , as well as to this poor corrupt Gardiner ? If Jesus is everywhere about us , why should not our eyes be opened to see him , as well as Col. Gardiner 's ? We can not answer such questions . It is not likely , however , that there was any apparition , but rather that the man was overcome by a dream in which he saw visions . Still they awakened his soul . Emanuel Swedenborg says : " The Lord 's appearance and the opening to me of the spiritual world is more excellent than all miracles . An experience like mine no one from creation has had . The men of the golden age indeed conversed with angels , but only in natural light ; but to me it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time . By this experience I have been enabled to see the wonderful things of Heaven , and to be among angels as one of themselves , and to learn truth in light itself ; and thus to see and teach them , and to be led of the Lord . " // " I have , " he says , " conversed with spirits as a spirit , and in doing so they knew no other than that I was one of themselves . " He declares that at these times his respiration was suspended , or rather that he lived by a sort of internal respiration ; and that for the space of an hour he scarcely breathed at all . Also that this strange or cataleptic condition was essential to intense thought or speculation . These things complicate the history of conversions and awakenings , and deepen the mystery . In the world of matter little is left to be known ; in the region of spirit much . We see darkly : we shall see more ; we shall know what a ghost is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here on earth ? That we may even doubt . Few have fallen into the wondrous trances which marked the career of Swedenborg ; many have had experiences like his . Hundreds and thousands have fallen down in a cataleptic state , insensible to all external influences , and have had startling visions ; some have been converted by them , some have not . But this does not seem the great common way marked out for man . It is exceptional , and not to be desired ; and other means of conversion must be sought . It is a condition analogous to hysteria , of which medical books contain a world of matter . This cataleptic state , like other hysteria , may be so cultivated that it becomes easy for a person to go into it , and , indeed , it may become imperative , so that the patient can not resist it . One of the most remarkable facts in this matter is , that it is , or may be contagious-so with hysteria . One hysterical patient may infect a whole hospital ; one case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Whitefield produced no such conversions until he came on to Wesley 's ground , where such experiences already existed ; and then the results were surprising . Here I must leave the subjects with the reader , who will be able to decide from the facts given , to his own satisfaction . Conversions and awakenings are mysterious , vital , and important subjects . Once in one 's lifetime there may come from without or may proceed from within a divine influx or a holy influence ; there may be agony followed by ecstasy , or there may be ecstasy alone . As man comes to know more of the laws of spirit and more of the laws of body , there will be less agony-perhaps less ecstasy . But this transcendental experience does come . Jonathan Edwards describes it as coming to him after reading these words : " Now unto the King eternal , immortal , invisible , the only xvise God , be honor and glory forever . Amen . " As I read the words there came into my soul , and was , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glory of the Divine Being  --  a new sense quite different from anything I ever experienced before . This is but a foretaste of heaven ; it is of the nature of ecstasy , and can not be expected to be permanent on earth .
