" East or West , it matters not where -- the story may , doubtless , indicate something of latitude and longitude as it proceeds -- in the city of Mishaumok , lived Henderson Gartney , Esq. , one of those American gentlemen of whom , if she were ever canonized , Martha of Bethany must be the patron saint -- if again , feminine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , do n't know better than to assume such charge of wayward man -- born , as they are , seemingly , to the life destiny of being ever " careful and troubled about many things . " We have all of us , as little girls , read " Rosamond . " Now , one of Rosamond 's early worries suggests a key to half the worries , early and late , of grown men and women . The silver paper wo n't cover the basket . Mr. Gartney had spent his years , from twenty-five to forty , in sedulously tugging at the corners . He had had his share of silver paper , too -- only the basket was a little too big . In a pleasant apartment , half library , half parlor , and used in the winter months as a breakfast room , beside a table still covered with the remnants of the morning meal , sat Mrs. Gartney and her young daughter , Faith ; the latter with a somewhat disconcerted , not to say rueful , expression of face . A pair of slippers on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gave hint of the recent presence of the master of the house . " Then I suppose I ca n't go , " remarked the young lady . " I 'm sure I do n't know , " answered the elder , in a helpless , worried sort of tone . " It does n't seem really right to ask your father for the money . I did just speak of your wanting some things for a party , but I suppose he has forgotten it ; and , to-day , I hate to trouble him with reminding . Must you really have new gloves and slippers , both ? " Faith held up her little foot for answer , shod with a partly worn bronze kid , reduced to morning service . " These are the best I 've got . And my gloves have been cleaned over and over , till you said yourself , last time , they would hardly do to wear again . If it were any use , I should say I must have a new dress ; but I thought at least I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps have something left for a few natural flowers for my hair . " " I know . But your father looked annoyed when I told him we should want fresh marketing to-day . He is really pinched , just now , for ready money -- and he is so discouraged about the times . He told me only last night of a man who owed him five hundred dollars , and came to say he did n't know as he could pay a cent . It does n't seem to be a time to afford gloves and shoes and flowers . And then there 'll be the carriage , too . " " Oh , dear ! " sighed Faith , in the tone of one who felt herself checkmated . " I wish I knew what we really could afford ! It always seems to be these little things that do n't cost much , and that other girls , whose fathers are not nearly so well off , always , have , without thinking anything about it . " And she glanced over the table , whereon shone a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood a French clock that had been placed there a month before . " Pull at the bobbin and the latch will fly up . " An unspoken suggestion , of drift akin to this , flitted through the mind of Faith . She wondered if her father knew that this was a Signal Street invitation . Mr. Gartney was ambitious for his children , and solicitous for their place in society . But Faith had a touch of high-mindedness about her that made it impossible for her to pull bobbins . So , when her father presently , with hat and coat on , came into the room again for a moment , before going out for the day , she sat quite silent , with her foot upon the fender , looking into the fire . Something in her face however , quite unconsciously , bespoke that the world did not lie entirely straight before her , and this catching her father 's eye , brought up to him , by an untraceable association , the half-proffered request of his wife . " So you have n't any shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice enough for a party , father . " " And the party is a vital necessity , I suppose . Where is it to be ? " The latch string was put forth , and while Faith still stayed her hand , her mother , absolved from selfish end , was fain to catch it up . " At the Rushleighs ' . The Old Year out and the New Year in . " " Oh , well , we must n't ' let the colt go bare , ' " answered Mr. Gartney , pleasantly , portemonnaie in hand . " But you must make that do . " He handed her five dollars . " And take good care of your things when you have got them , for I do n't pick up many five dollars nowadays . " And the old look of care crept up , replacing the kindly smile , as he turned and left the room . " I feel very much as if I had picked my father 's pocket , " said Faith , holding the bank note , half ashamedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a man of no method in his expenditure . When money chanced to be plenty with him it was very apt to go as might happen -- for French clocks , or whatsoever ; and then , suddenly , the silver paper fell short elsewhere , and lo ! a corner was left uncovered . The horse and the mare were shod . Great expenses were incurred ; money was found , somehow , for grand outlays ; but the comfort of buying , with a readiness , the little needed matters of every day -- this was foregone . " Not let the colt go bare ! " It was precisely the thing he was continually doing . Mrs. Gartney had long found it to be her only wise way to make her hay while the sun was shining -- to buy , when she could buy , what she was sure would be most wanted -- and to look forward as far as possible , in her provisions , since her husband scarcely seemed to look forward at all . So she exemplified , over and over again in her life , the story of Pharaoh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faith , her little purchases and arrangements all complete , and flowers and carriage bespoken for the next evening , went to bed to dream such dreams as only come to the sleep of early years . At the same time , lingering by the fireside below for a half hour 's unreserved conversation , Mr. Gartney was telling his wife of another money disappointment . " Blacklow , at Cross Corners , gives up the lease of the house in the spring . He writes me he is going out to Indiana with his son-in-law . I do n't know where I shall find another such tenant -- or any at all , for that matter . " CHAPTER II . SORTES . " How shall I know if I do choose the right ? " " Since this fortune falls to you , Be content , and seek no new . " MERCHANT OF VENICE . " Now , Mahala Harris , " said Faith , as she glanced in at the nursery door , which opened from her room , " do n't let Hendie get up a French Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land sakes ! Miss Faith ! I do n't know what you mean , nor whether I can help it . I dare say he 'd get up a Revolution of ' 76 , over again , if he once set out . He does train like ' lection , fact , sometimes . " " Well , do n't let him build barricades with all the chairs , so that I shall have to demolish my way back again . I 'm going to lay out my dress for to-night . " And very little dinner could her young appetite manage on this last day of the year . All her vital energy was busy in her anticipative brain , and glancing thence in sparkles from her eyes , and quivering down in swift currents to her restless little feet . It mattered little that there was delicious roast beef smoking on the table , and Christmas pies arrayed upon the sideboard , while upstairs the bright ribbon and tiny , shining , old-fashioned buckles were waiting to be shaped into rosettes for the new slippers , and the lace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple but delicate silk dress , and those lovely greenhouse flowers stood in a glass dish on her dressing table , to be sorted for her hair , and into a graceful breast knot . No -- dinner was a very secondary and contemptible affair , compared with these . There were few forms or faces , truly , that were pleasanter to look upon in the group that stood , disrobed of their careful outer wrappings , in Mrs. Rushleigh 's dressing room ; their hurried chat and gladsome greetings distracted with the drawing on of gloves and the last adjustment of shining locks , while the bewildering music was floating up from below , mingled with the hum of voices from the rooms where , as children say , " the party had begun " already . And Mrs. Rushleigh , when Faith paid her timid respects in the drawing-room at last , made her welcome with a peculiar grace and empressement that had their own flattering weight and charm ; for the lady was a sort of St. Peter of fashion , holding its mystic keys , and admitting or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tact and taste , the flower of the up-growing world of Mishaumok to adorn " her set . " After which , Faith , claimed at once by an eager aspirant , and beset with many a following introduction and petition , was drawn to and kept in the joyous whirlpool of the dance , till she had breathed in enough of delight and excitement to carry her quite beyond the thought even of ices and oysters and jellies and fruits , and the score of unnamable luxuries whereto the young revelers were duly summoned at half past ten o'clock . Four days ' anticipation -- four hours ' realization -- culminated in the glorious after-supper midnight dance , when , marshaled hither and thither by the ingenious orders of the band , the jubilant company found itself , just on the impending stroke of twelve , drawn out around the room in one great circle ; and suddenly a hush of the music , at the very poising instant of time , left them motionless for a moment to burst out again in the age-honored and heartwarming strains of " Auld Lang Syne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the last note had lingeringly died away , one after another gently broke from their places , and the momentary figure melted out with the dying of the Year , never again to be just so combined . It was gone , as vanishes also every other phase and grouping in the kaleidoscope of Time . " Now is the very ' witching hour ' to try the Sortes ! " Margaret Rushleigh said this , standing on the threshold of a little inner apartment that opened from the long drawing-room , at one end . She held in her hand a large and beautiful volume -- a gift of Christmas Day . " Here are Fates for everybody who cares to find them out ! " The book was a collection of poetical quotations , arranged by numbers , and to be chosen thereby , and the chance application taken as an oracle . Everything like fortune telling , or a possible peering into the things of coming time , has such a charm ! Especially with them to whom the past is but a prelude and beginning , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystic Story of Life ! " No , no , this wo n't do ! " cried the young lady , as circle behind circle closed and crowded eagerly about her . " Fate does n't give out her revelations in such wholesale fashion . You must come up with proper reverence , one by one . " As she spoke , she withdrew a little within the curtained archway , and , placing the crimson-covered book of destiny upon an inlaid table , brought forward a piano stool , and seated herself thereon , as a priestess upon a tripod . A little shyly , one after another , gaining knowledge of what was going on , the company strayed in from without , and , each in turn hazarding a number , received in answer the rhyme or stanza indicated ; and who shall say how long those chance-directed words , chosen for the most part with the elastic ambiguity of all oracles of any established authority , lingered echoing in the heads and hearts of them to whom they were given -- shaping and confirming , or darkening with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up among the very last . " How many numbers are there to choose from ? " she asked . " Three hundred and sixty-five . The number of days in the year . " " Well , then , I 'll take the number of the day ; the last -- no , I forgot -- the first of all . " Nobody before had chosen this , and Margaret read , in a clear , gentle voice , not untouched with the grave beauty of its own words , and the sweet , earnest , listening look of the young face that bent toward her to take them in : " Rouse to some high and holy work of love , And thou an angel 's happiness shalt know ; Shalt bless the earth while in the world above ; The good begun by thee while here below Shall like a river run , and broader flow . " Ten minutes later , and all else were absorbed in other things again -- leave-takings , parting chat , and a few waltzing a last measure to a specially accorded grace of music . Faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was closed and left . She quietly reopened it at that first page . Unconscious of a step behind her , her eyes ran over the lines again , to make their beautiful words her own . " And that was your oracle , then ? " asked a kindly voice . Glancing quickly up , while the timid color flushed her cheek , she met a look as of a wise and watchful angel , though it came through the eye and smile of a gray-haired man , who laid his hand upon the page as he said : " Remember -- it is conditional . " CHAPTER III . AUNT HENDERSON . " I never met a manner more entirely without frill . " SYDNEY SMITH . Late into the morning of the New Year , Faith slept . Through her half consciousness crept , at last , a feeling of music that had been wandering in faint echoes among the chambers of her brain all those hours of her suspended life . Light , and music , and a sense of an unexamined , half-remembered joy , filled her being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Day . A moment she lay in a passive , unthinking delight ; and then her first , full , and distinct thought shaped itself , as from a sweet and solemn memory : " Rouse to some high and holy work of love , And thou an angel 's happiness shalt know . " An impulse of lofty feeling held her in its ecstasy ; a noble longing and determination shaped itself , though vaguely , within her . For a little , she was touched in her deepest and truest nature ; she was uplifted to the threshold of a great resolve . But generalities are so grand -- details so commonplace and unsatisfying . What should she do ? What " high and holy work " lay waiting for her ? And , breaking in upon her reverie -- bringing her down with its rough and common call to common duty -- the second bell for breakfast rang . " Oh , dear ! It is no use ! Who 'll know what great things I 've been wishing and planning , when I 've nothing to show for it but just being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year 's morning , too ! " Hurrying her toilet , she repaired , with all the haste possible , to the breakfast room , where her consciousness of shortcoming was in nowise lessened when she saw who occupied the seat at her father 's right hand -- Aunt Henderson ! Aunt Faith Henderson , who had reached her nephew 's house last evening just after the young Faith , her namesake , had gone joyously off to " dance the Old Year out and the New Year in . " Old-fashioned Aunt Faith -- who believed most devoutly that " early to bed and early to rise " was the only way to be " healthy , wealthy , or wise ! " Aunt Faith , who had never quite forgiven our young heroine for having said , at the discreet and positive age of nine , that " she did n't see what her father and mother had called her such an ugly name for . It was a real old maid 's name ! " Whereupon , having asked the child what she would have preferred as a substitute , and being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Miss Henderson had told her that she was quite welcome to change it for any heathen woman 's that she pleased , and the worse behaved perhaps the better . She would n't be so likely to do it any discredit ! Aunt Henderson had a downright and rather extreme fashion of putting things ; nevertheless , in her heart she was not unkindly . So when Faithie , with her fair , fresh face -- a little apprehensive trouble in it for her tardiness -- came in , there was a grim bending of the old lady 's brows ; but , below , a half-belying twinkle in the eye , that , long as it had looked out sharply and keenly on the things and people of this mixed-up world , found yet a pleasure in anything so young and bright . " Why , auntie ! How do you do ? " cried Faith , cunning culprit that she was , taking the " bull by the horns , " and holding out her hand . " I wish you a Happy New Year ! Good morning , father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry I 'm so late . " " Wish you a great many , " responded the great-aunt , in stereotyped phrase . " It seems to me , though , you 've lost the beginning of this one . " " Oh , no ! " replied Faithie , gayly . " I had that at the party . We danced the New Year in . " " Humph ! " said Aunt Henderson . Breakfast over , and Mr. Gartney gone to his counting room , the parlor girl made her appearance with her mop and tub of hot water , to wash up the silver and china . " Give me that , " said Aunt Henderson , taking a large towel from the girl 's arm as she set down her tub upon the sideboard . " You go and find something else to do . " Wherever she might be -- to be sure , her round of visiting was not a large one -- Aunt Henderson never let anyone else wash up breakfast cups . This quiet arming of herself , with mop and towel , stirred up everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet from the comfortable fender , and departed to the kitchen to give her household orders for the day . Faith removed cups , glasses , forks , and spoons from the table to the sideboard , while the maid , returning with a tray , carried off to the lower regions the larger dishes . " I have n't told you yet , Elizabeth , what I came to town for , " said Aunt Faith , when Mrs. Gartney came back into the breakfast room . " I 'm going to hunt up a girl . " " A girl , aunt ! Why , what has become of Prudence ? " " Mrs. Pelatiah Trowe . That 's what 's become of her . More fool she . " " But why in the world do you come to the city for a servant ? It 's the worst possible place . Nineteen out of twenty are utterly good for nothing . " " I 'm going to look out for the twentieth . " " But are n't there girls enough in Kinnicutt who would be glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course there are . But they 're all well enough off where they are . When I have a chance to give away , I want to give it to somebody that needs it . " " I 'm afraid you 'll hardly find any efficient girl who will appreciate the chance of going twenty miles into the country . " " I do n't want an efficient girl . I 'm efficient myself , and that 's enough . " " Going to train another , at your time of life , aunt ? " asked Mrs. Gartney , in surprise . " I suppose I must either train a girl , or let her train me ; and , at my time of life , I do n't feel to stand in need of that . " " How shall I go to work to inquire ? " resumed Aunt Henderson , after a pause . " Well , there are the Homes , and the Offices , and the Ministers at Large . At a Home , they would probably recommend you somebody they 've made up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or might not be such as would suit you . Then at the Offices , you 'll see all sorts , and mostly poor ones . " " I 'll try an Office , first , " interrupted Miss Henderson . " I want to see all sorts . Faith , you 'll go with me , by and by , wo n't you , and help me find the way ? " Faith , seated at a little writing table at the farther end of the room , busied in copying into her album , in a clear , neat , but rather stiff schoolgirl 's hand , the oracle of the night before , did not at once notice that she was addressed . " Faith , child ! do n't you hear ? " " Oh , yes , aunt . What is it ? " " I want you to go to a what-d'ye-call-it office with me , to-day . " " An intelligence office , " explained her mother . " Aunt Faith wants to find a girl . " " ' Lucus a non lucendo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her little stock of Latin . " Stupidity offices , I should call them , from the specimens they send out . " " Hold your tongue , chit ! Do n't talk Latin to me ! " growled Aunt Henderson . " What are you writing ? " she asked , shortly after , when Mrs. Gartney had again left her and Faith to each other . " Letters , or Latin ? " Faith colored , and laughed . " Only a fortune that was told me last night , " she replied . " Oh ! ' A little husband , ' I suppose , ' no bigger than my thumb ; put him in a pint pot , and there bid him drum . ' " " No , " said Faith , half seriously , and half teased out of her seriousness . " It 's nothing of that sort . At least , " she added , glancing over the lines again , " I do n't think it means anything like that . " And Faith laid down the book , and went upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been brought up in times when all the doings of young girls were strictly supervised , and who had no high-flown scruples , because she had no mean motives , deliberately walked over and fetched the elegant little volume from the table , reseated herself in her armchair -- felt for her glasses , and set them carefully upon her nose -- and , as her grandniece returned , was just finishing her perusal of the freshly inscribed lines . " Humph ! A good fortune . Only you 've got to earn it . " " Yes , " said Faith , quite gravely . " And I do n't see how . There does n't seem to be much that I can do . " " Just take hold of the first thing that comes in your way . If the Lord 's got anything bigger to give you , he 'll see to it . There 's your mother 's mending basket brimful of stockings . " Faith could n't help laughing . Presently she grew grave again . " Aunt Henderson , " said she , abruptly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired of living sometimes . Things do n't seem worth while . " Aunt Henderson bent her head slightly , and opened her eyes wide over the tops of her glasses . " Do n't say that again , " said she . " Things happen fast enough . Do n't you dare to tempt Providence . " " Providence wo n't be tempted , nor misunderstand , " replied Faith , an undertone of reverence qualifying her girlish repartee . " He knows just what I mean . " " She 's a queer child , " said Aunt Faith to herself , afterwards , thinking over the brief conversation . " She 'll be something or nothing , I always said . I used to think ' t would be nothing . " CHAPTER IV . GLORY McWHIRK . " There 's beauty waiting to be born , And harmony that makes no sound ; And bear we ever , unawares , A glory that hath not been crowned . " Shall I try to give you a glimpse of quite another young life than Faith Gartney 's ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen "  - -  that indefinite " something " which lies in everybody 's future , which may never arrive , and yet which any hour may bring ? Very little likelihood there has ever seemed for any great joy to get into such a life as this has been , that began , or at least has its earliest memory and association , in the old poorhouse at Stonebury . A child she was , of five years , when she was taken in there with her old , crippled grandmother . Peter McWhirk was picked up dead , from the graveled drive of a gentleman 's place , where he had been trimming the high trees that shaded it . An unsound limb -- a heedless movement -- and Peter went straight down , thirty feet , and out of life . Out of life , where he had a trim , comfortable young wife -- one happy little child , for whom skies were as blue , and grass as green , and buttercups as golden as for the little heiress of Elm Hill , who was riding over the lawn in her basket wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of another that was to come . Rosa McWhirk and her baby of a day old were buried the week after , together ; and then there was nothing left for Glory and her helpless grandmother but the poorhouse as a present refuge ; and to the one death , that ends all , and to the other a life of rough and unremitting work to look to for by and by . When Glory came into this world where wants begin with the first breath , and go on thickening around us , and pressing upon us until the last one is supplied to us -- a grave -- she wanted , first of all , a name . " Sure what 'll I call the baby ? " said the proud young mother to the ladies from the white corner house , where she had served four faithful years of her maidenhood , and who came down at once with comforts and congratulations . " They 've sint for the praist , an ' I 've niver bethought of a name . I made so certain ' t would be a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is ! " cried the younger of the two visitors , turning back the bedclothes a little from the tiny , red , puckered face , with short , sandy-colored hair standing up about the temples like a fuzz ball . " I 'd call her Glory . There 's a halo round her head like the saints in the pictures . " " Sure , that 's jist like yersilf , Miss Mattie ! " exclaimed Rosa , with a faint , merry little laugh . " An ' quare enough , I knew a lady once't of the very name , in the ould country . Miss Gloriana O'Dowd she was ; an ' the beauty o ' County Kerry . My Lady Kinawley , she came to be . ' Deed , but I 'd like to do it , for the ould times , an ' for you thinkin ' of it ! I 'll ask Peter , anyhow ! " And so Glory got her name ; and Mattie Hyde , who gave her that , gave her many another thing that was no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years old . Then Mrs. Hyde and the young lady , having first let the corner house , went away to Europe to stay for years ; and when a box of tokens from the far , foreign lands came back to Stonebury a while after , there was a grand shawl for Rosa , and a pretty braided frock for the baby , and a rosary that Glory keeps to this hour , that had been blessed by the Pope . That was the last . Mattie and her mother sailed out upon the Mediterranean one day from the bright coast of France for a far eastern port , to see the Holy Land . God 's Holy Land they did see , though they never touched those Syrian shores , or climbed the hills about Jerusalem . Glory remembered -- for the most part dimly , for some special points distinctly -- her child life of three years in Stonebury poorhouse . How her grandmother and an old countrywoman from the same county " at home " sat knitting and crooning together in a sunny corner of the common room in winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she rolled down the green bank behind the house ; and , when she grew big enough to be trusted with a knife , was sent out to dig dandelions in the spring , and how an older girl went with her round the village , and sold them from house to house . How , at last , her old grandmother died , and was buried ; and how a woman of the village , who had used to buy her dandelions , found a place for her with a relative of her own , in the ten-mile distant city , who took Glory to " bring up "  --  " seeing , " as she said , " there was nobody belonging to her to interfere . " Was there a day , after that , that did not leave its searing impress upon heart and memory , of the life that was given , in its every young pulse and breath , to sordid toil for others , and to which it seemed nobody on earth owed aught of care or service in return ? It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinners so often that the smell never gets out in Budd Street -- a street of a single side , wedged in between the back yards of more pretentious mansions that stood on fair parallel avenues sloping down from a hilltop to the waterside , that Mrs. Grubbling lived in . Here Glory McWhirk , from eight years old to nearly fifteen , scoured knives and brasses , tended doorbell , set tables , washed dishes , and minded the baby ; whom , at her peril , she must " keep pacified "  - -  i. e. , amused and content , while its mother was otherwise busy . For her , poor child -- baby that she still , almost , was herself -- who amused , or contented her ? There are humans with whom amusement and content have nothing to do . What will you ? The world must go on . Glory curled the baby 's hair , and made him " look pretty . " Mrs. Grubbling cut her little handmaid 's short to save trouble ; so that the very determined yellow locks which , under more favoring circumstances of place and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stood up continually in their restless reaching after the fairer destiny that had been meant for them , in the old fuzz-ball fashion ; and Glory grew more and more to justify her name . Do you think she did n't know what beauty was -- this child who never had a new or pretty garment , but who wore frocks " fadged up " out of old , faded breadths of her mistress 's dresses , and bonnets with brims cut off and topknots taken down , and coarse shoes , and stockings cut out of the legs of those whereof Mrs. Grubbling had worn out the extremities ? Do you think she did n't feel the difference , and that it was n't this that made her shuffle along so with her toes in , when she sped along the streets upon her manifold errands , and met gentle-people 's children laughing and skipping their hoops upon the sidewalks ? Out of all lives , actual and possible , each one of us appropriates continually into his own . This is a world of hints only , out of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , uncherished , repressed in every natural longing to be and to have , took in all the more of what was possible ; for God had given her this glorious insight , this imagination , wherewith we fill up life 's scanty outline , and grasp at all that might be , or that elsewhere , is . In her , as in us all , it was often -- nay , daily -- a discontent ; yet a noble discontent , and curbed with a grand , unconscious patience . She scoured her knives ; she shuffled along the streets on hasty errands ; she went up and down the house in her small menial duties ; she put on and off her coarse , repulsive clothing ; she uttered herself in her common , ignorant forms of speech ; she showed only as a poor , low , little Irish girl with red hair and staring , wondering eyes , and awkward movements , and a frightened fashion of getting into everybody 's way ; and yet , behind all this , there was another life that went on in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save only as God gives the like , inwardly , to ourselves . When Glory 's mistress cut her hair , there were always tears and rebellion . It was her one , eager , passionate longing , in these childish days , that these locks of hers should be let to grow . She thought she could almost bear anything else , if only this stiff , unseemly crop might lengthen out into waves and ringlets that should toss in the wind like the carefully kempt tresses of children she met in the streets . She imagined it would be a complete and utter happiness just once to feel it falling in its wealth about her shoulders or dropping against her cheeks ; and to be able to look at it with her eyes , and twist her fingers in it at the ends . And so , when it got to be its longest , and began to make itself troublesome about her forehead , and to peep below her shabby bonnet in her neck , she had a brief season of wonderful enjoyment in it . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the comfort she took in " going through the motions "  - -  pretending to tuck behind her ears what scarcely touched their tips , and tossing her head continually , to throw back imaginary masses of curls , was truly indescribable , and such as I could not begin to make you understand . " Half-witted monkey ! " Mrs. Grubbling would ejaculate , contemptuously , seeing , with what she conceived marvelous penetration , the half of her little servant 's thought , and so pronouncing from her own half wit . Then the great shears came out , and the instinct of grace and beauty in the child was pitilessly outraged , and her soul mutilated , as it were , in every clip of the inexorable shears . She was always glad -- poor Glory -- when the springtime came . She took Bubby and Baby down to the Common , of a May Day , to see the processions and the paper-crowned queens ; and stood there in her stained and drabbled dress , with the big year-and-a-half-old baby in her arms , and so quite at the mercy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avenues , and almost out of her sight -- she looking after him in helpless dismay , lest he should get a splash or a tumble , or be altogether lost ; and then what would the mistress say ? Standing there so -- the troops of children in their holiday trim passing close beside her -- her young heart turned bitter for a moment , as it sometimes would ; and her one utterance of all that swelled her martyr soul broke forth : " Laws a me ! Sech lots of good times in the world , and I ai n't in ' em ! " Yet , that afternoon , when Mrs. Grubbling went out shopping , and left her to her own devices with the children , how jubilantly she trained the battered chairs in line , and put herself at the head , with Bubby 's scarlet tippet wreathed about her upstart locks , and made a May Day ! I say , she had the soul and essence of the very life she seemed to miss . There were shabby children 's books about the Grubbling domicile , that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet his only pastime in them was to scrawl them full of pencil marks , and tear them into tatters . These , one by one , Glory rescued , and hid away , and fed upon , piecemeal , in secret . She could read , at least -- this poor , denied unfortunate . Peter McWhirk had taught his child her letters in happy , humble Sundays and holidays long ago ; and Mrs. Grubbling had begun by sending her to a primary school for a while , irregularly , when she could be spared ; and when she had n't just torn her frock , or worn out her shoes , or it did n't rain , or she had n't been sent of an errand and come back too late -- which reasons , with a multitude of others , constantly recurring , reduced the school days in the year to a number whose smallness Mrs. Grubbling would have indignantly disputed , had it been calculated and set before her ; she being one of those not uncommon persons who regard a duty continually evaded as one continually performed , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at last , Herbert had a winter 's illness , and in summer it was n't worth while , and the winter after , baby came , so that of course she could n't be spared at all ; and it seemed little likely now that she ever again would be . But she kept her spelling book , and read over and over what she knew , and groped her way slowly into more , till she promoted herself from that to " Mother Goose "  - -  from " Mother Goose " to " Fables for the Nursery "  - -  and now , her ever fresh and unfailing feast was the " Child 's Own Book of Fairy Tales , " and an odd volume of the " Parents ' Assistant . " She picked out , slowly , the gist of these , with a lame and uncertain interpretation . She lived for weeks with Beauty and the Beast -- with Cinderella -- with the good girl who worked for the witch , and shook her feather bed every morning ; till at last , given leave to go home and see her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , departing at the back door . Perhaps she should get her pay , some time , and go home and see her mother . Meanwhile , she identified herself with -- lost herself utterly in , these imaginary lives . She was , for the time , Cinderella ; she was Beauty ; she was above all , the Fair One with Golden Locks ; she was Simple Susan going to be May Queen ; she dwelt in the old Castle of Rossmore , with the Irish Orphans . The little Grubbling house in Budd Street was peopled all through , in every corner , with her fancies . Do n't tell me she had nothing but her niggardly outside living there . And the wonder began to come up in her mind , as it did in Faith Gartney 's , whether and when " something might happen " to her . CHAPTER V. SOMETHING HAPPENS . " Athirst ! athirst ! The sandy soil Bears no glad trace of leaf or tree ; No grass-blade sigheth to the heaven Its little drop of ecstasy . " Yet other fields are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palms and cedars shall sublime Their rapture for thee ,  - -  waiting one ! " " Take us down to see the apple woman , " said Master Herbert , going out with Glory and the baby one day when his school did n't keep , and Mrs. Grubbling had a headache , and wanted to get them all off out of the way . Bridget Foye sat at her apple stand in the cheery morning sunlight , red cheeks and russets ranged fair and tempting before her , and a pile of roasted peanuts , and one of delicate molasses candy , such as nobody but she knew how to make , at either end of the board . Bridget Foye was the tidiest , kindliest , merriest apple woman in all Mishaumok . Everybody whose daily path lay across that southeast corner of the Common , knew her well , and had a smile , and perhaps a penny for her ; and got a smile and a God-bless-you , and , for the penny , a rosy or a golden apple , or some of her crisp candy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest on one of the benches close by , as their habit was , had one day made a nearer acquaintance with blithe Bridget . I think it began with Glory -- who held the baby up to see the passing show of a portion of a menagerie in the street , and heard two girls , stopping just before her to look , likewise , say they 'd go and see it perform next day -- uttering something of her old soliloquy about " good times , " and why she " war n't ever in any of ' em . " However it was , Mrs. Foye , in her buxom cheeriness , was drawn to give some of it forth to the uncouth-looking , companionless girl , and not only began a chat with her , after the momentary stir in the street was over , and she had settled herself upon her stool , and leaning her back against a tree , set vigorously to work again at knitting a stout blue yarn stocking , but also treated Bubby and Baby to some bits of her sweet merchandise , and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , shut up in the gay , red-and-yellow-painted wagons . So it became , after this first opening , Glory 's chief pleasure to get out with the children now and then , of a sunny day , and sit here on the bench by Bridget Foye , and hear her talk , and tell her , confidentially , some of her small , incessant troubles . It was one more life to draw from -- a hearty , bright , and wholesome life , besides . She had , at last , in this great , tumultuous , indifferent city , a friendship and a resource . But there was a certain fair spot of delicate honor in Glory 's nature that would not let her bring Bubby and Baby in any apparent hope of what they might get , gratuitously , into their mouths . She laid it down , a rule , with Master Herbert , that he was not to go to the apple stand with her unless he had first put by a penny for a purchase . And so unflinchingly she adhered to this determination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of pleasantness for her ; weeks of sore pining for a morsel of heart food -- before she was free of her own conscience to go and take it . Bridget told stories to Herbert -- strange , nonsensical fables , to be sure -- stuff that many an overwise mother , bringing up her children by hard rule and theory , might have utterly forbidden as harmful trash -- yet that never put an evil into his heart , nor crowded , I dare to say , a better thought out of his brain . Glory liked the stories as well , almost , as the child . One moral always ran through them all . Troubles always , somehow , came to an end ; good creatures and children got safe out of them all , and lived happy ever after ; and the fierce , and cunning , and bad -- the wolves , and foxes , and witches -- trapped themselves in their own wickedness , and came to deplorable ends . " Tell us about the little red hen , " said Herbert , paying his money , and munching his candy . " An ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree , an ' lave Glory an ' me our lane for a minute ? " " Faith , an ' I will that , " said the boy -- aping , ambitiously , the racy Irish accent . " Well , thin , there was once't upon a time , away off in the ould country , livin ' all her lane in the woods , in a wee bit iv a house be herself , a little rid hin . Nice an ' quite she was , and nivir did no kind o ' harrum in her life . An ' there lived out over the hill , in a din o ' the rocks , a crafty ould felly iv a fox . An ' this same ould villain iv a fox , he laid awake o ' nights , and he prowled round shly iy a daytime , thinkin ' always so busy how he 'd git the little rid hin , an ' carry her home an ' bile her up for his shupper .

But at lasht there came a shcame intil his wicked ould head , an ' he tuk a big bag one mornin ' , over his shouldher , and he says till his mother , says he , ' Mother , have the pot all bilin ' agin ' I come home , for I 'll bring the little rid hin to-night for our shupper .

An ' thin she turns round -- an ' there shtands the baste iv a fox in the corner . Well , thin , what did she do , but jist dhrop down her shticks , and fly up in a great fright and flutter to the big bame acrass inside o ' the roof , where the fox could n't get at her ? " ' Ah , ha ! ' says the ould fox , ' I 'll soon bring yees down out o ' that ! ' An ' he began to whirrul round , an ' round , an ' round , fashter an ' fashter an ' fashter , on the floor , after his big , bushy tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lookin ' , that she jist tumbled down off the bame , and the fox whipped her up and popped her intil his bag , and shtarted off home in a minute . An ' he wint up the wood , an ' down the wood , half the day long , with the little rid hin shut up shmotherin ' in the bag . Sorra a know she knowd where she was , at all , at all . She thought she was all biled an ' ate up , an ' finished , shure ! But , by an ' by , she renumbered herself , an ' pit her hand in her pocket , and tuk out her little bright schissors , and shnipped a big hole in the bag behind , an ' out she leapt , an ' picked up a big shtone , an ' popped it intil the bag , an ' rin aff home , an ' locked the door .

' An ' the ould mother says , ' Sure an ' it is ; an ' have ye the little rid hin ? ' ' Yes , jist here in me bag . Open the lid o ' the pot till I pit her in , ' says he . " An ' the ould mother fox she lifted the lid o ' the pot , and the rashkill untied the bag , and hild it over the pot o ' bilin ' wather , an ' shuk in the big , heavy shtone . An ' the bilin ' wather shplashed up all over the rogue iv a fox , an ' his mother , an ' shcalded them both to death . An ' the little rid hin lived safe in her house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in intense relief , for perhaps the twentieth time . " Now tell about the girl that went to seek her fortune ! " " Away wid ye ! " cried Bridget Foye . " Kape yer promish , an ' lave that till ye come back ! " So Herbert and his hoop trundled off to the big tree . " An ' how are yees now , honey ? " says Bridget to Glory , a whole catechism of questions in the one inquiry . " Have ye come till any good times yit ? " " Oh , Mrs. Foye , " says Glory , " I think I 'm tied up tight in the bag , an ' I 'll never get out , except it 's into the hot water ! " " An ' havint ye nivir a pair iv schissors in yer pocket ? " asks Bridget . " I do n't know , " says poor Glory , hopelessly . And just then Master Herbert comes trundling back , and Bridget tells him the story of the girl that went to seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half thinks that , some day or other , she , too , will start off and seek her fortune . The next morning , Sunday -- never a holiday , and scarcely a holy day to her -- Glory sits at the front window , with the inevitable baby in her arms . Mrs. Grubbling is upstairs getting ready for church . After baby has his forenoon drink , and is got off to sleep -- supposing he shall be complaisant , and go -- Glory is to dust up , and set table , and warm the dinner , and be all ready to bring it up when the elder Grubbling shall have returned . Out at the Pembertons ' green gate she sees the tidy parlor maid come , in her smart shawl and new , bright ribbons ; holding up her pretty printed mousseline dress with one hand , as she steps down upon the street , and so revealing the white hem of a clean starched skirt ; while the other hand is occupied with the little Catholic prayer book and a folded handkerchief . Actually , gloves on her hands , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and somehow the hem of the fresh , outspreading crinoline gets caught in it , as it shuts . So she turns half round , and takes both hands to push it open and release herself . Doing so , something slips from between the folds of her handkerchief , and drops upon the ground . A bright half dollar , which was going to pay some of her little church dues to-day . And she hurries on , never missing it out of her grasp , and is halfway down the side street before Glory can set the baby suddenly on the carpet , rush out at the front door , regardless that Mrs. Grubbling 's chamber window overlooks her from above , pick up the coin , and overtake her . " I saw you drop it by the gate , " is all she says , as she puts it into Katie Ryan 's hand . Katie stares with surprise , turning round at the touch upon her shoulder , and beholding the strange figure , and the still stranger evidence of honesty and good will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says she , barely in time , for the odd figure is already retreating up the street . " It 's the red-headed girl over at Grubbling 's , " she continues to herself . " Well , anyhow , she 's an honest , kind-hearted crature , and I 'll not forget it of her . " Glory has made another friend . " Well , Glory McWhirk , this is very pretty doings indeed ! " began Mrs. Grubbling , meeting the little handmaiden at the parlor door . " So this is the way , is it , when my back is turned for a minute ? That poor baby dumped down on the floor , to crawl up to the hot stove , or do any other horrid thing he likes , while you go flacketting out , bareheaded , into the streets , after a topping jade like that ? You ca n't have any high-flown acquaintances while you live in my house , I tell you now , once and for all . Are you going to take up that baby or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glory off , by standing square in the parlor doorway . " Or perhaps , I 'd better stay at home and take care of him myself , " she added , in a tone of superlative irony . Poor Glory , meekly murmuring that it was only to give back some money the girl had dropped , slid past her mistress submissively , like a sentry caught off his post and warned of mortal punishment , and shouldered arms once more ; that is , picked up the baby , who , as if taking the cue from his mother , and made conscious of his grievance , had at this moment begun to cry . Glory had a good cry of her own first , and then , " killing two birds with one stone , " pacified herself and the baby " all under one . " After this , Katie Ryan never came out at the green gate , of a Sunday on the way to church , or of a week day to run down the little back street of an errand , but she gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she caught sight of Glory 's illumined head , nodded her own , with its pretty , dark-brown locks , quite pleasant and friendly . And between these chance recognitions of Katie 's , and the good apple woman 's occasional sympathy , the world began to brighten a little , even for poor Glory . Still , good times went on -- grand , wonderful good times -- all around her . And she caught distant glimpses , but " was n't in ' em . " One day , as she hurried home from the grocer 's with half-a-dozen eggs and two lemons , Katie ran out from the gate , and met her halfway down Budd Street . " I 've been watchin ' for ye , " said she . " I seen ye go out of an errand , an ' I 've been lookin ' for ye back . There 's to be a grand party at our house to-morrow night , an ' I thought maybe ye 'd like to get lave , an ' run over to take a peep at it . Put on yer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I 'll see to yer gettin ' a good chance . " Poor Glory colored up , as Mrs. Grabbling might have done if the President 's wife had bidden her . Not so , either . With a glow of feeling , and an oppression of gratitude , and a humility of delight , that Mrs. Grubbling , under any circumstances whatever , could have known nothing about . " If I only can , " she managed to utter , " and , anyhow , I 'm sure I 'm thankful to ye a thousand times . " And that night she sat up in her little attic room , after everybody else was in bed , mending , in a poor fashion , a rent in the faded " best frock , " and sewing a bit of cotton lace in the neck thereof that she had picked out of the ragbag , and surreptitiously washed and ironed . Next morning , she went about her homely tasks with an alacrity that Mrs. Grubbling , knowing nothing of the hope that had been let in upon her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " good scolding " she had administered the day before . The work she got out of the girl that Thursday forenoon ! Never once did Glory leave her scrubbing , or her dusting , or her stove polishing , to glance from the windows into the street , though the market boys , and the waiters , and the confectioners ' parcels were going in at the Pembertons ' gate , and the man from the greenhouse , even , drove his cart up , filled with beautiful plants for the staircase . She waited , as in our toils we wait for Heaven -- trusting to the joy that was to come . After dinner , she spoke , with fear and trembling . Her lips turned quite white with anxiety as she stood before Mrs. Grubbling with the baby in her arms . " Please , mum , " says Glory , tremulously , " Katie Ryan asked me over for a little while to-night to look at the party . " Mrs. Grubbling actually felt a jealousy , as if her poor , untutored handmaid were taking precedence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At the Pembertons ' , mum . I thought you knew about it . " " And what if I do ? Maybe I 'm going , myself . " Glory opened her eyes wide in mingled consternation and surprise . " I did n't think you was , mum . But if you is --  --  " " You 're willing , I suppose , " retorted her mistress , laughing , in a bitter way . " I 'm very much obliged . But I 'm going out to-night , anyhow , whether it 's there or not , and you ca n't be spared . Besides , you need n't think you 're going to begin with going out evenings yet a while . At your age ! A pretty thing ! There -- go along , and do n't bother me . " Glory went along ; and only the baby -- of mortal listeners -- heard the suffering cry that went up from her poor , pinched , and chilled , and disappointed heart . " Oh , baby , baby ! it was too good a time ! I 'd ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only a stone 's throw from those brightly lighted windows of the Pembertons ' ! Their superfluous radiance pouring out lavishly across the narrow street , searched even through the dim panes behind which Glory sat , resting her tired arms , after tucking away their ordinary burden in his crib , and answering Herbert 's wearisome questions , who from his trundle bed kept asking , ceaselessly : " What are they doing now ? Ca n't you see , Glory ? " " Hush , hush ! " said Glory , breathlessly , as a burst of brilliant melody floated over to her ear . " They 're making music now . Do n't you hear ? " " No . How can I , with my head in the pillow ? I 'm coming there to sit with you , Glory . " And the boy scrambled from his feed to the window . " No , no ! you 'll ketch cold . Besides , you 'd oughter go to sleep . Well -- only for a little bit of a minute , then , " as Herbert persisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the window pane . Glory gathered up her skirt about his shoulders and held him for a while , begging him uneasily , over and over , to " be a good boy , and go back to bed . " No ; he would n't be a good boy , and he would n't go back to bed , till the music paused . Then , by dint of promising that if it began again she would open the window a " teenty little crack , " so that he might hear it better , she coaxed him to the point of yielding , and tucked him , chilly , yet half unwilling , in the trundle . Back again , to look and listen . And , oh , wonderful and unexpected fortune ! A beneficent hand has drawn up the white linen shade at one of the back parlor windows to slide the sash a little from the top . It was Katie , whom her young mistress , standing with her partner at that corner of the room , had called in from the hall to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young lady , hastily , as her companion moved to render her the service she desired , " let Katie come in . She 'll get such a good look down the room at the dancers . " There was no abated admiration in the young man 's eye , as he turned back to her side , and allowed her kindly intention to be fulfilled . Did Katie surmise , in her turn , with the freemasonry of her class , how it was with her humble friend over the way -- that she could n't get let out for the evening , and that she would be sure to be looking and listening from her old post opposite ? However it was , the linen shade was not lowered again , and there between the lace and crimson curtains stood revealed the graceful young figure of Edith Pemberton , in her floating ball robes , with the wreath of morning-glories in her hair . " Oh , my sakes and sorrows ! Ai n't she just like a princess ? Ai n't it a splendid time ? And I come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ; and I s'pose I sha n't ever get a chance again . Maybe Katie 'd get me over of a common workday though , some time , to help her a bit or so . Would n't I be glad to ? " " Oh , for gracious , child ! Do n't ever come here again . You 'll catch your death . You 'll have the croup and whooping cought , and everything to-morrow . " This to Herbert , who had of course tumbled out of bed again at Glory 's first rapturous exclamation . " No , I wo n't ! " cried the boy , rebelliously ; " I 'll stay as long as I like . And I 'll tell my ma how you was a-wantin ' to go away and be the Pembertons ' girl . Wo n't she lam you when she hears that ? " " You can tell wicked lies if you want to , Master Herbert ; but you know I never said such a word , nor ever thought of it . Of course I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could n't live there ? I guess not . Think they 'd have a girl like you ? What a lookin ' you 'd be , a-comin ' to the front door answerin ' the bell ! " Here the doorbell rang suddenly and sharply , and Master Herbert fancying , as did Glory , that it was his mother come back , scrambled into his bed again and covered himself up , while the girl ran down to answer the summons . It was Katie Ryan , with cakes and sweetmeats . " I 've jist rin in to fetch ye these . Miss Edith gave ' em me , so ye need n't be feared . I knows ye 're sich an honest one . An ' it 's a tearin ' shame , if ever there was , that ye could n't come over for a bit of diversion . Why do n't ye quit this ? " " Oh , hush ! " whispered Glory , with a gesture up the staircase , where she had just left the little pitcher with fearfully long ears . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure . It 's real good o ' you to think o ' me so -- oh ! " And Glory could n't say anything more for a quick little sob that came in her throat , and caught the last word up into a spasm . " Pooh ! it 's just nothing at all . I 'd do something better nor that if I had the chance ; an ' I 'd adwise ye to get out o ' this if ye can . Good-by . I 've set the parlor windy open , an ' the shade 's up . I knew it would jist be a conwenience . " Glory ran up the back stairs to the top of the house , and hid away the sweet things in her own room to " make a party " with next day . And then she went down and tented over the crib with an old woolen shawl , and set a high-backed rocking chair to keep the draft from Herbert , and opened the window " a teenty crack . " In five minutes the slight freshening of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy to sleep , and watchful Glory closed the window and set things in their ordinary arrangement once more . Next morning Herbert made hoarse complaint . " What did you let him do , Glory , to catch such a cold ? " asked Mrs. Grabbling . " Nothing , mum , only he would get out of bed to hear the music , " replied the girl . " Well , you opened the window , you know you did , and Katie Ryan came over and kept the front door open . And you said how you wished you could go over there and do their chores . I told you I 'd tell . " " It 's wicked lies , mum , " burst out Glory , indignant . " Do you dare to tell him he lies , right before my face , you good-for-nothing girl ? " shrieked the exasperated mother . " Where do you expect to go to ? " " I do n't expect to go nowheres , mum ; and I would n't say it was lies if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How should such a thing come into his head if you did n't say it ? " " There 's many things comes into his head , " answered Glory , stoutly , " and I think you 'd oughter believe me first , when I never told you a lie in my life , and you did ketch Master Herbert fibbing , jist the other day , but . " Somehow , Glory had grown strangely bold in her own behalf since she had come to feel there was a bit of sympathy somewhere for her in the world . " I know now where he learns it , " retorted the mistress , with persistent and angry injustice . Glory 's face blazed up , and she took an involuntary step to the woman 's side at the warrantless accusation . " You do n't mean that , mum , and you 'd oughter take it back , " said she , excited beyond all fear and habit of submission . Mrs. Grubbling raised her hand passionately , and struck the girl upon the cheek . " I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer me up again ! " " No , mum , " said Glory , in a low , strange tone ; quite white now , except where the vindictive fingers had left their crimson streaks . And she went off out of the room without another word . Over the knife board she revolved her wrongs , and sharpened at length the keen edge of desperate resolution . " Please , mum , " said she , in the old form of address , but with quite a new manner , that , in the little dependant of less than fifteen , startled the hard mistress , " I ai n't noways bound to you , am I ? " She propounded her question , stopping short in her return toward the china closet through the sitting room . " Bound ? What do you mean ? " parried Mrs. Grubbling , dimly foreshadowing to herself what it would be if Glory should break loose , and go . " To stay , mum , and you to keep me , till I 'm growed up , " answered Glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " replied the mistress . " Of course I would n't be held to anything of that sort . I sha n't keep you any longer than you behave yourself . " " Then , if you please , mum , I think I 'll go , " said Glory . And she burst into a passion of tears . " Humph ! Where ? " asked Mrs. Grubbling . " I do n't know , yet , " said Glory , the sarcasm drying her tears . " I s'pose I can go to a office . " " And where 'll you get your meals and your lodgings till you find a place ? " The cat thought she had her paw on the mouse , now , and could play with her as securely and cruelly as she pleased . " If you go away at all , " continued Mrs. Grubbling , with what she deemed a finishing stroke of policy , " you go straight off . I 'll have no dancing back and forth to offices from here . " " Do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aghast . " Yes just that . Pack up and go , or else let me hear no more about it . " The next thing in Glory 's programme of duty was to lay the table for dinner . But she went out of the room , and slowly off , upstairs . Pretty soon she came down again , with her eyes very tearful , and her shabby shawl and bonnet on . " I 'm going , mum , " said she , as one resolved to face calmly whatever might befall . " I did n't mean it to be sudden , but it are . And I would n't never a gone , if I 'd a thought anybody cared for me the leastest bit that ever was . I would n't mind bein ' worked and put upon , and not havin ' any good times ; but when people hates me , and goes to say I does n't tell the truth "  - -  here Glory broke down , and the tears poured over her stained cheeks again , and she essayed once more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were full . " It 's some goodies -- from the party , mum " she struggled to say between short breaths and sobs , " that Katie Ryan give me -- an ' I kept -- to make a party -- for the children , with -- to-day , mum -- when the chores was done -- and I 'll leave ' em -- for ' em -- if you please . " Glory laid her coals of fire upon the table as she spoke . Master Herbert eyed them , as one utterly unconscious of a scorch . " I s'pose I might come back and get my bundle , " said Glory , standing still in the hope of one last kindly or relenting word . " Oh , yes , if you get a place , " said her mistress , dryly , affecting to treat the whole affair as a childish , though unwonted burst of petulance . But Glory , not daring , unbidden , even to kiss the baby , went steadily and sorrowfully out into the street , and drew the door behind her , that shut with a catch lock , and fastened her out into the wide world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Budd and down Branch Street , and across the green common path to the apple stand and Bridget Foye . " I 've done it ! I 've gone ! And I do n't know what to do , nor where to go to ! " " Arrah , poor little rid hin ! So , ye 've found yer schiasors , have ye , an ' let yersel ' loose out o ' the bag ? Well , it 's I that is glad , though I would n't pit ye up till it , " says Bridget Foye . Poor little red hen . She had cut a hole , and jumped out of the bag , to be sure ; but here she was , " all alone by herself " once more , and the foxes -- Want and Cruelty -- ravening after her all through the great , dreary wood ! This day , at least , passed comfortably enough , however , although with an undertone of sadness -- in the sunshine , by Bridget 's apple stand , watching the gay passers-by , and shaping some humble hopes and plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foye 's plain bread and cheese , and made a dessert of an apple and a handful of peanuts . At night Bridget took her home and gave her shelter , and the next day she started her off with a " God bless ye and good luck till ye , " in the charge of an older girl who lodged in the same building , and who was also " out after a place . " CHAPTER VI . AUNT HENDERSON 'S GIRL HUNT . " Black spirits and white , Red spirits and gray ; Mingle , mingle , mingle , You that mingle may . " MACBETH . It was a small , close , dark room -- Mrs . Griggs 's Intelligence Office -- a little counter and show case dividing off its farther end , making a sanctum for Mrs. Griggs , who sat here in rheumatic ponderosity , dependent for whatever involved locomotion on the rather alarming alacrity of an impish-looking granddaughter who is elbowing her way through the throng of applicants for places and servants . She paid no heed to the astonishment of a severe-looking , elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been rudely thrust back into the very arms of a fat , unsavory cook with whom she had a minute before been quite unwillingly set to confer by the high priestess of the place . Aunt Henderson grasped Faith 's hand as if she felt she had brought her into a danger , and held her close to her side while she paused a moment to observe , with the strange fascination of repulsion , the manifestation of a phase of human life and the working of a vocation so utterly and astoundingly novel to herself . " Well , Melindy , " said Mrs. Griggs , salutatorily . " Well , grandma , " answered the girl , with a pert air of show off and consequence , " I found the place , and I found the lady . Ai n't I been quick ? " " Yes . What did she say ? " " Said the girl left last Saturday . Ai n't had anybody sence . Wants you to send her a first-rate one , right off . Has Care ' line been here after me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " She never said a word about it . Guess she forgot the month was out . " " Did n't you ask her ? " " Me ? No . I did the arrant , and stood and looked at her -- jest as pious --  ! And when she did n't say nothin ' , I come away . " " Winny M'Goverin , " said Mrs. Griggs , " that place 'll suit you . Leastways , it must , for another month . You 'd better go right round there . " " Where is it ? " asked the fat cook , indifferently . " Up in Mount Pleasant Street , Number 53 . First-class place , and plenty of privileges . Margaret McKay , " she continued , to another , " you 're too hard to please . Here 's one more place "  - -  handing her a card with address --  " and if you do n't take that , I wo n't do nothing more for you , if you air Scotch and a Protestant ! Mary McGinnis , it 's no use your talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare you to come down but twice or so a year . " " Lord ! " ejaculated Mary McGinnis , " I would n't live a whole year with no lady that ever was , let alone the country ! " " Come out , Faith ! " said Miss Henderson , in a deep , ineffable tone of disgust . " If that 's a genteel West End Intelligence Office , " cried Aunt Faith , as she touched the sidewalk , " let 's go downtown and try some of the common ones . " A large hall -- where the candidates were ranged on settees under order and restraint , and the superintendent , or directress , occupied a desk placed upon a platform near the entrance -- was the next scene whereon Miss Henderson and Faith Gartney entered . Things looked clean and respectable . System obtained here . Aunt Faith felt encouraged . But she made no haste to utter her business . Tall , self-possessed , and dignified , she stood a few paces inside the door , and looked down the apartment , surveying coolly the faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their indications . Her niece had stopped a moment on the landing outside to fasten her boot lace . Miss Henderson did not wear hoops . Also , the streets being sloppy , she had tucked up her plain , gray merino dress over a quilted black alpaca petticoat . Her boots were splashed , and her black silk bonnet was covered with a large gray barege veil , tied down over it to protect it from the dripping roofs . Judging merely by exterior , one would hardly take her at a glance , indeed , for a " fust-class " lady . The directress -- a busy woman , with only half a glance to spare for anyone -- moved toward her . " Take a seat , if you please . What kind of a place do you want ? " Aunt Faith turned full face upon her , with a look that was prepared to be overwhelming . " I 'm looking for a place , ma'am , where I can find a respectable girl . " Her firm , emphatic utterance was heard to the farthest end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this moment , and walked up quietly to Miss Henderson 's side . There was visibly a new impression made , and the tittering ceased . " I beg pardon , ma'am . I see . But we have so many in , and I did n't fairly look . General housework ? " " Yes ; general and particular -- both . Whatever I set her to do . " The directress turned toward the throng of faces whose fire of eyes was now all concentrated on the unflinching countenance of Miss Henderson . " Ellen Mahoney ! " A stout , well-looking damsel , with an expression that seemed to say she answered to her name , but was nevertheless persuaded of the utter uselessness of the movement , half rose from her seat . " You need n't call up that girl , " said Aunt Faith , decidedly ; " I do n't want her . " Ellen Mahoney had giggled among the loudest . " She knows what she does want ! " whispered a decent-appearing young woman to a girl at her side with an eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and that 's more than half of ' em do . " " Country , did you say , ma'am ? or city ? " asked the directress once more of Miss Henderson . " I did n't say . It 's country , though -- twenty miles out . " " What wages ? " " I 'll find the girl first , and settle that afterwards . " " Anybody to do general housework in the country , twenty miles out ? " The prevailing expression of the assemblage changed . There was a settling down into seats , and a resumption of knitting and needlework . One pair of eyes , however , looked on , even more eagerly than before . One young girl -- she with the short curly hair who had n't seen the country for six years and more -- caught her breath , convulsively , at the word . " I wish I dar'st ! I 've a great mind ! " whispered she to her tidy companion . While she hesitated , a slatternly young woman , a few seats farther forward , moved , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer the summons . " Oh , dear ! " sighed the first . " I 'd ought to a done it ! " " I do n't think she would take a young girl like you , " replied her friend . " That 's the way it always is ! " exclaimed the disappointed voice , in forgetfulness and excitement uttering itself aloud . " Plenty of good times going , but they all go right by . I ai n't never in any of ' em ! " " Glory McWhirk ! " chided the directress , " be quiet ! Remember the rules , or leave the room . " " Call that red-headed girl to me , " said Miss Henderson , turning square round from the dirty figure that was presenting itself before her , and addressing the desk . " She looks clean and bright , " she added , aside , to Faith , as Glory timidly approached . " And poor . And longing for a chance . I 'll have her . " A girl with a bonnet full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , started up close at Miss Henderson 's side , and interposed . " Did you say twenty miles , mum ? How often could I come to town ? " " You have n't been asked to go out of town , that I know of , " replied Miss Henderson , frigidly , abashing the office habitue , who had not been used to find her catechism cut so summarily short , and moving aside to speak with Glory . " What was it I heard you say just now ? " " I did n't mean to speak out so , mum . It was only what I mostly thinks . That there 's always lots of good times in the world , only I ai n't never in ' em . " " And you thought it would be good times , did you , to go off twenty miles into the country , to live alone with an old woman like me ? " Miss Henderson 's tone softened kindly to the rough , uncouth girl , and encouraged her to confidence . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where things is green and pleasant . I lived in the country once -- ever so long ago -- when I was a little girl . " Miss Henderson could not help a smile that was half amused , and wholly pitiful , as she looked in the face of this creature of fourteen , so strange and earnest , with its outline of fuzzy , cropped hair , and heard her talk of " ever so long ago . " " Are you strong ? " " Yes 'm . I ai n't never sick . " " And willing to work ? " " Yes 'm . Jest as much as I know how . " " And want to learn more ? " " Yes 'm . I do n't know as I 'd know enough hardly , to begin , though . " " Can you wash dishes ? And sweep ? And set table ? " To each of these queries Glory successively interposed an affirmative monosyllable , adding , gratuitously , at the close , " And tend baby , too , real good . " Her eyes filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love that always grows for that whereto one has sacrificed oneself . " You wo n't have any babies to tend . Time enough for that when you 've learned plenty of other things . Who do you belong to ? " " I do n't belong to anybody , mum . Father , and mother , and grandmother is all dead . I 've done the chores and tended baby up at Mrs. Grubbling 's ever since . That 's in Budd Street . I 'm staying now in High Street , with Mrs. Foye . Number 15 . " " I 'll come after you to-morrow . Have your things ready to go right off . " " I 'm so glad you took her , auntie , " said Faith , as they went out . " She looks as if she had n't been well treated . Think of her wanting so to go into the country ! I should like to do something for her . " " That 's my business , " answered Aunt Faith , curtly , but not crossly . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . If your mother 's willing , though , you might mend up one of your old school dresses for her . ' Tis n't likely she 's got anything to begin with . " And so saying , Aunt Faith turned precipitately into a drygoods store , where she bought a large plaid woolen shawl , and twelve yards of dark calico . Coming out , she darted as suddenly , and apparently unpremeditatedly , across the street into a milliner 's shop , and ordered home a brown rough-and-ready straw bonnet , and four yards of ribbon to match . " And that you can put on , too , " she said to Faith . That evening , Faith was even unwontedly cheery and busy , taking a burned half breadth out of a dark cashmere dress , darning it at the armhole , and pinning the plain ribbon over the brown straw bonnet . At the same time , Glory went up across the city to Budd Street , with a mingled heaviness and gladness at her heart , and , after a kindly farewell interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang , with a half-guilty feeling at her own independence , at the Grubblings ' door . Bubby opened it . " Why , ma ! " he shouted up the staircase , " it 's Glory come back ! " " I 've come to get my bundle , " said the girl . Mrs. Grubbling had advanced to the stair head , somewhat briskly , with the wakeful baby in her arms . Two days ' " tending " had greatly mollified her sentiments toward the offending Glory . " And she 's come to get her bundle , " added the young usher , from below . Mrs. Grubbling retreated into her chamber , and shut herself and the baby in . Poor Glory crept upstairs to her little attic . Coming down again , she set her bundle on the stairs , and knocked . " What is it ? " was the ungracious response . " Please , mum , might n't I say good-by to the baby ? " The latch had slipped , and the door was already slightly ajar . Baby heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A pretty time to come disturbing him to do it ! " grumbled she . Nevertheless , she set the baby on the floor , who tottled out , and was seized by Glory , standing there in the dark entry , and pressed close in her poor , long-wearied , faithful arms . " Oh , baby , baby ! I 'm in it now ! And I do n't know rightly whether it 's a good time or not ! " CHAPTER VII . CARES ; AND WHAT CAME OF THEM . " To speed to-day , to be put back to-morrow ; To feed on hope , to pine with feare and sorrow ; . . . . . To fret thy soul with crosses and with cares ; To eate thy heart through comfortlesse dispaires . " SPENCER . Two years and more had passed since the New Year 's dance at the Rushleighs ' . The crisis of ' 57 and ' 58 was approaching its culmination . The great earthquake that for months had been making itself heard afar off by its portentous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaker houses had fallen and were forgotten . When a great financial trouble sweeps down upon a people , there are three general classes who receive and feel it , each in its own peculiar way . There are the great capitalists -- the enormously rich -- who , unless a tremendous combination of adversities shall utterly ruin here and there one , grow the richer yet for the calamities of their neighbors . There are also the very poor , who have nothing to lose but their daily labor and their daily bread -- who may suffer and starve ; but who , if by any little saving of a better time they can manage just to buy bread , shall be precisely where they were , practically , when the storm shall have blown over . Between these lies the great middle class -- among whom , as on the middle ground , the world 's great battle is continually waging -- of persons who are neither rich nor poor ; who have neither secured fortunes to fall back upon , nor yet the independence of their hands to turn to , when business and its income fail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in apprehension , in mortification , in after privation . Of this class was the Gartney family . Mr. Gartney was growing pale and thin . No wonder ; with sleepless nights , and harassed days , and forgotten , or unrelished meals . His wife watched him and waited for him , and contrived special comforts for him , and listened to his confidences . Faith felt that there was a cloud upon the house , and knew that it had to do with money . So she hid her own little wants as long as she could , wore her old ribbons , mended last year 's discarded gloves , and yearned vaguely and helplessly to do something -- some great thing if she only could , that might remedy or help . Once , she thought she would learn Stenography . She had heard somebody speak one day of the great pay a lady shorthand writer had received at Washington , for some Congressional reports . Why should n't she learn how to do it , and if the terrible worst should ever come to the worst , make known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family ? Something like this -- some " high and holy work of love " she longed to do . Longed almost -- if she were once prepared and certain of herself -- for even misfortune that should justify and make practicable her generous purpose . She got an elementary book , and set to work , by herself . She toiled wearily , every day , for nearly a month ; despairing at every step , yet persevering ; for , beside the grand dream for the future , there was a present fascination in the queer little scrawls and dots . It can not be known how long she might have gone on with the attempt , if her mother had not come to her one day with some parcels of cut-out cotton cloth . " Faithie , dear , " said she , deprecatingly , " I do n't like to put such work upon you while you go to school ; but I ought not to afford to have Miss McElroy this spring . Ca n't you make up some of these with me ? " There were articles of clothing for Faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and how could she rebel ? Yet what was to become of the great scheme ? By and by would come vacation , and in the following spring , at farthest , she would leave school , and then -- she would see . She would write a book , maybe . Why not ? And secretly dispose of it , for a large sum , to some self-regardless publisher . Should there never be another Fanny Burney ? Not a novel , though , or any grown-up book , at first ; but a juvenile , at least , she could surely venture on . Look at all the Cousin Maries , and Aunt Fannies , and Sister Alices , whose productions piled the booksellers ' counters during the holiday sales , and found their way , sooner or later , into all the nurseries , and children 's bookcases ! And think of all the stories she had invented to amuse Hendie with ! Better than some of these printed ones , she was quite sure , if only she could set them down just as she had spoken them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glee . She made two or three beginnings , during the summer holidays , but always came to some sort of a " sticking place , " which could n't be hobbled over in print as in verbal relation . All the links must be apparent , and everything be made to hold well together . She would n't have known what they were , if you had asked her -- but the " unities " troubled her . And then the labor loomed up so large before her ! She counted the lines in a page of a book of the ordinary juvenile size , and the number of letters in a line , and found out the wonderful compression of which manuscript is capable . And there must be two hundred pages , at least , to make a book of tolerable size . There seemed to be nothing in the world that she could do . She could not give her time to charity , and go about among the poor . She had nothing to help them with . Her father gave , already , to ceaseless applications , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then she relinquished in discouragement her aspirations , and lived on , from day to day , as other girls did , getting what pleasure she could ; hampered continually , however , with the old , inevitable tether , of " ca n't afford . " " If something only would happen ! " If some new circumstance would creep into her life , and open the way for a more real living ! Do you think girls of seventeen do n't have thoughts and longings like these ? I tell you they do ; and it is n't that they want to have anybody else meet with misfortune , or die , that romantic combinations may thereby result to them ; or that they are in haste to enact the everyday romance -- to secure a lover -- get married -- and set up a life of their own ; it is that the ordinary marked-out bound of civilized young-lady existence is so utterly inadequate to the fresh , vigorous , expanding nature , with its noble hopes , and its apprehension of limitless possibilities . Something did happen . Winter came on again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none but a harassed man of business can ever know or imagine , Mr. Gartney found himself " out of the wood . " He had survived the shock -- his last mote was taken up -- he had labored through -- and that was all . He was like a man from off a wreck , who has brought away nothing but his life . He came home one morning from New York , whither he had been to attend a meeting of creditors of a failed firm , and went straight to his chamber with a raging headache . The next day , the physician 's chaise was at the door , and on the landing , where Mrs. Gartney stood , pale and anxious , gazing into his face for a word , after the visit to the sick room was over , Dr. Gracie drew on his gloves , and said to her , with one foot on the stair : " Symptoms of typhoid . Keep him absolutely quiet . " CHAPTER VIII . A NICHE IN LIFE , AND A WOMAN TO FILL IT . " A Traveller between Life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this evening . It was not what one would have pictured to oneself as a scene of home comfort or enjoyment ; but Miss Sampson was at home . In her little room of fourteen feet square , up a dismal flight of stairs , sitting , in the light of a single lamp , by her air-tight stove , whereon a cup of tea was keeping warm ; that , and the open newspaper on the little table in the corner , being the only things in any way cheery about her . Not even a cat or a canary bird had she for companionship . There was no cozy arrangement for daily feminine employment ; no workbasket , or litter of spools and tapes ; nothing to indicate what might be her daily way of going on . On the broad ledges of the windows , where any other woman would have had a plant or two , there was no array of geraniums or verbenas -- not even a seedling orange tree or a monthly rose . But in one of them lay a plaid shawl and a carpet bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of feminine property , a paper bandbox , tied about with tape . Packed up for a journey ? Reader , Miss Sampson was always packed up . She was that much-enduring , all-foregoing creature , a professional nurse . There would have been no one to feed a cat , or a canary bird , or to water a rose bush , if she had had one . Her home was no more to her than his station at the corner of the street is to the handcart man or the hackney coachman . It was only the place where she might receive orders ; whence she might go forth to the toilsomeness and gloom of one sick room after another , returning between each sally and the next to her cheerless post of waiting -- keeping her strength for others , and living no life of her own . There was nothing in Miss Sampson 's outer woman that would give you , at first glance , an idea of her real energy and peculiar force of character . She was a tall and slender figure , with no superfluous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to have grown long and wiry with lifting , and easing , and winding about the poor wrecks of mortality that had lost their own vigor , and were fain to beg a portion of hers . Her face was thin and rigid , too -- molded to no mere graces of expression -- but with a strong outline , and a habitual compression about the mouth that told you , when you had once learned somewhat of its meaning , of the firm will that would go straight forward to its object , and do , without parade or delay , whatever there might be to be done . Decision , determination , judgment , and readiness were all in that habitual look of a face on which little else had been called out for years . But you would not so have read it at first sight . You would almost inevitably have called her a " scrawny , sour-looking old maid . " A creaking step was heard upon the stair , and then a knock of decision at Miss Sampson 's door . " Come in ! " And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her hand . That was to be kept waiting no longer for whatever visitor it might chance to be . She was taking her first sip as Dr. Gracier entered . " Do n't move , Miss Sampson ; do n't let me interrupt . " " I do n't mean to ! What sends you here ? " " A new patient . " " Humph ! Not one of the last sort , I hope . You know my kind , and ' tai n't any use talking up about any others . Any old woman can make gruel , and feed a baby with catnip tea . Do n't offer me any more such work as that ! If it 's work that is work , speak out ! " " It 's work that nobody else can do for me . A critical case of typhoid , and nobody in the house that understands such illness . I 've promised to bring you . " " You knew I was back , then ? " " I knew you would be . I only sent you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as things were tolerably comfortable . " " Of course I would . What business should I have where there was nothing wanted of me but to go to bed at nine o'clock , and sleep till daylight ? That ai n't the sort of corner I was cut out to fill . " " Well , drink your tea , and put on your bonnet . There 's a carriage at the door . " " Man ? or woman ? " asked Miss Sampson . " A man -- Mr . Henderson Gartney , Hickory Street . " " Out of his head ? " " Yes -- and getting more so . Family all frightened to death . " " Keep ' em out of my way , then , and let me have him to myself . One crazy patient is enough , at a time , for any one pair of hands . I 'm ready . " In fifteen minutes more , they were in Hickory Street ; and the nurse was speedily installed , or rather installed herself , in her office . Dr. Gracie hastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedtime . " Now , ma'am , " said Miss Sampson to Mrs. Gartney , who , after taking her first to the bedside of the patient , had withdrawn with her to the little dressing room adjoining , and given her a resume of the treatment thus far followed , with the doctor 's last directions to herself --  " you just go downstairs to your supper . I know , by your looks , you ai n't had a mouthful to-day . That 's no way to help take care of sick folks . " Mrs. Gartney smiled a little , feebly ; and an expression of almost childlike rest and relief came over her face . She felt herself in strong hands . " And you ? " she asked . " Shall I send you something here ? " " I 've drunk a cup of tea , before I started . If I see my way clear , I 'll run down for a bite after you get through . I do n't want any special providings . I take my nibbles anyhow , as I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't here . I shall find my way all over the house . Now , you go . " " Only tell me how he seems to you . " " Well -- not so terrible sick . Just barely bad enough to keep me here . I do n't take any easy cases . " The odd , abrupt manner and speech comforted , while they somewhat astonished Mrs. Gartney . " Leave the bread and butter and cold chicken on the table , " said she , when the tea things were about to be removed ; " and keep the chocolate hot , downstairs . Faithie -- sit here ; and if Miss Sampson comes down by and by , see that she is made comfortable . " It was ten o'clock when Miss Sampson came down , and then it was with Dr. Gracie . " Cheer up , little lady ! " said the doctor , meeting Faith 's anxious , inquiring glance . " Not so bad , by any means , as we might be . The only difficulty will be to keep Nurse Sampson here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to get better too fast . Yes -- I will take a bit of chicken , I think ; and -- what have you there that 's hot ? " as the maid came in with the chocolate pot , in answer to Faith 's ring of the bell . " Ah , yes ! Chocolate ! I missed my tea , somehow , to-night . " The " somehow " had been in his kindly quest of the best nurse in Mishaumok . " Sit down , Miss Sampson . Let me help you to a scrap of cold chicken . What ? Drumstick ! Miss Faithie -- here is a woman who makes it a principle to go through the world , choosing drumsticks ! She 's a study ; and I set you to finding her out . " Last night , as he had told Miss Sampson , the family had been " frightened to death . " He had found Faith sitting on the front stairs , at midnight , when he came in at a sudden summons . She was pale and shivering , and caught him nervously by both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , Miss Faithie ! This is no place for you . You ought to be in bed . " " But I ca n't . Mother is all alone , except Mahala . And I do n't dare stay up there , either . What shall we do ? " For all answer , the doctor had just taken her in his arms , and carried her down to the sofa in the hall , where he laid her , and covered her over with his greatcoat . There she stayed , passively , till he came back . And then he told her kindly and gravely , that if she could be quite quiet , and firm , she might go and lie on the sofa in her mother 's dressing room for the remainder of the night , to be at hand for any needed service . To-morrow he would see that they were otherwise provided . And so , to-night , here was Miss Sampson eating her drumstick . Faith watched the hard lines of her face as she did so , and wondered what , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find her out . " " I 'm afraid you have n't had a vary nice supper , " said she , timidly . " Do you like that best ? " " Somebody must always eat drumsticks , " was the concise reply . And so , presently , without any further advance toward acquaintance , they went upstairs ; and the house , under the new , energetic rule , soon subsided into quiet for the night . CHAPTER IX . LIFE OR DEATH ? " With God the Lord belong the issues from death . "  - -  Ps. 68 ; 18 . The nursery was a corner room , opening both into Faith 's and her mother 's . Hendie and Mahala Harris had been removed upstairs , and the apartment was left at Miss Sampson 's disposal . Mrs. Gartney 's bed had been made up in the little dressing room at the head of the front entry , so that she and the nurse had the sick room between them . Faith came down the two steps that led from her room into the nursery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her father 's chamber to put on her night wrapper and make ready for her watch . " How is he , nurse ? He will get well , wo n't he ? What does the doctor say ? " " Nothing , " said Miss Sampson , shortly . " He do n't know , and he do n't pretend to . And that 's just what proves he 's good for something . He ai n't one of the sort that comes into a sick room as if the Almighty had made him a kind of special delegit , and left the whole concern to him . He knows there 's a solemner dealing there than his , whether it 's for life or death . " " But he ca n't help thinking , " said Faith , tremblingly . " And I wish I knew . What do you --  ? " But Faith paused , for she was afraid , after all , to finish the question , and to hear it answered . " I do n't think . I just keep doing . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's a-coming , most likely wo n't attend to what there is . " Faith was finding out -- a little of Miss Sampson , and a good deal of herself . Had she not thought too much of what might be coming ? Had she not missed , perhaps , some of her own work , when that work was easier than now ? And how presumptuously she had wished for " something to happen ! " Was God punishing her for that ? " You just keep still , and patient -- and wait , " said Miss Sampson , noting the wistful look of pain . " That 's your work , and after all , maybe it 's the hardest kind . And I ca n't take it off folks ' shoulders , " added she to herself in an under voice ; " so I need n't set up for the very toughest jobs , to be sure . " " I 'll try , " answered Faith , submissively , with quivering lips , " only if there should be anything that I could do -- to sit up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Of course I will , " replied the nurse , cheerily . " I sha n't be squeamish about asking when there 's anything I really want done . " Faith moved toward the door that opened to her father 's room . It was ajar . She pushed it gently open , and paused . " I may go in , may n't I , nurse , just for a good-night look ? " The sick man heard her voice , though he did not catch her words . " Come in , Faithie , " said he , with one of his half gleams of consciousness , " I 'll see you , daughter , as long as I live . " Faith 's heart nearly broke at that , and she came , tearfully and silently , to the bedside , and laid her little , cool hand on her father 's fevered one , and looked down on his face , worn , and suffering , and flushed -- and thought within herself -- it was a prayer and vow unspoken --  " Oh , if God will only let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for him ! " And then she lifted the linen cloth that was laid over his forehead , and dipped it afresh in the bowl of ice water beside the bed , and put it gently back , and just kissed his hair softly , and went out into her own room . Three nights -- three days -- more , the fever raged . And on the fourth night after , Faith and her mother knew , by the scrupulous care with which the doctor gave minute directions for the few hours to come , and the resolute way in which Miss Sampson declared that " whoever else had a mind to watch , she should sit up till morning this time , " that the critical point was reached ; that these dark , silent moments that would flit by so fast , were to spell , as they passed by , the sentence of life or death . Faith would not be put by . Her mother sat on one side of the bed , while the nurse busied herself noiselessly , or waited , motionless , upon the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her head on the cushion of an easy-chair , leaned the young girl -- her heart full , and every nerve strained with emotion and suspense . She will never know , precisely , how those hours went on . She can remember the low breathing from the bed , and the now and then half-distinct utterance , as the brain wandered still in a dreamy , feverish maze ; and she never will forget the precise color and pattern of the calico wrapper that Nurse Sampson wore ; but she can recollect nothing else of it all , except that , after a time , longer or shorter , she glanced up , fearfully , as a strange hush seemed to have come over the room , and met a look and gesture of the nurse that warned her down again , for her life . And then , other hours , or minutes , she knows not which , went by . And then , a stir -- a feeble word -- a whisper from Nurse Sampson -- a low " Thank God ! " from her mother . The crisis was passed . Henderson Gartney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall Take patience , labor , to their heart and hand , From thy hand and thy heart , and thy brave cheer , And God 's grace fructify through thee to all . " MRS . BROWNING . " M. S. What does that stand for ? " said little Hendie , reading the white letters painted on the black leather bottom of nurse 's carpetbag . He got back , now , often , in the daytime , to his old nursery quarters , where his father liked to hear his chatter and play , for a short time together -- though he still slept , with Mahala , upstairs . " Does that mean ' Miss Sampson ' ? " Faith glanced up from her stocking mending , with a little fun and a little curiosity in her eyes . " What does ' M. ' stand for ? " repeated Hendie . The nurse was " setting to rights " about the room . She turned round at the question , from hanging a towel straight over the stand , and looked a little amazed , as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a quick opening and shutting of the thin lips , like the snipping of a pair of scissors --  " Mehitable . " Faith had been greatly drawn to this odd , efficient woman . Beside that her skillful , untiring nursing had humanly , been the means of saving her father 's life , which alone had warmed her with an earnest gratitude that was restless to prove itself , and that welled up in every glance and tone she gave Miss Sampson , there were a certain respect and interest that could not withhold themselves from one who so evidently worked on with a great motive that dignified her smallest acts . In whom self-abnegation was the underlying principle of all daily doing . Miss Sampson had stayed on at the Gartneys ' , notwithstanding the doctor 's prediction , and her usual habit . And , in truth , her patient did not " get well too fast . " She was needed now as really as ever , though the immediate danger which had summoned her was past , and the fever had gone . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its violent attack were telling upon him now , in the scarcely less perilous prostration that followed . And Mrs. Gartney had quite given out since the excessive tension of nerve and feeling had relaxed . She was almost ill enough to be regularly nursed herself . She alternated between her bed in the dressing room and an easy-chair opposite her husband 's , at his fireside . Miss Sampson knew when she was really wanted , whether the emergency were more or less obvious . She knew the mischief of a change of hands at such a time . And so she stayed on , though she did sleep comfortably of a night , and had many an hour of rest in the daytime , when Faith would come into the nursery and constitute herself her companion . Miss Sampson was to her like a book to be read , whereof she turned but a leaf or so at a time , as she had accidental opportunity , yet whose every page rendered up a deep , strong -- above all , a most sound and healthy meaning . She turned over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Miss Sampson , how came you , at first , to be a sick nurse ? " The shadow of some old struggle seemed to come over Miss Sampson 's face , as she answered , briefly : " I wanted to find the very toughest sort of a job to do . " Faith looked up , surprised . " But I heard you tell my father that you had been nursing more than twenty years . You must have been quite a young woman when you began . I wonder --  " " You wonder why I was n't like most other young women , I suppose . Why I did n't get married , perhaps , and have folks of my own to take care of ? Well , I did n't ; and the Lord gave me a pretty plain indication that He had n't laid out that kind of a life for me . So then I just looked around to find out what better He had for me to do . And I hit on the very work I wanted . A trade that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up my mind , as the doctor says , that somebody in the world had got to choose drumsticks , and I might as well take hold of one . " " But do n't you ever get tired of it all , and long for something to rest or amuse you ? " " Amuse ! I could n't be amused , child . I 've been in too much awful earnest ever to be much amused again . No , I want to die in the harness . It 's hard work I want . I could n't have been tied down to a common , easy sort of life . I want something to fight and grapple with ; and I 'm thankful there 's been a way opened for me to do good according to my nature . If I had n't had sickness and death to battle against , I should have got into human quarrels , maybe , just for the sake of feeling ferocious . " " And you always take the very worst and hardest cases , Dr. Gracie says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do n't face the toughest part of it ? I do n't want the comfortable end of the business . Somebody 's got to nurse smallpox , and yellow fever , and raving-distracted people ; and I know the Lord made me fit to do just that very work . There ai n't many that He does make for it , but I 'm one . And if I shirked , there 'd be a stitch dropped . " " Yellow fever ! where have you nursed that ? " " Do you suppose I did n't go to New Orleans ? I 've nursed it , and I 've had it , and nursed it again . I 've been in the cholera hospitals , too . I 'm seasoned to most everything . " " Do you think everybody ought to take the hardest thing they can find , to do ? " " Do you think everybody ought to eat drumsticks ? We 'd have to kill an unreasonable lot of fowls to let ' em ! No . The Lord portions out breasts and wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your plate , take it . " Dr. Gracie always had a word for the nurse , when he came ; and , to do her justice , it was seldom but she had a word to give him back . " Well , Miss Sampson , " said he gayly , one bright morning , " you 're as fresh as the day . What pulls down other folks seems to set you up . I declare you 're as blooming as -- twenty-five . " " You -- fib -- like -- sixty ! It 's no such thing ! And if it was , I 'd ought to be ashamed of it . " " Prodigious ! as your namesake , the Dominie , would say . Do n't tell me a woman is ever ashamed of looking young , or handsome ! " " Now , look here , doctor ! " said Miss Sampson , " I never was handsome ; and I thank the Lord He 's given me enough to do in the world to wear off my young looks long ago ! And any woman ought to be ashamed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forty-five , and keeps her baby face on ! It 's a sign she ai n't been of much account , anyhow . " " Oh , but there are always differences and exceptions , " persisted the doctor , who liked nothing better than to draw Miss Sampson out . " There are some faces that take till thirty , at least , to bring out all their possibilities of good looks , and wear on , then , till fifty . I 've seen ' em . And the owners were no drones or do-nothings , either . What do you say to that ? " " I say there 's two ways of growing old . And growing old ai n't always growing ugly . Some folks grow old from the inside , out ; and some from the outside , in . There 's old furniture , and there 's growing trees ! " " And the trunk that is roughest below may branch out greenest a-top ! " said the doctor . The talk Faith heard now and then , in her walks from home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and called her down into the parlor -- about pretty looks , and becoming dresses , and who danced with who at the " German " last night , and what a scrape Loolie Lloyd had got into with mixing up and misdating her engagements at the class , and the last new roll for the hair -- used to seem rather trivial to her in these days ! Occasionally , when Mr. Gartney had what nurse called a " good " day , he would begin to ask for some of his books and papers , with a thought toward business ; and then Miss Sampson would display her carpetbag , and make a show of picking up things to put in it . " For , " said she , " when you get at your business , it 'll be high time for me to go about mine . " " But only for half an hour , nurse ! I 'll give you that much leave of absence , and then we 'll have things back again as they were before . " " I guess you will ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 've got to behave . I wo n't have them vicious-looking accounts about , and it do n't signify . " " If it do n't , why not ? " But it ended in the accounts and the carpetbag disappearing together . Until one morning , some three weeks from the beginning of Mr. Gartney 's illness , when , after a few days ' letting alone the whole subject , he suddenly appealed to the doctor . " Doctor , " said he , as that gentleman entered , " I must have Braybrook up here this afternoon . I dropped things just where I stood , you know . It 's time to take an observation . " The doctor looked at his patient gravely . " Ca n't you be content with simply picking up things , and putting them by , for this year ? What I ought to tell you to do would be to send business to the right about , and go off for an entire rest and change , for three months , at least . " " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Perhaps not , on one side of the subject . I feel pretty certain on the other , however . " Mr. Gartney did not send for Braybrook that afternoon . The next morning , however , he came , and the tabooed books and papers were got out . In another day or two , Miss Sampson did pack her carpetbag , and go back to her air-tight stove and solitary cups of tea . Her occupation in Hickory Street was gone . CHAPTER XI . CROSS CORNERS . " O thou that pinest in the imprisonment of the Actual , and criest bitterly to the Gods for a kingdom , wherein to rule and create , know this of a truth , the thing thou seekest is already with thee , ' here or nowhere , ' couldst thou only see ! "  - -  CARLYLE . " It is of no use to talk about it , " said Mr. Gartney , wearily . " If I live -- as long as I live -- I must do business . How else are you to get along ? " " How shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked his wife , in a low , anxious tone . " My life 's insured , " was all Mr. Gartney 's answer . " Father ! " cried Faith , distressfully . Faith had been taken more and more into counsel and confidence with her parents since the time of the illness that had brought them all so close together . And more and more helpful she had grown , both in word and doing , since she had learned to look daily for the daily work set before her , and to perform it conscientiously , even although it consisted only of little things . She still remembered with enthusiasm Nurse Sampson and the " drumsticks , " and managed to pick up now and then one for herself . Meantime she began to see , indistinctly , before her , the vision of a work that must be done by some one , and the duty of it pressed hourly closer home to herself . Her father 's health had never been fully reestablished . He had begun to use his strength before and faster than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even , to tell them so -- of grave disease , if this went on . And still , whenever urged , his answer was the same . " What would become of his family without his business ? " Faith turned these things over and over in her mind . " Father , " said she , after a while -- the conversation having been dropped at the old conclusion , and nobody appearing to have anything more to say --  " I do n't know anything about business ; but I wish you 'd tell me how much money you 've got ! " Her father laughed ; a sad sort of laugh though , that was not so much amusement as tenderness and pity . Then , as if the whole thing were a mere joke , yet with a shade upon his face that betrayed there was far too much truth under the jest , after all , he took out his portemonnaie and told her to look and see . " You know I do n't mean that , father ! How much in the bank , and everywhere ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enough to keep house with for a year , nearly , perhaps . But if I were to take it and go off and spend it in traveling , you can understand that the housekeeping would fall short , ca n't you ? " Faith looked horrified . She was bringing down her vague ideas of money that came from somewhere , through her father 's pocket , as water comes from Lake Kinsittewink by the turning of a faucet , to the narrow point of actuality . " But that is n't all , I know ! I 've heard you talk about railroad dividends , and such things . " " Oh ! what does the Western Road pay this time ? " asked his wife . " I 've had to sell out my stock there . " " And where 's the money , father ? " asked Faith . " Gone to pay debts , child , " was the answer . Mrs. Gartney said nothing , but she looked very grave . Her husband surmised , perhaps , that she would go on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , presently : " I have n't been obliged to sell all my railroad stocks , wifey . I held on to some . There 's the New York Central all safe ; and the Michigan Central , too . That would n't have sold so well , to be sure , just when I was wanting the money ; but things are looking better , now . " " Father , " said Faithie , with her most coaxing little smile , " please just take this bit of paper and pencil , and set down these stocks and things , will you ? " The little smile worked its way ; and half in idleness , half in acquiescence , Mr. Gartney took the pencil and noted down a short list of items . " It 's very little , Faith , you see . " They ran thus : New York Central Railroad 20 shares . Michigan Central " 15 " Kinnicutt Branch " 10 " Mishaumok Insurance Co. 15 " Merchants Bank 30 " " And now , father , please put down how much you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , little busybody . " Nevertheless he noted down the average sums . And the total was between six and seven hundred dollars . " But that is n't all . You 've got other things . Why , there 's the house at Cross Corners . " " Yes , but I ca n't let it , you know . " " What used you to get for it ? " " Two hundred and fifty . For house and land . " " And you own this house , too , father ? " " Yes . This is your mother 's . " " How much rent would this bring ? " Mr. Gartney turned around and looked at his daughter . He began to see there was a meaning in her questions . And as he caught her eye , he read , or discerned without fully reading , a certain eager kindling there . " Why , what has come over you , Faithie , to set you catechising so ? " Faith laughed . " Just answer this , please , and I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About the rent ? Why , this house ought to bring six hundred , certainly . And now , if the court will permit , I 'll read the news . " About a week after this , in the latter half of one of those spring days that come with a warm breath to tell that summer is glowing somewhere , and that her face is northward , Aunt Faith Henderson came out upon the low , vine-latticed stoop of her house in Kinnicutt . Up the little footpath from the road -- across the bit of greensward that lay between it and the stoop -- came a quick , noiseless step , and there was a touch , presently , on the old lady 's arm . Faith Gartney stood beside her , in trim straw bonnet and shawl , with a black leather bag upon her arm . " Auntie ! I 've come to make you a tiny little visit ! Till day after to-morrow . " " Faith Gartney ! However came you here ? And in such a fashion , too , without a word of warning , like -- an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cars , auntie ! I felt just like it ! Will you keep me ? " " Glory ! Glory McWhirk ! " Like the good Vicar of Wakefield , Aunt Henderson liked often to give the whole name ; and calling , she disappeared round the corner of the stoop , without ever a word of more assured welcome . " Put on the teapot again , and make a slice of toast . " The good lady 's voice , going on with further directions , was lost in the intricate threading of the inner maze of the singular old dwelling , and Faith followed her as far as the first apartment , where she set down her bag and removed her bonnet . It was a quaint , dim room , overbrowed and gloomed by the roofed projection of the stoop ; low-ceiled , high-wainscoted and paneled . All in oak , of the natural color , deepened and glossed by time and wear . The heavy beams that supported the floor above were undisguised , and left the ceiling in panels also , as it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six feet tall could hardly have stood without bending . He certainly would not , whether he could or no . Even Aunt Faith , with her five feet , six-and-a-half , dropped a little of her dignity , habitually , when she entered . But then , as she said , " A hen always bobs her head when she comes in at a barn door . " Between the windows stood an old , old-fashioned secretary , that filled up from floor to ceiling ; and over the fireplace a mirror of equally antique date tilted forward from the wall . Opposite the secretary , a plain mahogany table ; and eight high-backed , claw-footed chairs ranged stiffly around the room . Aunt Henderson was proud of her old ways , her old furniture , and her house , that was older than all . Some far back ancestor and early settler had built it -- the beginning of it -- before Kinnicutt had even become a town ; and -- rare exception to the changes elsewhere -- generation after generation of the same name and line had inhabited it until now . Aunt Faith , exultingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely two hundred and ten years . Out in the back kitchen , or lean-to , was hung to a rafter the identical gun with which the " old settler " had ranged the forest that stretched then from the very door ; and higher up , across a frame contrived for it , was the " wooden saddle " fabricated for the back of the placid , slow-moving ox , in the time when horses were as yet rare in the new country , and used with pillions , to transport I ca n't definitely say how many of the family to " meeting . " Between these -- the best room and the out-kitchen -- the labyrinth of sitting room , bedrooms , kitchen proper , milk room , and pantry , partitioned off , or added on , many of them since the primary date of the main structure , would defy the pencil of modern architect . In one of these irregularly clustered apartments that opened out on different aspects , unexpectedly , from their conglomerate center , Faith sat , some fifteen minutes after her entrance into the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked northwest and southwest , and together took in the full radiance of the evening sky . Opposite sat her aunt , taking care of her as regarded tea , toast , and plain country loaf cake , and watching somewhat curiously , also , her face . Faith 's face had changed a little since Aunt Henderson had seen her last . It was not the careless girl 's face she had known . There was a thought in it now . A thought that seemed to go quite out from , and forget the self from which it came . Aunt Henderson wondered greatly what sudden whim or inward purpose had brought her grandniece hither . When Faith absolutely declined any more tea or cake , Miss Henderson 's tap on the table leaf brought in Glory McWhirk . A tall , well-grown girl of eighteen was Glory , now -- quite another Glory than had lightened , long ago , the dull little house in Budd Street , and filled it with her bright , untutored dreams . The luminous tresses had had their way since then ; that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backward from a clear , contented face , into the net that held them tidily . Faith looked up , and remembered the poor office girl of three years since , half clad and hopeless , with a secret amaze at what " Aunt Faith had made of her . " " You may give me some water , Glory , " said Miss Henderson . Glory brought the pitcher , and poured into the tumbler , and gazed at Faith 's pretty face , and the dark-brown glossy rolls that framed it , until the water fairly ran over the table . " There ! there ! Why , Glory , what are you thinking of ? " cried Miss Henderson . Glory was thinking her old thoughts -- wakened always by all that was beautiful and beyond . She came suddenly to herself , however , and darted off , with her face as bright a crimson as her hair was golden ; flashing up so , as she did most easily , into as veritable a Glory as ever was . Never had baby been more aptly or prophetically named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freshet she had set flowing , she dared not give another glance across the table ; but went busily and deftly to work , clearing it of all that should be cleared , that she might make her shy way off again before she should be betrayed into other unwonted blundering . " And now , Faith Gartney , tell me all about it ! What sent you here ? " " Nothing . Nobody . I came , aunt . I wanted to see the place , and you . " The rough eyebrows were bent keenly across the table . " Hum ! " breathed Aunt Henderson . There was small interior sympathy between her ideas and those that governed the usual course of affairs in Hickory Street . Fond of her nephew and his family , after her fashion , notwithstanding Faith 's old rebellion , and all other differences , she certainly was ; but they went their way , and she hers . She felt pretty sure theirs would sooner or later come to a turning ; and when that should happen , whether she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would depend . Her path would need to bend a little , and theirs to make a pretty sharp angle , first . But here was Faith cutting across lots to come to her ! Aunt Henderson put away her loaf cake in the cupboard , set back her chair against the wall in its invariable position of disuse , and departed to the milk room and kitchen for her evening duty and oversight . Glory 's hands were busy in the bread bowl , and her brain kneading its secret thoughts that no one knew or intermeddled with . Faith sat at the open window of the little tea room , and watched the young moon 's golden horn go down behind the earth rim among the purple , like a flamy flower bud floating over , and so lost . And the three lives gathered in to themselves , separately , whatsoever the hour brought to each . At nine o'clock Aunt Faith came in , took down the great leather-bound Bible from the corner shelf , and laid it on the table . Glory appeared , and seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three lives met in the One Great Life that overarches and includes humanity . Miss Henderson read from the sixth chapter of St. John . They were fed with the five thousand . CHAPTER XII . A RECONNOISSANCE . " Then said his Lordship , ' Well God mend all ! ' ' Nay , Donald , we must help him to mend it , ' said the other . "  - -  Quoted by CARLYLE . " Oh , leave these jargons , and go your way straight to God 's work in simplicity and singleness of heart ! "  - -  MISS NIGHTINGALE . " Auntie , " said Faith , next morning , when , after some exploring , she had discovered Miss Henderson in a little room , the very counterpart of the one she had had her tea in the night before , only that this opened to the southeast , and hailed the morning sun . " Auntie , will you go over with me to the Cross Corners house , after breakfast ? It 's empty , is n't it ? " " Yes , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . What do you want to see it for ? " " Why , it used to be so pretty , there . I 'd like just to go into it . Have you heard of anybody 's wanting it yet ? " " No ; and I guess nobody 's likely to , for one while . Folks do n't make many changes , out here . " " What a bright little breakfast room this is , auntie ! And how grand you are to have a room for every meal ! " " It ai n't for the grandeur of it . But I always did like to follow the sun round . For the most part of the year , at any rate . And this is just as near the kitchen as the other . Besides , I kind of hate to shut up any of the rooms , altogether . They were all wanted , once ; and now I 'm all alone in ' em . " For Miss Henderson , this was a great opening of the heart . But she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been her young brother 's , who long ago , when he was just ready for his Master 's work in this world , had been called up higher ; and that her evening rest was sweeter , and her evening reading holier for being holden there ; or that here , in the sunny morning hours , her life seemed almost to roll back its load of many years , and to set her down beside her mother 's knee , and beneath her mother 's gentle tutelage , once more ; that on the little " light stand " in the corner by the fireplace stood the selfsame basket that had been her mother 's then -- just where she had kept it , too , when it was running over with little frocks and stockings that were always waiting finishing or mending -- and now held only the plain gray knitting work and the bit of sewing that Aunt Faith might have in hand . A small , square table stood now in the middle of the floor , with a fresh brown linen breakfast cloth upon it ; and Glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted calico dress and apron of the same , came in smiling like a very goddess of peace and plenty , with the steaming coffeepot in one hand , and the plate of fine , white rolls in the other . The yellow print of butter and some rounds from a brown loaf were already on the table . Glory brought in , presently , the last addition to the meal -- six eggs , laid yesterday , the water of their boiling just dried off , and modestly took her own seat at the lower end of the board . Aunt Faith , living alone , kept to the kindly old country fashion of admitting her handmaid to the table with herself . " Why not ? " she would say . " In the first place , why should we keep the table about , half an hour longer than we need ? And I suppose hot cakes and coffee are as much nicer than cold , for one body as another . Then where 's the sense ? We take Bible meat together . Must we be more dainty about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed up from its lower reason to its climax . Glory had little of the Irish now about her but her name . And all that she retained visibly of the Roman faith she had been born to , was her little rosary of colored shells , strung as beads , that had been blessed by the Pope . Miss Henderson had trained and fed her in her own ways , and with such food as she partook herself , physically and spiritually . Glory sat , every Sunday , in the corner pew of the village church , by her mistress 's side . And this church-going being nearly all that she had ever had , she took in the nutriment that was given her , to a soul that recognized it , and never troubled itself with questions as to one truth differing from another , or no . Indeed , no single form or theory could have contained the " credo " of her simple , yet complex , thought . The old Catholic reverence clung about her still , that had come with her all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught her the prayers of their Church ; and across the long interval of ignorance and neglect flung a sort of cathedral light over what she felt was holy now . Rescued from her dim and servile city life -- brought out into the light and beauty she had mutely longed for -- feeling care and kindliness about her for the long-time harshness and oppression she had borne -- she was like a spirit newly entered into heaven , that needs no priestly ministration any more . Every breath drew in a life and teaching purer than human words . And then the words she did hear were Divine . Miss Henderson did no preaching -- scarcely any lip teaching , however brief . She broke the bread of life God gave her , as she cut her daily loaf and shared it -- letting each soul , God helping , digest it for itself . Glory got hold of some old theology , too , that she could but fragmentarily understand but that mingled itself -- as all we gather does mingle , not uselessly -- with her growth . She found old books among Miss Henderson 's stores , that she read and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reposed in the holy comforts of Doddridge 's " Rise and Progress , " and Baxter 's " Saint 's Rest . " She traveled to the Holy City , above all , with Bunyan 's Pilgrim . And then , Sunday after Sunday , she heard the simple Christian preaching of an old and simple Christian man . Not terrible -- but earnest ; not mystical -- but high ; not lax -- but liberal ; and this fused and tempered all . So " things had happened " for Glory . So God had cared for this , His child . So , according to His own Will -- not any human plan or forcing --  she grew . Aunt Faith washed up the breakfast cups , dusted and " set to rights " in the rooms where , to the young Faith 's eyes , there seemed such order already as could not be righted , made up a nice little pudding for dinner , and then , taking down her shawl and silk hood , and putting on her overshoes , announced herself ready for Cross Corners . " Though it 's all cross corners to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's none of my business , but I ca n't think what you 're up to . " " Not up to any great height , yet , auntie . But I 'm growing , " said Faith , merrily , and with meaning somewhat beyond the letter . They went out at the back door , which opened on a little footpath down the sudden green slope behind , and stretched across the field , diagonally , to a bar place and stile at the opposite corner . Here the roads from five different directions met and crossed , which gave the locality its name . Opposite the stile at which they came out , across the shady lane that wound down from the Old Road whereon Miss Henderson 's mansion faced , a gateway in a white paling that ran round and fenced in a grassy door yard , overhung with pendent branches of elms and stouter canopy of chestnuts , let them in upon the little " Cross Corners Farm . " " Oh , Aunt Faith ! It 's just as lovely as ever ! I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so well ! When I was a little bit of a girl , and nurse and I came out to stay with you . I had my ' fairy house ' there . I 'd like to go over this minute , only that we sha n't have time . How shall we get in ? Where is the key ? " " It 's in my pocket . But it mystifies me , what you want there . " " I want to look out of all the windows , auntie , to begin with . " Aunt Faith 's mystification was not lessened . The front door opened on a small , square hall , with doors to right and left . The room on the left , spite of the bare floor and fireless hearth , was warm with the spring sunshine that came pouring in at the south windows . Beyond this , embracing the corner of the house rectangularly , projected an equally sunny and cheery kitchen ; at the right of which , communicating with both apartments , was divided off a tiny tea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very likely been a bedroom . From the entrance hall at the right opened a room larger than either of the others -- so large that the floor above afforded two bedrooms over it -- and having , besides its windows south and east , a door in the farther corner beyond the chimney , that gave out directly upon the grassy slope , and looked up the path among the trees that crossed the ridge . Faith drew the bolt and opened it , expecting to find a closet or a passage somewhither . She fairly started back with surprise and delight . And then seated herself plump upon the threshold , and went into a midsummer dream . " Oh , auntie ! " she cried , at her waking , presently , " was ever anything so perfect ? To think of being let out so ! Right from a regular , proper parlor , into the woods ! " " Do you mean to go upstairs ? " inquired Miss Henderson , with a vague amaze in her look that seemed to question whether her niece had not possibly been " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wits ! Whereupon Faith scrambled up from her seat upon the sill , and hurried off to investigate above . Miss Henderson closed the door , pushed the bolt , and followed quietly after . It was a funny little pantomime that Faith enacted then , for the further bewilderment of the staid old lady . Darting from one chamber to another , with an inexplicable look of business and consideration in her face , that contrasted comically with her quick movements and her general air of glee , she would take her stand in the middle of each one in turn , and wheeling round to get a swift panoramic view of outlook and capabilities , would end by a succession of mysterious and apparently satisfied little nods , as if at each pause some point of plan or arrangement had settled itself in her mind . " Aunt Faith ! " cried she , suddenly , as she came out upon the landing when she had peeped into the last corner , and found Miss Henderson on the point of making her descent --  " what sort of a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and live ? " Aunt Faith sat down now as suddenly , in her turn , on the stairhead . Recovering , so , from her momentary and utter astonishment , and taking in , during that instant of repose , the full drift of the question propounded , she rose from her involuntarily assumed position , and continued her way down -- answering , without so much as turning her head , " It would be just the most sensible thing that Henderson Gartney ever did in his life ! " What made Faithie a bit sober , all at once , when the key was turned , and they passed on , out under the elms , into the lane again ? Did you ever project a very wise and important scheme , that involves a little self-sacrifice , which , by a determined looking at the bright side of the subject , you had managed tolerably to ignore ; and then , by the instant and unhesitating acquiescence of some one to whose judgment you submitted it , find yourself suddenly wheeled about in your own mind to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's one thing , Aunt Faith , " said she , as they slowly walked up the field path ; " I could n't go to school any more . " Faith had discontinued her regular attendance since the recommencement for the year , but had gone in for a few hours on " French and German days . " " There 's another thing , " said Aunt Faith . " I do n't believe your father can afford to send you any more . You 're eighteen , ai n't you ? " " I shall be , this summer . " " Time for you to leave off school . Bring your books and things along with you . You 'll have chance enough to study . " Faith had n't thought much of herself before . But when she found her aunt did n't apparently think of her at all , she began to realize keenly all that she must silently give up . " But it 's a good deal of help , auntie , to study with other people . And then -- we should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sake of parties , and going about . But for the improvement of it . I should n't like to be shut out from cultivated people . " " Faith Gartney ! " exclaimed Miss Henderson , facing about in the narrow footway , " do n't you go to being fine and transcendental ! If there 's one word I despise more than another , in the way folks use it nowadays -- it 's ' Culture ' ! As if God did n't know how to make souls grow ! You just take root where He puts you , and go to work , and live ! He 'll take care of the cultivating ! If He means you to turn out a rose , or an oak tree , you 'll come to it . And pig-weed 's pig-weed , no matter where it starts up ! " " Aunt Faith ! " replied the child , humbly and earnestly , " I believe that 's true ! And I believe I want the country to grow in ! But the thing will be , " she added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Does n't he want to come , then ? Whose plan is it , pray ? " asked Miss Henderson , stopping short again , just as she had resumed her walk , in a fresh surprise . " Nobody 's but mine , yet , auntie ! I have n't asked him , but I thought I 'd come and look . " Miss Henderson took her by the arm , and looked steadfastly in her dark , earnest eyes . " You 're something , sure enough ! " said she , with a sharp tenderness . Faith did n't know precisely what she meant , except that she seemed to mean approval . And at the one word of appreciation , all difficulty and self-sacrifice vanished out of her sight , and everything brightened to her thought , again , till her thought brightened out into a smile . " What a skyful of lovely white clouds ! " she said , looking up to the pure , fleecy folds that were flittering over the blue . " We ca n't see that in Mishaumok ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to herself , standing at the back door , and gazing with a rapturous admiration at Faith 's upturned face . " And the dinner 's all ready , and I 'm thankful , and more , that the custard 's baked so beautiful ! " CHAPTER XIII . DEVELOPMENT . " Sits the wind in that corner ? " MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING . " For courage mounteth with occasion . " KING JOHN . The lassitude that comes with spring had told upon Mr. Gartney . He had dyspepsia , too ; and now and then came home early from the counting room with a headache that sent him to his bed . Dr. Gracie dropped in , friendly-wise , of an evening -- said little that was strictly professional -- but held his hand a second longer , perhaps , than he would have done for a mere greeting , and looked rather scrutinizingly at him when Mr. Gartney 's eyes were turned another way . Frequently he made some slight suggestion of a journey , or other summer change . " You must urge it , if you can , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . " I do n't quite like his looks . Get him away from business , at almost any sacrifice , " he came to add , at last . " At every sacrifice ? " asked Mrs. Gartney , anxious and perplexed . " Business is nearly all , you know . " " Life is more -- reason is more , " answered the doctor , gravely . And the wife went about her daily task with a secret heaviness at her heart . " Father , " said Faith , one evening , after she had read to him the paper while he lay resting upon the sofa , " if you had money enough to live on , how long would it take you to wind up your business ? " " It 's pretty nearly wound up now ! But what 's the use of asking such a question ? " " Because , " said Faith , timidly , " I 've got a little plan in my head , if you 'll only listen to it . " " Well , Faithie , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke it all out , at once . " That you should give up all your business , father , and let this house , and go to Cross Corners , and live at the farm . " Mr. Gartney started to his elbow . But a sudden pain that leaped in his temples sent him back again . For a minute or so , he did not speak at all . Then he said : " Do you know what you are talking of , daughter ? " " Yes , father ; I 've been thinking it over a good while -- since the night we wrote down these things . " And she drew from her pocket the memorandum of stocks and dividends . " You see you have six hundred and fifty dollars a year from these , and this house would be six hundred more , and mother says she can manage on that , in the country , if I will help her . " Mr. Gartney shaded his eyes with his hand . Not wholly , perhaps , to shield them from the light . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , presently ; and there was assuredly a little tremble in his voice . " And so , you and your mother have talked it over , together ? " " Yes ; often , lately . And she said I had better ask you myself , if I wished it . She is perfectly willing . She thinks it would be good . " " Faithie , " said her father , " you make me feel , more than ever , how much I ought to do for you ! " " You ought to get well and strong , father -- that is all ! " replied Faith , with a quiver in her own voice . Mr. Gartney sighed . " I 'm no more than a mere useless block of wood ! " " We shall just have to set you up , and make an idol of you , then ! " cried Faith , cheerily , with tears on her eyelashes , that she winked off . There had been a ring at the bell while they were speaking ; and now Mrs. Gartney entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faith , " said the doctor , after the usual greetings , and a prolonged look at Mr. Gartney 's flushed face , " what have you done to your father ? " " I 've been reading the paper , " answered Faith , quietly , " and talking a little . " " Mother ! " said Mr. Gartney , catching his wife 's hand , as she came round to find a seat near him , " are you really in the plot , too ? " " I 'm glad there is a plot , " said the doctor , quickly , glancing round with a keen inquiry . " It 's time ! " " Wait till you hear it , " said Mr. Gartney . " Are you in a hurry to lose your patient ? " " Depends upon how ! " replied the doctor , touching the truth in a jest . " This is how . Here 's a little jade who has the conceit and audacity to propose to me to wind up my business ( as if she understood the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go to my farm at Cross Corners . What do you think of that ? " " I think it would be the most sensible thing you ever did in your life ! " " Just exactly what Aunt Henderson said ! " cried Faith , exultant . " Aunt Faith , too ! The conspiracy thickens ! How long has all this been discussing ? " continued Mr. Gartney , fairly roused , and springing , despite the doctor 's request , to a sitting position , throwing off , as he did so , the afghan Faith had laid over his feet . " There has n't been much discussion , " said Faith . " Only when I went out to Kinnicutt I got auntie to show me the house ; and I asked her how she thought it would be if we were to do such a thing , and she said just what Dr. Gracie has said now . And , father , you do n't know how beautiful it is there ! " " So you really want to go ? and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Faith . " Some drumsticks are very nice , " said Faith . " Gartney ! " said Dr. Gracie , " you 'd better mind what this girl of yours says . She 's worth attending to . " The wedge had been entered , and Faith 's hand had driven it . The plan was taken into consideration . Of course , such a change could not be made without some pondering ; but when almost the continual thought of a family is concentrated upon a single subject , a good deal of pondering and deciding can be done in three weeks . At the end of that time an advertisement appeared in the leading Mishaumok papers , offering the house in Hickory Street to be let ; and Mrs. Gartney and Faith were busy packing boxes to go to Kinnicutt . Only a passing shade had been flung on the project which seemed to brighten into sunshine , otherwise , the more they looked at it , when Mrs. Gartney suddenly said , after a long " talking over , " the second evening after the proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? " Now Saidie -- whom before it has been unnecessary to mention -- was Faith 's elder sister , traveling at this moment in Europe , with a wealthy elder sister of Mrs. Gartney . " I never thought of Saidie , " cried Faith . Saidie was pretty sure not to like Kinnicutt . A young lady , educated at a fashionable New York school -- petted by an aunt who found nobody else to pet , and who had money enough to have petted a whole asylum of orphans -- who had shone in London and Paris for two seasons past -- was not exceedingly likely to discover all the possible delights that Faith had done , under the elms and chestnuts at Cross Corners . But this could make no practical difference . " She would n't like Hickory Street any better , " said Faith , " if we could n't have parties or new furniture any more . And she 's only a visitor , at the best . Aunt Etherege will be sure to have her in New York , or traveling about , ten months out of twelve . She can come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll like strawberries and cream , and -- whatever comes at the other season , besides red leaves . " Now this was kind , sisterly consideration of Faith , however little so it seems , set down . It was very certain that no more acceptable provision could be made for Saidie Gartney in the family plan , than to leave her out , except where the strawberries and cream were concerned . In return , she wrote gay , entertaining letters home to her mother and young sister , and sent pretty French , or Florentine , or Roman ornaments for them to wear . Some persons are content to go through life with such exchange of sympathies as this . By and by , Faith being in her own room , took out from her letter box the last missive from abroad . There was something in this which vexed Faith , and yet stirred her a little , obscurely . All things are fair in love , war , and -- story books ! So , though she would never have shown the words to you or me , we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ en rapport . " " And Paul Rushleigh , it seems , is as much as ever in Hickory Street ! Well -- my little Faithie might make a far worse ' parti ' than that ! Tell papa I think he may be satisfied there ! " Faith would have cut off her little finger , rather than have had her father dream that such a thing had been put into her head ! But unfortunately it was there , now , and could not be helped . She could only -- sitting there in her chamber window with the blood tingling to the hair upon her temples , as if from every neighboring window of the clustering houses about her , eyes could overlook and read what she was reading now --  " wish that Saidie would not write such things as that ! " For all that , it was one pleasant thing Faith would have to lose in leaving Mishaumok . It was very agreeable to have him dropping in , with his gay college gossip ; and to dance the " German " with the nicest partner in the Monday class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Had she done things greater than she knew in shutting her eyes resolutely to all her city associations and enjoyments , and urging , for her father 's sake , this exodus in the desert ? Only that means were actually wanting to continue on as they were , and that health must at any rate be first striven for as a condition to the future enlargement of means , her father and mother , in their thought for what their child hardly considered for herself , would surely have been more difficult to persuade . They hoped that a summer 's rest might enable Mr. Gartney to undertake again some sort of lucrative business , after business should have revived from its present prostration ; and that a year or two , perhaps , of economizing in the country , might make it possible for them to return , if they chose , to the house in Hickory Street . There were leave takings to be gone through -- questions to be answered , and reasons to be given ; for Mrs. Gartney , the polite wishes of her visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return to the city in the winter , " with the wonder , unexpressed , whether this were to be a final breakdown of the family , or not ; and for Faith , the horror and extravagant lamentations of her young coterie , at her coming occultation -- or setting , rather , out of their sky . Paul Rushleigh demanded eagerly if there were n't any sober old minister out there , with whom he might be rusticated for his next college prank . Everybody promised to come as far as Kinnicutt " some time " to see them ; the good-bys were all said at last ; the city cook had departed , and a woman had been taken in her place who " had no objections to the country " ; and on one of the last bright days of May they skimmed , steam-sped , over the intervening country between the **25;3373;TOOLONG hills of Mishaumok and the fair meadow reaches of Kinnicutt ; and so disappeared out of the places that had known them so long , and could yet , alas ! do so exceedingly well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great city remembered , or remembered very seriously to regard , the little gap that had been made in its midst . CHAPTER XIV . A DRIVE WITH THE DOCTOR . " And what is so rare as a day in June ? Then , if ever , come perfect days ; Then heaven tries the earth if it be in tune , And over it softly her warm ear lays . " LOWELL . " All lives have their prose translation as well as their ideal meaning . "  - -  CHARLES AUCHESTER . But Kinnicutt opened wider to receive them than Mishaumok had to let them go . If Mr. Gartney 's invalidism had to be pleaded to get away with dignity , it was even more needed to shield with anything of quietness their entrance into the new sphere they had chosen . Faith , with her young adaptability , found great fund of entertainment in the new social developments that unfolded themselves at Cross Corners . All sorts of quaint vehicles drove up under the elms in the afternoon visiting hours , day after day -- hitched horses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course ; the " old doctor " from the village , and the " young doctor " from " over at Lakeside . " Quiet Mrs. Holland walked in at the twilight , by herself , one day , to explain that her husband , the minister , was too unwell to visit , and to say her pleasant , unpretentious words of welcome . Squire Leatherbee 's daughters made themselves fine in lilac silks and green Estella shawls , to offer acquaintance to the new " city people . " Aunt Faith came over , once or twice a week , at times when " nobody else would be round under foot , " and always with some dainty offering from dairy , garden , or kitchen . At other hours , Glory was fain to seize all opportunity of errands that Miss Henderson could not do , and irradiate the kitchen , lingeringly , until she herself might be more ecstatically irradiated with a glance and smile from Miss Faith . There was need enough of Aunt Faith 's ministrations during these first , few , unsettled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the country , " objected no more to these pleasant country fashions of neighborly kindness . She had reason . Aunt Faith 's " thirds bread , " or crisp " vanity cakes , " or " velvet creams , " were no sooner disposed of than there surely came a starvation interval of sour biscuits , heavy gingerbread , and tough pie crust , and dinners feebly cooked , with no attempt at desserts , at all . This was gloomy . This was the first trial of their country life . Plainly , this cook was no cook . Mr. Gartney 's dyspepsia must be considered . Kinnicutt air and June sunshine would not do all the curative work . The healthy appetite they stimulated must be wholesomely supplied . Faith took to the kitchen . To Glory 's mute and rapturous delight , she began to come almost daily up the field path , in her pretty round hat and morning wrapper , to waylay her aunt in the tidy kitchen at the early hour when her cookery was sure to be going on , to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and then to go home and repeat the operation as nearly as she could for their somewhat later dinner . " Miss McGonegal seems to be improving , " observed Mr. Gartney , complacently , one day , as he partook of a simple , but favorite pudding , nicely flavored and compounded ; " or is this a charity of Aunt Henderson 's ? " " No , " replied his wife , " it is home manufacture , " and she glanced at Faith without dropping her tone to a period . Faith shook her head , and the sentence hung in the air , unfinished . Mrs. Gartney had not been strong for years . Moreover , she had not a genius for cooking . That is a real gift , as much as a genius for poetry or painting . Faith was finding out , suddenly , that she had it . But she was quite willing that her father should rest in the satisfactory belief that Miss McGonegal , in whom it never , by any possibility , could be developed , was improving ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his table had a paid and permanent origin . He was more comfortable so , she thought . Meanwhile , they would inquire if the region round about Kinnicutt might be expected to afford a substitute . Dr. Wasgatt 's wife told Mrs. Gartney of a young American woman who was staying in the " factory village " beyond Lakeside , and who had asked her husband if he knew of any place where she could " hire out . " Dr. Wasgatt would be very glad to take her or Miss Faith over there , of a morning , to see if she would answer . Faith was very glad to go . Dr. Wasgatt was the " old doctor . " A benign man , as old doctors -- when they do n't grow contrariwise , and become unspeakably gruff and crusty -- are apt to be . A benign old doctor , a docile old horse , an old-fashioned two-wheeled chaise that springs to the motion like a bough at a bird flitting , and an indescribable June morning wherein to drive four miles and back -- well ! Faith could n't help exulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way was very lovely toward Lakeside , and across to factory village . It crossed the capricious windings of Wachaug two or three times within the distance , and then bore round the Pond Road , which kept its old traditional cognomen , though the new neighborhood that had grown up at its farther bend had got a modern name , and the beautiful pond itself had come to be known with a legitimate dignity as Lake Wachaug . Graceful birches , with a spring , and a joyous , whispered secret in every glossy leaf , leaned over the road toward the water ; and close down to its ripples grew wild shrubs and flowers , and lush grass , and lady bracken , while out over the still depths rested green lily pads , like floating thrones waiting the fair water queens who , a few weeks hence , should rise to claim them . Back , behind the birches , reached the fringe of woodland that melted away , presently , in the sunny pastures , and held in bush and branch hundreds of little mother birds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Universal Love , over a coming life and joy . Life and joy were everywhere . Faith 's heart danced and glowed within her . She had thought , many a time before , that she was getting somewhat of the joy of the country , when , after dinner and business were over , she had come out from Mishaumok , in proper fashionable toilet , with her father and mother , for an afternoon airing in the city environs . But here , in the old doctor 's " one-hoss shay , " and with her round straw hat and chintz wrapper on , she was finding out what a rapturously different thing it is to go out into the bountiful morning , and identify oneself therewith . She had almost forgotten that she had any other errand when they turned away from the lake , and took a little side road that wound off from it , and struck the river again , and brought them at last to the Wachaug Mills and the little factory settlement around them . " This is Mrs. Pranker 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door in a block of factory houses , " and it 's a sister-in-law of hers who wants to ' hire out . ' I 've a patient in the next row , and if you like , I 'll leave you here a few minutes . " Faith 's foot was instantly on the chaise step , and she sprang to the ground with only an acknowledging touch of the good doctor 's hand , upheld to aid her . A white-haired boy of three , making gravel puddings in a scalloped tin dish at the door , scrambled up as she approached , upset his pudding , and sidled up the steps in a scared fashion , with a finger in his mouth , and his round gray eyes sending apprehensive peeps at her through the linty locks . " Well , tow-head ! " ejaculated an energetic female voice within , to an accompaniment of swashing water , and a scrape of a bucket along the floor ; " what 's wanting now ? Ca n't you stay put , nohow ? " An unintelligible jargon of baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveyed an idea to the mother 's mind , for she appeared immediately in the passage , drying her wet arms upon her apron . " Mrs. Pranker ? " asked Faith . " That 's my name , " replied the woman , as who should say , peremptorily , " what then ? " " I was told -- my mother heard -- that a sister of yours was looking for a place . " " She hai n't done much about lookin ' , " was the reply , " but she was sayin ' she did n't know but what she 'd hire out for a spell , if anybody wanted her . She 's in the keepin ' room . You can come in and speak to her , if you 're a mind to . The kitchen floor 's wet . I 'm jest a-washin ' of it . You little sperrit ! " This to the child , who was amusing himself with the floor cloth which he had fished out of the bucket , and held up , dripping , letting a stream of dirty water run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If children ai n't the biggest torments ! Talk about Job ! His wife had to have more patience than he did , I 'll be bound ! And patience ai n't any use , either ! The more you have , the more you 're took advantage of ! I declare and testify , it makes me as cross as sin , jest to think how good-natured I be ! " And with this , she snatched the cloth from the boy 's hands , shook first him and then his frock , to get rid , in so far as a shake might accomplish it , of original depravity and sandy soapsuds , and carried him , vociferant , to the door , where she set him down to the consolation of gravel pudding again . Meanwhile Faith crossed the sloppy kitchen , on tiptoe , toward an open door , that revealed a room within . Here a very fat young woman , with a rather pleasant face , was seated , sewing , in a rocking-chair . She did not rise , or move , at Faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and let fall her arms along those of the chair , retaining the needle in one hand and her work in the other . " I came to see , " said Faith -- obliged to say something to explain her presence , but secretly appalled at the magnitude of the subject she had to deal with --  " if you wanted a place in a family . " " Take a seat , " said the young woman . Faith availed herself of one , and , doubtful what to say next , waited for indications from the other party . " Well -- I was calc'latin ' to hire out this summer , but I ai n't very partic'ler about it , neither . " " Can you cook ? " " Most kinds . I ca n't do much fancy cookin ' . Guess I can make bread -- all sorts -- and roast , and bile , and see to common fixin 's , though , as well as the next one ! " " We like plain country cooking , " said Faith , thinking of Aunt Henderson 's delicious , though simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things if you have direction . " " Well -- I 'm pretty good at workin ' out a resate , too . But then , I ai n't anyways partic'ler ' bout hirin ' out , as I said afore . " Faith judged rightly that this was a salvo put in for pride . The Yankee girl would not appear anxious for a servile situation . All the while the conversation went on , she sat tilting herself gently back and forth in the rocking-chair , with a lazy touching of her toes to the floor . Her very vis inertiae would not let her stop . Faith 's only question , now , was with herself -- how she should get away again . She had no idea that this huge , indolent creature would be at all suitable as their servant . And then , her utter want of manners ! " I 'll tell my mother what you say , " said she , rising . " What 's your mother 's name , and where d'ye live ? " " We live at Kinnicutt Cross Corners . My mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Faith turned toward the kitchen . " Look here ! " called the stout young woman after her ; " you may jest say if she wants me she can send for me . I do n't mind if I try it a spell . " " I did n't ask your name , " remarked Faith . " Oh ! my name 's Mis ' Battis ! " Faith escaped over the wet floor , sprang past the white-haired child at the doorstep , and was just in time to be put into the chaise by Dr. Wasgatt , who drove up as she came out . She did not dare trust her voice to speak within hearing of the house ; but when they had come round the mills again , into the secluded river road , she startled its quietness and the doctor 's composure , with a laugh that rang out clear and overflowing like the very soul of fun . " So that 's all you 've got out of your visit ? " " Yes , that is all , " said Faith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she laughed again -- such a merry little waterfall of a laugh . When she reached home , Mrs. Gartney met her at the door . " Well , Faithie , " she cried , somewhat eagerly , " what have you found ? " Faith 's eyes danced with merriment . " I do n't know , mother ! A -- hippopotamus , I think ! " " Wo n't she do ? What do you mean ? " " Why she 's as big ! I ca n't tell you how big ! And she sat in a rocking-chair and rocked all the time -- and she says her name is Miss Battis ! " Mrs. Gartney looked rather perplexed than amused . " But , Faith !  - -  I ca n't think how she knew -- she must have been , listening -- Norah has been so horribly angry ! And she 's upstairs packing her things to go right off . How can we be left without a cook ? " " It seems Miss McGonegal means to demonstrate that we can ! Perhaps -- the hippopotamus might be trained to domestic service ! She said you could send if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else to do . Norah wo n't even stay till morning . And there is n't a bit of bread in the house . I ca n't send this afternoon , though , for your father has driven over to Sedgely about some celery and tomato plants , and wo n't be home till tea time . " " I 'll make some cream biscuits like Aunt Faith 's . And I 'll go out into the garden and find Luther . If he ca n't carry us through the Reformation , somehow , he does n't deserve his name . " Luther was found -- thought Jerry Blanchard would n't " value lettin ' him have his old horse and shay for an hour . " And he would n't " be mor'n that goin ' . " He could " fetch her , easy enough , if that was all . " Mis ' Battis came . She entered Mrs. Gartney 's presence with nonchalance , and " flumped " incontinently into the easiest and nearest chair . Mrs. Gartney began with the common preliminary -- the name . Mis ' Battis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " proceeded the lady . " My first name was Parthenia Franker . I 'm a relic ' . " Mrs. Gartney experienced an internal convulsion , but retained her outward composure . " I suppose you would quite as lief be called Parthenia ? " " Ruther , " replied the relict , laconically . And Mrs. Parthenia Battis was forthwith installed -- pro tem.  - -  in the Cross Corners kitchen . " She 's got considerable gumption , " was the opinion Luther volunteered , of his own previous knowledge -- for Mrs. Battis was an old schoolmate and neighbor --  " but she 's powerful slow . " CHAPTER XV . NEW DUTIES . " Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do , do it with thy might . "  - -  Ecc. 9:10 . " A servant with this clause Makes drudgery divine ;  --  Who sweeps a room as for Thy laws , Makes that and the action fine . " GEORGE HERBERT . Mis ' Battis 's " gumption " was a relief -- conjoined , even , as it was , to a mighty inertia -- after the experience of Norah McGonegal 's utter incapacity ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tacitly looked upon as a permanent adoption , for want of a better alternative . She continued to seat herself , unabashed , whenever opportunity offered , in the presence of the family ; and invariably did so , when Mrs. Gartney either sent for , or came to her , to give orders . She always spoke of Mr. Gartney as " he , " addressed her mistress as Miss Gartney , and ignored all prefix to the gentle name of Faith . Mrs. Gartney at last remedied the pronominal difficulty by invariably applying all remarks bearing no other indication , to that other " he " of the household -- Luther . Her own claim to the matronly title she gave up all hope of establishing ; for , if the " relic ' " abbreviated her own wifely distinction , how should she be expected to dignify other people ? As to Faith , her mother ventured one day , sensitively and timidly , to speak directly to the point . " My daughter has always been accustomed to be called Miss Faith , " she said , gently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the ungarnished name had twice been used . " It is n't a very important matter -- still , it would be pleasanter to us , and I dare say you wo n't mind trying to remember it ? " " ' M ! No -- I ai n't partic'ler . Faith ai n't a long name , and ' two n't be much trouble to put a handle on , if that 's what you want . It 's English fashion , ai n't it ? " Parthenia 's coolness enabled Mrs. Gartney to assert , somewhat more confidently , her own dignity . " It is a fashion of respect and courtesy , everywhere , I believe . " " ' M ! " reejaculated the relict . Thereafter , Faith was " Miss , " with a slight pressure of emphasis upon the handle . " Mamma ! " cried Hendie , impetuously , one day , as he rushed in from a walk with his attendant , " I hate Mahala Harris ! I wish you 'd let me dress myself , and go to walk alone , and send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose Jericho to be ? " asked Faith , laughing . " I do n't know . It 's where she keeps wishing I was , when she 's cross , and I want anything . I wish she was there !  - -  and I mean to ask papa to send her ! " " Go and take your hat off , Hendie , and have your hair brushed , and your hands washed , and then come back in a nice quiet little temper , and we 'll talk about it , " said Mrs. Gartney . " I think , " said Faith to her mother , as the boy was heard mounting the stairs to the nursery , right foot foremost all the way , " that Mahala does n't manage Hendie as she ought . She keeps him in a fret . I hear them in the morning while I am dressing . She seems to talk to him in a taunting sort of way . " " What can we do ? " exclaimed Mrs. Gartney , worriedly . " These changes are dreadful . We might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to pay extravagantly . Mahala has been content to take less wages , and I think she means to be faithful . Perhaps if I make her understand how important it is , she will try a different manner . " " Only it might be too late to do much good , if Hendie has really got to dislike her . And -- besides -- I 've been thinking -- only , you will say I 'm so full of projects --  --  " But what the project was , Mrs. Gartney did not hear at once , for just then Hendie 's voice was heard again at the head of the stairs . " I tell you , mother said I might ! I 'm going -- down -- in a nice -- little temper -- to ask her -- to send you -- to Jericho ! " Left foot foremost , a drop between each few syllables , he came stumping , defiantly , down the stairs , and appeared with all his eager story in his eyes . " She plagues me , mamma ! She tells me to see who 'll get dressed first ; and if she does , she says : " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same ; The last 's the worst Of all the game ! ' " And if I get dressed first -- all but the buttoning , you know -- she says : " ' The last 's the best , The second 's the same ; The first 's the worst Of all the game ! ' " And then she keeps telling me ' her little sister never behaved like me . ' I asked her where her little sister was , and she said she 'd gone over Jordan . I 'm glad of it ! I wish Mahala would go too ! " Mrs. Gartney smiled , and Faith could not help laughing outright . Hendie burst into a passion of tears . " Everybody keeps plaguing me ! It 's too bad ! " he cried , with tumultuous sobs . Faith checked her laughter instantly . She took the indignant little fellow on her lap , in despite of some slight , implacable struggle on his part , and kissed his pouting lips . " No , indeed , Hendie ! We would n't plague you for all the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , just as soon as you 're ready for it ! " Hendie took his little knuckles out of his eyes . " A bunch of great red cherries , as big as your two hands ! " " Where ? " " I 'll get them , if you 're good . And then you can go out in the front yard , and eat them , so that you can drop the stones on the grass . " Hendie was soon established on a flat stone under the old chestnut trees , in a happy oblivion of Mahala 's injustice , and her little sister 's perfections . " I 'll tell you , mamma . I 've been thinking we need not keep Mahala , if you do n't wish . She has been so used to do nothing but run round after Hendie , that , really , she is n't much good about the house ; and I 'll take Hendie 's trundle bed into my room , and there 'll be one less chamber to take care of ; and you know we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sweeping , Faithie ! And the washing ! Parthenia never would get through with it all . " " Well , somebody might come and help wash . And I guess I can sweep . " " But I ca n't bear to put you to such work , darling ! You need your time for other things . " " I have ever so much time , mother ! And , besides , as Aunt Faith says , I do n't believe it makes so very much matter what we do . I was talking to her , the other day , about doing coarse work , and living a narrow , common kind of life , and what do you think she said ? " " I ca n't tell , of course . Something blunt and original . " " We were out in the garden . She pointed to some plants that were coming up from seeds , that had just two tough , clumsy , coarse leaves . ' What do you call them ? ' said auntie . ' Cotyledons , are n't they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are in botany , ' said she ; ' but I know the use of ' em . They 'll last a while , and help feed up what 's growing inside and underneath , and by and by they 'll drop off , when they 're done with , and you 'll see what 's been coming of it . Folks ca n't live the best right out at first , any more than plants can . I guess we all want some kind of -- cotyledons . ' " Mrs. Gartney 's eyes shone with affection , and something that affection called there , as she looked upon her daughter . " I guess the cotyledons wo n't hinder your growing , " said she . And so , in a few days after , Mahala was dismissed , and Faith took upon herself new duties . It was a bright , happy face that glanced hither and thither , about the house , those fair summer mornings ; and it was n't the hands alone that were busy , as under their dexterous and delicate touch all things arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared itself , as furniture and books were dusted and set right ; and while the carpet brightened under the broom , something else brightened and strengthened , also , within . It is so true , what the author of " Euthanasy " tells us , that exercise of limb and muscle develops not only themselves , but what is in us as we work . " Every stroke of the hammer upon the anvil hardens a little what is at the time the temper of the smith 's mind . " " The toil of the plowman furrows the ground , and so it does his brow with wrinkles , visibly ; and invisibly , but quite as certainly , it furrows the current of feeling , common with him at his work , into an almost unchangeable channel . " Faith 's life purpose deepened as she did each daily task . She had hold , already , of the " high and holy work of love " that had been prophesied . " I am sure of one thing , mother , " said she , gayly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , I am bringing old knowledge into play . It 's the same thing , taken hold of at different ends . I 've learned to draw straight lines , and shape pictures ; and so there is n't any difficulty in sweeping a carpet clean , or setting chairs straight . I never shall wonder again that a woman who never heard of a right angle ca n't lay a table even . " CHAPTER XVI . " BLESSED BE YE , POOR . " " And so we yearn , and so we sigh , And reach for more than we can see ; And , witless of our folded wings , Walk Paradise , unconsciously . " October came , and brought small dividends . The expenses upon the farm had necessarily been considerable , also , to put things in " good running order . " Mr. Gartney 's health , though greatly improved , was not yet so confidently to be relied on , as to make it advisable for him to think of any change , as yet , with a view to business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tempt him . Everything was flat . Mr. Gartney must wait . Mrs. Gartney and Faith felt , though they talked of waiting , that the prospect really before them was that of a careful , obscure life , upon a very limited income . The house in Mishaumok had stood vacant all the summer . There was hope , of course , of letting it now , as the winter season came on , but rents were falling , and people were timid and discouraged . October was beautiful at Kinnicutt . And Faith , when she looked out over the glory of woods and sky , felt rich with the great wealth of the world , and forgot about economies and privations . She was so glad they had come here with their altered plans , and had not struggled shabbily and drearily on in Mishaumok ! It was only when some chance bit of news from the city , or a girlish , gossipy note from some school friend found its way to Cross Corners , that she felt , a little keenly , her denials -- realized how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on without her . It was the old plaint that Glory made , in her dark days of childhood -- this feeling of despondency and loss that assailed Faith now and then --  " such lots of good times in the world , and she not in ' em ! " Mrs. Etherege and Saidie were coming home . Gertrude Rushleigh , Saidie 's old intimate , was to be married on the twenty-eighth , and had fixed her wedding thus for the last of the month , that Miss Gartney might arrive to keep her promise of long time , by officiating as bridesmaid . The family eclipse would not overshadow Saidie . She had made her place in the world now , and with her aunt 's aid and countenance , would keep it . It was quite different with Faith -- disappearing , as she had done , from notice , before ever actually " coming out . " " It was a thousand pities , " Aunt Etherege said , when she and Saidie discussed with Mrs. Gartney , at Cross Corners , the family affairs . " And things just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have settled matters for her , so that this need never have happened ! At any rate , the child should n't be moped up here , all winter ! " Mrs. Etherege had engaged rooms , on her arrival , at the Mishaumok House ; and it seemed to be taken for granted by her , and by Saidie as well , that this coming home was a mere visit ; that Miss Gartney would , of course , spend the greater part of the winter with her aunt ; and that lady extended also an invitation to Mishaumok for a month -- including the wedding festivities at the Rushleighs '  - -  to Faith . Faith shook her head . She " knew she could n't be spared so long . " Secretly , she doubted whether it would be a good plan to go back and get a peep at things that might send her home discontented and unhappy . But her mother reasoned otherwise . Faithie must go . " The child must n't be moped up . " She would get on , somehow , without her . Mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went for a fortnight . She could n't quite resist her newly returned sister . Besides , a pressing personal invitation had come from Margaret Rushleigh to Faith herself , with a little private announcement at the end , that " Paul was refractory , and utterly refused to act as fourth groomsman , unless Faith Gartney were got to come and stand with him . " Faith tore off the postscript , and might have lit it at her cheeks , but dropped it , of habit , into the fire ; and then the note was at the disposal of the family . It was a whirl of wonderful excitement to Faith -- that fortnight ! So many people to see , so much to hear , and in the midst of all , the gorgeous wedding festival ! What wonder if a little dream flitted through her head , as she stood there , in the marriage group , at Paul Rushleigh 's side , and looked about her on the magnificent fashion , wherein the affection of new relatives and old friends had made itself tangible ; and heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Livingston , who stood with his son Philip , and whose bridal , it was well known , was to come next ? Jewels , and silver , and gold , are such flashing , concrete evidences of love ! And the courtly condescension of an old and world-honored man to the young girl whom his son has chosen , is such a winning and distinguishing thing ! Paul Rushleigh had finished his college course , and was to go abroad this winter -- between the weddings , as he said -- for his brother Philip 's was to take place in the coming spring . After that -- things were not quite settled , but something was to be arranged for him meanwhile -- he would have to begin his work in the world ; and then -- he supposed it would be time for him to find a helpmate . Marrying was like dying , he believed ; when a family once began to go off there was soon an end of it ! Blushes were the livery of the evening , and Faith 's deeper glow at this audacious rattle passed unheeded , except , perhaps , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three parties made for the newly married couple in the week that followed . The week after , Paul Rushleigh , with the bride and groom , was to sail for Europe . At each of these brilliant entertainments he constituted himself , as in duty bound , Faith 's knight and sworn attendant ; and a superb bouquet for each occasion , the result of the ransack of successive greenhouses , came punctually , from him , to her door . For years afterwards -- perhaps for all her life -- Faith could n't smell heliotrope , and geranium , and orange flowers , without floating back , momentarily , into the dream of those few , enchanted days ! She stayed in Mishaumok a little beyond the limit she had fixed for herself , to go , with the others , on board the steamer at the time of her sailing , and see the gay party off . Paul Rushleigh had more significant words , and another gift of flowers as a farewell . When she carried these last to her own room , to put them in water , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among their stems . It was a delicate little ring , of twisted gold , with a forget-me-not in turquoise and enamel upon the top . Faith was half pleased , half frightened , and wholly ashamed . Paul Rushleigh was miles out on the Atlantic . There was no help for it , she thought . It had been cunningly done . And so , in the short November days , she went back to Kinnicutt . The east parlor had to be shut up now , for the winter . The family gathering place was the sunny little sitting room ; and with closed doors and doubled windows , they began , for the first time , to find that they were really living in a little bit of a house . It was very pretty , though , with the rich carpet and the crimson curtains that had come from Hickory Street , replacing the white muslin draperies and straw matting of the summer ; and the books and vases , and statuettes and pictures , gathered into so small space , seemed to fill the room with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nook between the windows . Hendie 's blocks and picture books were stowed in a corner cupboard . Mr. Gartney 's newspapers and pamphlets , as they came , found room in a deep drawer below ; and so , through the wintry drifts and gales , they were " close hauled " and comfortable . Faith was happy ; yet she thought , now and then , when the whistling wind broke the stillness of the dark evenings , of light and music elsewhere ; and how , a year ago , there had always been the chance of a visitor or two to drop in , and while away the hours . Nobody lifted the old-fashioned knocker , here at Cross Corners . By day , even , it was scarcely different . Kinnicutt was hibernating . Each household had drawn into its shell . And the huge drifts , lying defiant against the fences in the short , ineffectual winter sunlight , held out little hope of reanimation . Aunt Faith , in her pumpkin hood , and Rob Roy cloak , and carpet moccasins , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally stayed to tea , and helped make up a rubber of whist for Mr. Gartney 's amusement ; but , beyond this , they had no social excitement . January brought a thaw ; and , still further to break the monotony , there arose a stir and an anxiety in the parish . Good Mr. Holland , its minister of thirty years , whose health had been failing for many months , was at last compelled to relinquish the duties of his pulpit for a time ; and a supply was sought with the ultimate probability of a succession . A new minister came to preach , who was to fill the pastor 's place for the ensuing three months . On his first Sunday among them , Faith heard a wonderful sermon . I indicate thus , not the oratory , nor the rhetoric ; but the sermon , of which these were the mere vehicle -- the word of truth itself -- which was spoken , seemingly , to her very thought . So also , as certainly , to the long life-thought of one other . Glory McWhirk sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a soul athirst . A man of middle age , one might have said , at first sight -- there was , here and there , a silver gleam in the dark hair and beard ; yet a fire and earnestness of youth in the deep , beautiful eye , and a look in the face as of life 's first flush and glow not lost , but rather merged in broader light , still climbing to its culmination , belied these tokens , and made it as if a white frost had fallen in June -- rising up before the crowded village congregation , looked round upon the upturned faces , as One had looked before who brought the bread of Life to men 's eager asking ; and uttered the selfsame simple words . It was a certain pause and emphasis he made -- a slight new rendering of punctuation -- that sent home the force of those words to the people who heard them , as if it had been for the first time , and fresh from the lips of the Great Teacher . * * * * * " ' Blessed are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom of heaven . ' " Herein Christ spoke , not to a class , only , but to the world ! A world of souls , wrestling with the poverty of life ! " In that whole assemblage -- that great concourse -- that had thronged from cities and villages to hear His words upon the mountainside -- was there , think you , one satisfied nature ? " Friends -- are ye satisfied ? . . . . . " Or , does every life come to know , at first or at last , how something -- a hope , or a possibility , or the fulfillment of a purpose -- has got dropped out of it , or has even never entered , so that an emptiness yawns , craving , therein , forever ? " How many souls hunger till they are past their appetite ! Go on -- down through the years -- needy and waiting , and never find or grasp that which a sure instinct tells them they were made for ? " This , this is the poverty of life ! These are the poor , to whom God 's Gospel was preached in Christ ! And to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's preaching -- as I read them -- were spoken in blessing . " Because , elsewhere , he blesses the meek ; elsewhere and presently , he tells us how the lowly in spirit shall inherit the earth ; so , when I open to this , his earliest uttered benediction upon our race , I read it with an interpretation that includes all humanity : " ' Blessed , in spirit , are the poor . Theirs is the kingdom of heaven . ' . . . . . " What is this Kingdom of Heaven ? ' It is within you . ' It is that which you hold , and live in spiritually ; the real , of which all earthly , outward being and having are but the show . It is the region wherein little children ' do always behold the Face of my Father which is in Heaven . ' It is where we are when we shut our eyes and pray in the words that Christ taught us . . . . . . " What matters , then , where your feet stand , or wherewith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot where God has put you , and the work He has given you to do ? Your real life is within -- hid in God with Christ -- ripening , and strengthening , and waiting , as through the long , geologic ages of night and incompleteness waited the germs of all that was to unfold into this actual , green , and bounteous earth ! . . . . . " The narrower your daily round , the wider , maybe , the outreach . Isolated upon a barren mountain peak , you may take in river and lake -- forest , field , and valley . A hundred gardens and harvests lift their bloom and fullness to your single eye . " There is a sunlight that contracts the vision ; there is a starlight that enlarges it to take in infinite space . " ' God sets some souls in shade , alone . They have no daylight of their own . Only in lives of happier ones They see the shine of distant suns . " ' God knows . Content thee with thy night . Thy greater heaven hath grander light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thou sit'st afar , and hast them all . " ' Lose the less joy that doth but blind ; Reach forth a larger bliss to find . To-day is brief : the inclusive spheres Rain raptures of a thousand years . ' " Faith could not tell what hymn was sung , or what were the words of the prayer that followed the sermon . There was a music and an uplifting in her own soul that made them needless , but for the pause they gave her . She hardly knew that a notice was read as the people rose before the benediction , when the minister gave out , as requested , that " the Village Dorcas Society would meet on Wednesday of the coming week , at Mrs. Parley Gimp 's . " She was made aware that it had fallen upon her ears , though heard unconsciously , when Serena Gimp caught her by the sleeve in the church porch . " Ai n't it awful , " said she , with a simper and a flutter of importance , " to have your name called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it had n't been for seeing the new minister , I would n't have come to meeting , I dreaded it so ! Ai n't he handsome ? He 's old , though -- thirty-five ! He 's broken-hearted , too ! Somebody died , or something else , that he was going to be married to , ever so many years ago ; and they say he has n't hardly spoken to a lady since . That 's so romantic ! I do n't wonder he preaches such low-spirited kind of sermons . Only I wish they war n't quite so . I suppose it 's beautiful , and heavenly minded , and all that ; but yet I 'd rather hear something a little kind of cheerful . Do n't you think so ? But the poetry was elegant -- war n't it ? I guess it 's original , too . They say he puts things in the Mishaumok Monthly . Come Wednesday , wo n't you ? We shall depend , you know . " To Miss Gimp , the one salient point , amidst the solemnities of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new strings to her bonnet for the occasion . Mrs. Gimp , being more immediately and personally affected , had modestly remained away from church . Glory McWhirk went straight through the village , home ; and out to her little room in the sunny side of the low , sloping roof . This was her winter nook . She had a shadier one , looking the other way , for summer . " I wonder if it 's all true ! " she cried , silently , in her soul , while she stood for a minute with bonnet and shawl still on , looking out from her little window , dreamily , over the dazzle of the snow , even as her half-blinded thought peered out from its own narrowness into the infinite splendor of the promise of God --  " I wonder if God will ever make me beautiful ! I wonder if I shall ever have a real , great joyfulness , that is n't a make believe ! " Glory called her fancies so . They followed her still . She lived yet in an ideal world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it -- had not come close enough to her , even in this , her widely amended condition , to displace the other . Remember -- this child of eighteen had missed her childhood ; had known neither father nor mother , sister nor brother . Do n't think her simple , in the pitiful meaning of the word ; but she still enacted , in the midst of her plain , daily life , wonderful dreams that nobody could have ever suspected ; and here , in her solitary chamber , called up at will creatures of imagination who were to her what human creatures , alas ! had never been . Above all , she had a sister here , to whom she told all her secrets . This sister 's name was Leonora . CHAPTER XVII . FROST-WONDERS . " No hammers fell , no ponderous axes rung ; Like some tall palm , the mystic fabric sprung . Majestic silence ! " HEBER . The thaw continued till the snow was nearly gone . Only the great drifts against the fences , and the white folds in the rifts of distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day of warm rain , that washed away the last fragment of earth 's cast-off vesture , and bathed her pure for the new adornment that was to be laid upon her . At night , the weather cooled , and the rain changed to a fine , slow mist , congealing as it fell . Faith stood next morning by a small round table in the sitting-room window , and leaned lovingly over her jonquils and hyacinths that were coming into bloom . Then , drawing the curtain cord to let in the first sunbeam that should slant from the south upon her bulbs , she gave a little cry of rapturous astonishment . It was a diamond morning ! Away off , up the lane , and over the meadows , every tree and bush was hung with twinkling gems that the slight wind swayed against each other with tiny crashes of faint music , and the sun was just touching with a level splendor . After that first , quick cry , Faith stood mute with ecstasy . " Mother ! " said she , breathlessly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ! have you seen it ? Just imagine what the woods must be this morning ! How can we think of buckwheats ? " Sounds and odors betrayed that Mis ' Battis and breakfast were in the little room adjoining . " There is a thought of something akin to them , is n't there , under all this splendor ? Men must live , and grass and grain must grow . " Mr. Gartney said this , as he came up behind wife and daughter , and laid a hand on a shoulder of each . " I know one thing , though , " said Faith . " I 'll eat the buckwheats , as a vulgar necessity , and then I 'll go over the brook and up in the woods behind the Pasture Rocks . It 'll last , wo n't it ? " " Not many hours , with this spring balm in the air , " replied her father . " You must make haste . By noon , it will be all a drizzle . " " Will it be quite safe for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll ask Aunt Faith to let me have Glory . She showed me the walk last summer . It is fair she should see this , now . " So the morning odds and ends were done up quickly at Cross Corners and at the Old House , and then Faith and Glory set forth together -- the latter in as sublime a rapture as could consist with mortal cohesion . The common roadside was an enchanted path . The glittering rime transfigured the very cart ruts into bars of silver ; and every coarse weed was a fretwork of beauty . " Bells on their toes " they had , this morning , assuredly ; each footfall made a music on the sod . Over the slippery bridge -- out across a stretch of open meadow , and then along a track that skirted the border of a sparse growth of trees , projecting itself like a promontory upon the level land -- round its abrupt angle into a sweep of meadow again , on whose farther verge rose the Pasture Rocks . Behind these rocks swelled up gently a slope , half pasture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although clear enough for comfortable walking , studded pretty closely with trees that often interlaced their branches overhead , and made great , pillared aisles , among whose shade , in summer , wound delicious little footpaths that all came out together , midway up , into -- what you shall be told of presently . Here , among and beyond the rocks , were oaks , and pines , and savins -- each needle-like leaf a shimmering lance -- each clustering branch a spray of gems -- and the stout , spreading limbs of the oaks delineating themselves against the sky above in Gothic frost-work . Suddenly -- before they thought it could be so near -- they came up and out into a broader opening . Between two rocks that made , as it were , a gateway , and around whose bases were grouped sentinel evergreens , they came into this wider space , floored with flat rock , the surface of a hidden ledge , carpeted with crisp mosses in the summer , whose every cup and hollow held a jewel now -- and inclosed with lofty oaks and pines , while , straight beyond , where the woods shut in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over whose brow hung pendent birches that in their icy robing drooped like glittering wings of cherubim above an altar . All around and underneath , this strange magnificence . Overhead , the everlasting Blue , that roofed it in with sapphire . In front , the rough , gigantic shrine . " It is like a cathedral ! " said Faith , solemnly and low . " See ! " whispered Glory , catching her companion hastily by the arm --  " there is the minister ! " A little way beyond them , at the right , out from among the clumps of evergreen where some other of the little wood walks opened , a figure advanced without perceiving them . It was Roger Armstrong , the new minister . He held his hat in his hand . He walked , uncovered , as he would have into a church , into this forest temple , where God 's finger had just been writing on the walls . When he turned , slowly , his eye fell on the other two who stood there . It lighted up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faith bowed . Glory stood back , shyly . Neither party seemed astonished at the meeting . It was so plain why they came , that if they had wondered at all , it would have been that the whole village should not be pouring out hither , also . Mr. Armstrong led them to the center of the rocky space . " This is the best point , " said he . And then was silent . There was no need of words . A greatness of thought made itself felt from one to the other . Only , between still pauses , words came that almost spoke themselves . " ' Eye hath not seen , nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive , that which God hath prepared for them that love him . ' What a commentary upon His promise is a glory like this ! " ' And they shall all shine like the sun in the kingdom of my Father ! ' " Faith stood by the minister 's side , and glanced , when he spoke , from the wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . There was something in the very presence of this man that drew others who approached him into the felt presence of God . Because he stood therein in the spirit . These are the true apostles whom Christ sends forth . Glory could have sobbed with an oppression of reverence , enthusiasm , and joy . " It is only a glimpse , " said Mr. Armstrong , by and by . " It is going , already . " A drip -- drip -- was beginning to be heard . " You ought to get away from under the trees before the thaw comes fully on , " continued he . " A branch breaks , now and then , and the ice will be falling constantly . I can show you a more open way than the one you came by , I think . " And he gave his arm to Faith over the slope that even now was growing wet and slippery in the sun . Faith touched it with a reverence , and dropped it again , modestly , when they reached a safer foothold . Glory kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kindly word , and a thought for her safety . Once he took her hand , and helped her down a sudden descent in the path , where the water had run over and made a smooth , dangerous glare . " I shall call soon to see your father and mother , Miss Gartney , " said he , when they reached the road again beyond the brook , and their ways home lay in different directions . " This meeting , to-day , has given me pleasure . " " How ? " Faith wondered silently , as she kept on to the Cross Corners . She had hardly spoken a word . But , then , she might have remembered that the minister 's own words had been few , yet her very speechlessness before him had come from the deep pleasure that his presence had given to her . The recognition of souls cares little for words . Faith 's soul had been in her face to-day , as Roger Armstrong had seen it each Sunday , also , in the sweet , listening look she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this young , pure life , with a joy in its gentle purity ; the joy of an elder over a younger angel in the school of God . And Glory ? she laid up in her own heart a beautiful remembrance of something she had never known before . Of a near approach to something great and high , yet gentle and beneficent . Of a kindly , helping touch , a gracious smile , a glance that spoke straight to the mute aspiration within her . The minister had not failed , through all her humbleness and shyness , to read some syllables of that large , unuttered life of hers that lay beneath . He whose labor it is to save souls , learns always the insight that discerns souls . " I have seen the Winter ! " cried Faith , glowing and joyous , as she came in from her walk . " It has been a beautiful time ! " said Glory to her shadow sister , when she went to hang away hood and shawl . " It has been a beautiful time -- and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OUT IN THE SNOW . " Sydnaein showers Of sweet discourse , whose powers Can crown old winter 's head with flowers . " CRASHAW . Winter had not exhausted her repertory , however . She had more wonders to unfold . There came a long snowstorm . " Faithie , " said her father , coming in , wrapped up in furs from a visit to the stable , " put your comfortables on , and we 'll go and see the snow . We 'll make tracks , literally , for the hills . There is n't a road fairly broken between here and Grover 's Peak . The snow lies beautifully , though ; and there is n't a breath of wind . It will be a sight to see . " Faith brought , quickly , sontag , jacket , and cloak -- hood and veil , and long , warm snow boots , and in ten minutes was ready , as she averred , for a sledge ride to Hudson 's Bay . Luther drove the sleigh close to the kitchen door , that Faith might not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped directly from the threshold into the warm nest of buffalo robes ; while Mis ' Battis put a great stone jug of hot water in beside her feet , asserting that it was " a real comfortin ' thing on a sleigh ride , and that they need n't be afraid of its leakin ' , for the cork was druv in as tight as an eye tooth ! " So , out by the barn , into the road , and away from the village toward the hills , they went , with the glee of resonant bells and excited expectation . A mile , or somewhat more , along the Sedgely turnpike , took them into a bit of woods that skirted the road on either side , for a considerable distance . Away in , under the trees , the stillness and the whiteness and the wonderful multiplication of snow shapes were like enchantment . Each bush had an attitude and drapery and expression of its own , as if some weird life had suddenly been spellbound in these depths . Cherubs , and old women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bent , and stood majestic , in a motionless poise . Over all , the bent boughs made marble and silver arches in shadow and light , and , far down between , the vistas lengthened endlessly , still crowded with mystic figures , haunting the long galleries with their awful beauty . They went on , penetrating a lifeless silence ; their horse 's feet making the first prints since early morning in the unbroken smoothness of the way , and the only sound the gentle tinkle of their own bells , as they moved pleasantly , but not fleetly , along . So , up the ascent , where the land lay higher , toward the hills . " I feel , " said Faith , " as if I had been hurried through the Louvre , or the Vatican , or both , and had n't half seen anything . Was there ever anything so strange and beautiful ? " " We shall find more Louvres presently , " said her father . " We 'll keep the road round Grover 's Peak , and turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That lovely , wild , shady road we took last summer so often , where the grapevines grow so , all over the trees ? " " Exactly , " replied Mr. Gartney . " But you must n't scream if we thump about a little , in the drifts up there . It 's pretty rough , at the best of times , and the snow will have filled in the narrow spaces between the rocks and ridges , like a freshet . Shall you be afraid ? " " Afraid ! Oh , no , indeed ! It 's glorious ! I think I should like to go everywhere ! " " There is a good deal of everywhere in every little distance , " said Mr. Gartney . " People get into cars , and go whizzing across whole States , often , before they stop to enjoy thoroughly something that is very like what they might have found within ten miles of home . For my part , I like microscopic journeying . " " Leaving ' no stone unturned . ' So do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half know the journey between Kinnicutt and Sedgely yet , I think . And then , too , they 're multiplied , over and over , by all the different seasons , and by different sorts of weather . Oh , we sha n't use them up , in a long while ! " Saidie Gartney had not felt , perhaps , in all her European travel , the sense of inexhaustible pleasure that Faith had when she said this . Down under Grover 's Peak , with the river on one side , and the white-robed cedar thickets rising on the other -- with the low afternoon sun glinting across from the frosted roofs of the red mill buildings and barns and farmhouses to the rocky slope of the Peak . Then they came round and up again , over a southerly ridge , by beautiful Garland Lane , that she knew only in its summer look , when the wild grape festooned itself wantonly from branch to branch , and sometimes , even , from side to side ; and so gave the narrow forest road its name . Quite into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if , skirting the dark peak that shut it off from ordinary espial , they had lighted on a bypath that led them covertly in . Trailing and climbing vines wore their draperies lightly ; delicate shrubs bowed like veiled shapes in groups around the bases of tall tree trunks , and slight-stemmed birches quivered under their canopies of snow . Little birds hopped in and out under the pure , still shelter , and left their tiny tracks , like magical hieroglyphs , in the else untrodden paths . " Lean this way , Faith , and keep steady ! " cried Mr. Gartney , as the horse plunged breast high into a drift , and the sleigh careened toward the side Faith was on . It was a sharp strain , but they plowed their way through , and came upon a level again . This by-street was literally unbroken . No one had traversed it since the beginning of the storm . The drifts had had it all their own way there , and it involved no little adventurousness and risk , as Mr. Gartney began to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adventure was upon them both . On all , I should say ; for the strong horse plunged forward , from drift to drift , as though he delighted in the encounter . Moreover , to turn was impossible . Faith laughed , and gave little shrieks , alternately , as they rose triumphantly from deep , " slumpy " hollows , or pitched headlong into others again . Thus , struggling , enjoying -- just frightened enough , now and then , to keep up the excitement -- they came upon the summit of the ridge . Now their way lay downward . This began to look really almost perilous . With careful guiding , however , and skillful balancing -- tipping , creaking , sinking , emerging -- they kept on slowly , about half the distance down the descent . Suddenly , the horse , as men and brutes , however sagacious , sometimes will , made a miscalculation of depth or power -- lost his sure balance -- sunk to his body in the yielding snow -- floundered violently in an endeavor to regain safe footing -- and , snap ! crash ! was down against the drift at the left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his head . One runner was up -- one down . The sleigh stuck fast at an angle of about thirty degrees . Faith clung to the upper side . Here was a situation ! What was to be done ? Twilight coming on -- no help near -- no way of getting anywhere ! " Faith , " said Mr. Gartney , " what have you got on your feet ? " " Long , thick snow boots , father . What can I do ? " " Do you dare to come and try to unfasten these buckles ? There is no danger . Major ca n't stir while I hold him by the head . " Faith jumped out into the snow , and valorously set to work at the buckles . She managed to undo one , and to slip out the fastening of the trace , on one side , where it held to the whiffletree . But the horse was lying so that she could not get at the other . " I 'll come there , father ! " she cried , clambering and struggling through the drift till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I hold him while you undo the harness ? " " I do n't believe you can , Faithie . He is n't down so flat as to be quite under easy control . " " Not if I sit on his head ? " asked Faith . " That might do , " replied her father , laughing . " Only you would get frightened , maybe , and jump up too soon . " " No , I wo n't , " said Faith , quite determined upon heroism . While she spoke , she had picked up the whip , which had fallen close by , doubled back the lash against the handle , and was tying her blue veil to its tip . Then she sat down on the animal 's great cheek , which she had never fancied to be half so broad before , and gently patted his nose with one hand , while she upheld her blue flag with the other . Major 's big , panting breaths came up , close beside her face . She kept a quick , watchful eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as can be , father ! It must be what Miss Beecher called the ' chivalry of horses ' ! " " It 's the chivalry that has to develop under petticoat government ! " retorted Mr. Gartney . At this moment Faith 's blue flag waved vehemently over her head . She had caught the jingle of bells , and perceived a sleigh , with a man in it , come out into the crossing at the foot of Garland Lane . The man descried the signal and the disaster , and the sleigh stopped . Alighting , he led his horse to the fence , fastened him there , and turning aside into the steep , narrow , unbroken road , began a vigorous struggle through the drifts to reach the wreck . Coming nearer , he discerned and recognized Mr. Gartney , who also , at the same moment , was aware of him . It was Mr. Armstrong . " Keep still a minute longer , Faith , " said her father , lifting the remaining shaft against the dasher , and trying to push the sleigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , he was unable to accomplish . So the minister came up , and found Faith still seated on the horse 's head . " Miss Gartney ! Let me hold him ! " cried he . " I 'm quite comfortable ! " laughed Faith . " If you would just help my father , please ! " The sleigh was drawn back by the combined efforts of the two gentlemen , and then both came round to Faith . " Now , Faith , jump ! " said her father , placing his hands upon the creature 's temple , close beside her , while Mr. Armstrong caught her arms to snatch her safely away . Faith sprang , or was lifted as she sprang , quite to the top of the huge bank of snow under and against which they had , among them , beaten in and trodden down such a hollow , and the instant after , Mr. Gartney releasing Major 's head , and uttering a sound of encouragement , the horse raised himself , with a half roll , and a mighty scramble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four feet again , and shook his great skin . Mr. Gartney examined the harness . The broken shaft proved the extent of damage done . This , at the moment , however , was irremediable . He knotted the hanging straps and laid them over the horse 's neck . Then he folded a buffalo skin , and arranged it , as well as he could , above and behind the saddle , which he secured again by its girth . " Mr. Armstrong , " said he , as he completed this disposal of matters , " you came along in good time . I am very much obliged to you . If you will do me the further favor to take my daughter home , I will ride to the nearest house where I can obtain a sleigh , and some one to send back for these traps of mine . " " Miss Gartney , " said the minister , in answer , " can you sit a horse 's back as well as you did his eyebrow ? " Faith laughed , and reaching her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her snowy pinnacle to the buffalo cushion . Her father took the horse by the bit , and Mr. Armstrong kept at his side holding Faith firmly to her seat . In this fashion , grasping the bridle with one hand , and resting the other on Mr. Armstrong 's shoulder , she was transported to the sleigh at the foot of the hill . " We were talking about long journeys in small circuits , " said Faith , when she was well tucked in , and they had set off on a level and not utterly untracked road . " I think I have been to the Alhambra , and to Rome , and have had a peep into fairyland , and come back , at last , over the Alps ! " Mr. Armstrong understood her . " It has been beautiful , " said he . " I shall begin to expect always to encounter you whenever I get among things wild and wonderful ! " " And yet I have lived all my life , till now , in tame streets , " said Faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , when we first came to the country . But I am finding out Kinnicutt . One ca n't see the whole of anything at once . " " We are small creatures , and can only pick up atoms as we go , whether of things outward or inward . People talk about taking ' comprehensive views ' ; and they suppose they do it . There is only One who does . " Faith was silent . " Did it ever occur to you , " said Mr. Armstrong , " how little your thought can really grasp at once , even of what you already know ? How narrow your mental horizon is ? " " Does n't it seem strange , " said Faith , in a subdued tone , " that the earth should all have been made for such little lives to be lived in , each in its corner ? " " If it did not thereby prove these little lives to be but the beginning . This great Beyond that we get glimpses of , even upon earth , makes it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to match the Infinite Creation . God puts us , as He did Moses , into a cleft of the rock , that we may catch a glimmer of His glory as He goes by ; and then He tells us that one day we ' shall know even as also we are known ' ! " " And I suppose it ought to make us satisfied to live whatever little life is given us ? " said Faith , gently and wistfully . Mr. Armstrong turned toward her , and looked earnestly into her eyes . " Has that thought troubled you , too ? Never let it do so again , my child ! Believe that however little of tangible present good you may have , you have the unseen good of heaven , and the promise of all things to come . " " But we do see lives about us in the world that seem to be and to accomplish so much ! " " And so we ask why ours should not be like them ? Yes ; all souls that aspire , must question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , some day , if you like , the thought that comforted me at a time when that question was a struggle . " " I should like ! " said Faith , with deeply stirred and grateful emphasis . Then they drove on in silence , for a while ; and then the minister , pleasantly and easily , brought on a conversation of everyday matters ; and so they came to Cross Corners , just as Mrs. Gartney was gazing a little anxiously out of the window , down the road . Mrs. Gartney urged the minister to come in and join them at the tea table ; but " it was late in the week -- he had writing to finish at home that evening -- he would very gladly come another time . " " Mother ! " cried Faith , presently , moving out of a dream in which she had been sitting before the fire , " I wonder whether it has been two hours , or two weeks , or two years , since we set off from the kitchen door ! I have seen so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Armstrong , after we met him , that I had been through the Alhambra and the Vatican , and into fairyland , and over the Alps . And after that , mother , " she added , low , " I think he almost took me into heaven ! " CHAPTER XIX . A " LEADING . " " The least flower , with a brimming cup , may stand And share its dewdrop with another near . " MRS . BROWNING . Glory McWhirk was waiting upstairs , in Faith 's pretty , white , dimity-hung chamber . These two girls , of such utterly different birth and training , were drawing daily toward each other across the gulf of social circumstance that separated them . Twice a week , now , Glory came over , and found her seat and her books ready in Miss Faith 's pleasant room , and Faith herself waiting to impart to her , or to put her in the way of gathering , those bits of week-day knowledge she had ignorantly hungered for so long . Glory made quick progress . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of her stay with Miss Henderson , by a regular attendance , half daily , at the district school . Aunt Faith said " nobody 's time belonged to anybody that knew better themselves , until they could read , and write , and figure , and tell which side of the globe they lived on . " Then , too , the girl 's indiscriminate gleaning from such books as had come in her way , through all these years , assorted itself gradually , now , about new facts . Glory 's " good times " had , verily , begun at last . On this day that she sat waiting , Faith had been called down by her mother to receive some village ladies who had walked over to Cross Corners to pay a visit . Glory had time for two or three chapters of " Ivanhoe , " and to tell Hendie , who strayed in , and begged for it , Bridget Foye 's old story of the little red hen , while the regular course of topics was gone through below , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants and helplessness of Mrs. Sheffley and her seven children , and whether the society had better do anything more for them -- the trouble in the west district school , and the question " where the Dorcas bag was to go next time . " At last , the voices and footsteps retreated , through the entry , the door closed somewhat promptly as the last " good afternoon " was said , and Faith sprang up the narrow staircase . There was a lesson in Geography , and a bit of natural Philosophy to be done first , and then followed their Bible talk ; for this was Saturday . Before Glory went it had come to be Faith 's practice always to read to her some bit of poetry -- a gem from Tennyson or Mrs. Browning , or a stray poem from a magazine or paper which she had laid by as worthy . " Glory , " said she , to-day , " I 'm going to let you share a little treasure of mine -- something Mr. Armstrong gave me . " Glory 's eyes deepened and glowed . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verse . I shall read it to you , because I think it will just answer you , as it did me . Do n't you feel , sometimes , like a little brook in a deep wood ? " Glory 's gaze never moved from Faith 's face . Her poetical instinct seized the image , and the thought of her life applied it . " All alone , and singing to myself ? Yes , I did , Miss Faith . But I think it is growing lighter and pleasanter every day . I think I am getting --  --  " " Stop ! stop ! " said Faith . " Do n't steal the verses before I read them ! You 're such a queer child , Glory ! One never can tell you anything . " And then Faith gave her pearls ; because she knew they would not be trampled under foot , but taken into a heart and held there ; and because just such a rapt and reverent ecstasy as her own had been when the minister had given her , in fulfillment of his promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , looked out from the face that was uplifted to hers . " ' Up in the wild , where no one comes to look , There lives and sings , a little lonely brook ; Liveth and singeth in the dreary pines , Yet creepeth on to where the daylight shines . " ' Pure from their heaven , in mountain chalice caught , It drinks the rains , as drinks the soul her thought ; And down dim hollows , where it winds along , Bears its life-burden of unlistened song . " ' I catch the murmur of its undertone That sigheth , ceaselessly ,  - -  alone ! alone ! And hear , afar , the Rivers gloriously Shout on their paths toward the shining sea ! " ' The voiceful Rivers , chanting to the sun ; And wearing names of honor , every one ; Outreaching wide , and joining hand with hand To pour great gifts along the asking land . " ' Ah , lonely brook ! creep onward through the pines ! Press through the gloom , to where the daylight shines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the floods are all akin to thee ! " ' Drink the sweet rain the gentle heaven sendeth ; Hold thine own path , howeverward it tendeth ; For , somewhere , underneath the eternal sky , Thou , too , shalt find the Rivers , by-and-by ! ' " Faith 's voice trembled with earnestness as she finished . When she looked up from the paper as she refolded it , tears were running down Glory 's cheeks . " Why , the little brook has overflowed ! " cried Faith , playfully . If she had not found this to say , she would have cried , herself . " Miss Faith ! " said Glory , " I ai n't sure whether I was meant to tell ; but do you know what the minister has asked Miss Henderson ? Perhaps she wo n't ; I 'm afraid not ; it would be too good a time ! but he wants her to let him come and board with her ! Just think what it would be for him to be in the house with us all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be just as if one of those great Rivers had come rolling along through the dark woods , right among the little lonely brooks ! " Faith made no answer . She was astonished . Miss Henderson had said nothing of it . She never did make known her subjects of deliberation till the deliberations had become conclusions . " Why , you do n't seem glad ! " " I am glad , " said Faith , slowly and quietly . She was strangely conscious at the moment that she said so , glad as she would be if Mr. Armstrong were really to come so near , and she might see him daily , of a half jealousy that Glory should be nearer still . It was quite true that Mr. Armstrong had this wish . Hitherto , he had been at the house of the elder minister , Mr. Holland . A unanimous invitation had been given to Mr. Armstrong by the people to remain among them as their settled pastor . This he had not yet consented to do . But he had entered upon another engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needed a permanent home , which he could not conveniently have at Mr. Holland 's . There was great putting of heads together at the " Dorcas , " about it . Mrs. Gimp " would offer ; but then -- there was Serena , and folks would talk . " Other families had similar holdbacks -- that is the word , for they were not absolute insuperabilities -- wary mothers were waiting until it should appear positively necessary that somebody should waive objection , and take the homeless pastor in ; and each watched keenly for the critical moment when it should be just late enough , and not too late , for her to yield . Meanwhile , Mr. Armstrong quietly left all this seething , and walked off out of the village , one day , to Cross Corners , and asked Miss Henderson if he might have one of her quaint , pleasant , old-fashioned rooms . Miss Henderson was deliberating . This very afternoon , she sat in the southwest tea parlor , with her knitting forgotten in her lap , and her eyes searching the bright western sky , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It ai n't that I mind the trouble . And it ai n't that there is n't house room . And it ai n't that I do n't like the minister , " soliloquized she . " It 's whether it would be respectable common sense . I ai n't going to take the field with the Gimps and the Leatherbees , nor to have them think it , either . She 's over here almost every blessed day of her life . I might as well try to keep the sunshine out of the old house , as to keep her ; and I should be about as likely to want to do one as the other . But just let me take in Mr. Armstrong , and there 'd be all the eyes in the village watching . There could n't so much as a cat walk in or out , but they 'd know it , somehow . And they 'd be sure to say she was running after the minister . " Miss Henderson 's pronouns were not precise in their reference . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , and that sufficed . " It would be a disgrace to the parish , anyhow , " she resumed , " to let those Gimps and Leatherbees get him into their net ; and they 'll do it if Providence or somebody do n't interpose . I wish I was sure whether it was a leading or not ! " By and by she reverted , at last , as she always did , to that question of its being a " leading , " or not ; and , taking down the old Bible from the corner shelf , she laid it with solemnity on the little light stand at her side , and opened it , as she had known her father do , in the important crises of his life , for an " indication . " The wooden saddle and the gun were not all that had come down to Aunt Faith from the primitive days of the Puritan settlers . The leaves parted at the story of the Good Samaritan . Bible leaves are apt to part , as the heart opens , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Glory was washing up the tea things , Aunt Faith put on cloak and hood , and walked over to Cross Corners . " No -- I wo n't take off my things , " she replied to Mrs. Gartney 's advance of assistance . " I 've just come over to tell you what I 'm going to do . I 've made up my mind to take the minister to board . And when the washing and ironing 's out of the way , next week , I shall fix up a room for him , and he 'll come . " " That 's a capital plan , Aunt Faith ! " said her nephew , with a tone of pleased animation . " Cross Corners will be under obligation to you . Mr. Armstrong is a man whom I greatly respect and admire . " " So do I , " said Miss Henderson . " And if I did n't , when a man is beset with thieves all the way from Jerusalem to Jericho , it 's time for some kind of a Samaritan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the news , and had her word of comment to offer . " She 's got room enough for him , if that 's all ; but I would n't a believed she 'd have let herself be put about and upset so , if it was for John the Baptist ! I always thought she was setter'n an old hen ! But then , she 's gittin ' into years , and it 's kinder handy , I s'pose , havin ' a minister round the house , sayin ' she should be took anyways sudden ! " Village comments it would be needless to attempt to chronicle . April days began to wear their tearful beauty , and the southwest room at the old house was given up to Mr. Armstrong . CHAPTER XX . PAUL . " Standing , with reluctant feet , Where the brook and river meet , Womanhood and childhood fleet ! " LONGFELLOW . Glory had not been content with the utmost she could find to do in making the southwest room as clean , and bright , and fresh , and perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nice , old-fashioned methods and materials afforded possibility for . Twenty times a day , during the few that intervened between its fitting up and Mr. Armstrong 's occupation of it , she darted in , to settle a festoon of fringe , or to pick a speck from the carpet , or to move a chair a hair's-breadth this way or that , or to smooth an invisible crease in the counterpane , or , above all , to take a pleased survey of everything once more , and to wonder how the minister would like it . So well , indeed , he liked it , when he had taken full possession , that he seemed to divine the favorite room must have been relinquished to him , and to scruple at keeping it quite solely to himself . In the pleasant afternoons , when the spring sun got round to his westerly windows , and away from the southeast apartment , whither Miss Henderson had betaken herself , her knitting work , and her Bible , and where now the meals were always spread , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the passage , and into the keeping room , and would often take a book , and come in , himself , also , with the sunlight . Then Glory , busy in the kitchen , just beyond , would catch words of conversation , or of reading , or even be called in to hear the latter . And she began to think that there were good times , truly , in this world , and that even she was " in ' em ! " April days , as they lengthened and brightened , brought other things , also , to pass . The Rushleigh party had returned from Europe . Faith had a note from Margaret . The second wedding was close at hand , and would she not come down ? But her services as bridesmaid were not needed this time ; there was nothing so exceedingly urgent in the invitation -- Faith 's intimacy was with the Rushleighs , not the Livingstons -- that she could not escape its acceptance if she desired ; and so -- there was a great deal to be done in summer preparation , which Mis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish alone ; also , there was the forget-me-not ring lying in her box of ornaments , that gave her a little troubled perplexity as often as she saw it there ; and Faith excused herself in a graceful little note , and stayed at Cross Corners , helping her mother fold away the crimson curtains , and get up the white muslin ones , make up summer sacks for Hendie , and retouch her own simple wardrobe , which this year could receive little addition . One day , Aunt Faith had twisted her foot by a slip upon the stairs , and was kept at home . Glory , of course , was obliged to remain also , as Miss Henderson was confined , helpless , to her chair or sofa . Faith Gartney and the minister walked down the pleasant lane , and along the quiet road to the village church , together . Faith had fresh , white ribbons , to-day , upon her simple straw bonnet , and delicate flowers and deep green leaves about her face . She seemed like an outgrowth of the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attire reflected the significance of the day 's own newness and beauty . " Do you know , " said Mr. Armstrong , presently , after the morning greeting had passed , and they had walked a few paces , silently , " do you know that you are one of Glory 's saints , Miss Faith ? " Faith 's wondering eyes looked out their questioning astonishment from a deep rosiness that overspread her face . The minister was not apt to make remarks of at all a personal bearing . Neither was this allusion to sainthood quite to have been looked for , from his lips . Faith could scarcely comprehend . " I found her this morning , as I came out to cross the field , sitting on the doorstone with her Bible and a rosary of beautiful , small , variously tinted shells upon her lap . I stopped to speak with her , and asked leave to look at them . ' They were given to me when I was very little , ' she said . ' A lady sent them from Rome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful , ' I said , ' and a blessing , if that mean a true man 's prayer , can never be worthless . But , ' I asked her , ' do you use these , Glory ? ' ' Not as she did once , ' she said . She had almost forgotten about that . She knew the larger beads stood for saints , and the smaller ones between were prayers . ' But , ' she went on , ' it is n't for my prayers I keep them now . I 've named some of my saints ' beads for the people that have done me the most good in my life , and been the kindest to me ; and the little ones are thoughts , and things they 've taught me . This large one , with the queer spots , is Miss Henderson ; and this lovely rose-colored one is Miss Faith ; and these are Katie Ryan and Bridget Foye ; but you do n't know about them . ' And then she timidly told me that the white one next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Faith ! It is nearly fearful , sometimes , to get a glimpse of what one is to some trustful human soul , who looks through one toward the Highest ! " Faith had tears in her eyes . " Glory is such a strange girl , " said she . " She seems to have an instinct for things that other people are educated up to . " " She has seized the spirit of the dead Roman calendar , and put it into this rosary . Our saints are the spirits through whom God wills to send us of His own . Whatever becomes to us a channel of His truth and love we must involuntarily canonize and consecrate . Woe , if by the same channel ever an offense cometh ! " Perhaps Faith was nearly the only person in church , to-day , who did not notice that there were strangers in the pew behind the Gimps . When she came out , she was joined ; and not by strangers . Margaret and Paul Rushleigh came eagerly to her side . " We came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morrises ; and ran away from them here , purposely to meet you . And we mean to be very good , and go to church all day , if you will take us home with you meanwhile . " Faith , between her surprise , her pleasure , her embarrassment , the rush of old remembrance , and a quick , apprehensive thought of Mis ' Battis and her probable arrangements , made almost an awkward matter of her reply . But her father and mother came up , welcomed the Rushleighs cordially , and the five were presently on their way toward Cross Corners , and Faith had recovered sufficient self-possession to say something beyond mere words of course . Paul Rushleigh looked very handsome ! And very glad , too , to see shy Faith , who kept as invisible as might be at Margaret 's other side , and looked there , in her simple spring dress contrasted with Margaret 's rich and fashionable , though also simple and ladylike attire , like a field daisy beside a garden rose . Dinner was of no moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reheated and served with hot vegetables since their coming in , and a custard pudding , and some pastry cakes that Faith 's fingers had shaped , and coffee ; but they drank in balm and swallowed sunshine , and the essence of all that was to be concrete by and by in fruitful fields and gardens . And they talked of old times ! Three years old , nearly ! And Faith and Margaret laughed , and Mrs. Gartney listened , and dispensed dinner , or spoke gently now and then , and Paul did his cleverest with Mr. Gartney , so that the latter gentleman declared afterwards that " young Rushleigh was a capital fellow ; well posted ; his father 's million did n't seem to have spoiled him yet . " Altogether , this unexpected visit infused great life at Cross Corners . Why was it that Faith , when she thought it all over , tried to weigh so very nicely just the amount of gladness she had felt ; and was dimly conscious of a vague misgiving , deep down , lest her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than she was quite ready to have them ? What made her especially rejoice that Saidie and the strawberries had not come yet ? When Paul Rushleigh took her hand at parting , he glanced down at the fair little fingers , and then up , inquiringly , at Faith 's face . Her eyes fell , and the color rose , till it became an indignation at itself . She grew hot , for days afterwards , many a time , as she remembered it . Who has not blushed at the self-suspicion of blushing ? Who has not blushed at the simple recollection of having blushed before ? On Monday , this happened . Faith went over to the Old House , to inquire about Aunt Henderson 's foot , and to sit with her , if she should wish it , for an hour . She chose the hour at which she thought Mr. Armstrong usually walked to the village . Somehow , greatly as she enjoyed all the minister 's kindly words , and each moment of his accidental presence , she had , of late , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Faith . A secret womanly instinct , only , it was ; waked into no consciousness , and but ignorantly aware of its own prompting . To-day , however , Mr. Armstrong had not gone out . Some writing that he was tempted to do , contrary to his usual Monday habit , had detained him within . And so , just as Miss Henderson , having given the history of her slip , and the untoward wrenching of her foot , and its present condition , to Faith 's inquiries , asked her suddenly , " if they had n't had some city visitors yesterday , and what sent them flacketting over from Lakeside to church in the village ? " the minister walked in . If he had n't heard , she might not have done it ; but , with the abrupt question , came , as abruptly , the hot memory of yesterday ; and with those other eyes , beside the doubled keenness of Aunt Faith 's over her spectacles , upon her , it was so much worse if she should , that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and up , till the very roots of her soft hair tingled , and a quick shame wrapped her as in a flaming garment . The minister saw , and read . Not quite the obvious inference Faith might fear -- he had a somewhat profounder knowledge of nature than that -- but what persuaded him there was a thought , at least , between the two who met yesterday , more than of a mere chance greeting ; it might not lie so much with Faith as with the other ; yet it had the power -- even the consciousness of its unspoken being , to send the crimson to her face . What kept the crimson there and deepened it , he knew quite well . He knew the shame was at having blushed at all . Nevertheless , Mr. Armstrong remembered that blush , and pondered it , almost as long as Faith herself . In the little time that he had felt himself her friend , he had grown to recognize so fully , and to prize so dearly , her truth , her purity , her high-mindedness , her reverence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , without touching his solicitous love . Was this young man worthy of a blush from Faith ? Was there a height in his nature answering to the reach of hers ? Was the quick , impulsive pain that came to him in the thought of how much that rose hue of forehead and cheek might mean , an intuition of his stronger and more instructed soul of a danger to the child that she might not dream ? Be it as it might , Roger Armstrong pondered . He would also watch . CHAPTER XXI . PRESSURE . " To be warped , unconsciously , by the magnetic influence of all around is the destiny , to a certain extent , of even the greatest souls . "  - -  OAKFIELD . June came , and Saidie Gartney . Not for flowers , or strawberries , merely ; but for father 's and mother 's consent that , in a few weeks , when flowers and strawberries should have fully come , there should be a marriage feast made for her in the simple home , and she should go forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy New York banker . Aunt Etherege and Saidie filled the house . With finery , with bustle , with important presence . Miss Gartney 's engagement had been sudden ; her marriage was to be speedy . Half a dozen seamstresses , and as many sewing machines , were busy in New York -- hands , feet , and wheels -- in making up the delicate draperies for the trousseau ; and Madame A --  --  was frantic with the heap of elaborate dresses that was thrust upon her hands , and must be ready for the thirtieth . Mrs. Gartney and Faith had enough to do , to put the house and themselves in festival trim . Hendie was spoiled with having no lessons , and more toys and sugar plums than he knew what to do with . Mr. Selmore 's comings and goings made special ebullitions , weekly , where was only a continuous lesser effervescence before . Mis ' Battis had not been able to subside into an armchair since the last day of May . Faith found great favor in the eyes of her brother-in-law elect . He pronounced her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was talk of how pleasant it would be , to have her in Madison Square , and show her to the world . Faith said nothing to this , but in her heart she clung to Kinnicutt . Glory thought Miss Gartney wonderful . Even Mr. Armstrong spoke to Aunt Faith of the striking beauty of her elder niece . " I do n't know how she does look , " Aunt Faith replied , with all her ancient gruffness . " I see a great show of flounces , and manners , and hair ; but they do n't look as if they all grew , natural . I ca n't make her out , amongst all that . Now , Faith 's just Faith . You see her prettiness the minute you look at her , as you do a flower 's . " " There are not many like Miss Faith , " replied Mr. Armstrong . " I never knew but one other who so wore the fresh , pure beauty of God 's giving . " His voice was low and quiet , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , and sat down on the doorstone . There was a strange tumult at her heart . In the midst , a noble joy . About it , a disquietude , as of one who feels shut out -- alone . " I do n't know what ails me . I wonder if I ai n't glad ! Of course , it 's nothing to me . I ai n't in it . But it must be beautiful to be so ! And to have such words said ! She do n't know what a sight the minister thinks of her ! I know . I knew before . It 's beautiful -- but I ai n't in it . Only , I think I 've got the feeling of it all . And I 'm glad it 's real , somewhere . Some way , I seem to have so much here , that never grows out into anything . Maybe I 'd be beautiful if it did ! " So talked Glory , interjectionally , with herself . In the midst of these excited days , there came two letters to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to some land Mr. Gartney owned there , taken years ago , at a very low valuation , for a debt . This was likely , from the rapid growth and improvement in the neighborhood , to become , within a few years , perhaps , a property of some importance . The other letter was from his son , James Gartney , in San Francisco . The young man urged his father to consider whether it might not be a good idea for him to come out and join him in California . James Gartney 's proposal evidently roused his attention . It was a great deal to think of , certainly ; but it was worth thinking of , too . James had married in San Francisco , had a pleasant home there , and was prospering . Many old business friends had gone from Mishaumok , in the years when the great flood of enterprise set westward across the continent , and were building up name and influence in the Golden Land . The idea found a place in his brain , and clung there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round so that even this thought need to be no hindrance to the scheme . Changes , and plans , and interests , and influences were gathering ; all to bear down upon one young life . " More news ! " said Mr. Gartney , one morning , coming in from his walk to the village post office , to the pleasant sitting room , or morning room , as Mrs. Etherege and Saidie called it , where Faith was helping her sister write a list of the hundreds who were to receive Mr. and Mrs. Selmore 's cards --  " At Home , in September , in Madison Square . " " Whom do you think I met in the village , this morning ? " Everybody looked up , and everybody 's imagination took a discursive leap among possibilities , and then everybody , of course , asked " Whom ? " " Old Jacob Rushleigh , himself . He has taken a house at Lakeside , for the summer . And he has bought the new mills just over the river . That is to give young Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow ; and when places or people once take a start , there 's no knowing what they may come to . Here 's something for you , Faithie , that I dare say tells all about it . " And he tossed over her shoulder , upon the table , a letter , bearing her name , in Margaret Rushleigh 's chirography , upon the cover . Faith 's head was bent over the list she was writing ; but the vexatious color , feeling itself shielded in her face , crept round till it made her ear tips rosy . Saidie put out her forefinger , with a hardly perceptible motion , at the telltale sign , and nodded at Aunt Etherege behind her sister 's back . Aunt Etherege looked bland and sagacious . Upstairs , a little after , these sentences were spoken in Saidie 's room . " Of course it will be , " said the younger to the elder lady . " It 's been going on ever since they were children . Faith has n't a right to say no , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mills ? " " I do n't see that the houses and mills were necessary to the object . Rather cumbersome and costly machinery , I should think , to bring to bear upon such a simple purpose . " " Oh , the business plan is something that has come up accidentally , no doubt . Running after one thing , people very often stumble upon another . But it will all play in together , you 'll see . Only , I 'm afraid I sha n't have the glory of introducing Faithie in New York ! " " It would be as good a thing as possible . And I can perceive that your father and mother count upon it , also . In their situation what a great relief it would be ! Of course , Henderson never could do so mad a thing as take the child up by the roots , again , and transplant her to San Francisco ! And I see plainly he has got that in his own head . " A door across the passage at this moment shut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low chair by her sewing table sat the young sister whose fate had been so lightly decreed . Was it all just so , as Saidie had said ? Had she no longer a right to say no ? Only themselves know how easily , how almost inevitably , young judgments and consciences are drawn on in the track beaten down for them by others . Many and many a life decision has been made , through this taking for granted that bears with its mute , but magnetic power , upon the shyness and irresolution that can scarcely face and interpret its own wish or will . It was very true , that , as Saidie Gartney had said , " this had been going on for years . " For years , Faith had found great pleasantness in the companionship and evident preference of Paul Rushleigh . There had been nobody to compare with him in her young set in Mishaumok . She knew he liked her . She had been proud of it . The girlish fancy , that may be forgotten in after years , or may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm and happy wifehood , had been given to him . And what troubled her now ? Was it that always , when the decisive moment approaches , there is a little revulsion of timid feminine feeling , even amidst the truest joy ? Or was it that a new wine had been given into Faith 's life , which would not be held in the old bottles ? Was she uncertain -- inconstant ; or had she spiritually outgrown her old attachment ? Or , was she bewildered , now , out of the discernment of what was still her heart 's desire and need ? Paul was kind , and true , and manly . She recognized all this in him as surely as ever . If he had turned from , and forgotten her , she would have felt a pang . What was this , then , that she felt , as he came near , and nearer ? And then , her father ! Had he really begun to count on this ? Do men know how their young daughters feel when the first suggestion comes that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's house ? Would she even encumber his plans , if she clung still to her maidenly life ? By all these subtleties does the destiny of woman close in upon her . Margaret Rushleigh 's letter was full of delight , and eagerness , and anticipation . She and Paul had been so charmed with Kinnicutt and Lakeside ; and there had happened to be a furnished house to let for the season close by the Morrises , and they had persuaded papa to take it . They were tired of the seashore , and Conway was getting crowded to death . They wanted a real summer in the country . And then this had turned up about the mills ! Perhaps , now , her father would build , and they should come up every year . Perhaps Paul would stay altogether , and superintend . Perhaps -- anything ! It was all a delightful chaos of possibilities ; with this thing certain , that she and Faith would be together for the next four months in the glorious summer shine and bloom . Miss Gartney 's wedding was simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square . Mr. Armstrong pronounced the solemn words , in the shaded summer parlor , with the door open into the sweeter and stiller shade without . Faith stood by her sister 's side , in fair , white robes , and Mr. Robert Selmore was groomsman to his brother . A few especial friends from Mishaumok and Lakeside were present to witness the ceremony . And then there was a kissing -- a hand-shaking -- a well-wishing -- a going out to the simple but elegantly arranged collation -- a disappearance of the bride to put on traveling array -- a carriage at the door -- smiles , tears , and good-bys -- Mr. , and Mrs. , and Mr. Robert Selmore were off to meet the Western train -- and all was over . Mrs. Etherege remained a few days longer at Cross Corners . As Mis ' Battis judiciously remarked , " after a weddin ' or a funeral , there ought to be somebody to stay a while and cheer up the mourners . " This visit , that had been so full of happenings , was to have a strange occurrence still to mark it , before all fell again into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On Wednesday , the three ladies sat together in the cool , open parlor , where Mr. Armstrong , walking over from the Old House , had joined them . He had the July number of the Mishaumok in his hand , and a finger between the fresh-cut leaves at a poem he would read them . Just as he had finished the last stanza , amidst a hush of the room that paid tribute to the beauty of the lines and his perfect rendering of them , wheels came round from the high road into the lane . " It is Mr. Gartney come back from Sedgely , " said Aunt Etherege , looking from her window , between the blinds . " Whom on earth has he picked up to bring with him ? " A thin , angular figure of a woman , destitute of crinoline , wearing big boots , and a bonnet that ignored the fashion , and carrying in her hand a black enameled leather bag , was alighting as she spoke , at the gate . " Mother ! " said Faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looks like -- it is -- Nurse Sampson ! " And she put her work hastily from her lap , and rose to go out at the side door , to meet and welcome her . To do this , she had to pass by Mr. Armstrong . How came that rigid look , that deadly paleness , to his face ? What spasm of pain made him clutch the pamphlet he held with fingers that grew white about the nails ? Faith stopped , startled . " Mr. Armstrong ! Are you not well ? " said she . At the same instant of her pausing , Miss Sampson entered from the hall , behind her . Mr. Armstrong 's eye , lifted toward Faith in an attempt to reply , caught a glimpse of the sharp , pronounced outlines of the nurse 's face . Before Faith could comprehend , or turn , or cry out , the paleness blanched ghastlier over his features , and the strong man fell back , fainting . With quick , professional instinct , Miss Sampson sprang forward , seizing , as she did so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take this ! " said she to Faith , " and sprinkle him with it , while I loosen his neckcloth ! Gracious goodness ! " she exclaimed , in an altered tone , as she came nearer to him for this purpose , " do it , some of the rest of you , and let me get out of his way ! It was me ! " And she vanished out of the room . CHAPTER XXII . ROGER ARMSTRONG 'S STORY . " Even by means of our sorrows , we belong to the Eternal Plan . " HUMBOLDT . " Go in there , " said Nurse Sampson to Mr. Gartney , calling him in from the porch , " and lay that man flat on the floor ! " Which Mr. Gartney did , wondering , vaguely , in the instant required for his transit to the apartment , whether bandit or lunatic might await his offices . All happened in a moment ; and in that moment , the minister 's fugitive senses began to return . " Lie quiet , a minute . Faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brandy . " Faith quickly brought both ; and Mr. Armstrong , whom her father now assisted to the armchair again , took the wine from her hand , with a smile that thanked her , and depreciated himself . " I am not ill , " he said . " It is all over now . It was the sudden shock . I did not think I could have been so weak . " Mrs. Gartney had gone to find some hartshorn . Mrs. Etherege , seeing that the need for it was passing , went out to tell her sister so , and to ask the strange woman who had originated all the commotion , what it could possibly mean . Mr. Gartney , at the same instant , caught a glimpse of his horse , which he had left unfastened at the gate , giving indications of restlessness , and hastened out to tie him . Faith and Mr. Armstrong were left alone . " Did I frighten you , my child ? " he asked , gently . " It was a strange thing to happen ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought she died , when -- I will tell you all about it some day , soon , Miss Faith . It was the sad , terrible page of my life . " Faith 's eyes were lustrous with sympathy . Under all other thought was a beating joy -- not looked at yet -- that he could speak to her so ! That he could snatch this chance moment to tell her , only , of his sacred sorrow ! She moved a half step nearer , and laid her hand , softly , on the chair arm beside him . She did not touch so much as a fold of his sleeve ; but it seemed , somehow , like a pitying caress . " I am sorry ! " said she . And then the others came in . Mr. Gartney walked round with his friend to the old house . Miss Sampson began to recount what she knew of the story . Faith escaped to her own room at the first sentence . She would rather have it as Mr. Armstrong 's confidence . Next morning , Faith was dusting , and arranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " hillside door , " as they called it , open , when Mr. Armstrong passed the window and appeared thereat . " I came to ask , Miss Faith , if you would walk up over the Ridge . It is a lovely morning , and I am selfish enough to wish to have you to myself for a little of it . By and by , I would like to come back , and see Miss Sampson . " Faith understood . He meant to tell her this that had been heavy upon his heart through all these years . She would go . Directly , when she had brought her hat , and spoken with her mother . Mrs. Etherege and Mrs. Gartney were sitting together in the guest chamber , above . At noon , after an early dinner , Mrs. Etherege was to leave . Mr. Armstrong stood upon the doorstone below , looking outward , waiting . If he had been inside the room , he would not have heard . The ladies , sitting by the window , just over his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He caught Faith 's clear , sweet accent first , as she announced her purpose to her mother , adding : " I shall be back , auntie , long before dinner . " Then she crossed the hall into her own room , made her slight preparation for the walk , and went down by the kitchen staircase , to give Parthenia some last word about the early dinner . " I think , " said Mrs. Etherege , in the keenness of her worldly wisdom , " that this minister of yours might as well have a hint of how matters stand . It seems to me he is growing to monopolize Faith , rather . " " Oh , " replied Mrs. Gartney , " there is nothing of that ! You know what nurse told us , last evening . It is n't quite likely that a man would faint away at the memory of one woman , if his thoughts were turned , the least , in that way , upon another . No , indeed ! She is his Sunday scholar , and he treats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is all . " " Maybe . But is it quite safe for her ? He is a young man yet , notwithstanding those few gray hairs . " " Oh , Faith has tacitly belonged to Paul Rushleigh these three years ! " Mr. Armstrong heard it all . He turned the next moment , and met his " dear young friend " with the same gentle smile and manner that he always wore toward her , and they walked up the Ridge path , among the trees , together . A bowlder of rock , scooped into smooth hollows that made pleasant seats , was the goal , usually , of the Ridge walk . Here Faith paused , and Mr. Armstrong made her sit down and rest . Standing there before her , he began his story . " One summer -- years ago , " he said , " I went to the city of New Orleans . I went to bring thence , with me , a dear friend -- her who was to have been my wife . " The deep voice trembled , and paused . Faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the tears were all but ready . " She had been there , through the winter and spring , with her father , who , save myself , was the only near friend she had in all the world . " The business which took him there detained him until later in the season than Northerners are accustomed to feel safe in staying . And still , important affairs hindered his departure . " He wrote to me , that , for himself , he must risk a residence there for some weeks yet ; but that his daughter must be placed in safety . There was every indication of a sickly summer . She knew nothing of his writing , and he feared would hardly consent to leave him . But , if I came , she would yield to me . Our marriage might take place there , and I could bring her home . Without her , he said , he could more quickly dispatch what remained for him to do ; and I must persuade her of this , and that it was for the safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to have been at this time redeemed , had their earlier return been possible . " In the New Orleans papers that came by the same mail , were paragraphs of deadly significance . The very cautiousness with which they were worded weighted them the more . " Miss Faith ! my friend ! in that city of pestilence , was my life ! Night and day I journeyed , till I reached the place . I found the address which had been sent me -- there were only strangers there ! Mr. Waldo had been , but the very day before , seized with the fatal disease , and removed to a fever hospital . Miriam had gone with him -- into plague and death ! " Was I wrong , child ? Could I have helped it ? I followed . Ah ! God lets strange woes into this world of His ! I can not tell you , if I would , what I saw there ! **29;3400;TOOLONG ! " In the midst of all , among the gentle sisters of charity , I found a New England woman -- a nurse -- her whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry for Mr. Waldo . He was dead . Miriam had already sickened -- was past hope . I could not see her . It was against the rule . She would not know me . " I only remember that I refused to be sent away . I think my brain reeled with the weariness of sleepless nights and horror of the shock . " I can not dwell upon the story . It was ended quickly . When I struggled back , painfully , to life , from the disease that struck me down , there were strange faces round me , and none could even tell me of her last hours . The nurse -- Miss Sampson -- had been smitten -- was dying . " They sent me to a hospital for convalescents . Weeks after , I came out , feeble and hopeless , into my lonely life ! " Since then , God , who had taken from me the object I had set for myself , has filled its room with His own work . And , doing it , He has not denied me to find many a chastened joy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tender , lingering emphasis -- it was all he could say then -- all they had left him to say , if he would --  " I have told you this , because you have come nearer into my sympathies than any in all these years that have been my years of strangerhood and sorrow ! You have made me think , in your fresh , maidenly life , and your soul earnestness , of Miriam ! " When your way broadens out into busy sunshine , and mine lies otherwise , do not forget me ! " A solemn baptism of mingled grief and joy seemed to touch the soul of Faith . One hand covered her face , that was bowed down , weeping . The other lay in her companion 's , who had taken it as he uttered these last words . So it rested a moment , and then its fellow came to it , and , between the two , held Roger Armstrong 's reverently , while the fair , tearful face lifted itself to his . " I do thank you so ! " And that was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How the words in which her mother limited his thoughts of her to commonplace , widened , when she spoke them to herself , into a great beatitude ! She never thought of more -- scarcely whether more could be . This great , noble , purified , God-loving soul that stood between her and heaven , like the mountain peak , bathing its head in clouds , and drawing lightnings down , leaned over her , and blessed her thus ! She never suspected her own heart , even when the remembrance of Paul came up and took a tenderness from the thought how he , too , might love , and learn from , this her friend . She turned back with a new gentleness to all other love , as one does from a prayer ! CHAPTER XXIII . QUESTION AND ANSWER . " Unless you can swear , ' For life , for death ! ' Oh , fear to call it loving ! " MRS . BROWNING . Faith sent Nurse Sampson in to talk with Mr. Armstrong . Then he learned all that he had longed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which took him to his lost bride 's deathbed , and awoke out of the silent years for him a moment refused to him in its passing . Miss Sampson came from her hour 's interview , with an unbending of the hard lines of her face , and a softness , even , in her eyes , that told of tears . " If ever there was an angel that went walking about in black broadcloth , that man is the one , " said she . And that was all she would say . " I 'm staying , " she explained , in answer to their inquiries , " with a half-sister of mine at Sedgely . Mrs. Crabe , the blacksmith 's wife . You see , I 'd got run down , and had to take a rest . Resting is as much a part of work as doing , when it 's necessary . I had a chance to go to Europe with an invaleed lady ; but I allers hate such halfway contrivances . I either want to work with all my might , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've come here to do nothing , as hard as ever I can . " " I know well enough , " she said again , afterwards , " that something 's being cut out for me , tougher'n anything I 've had yet . I never had an hour 's extra rest in my life , but I found out , precious soon , what it had been sent for . I 'm going to stay on all summer , as the doctor told me to ; but I 'm getting strong , already ; and I shall be just like a tiger before the year 's out . And then it 'll come , whatever it is . You 'll see . " Miss Sampson stayed until the next day after , and then Mr. Gartney drove her back to Sedgely . In those days it came to pass that Glory found she had a " follower . " Luther Goodell , who " did round " at Cross Corners , got so into the way of straying up the field path , in his nooning hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henderson at last , in her plain , outright fashion , took the subject up , and questioned Glory . " If it means anything , and you mean it shall mean anything , well and good . I shall put up with it ; though what anybody wants with men folks cluttering round , is more than I can understand . But , if you do n't want him , he sha n't come . So tell me the truth , child . Yes , or no . Have you any notion of him for a husband ? " Glory blushed her brightest at these words ; but there was no falling of the eye , or faltering of the voice , as she spoke with answering straightforwardness and simplicity . " No ma'am . I do n't think I shall ever have a husband . " " No ma'am 's enough . The rest you do n't know anything about . Most likely you will . " " I should n't want anybody , ma'am , that would be likely to want me . " And Glory walked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scalding . It was true . This woman-child would go all through life as she had begun ; discerning always , and reaching spiritually after , that which was beyond ; which in that " kingdom of heaven " was hers already ; but which to earthly having and holding should never come . God puts such souls , oftener than we think , into such life . These are His vestals . Miss Henderson 's foot had not grown perfectly strong . She , herself , said , coolly , that she never expected it to . More than that , she supposed , now she had begun , she should keep on going to pieces . " An old life , " she said , " is just like old cloth when it begins to tear . It 'll soon go into the ragbag , and then to the mill that grinds all up , and brings us out new and white again ! " " Glory McWhirk , " said she , on another day after , " if you could do just the thing you would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To-day , ma'am ? or any time ? " asked Glory , puzzled as to how much her mistress 's question included . " Ever . If you had a home to live in , say , and money to spend ? " Glory had to wait a moment before she could so grasp such an extraordinary hypothesis as to reply . " Well ? " said Miss Henderson , with slight impatience . " If I had -- I should like best to find some little children , without any fathers or mothers , as I was , and dress them up , as you did me , and curl their hair , and make a real good time for them , every day ! " " You would ! Well , that 's all . I was curious to know what you 'd say . I guess those beans in the oven want more hot water . " The Rushleighs had come to Lakeside . Every day , nearly , saw Paul , or Margaret , or both , at Cross Corners . Faith was often , also , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatherliness , and looked upon her with an evident fondness and pride that threw heavy weight in the scale of his son 's chances . And Madam Rushleigh , as she began to be called , since Mrs. Philip had entered the family , petted her in the old , graceful , gracious fashion ; and Margaret loved her , simply , and from her heart . With Paul himself , it had not been as in the days of bouquets , and " Germans , " and bridal association in Mishaumok . They were all living and enjoying together a beautiful idyl . Nothing seemed special -- nothing was embarrassing . Faith thought , in these days , that she was very happy . Mr. Armstrong relinquished her , almost imperceptibly , to her younger friends . In the pleasant twilights , though , when her day 's pleasures and occupations were ended , he would often come over , as of old , and sit with them in the summer parlor , or under the elms . Or Faith would go up the beautiful Ridge walk with him ; and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any she could reach , by herself , or with the help of any other human soul . And the minister ? How did his world look to him ? Perhaps , as if clouds that had parted , sending a sunbeam across from the west upon the dark sorrow of the morning , had shut again , inexorably , leaving him still to tread the nightward path under the old , leaden sky . A day came , that set him thinking of all this -- of the years that were past , of those that might be to come . Mr. Armstrong was not quite so old as he had been represented . A man can not go through plague and anguish , as he had , and " keep , " as Nurse Sampson had said , long ago , of women , " the baby face on . " There were lines about brow and mouth , and gleams in the hair , that seldom come so early . This day he completed one-and-thirty years . The same day , last month , had been Faith 's birthday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . He thought of these twelve years that lay between them . Of the love -- the loss -- the stern and bitter struggle -- the divine amends and holy hope that they had brought to him ; and then of the innocent girl life she had been living in them ; then , how the two paths had met so , in these last few , beautiful months . Whither , and how far apart , trended they now ? He could not see . He waited -- leaving the end with God . A few weeks went by , in this careless , holiday fashion , with Faith and her friends ; and then came the hour when she must face the truth for herself and for another , and speak the word of destiny for both . She had made a promise for a drive round the Pond Road . Margaret and her brother were to come for her , and to return to Cross Corners for tea . At the hour fixed , she sat , waiting , under the elms , hat and mantle on , and whiling the moments of delay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Rushleighs ' light , open , single-seated wagon drove up . Paul had come alone . Margaret had a headache , but thought that after sundown she might feel better , and begged that Faith would reverse the plan agreed upon , and let Paul bring her home to tea with them . Paul took for granted that Faith would keep to her engagement with himself . It was difficult to refuse . She was ready , waiting . It would be absurd to draw back , sensitively , now , she thought . Besides , it would be very pleasant ; and why should she be afraid ? Yet she wished , very regretfully , that Margaret were there . She shrank from tete-a-tetes -- from anything that might help to precipitate a moment she felt herself not quite ready for . She supposed she did care for Paul Rushleigh as most girls cared for lovers ; that she had given him reason to expect she should ; she felt , instinctively , whither all this pleased acquiescence of father and mother , and this warm welcome and encouragement at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what must , some time , come of it : but that was all in the far-off by and by . She would not look at it yet . She was afraid , now , as she let Paul help her into the wagon , and take his place at her side . She had been frightened by a word of her mother 's , when she had gone to her , before leaving , to tell how the plan had been altered , and ask if she had better do as was wished of her . Mrs. Gartney had assented with a smile , and a " Certainly , if you like it , Faith ; indeed , I do n't see how you can very well help it ; only --  --  " " Only what , mother ? " asked Faith , a little fearfully . " Nothing , dear , " answered her mother , turning to her with a little caress . But she had a look in her eyes that mothers wear when they begin to see their last woman 's sacrifice demand itself at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was like giving her away . So they drove down , through byways , among the lanes , toward the Wachaug Road . Summer was in her perfect flush and fullness of splendor . The smell of new-mown hay was in the air . As they came upon the river , they saw the workmen busy in and about the new mills . Mr. Rushleigh 's buggy stood by the fence ; and he was there , among his mechanics , with his straw hat and seersucker coat on , inspecting and giving orders . " What a capital old fellow the governor is ! " said Paul , in the fashion young men use , nowadays , to utter their affections . " Do you know he means to set me up in these mills he is making such a hobby of , and give me half the profits ? " Faith had not known . She thought him very good . " Yes ; he would do anything , I believe , for me -- or anybody I cared for . " Faith was silent ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like Kinnicutt , thoroughly . " " Yes , " said Faith . " It is very beautiful here . " " Not only that . I like the people . I like their simple fashions . One gets at human life and human nature here . I do n't think I was ever , at heart , a city boy . I do n't like living at arm 's length from everybody . People come close together , in the country . And -- Faith ! what a minister you 've got here ! What a sermon that was he preached last Sunday ! I 've never been what you might call one of the serious sort ; but such a sermon as that must do anybody good . " Faith felt a warmth toward Paul as he said this , which was more a drawing of the heart than he had gained from her by all the rest . " My father says he will keep him here , if money can do it . He never goes to church at Lakeside , now . It needs just such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father thinks a great deal of his workpeople . He says nobody ought to bring families together , and build up a neighborhood , as a manufacturer does , and not look out for more than the money . I think he 'll expect a great deal of me , if he leaves me here , at the head of it all . More than I can ever do , by myself . " " Mr. Armstrong will be the very best help to you , " said Faith . " I think he means to stay . I 'm sure Kinnicutt would seem nothing without him , now . " " Faith ! Will you help me to make a home here ? " She could not speak . A great shock had fallen upon her whole nature , as if a thunderbolt she had had presentiment of , burst from a clear blue sky . They drove on for minutes , without another word . " Faith ! You do n't answer me . Must I take silence as I please ? It ca n't be that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ! " cried Faith , desperately , like one struggling for voice through a nightmare . " I do care . But -- Paul ! I do n't know ! I ca n't tell . Let me wait , please . Let me think . " " As long as you like , darling , " said he , gently and tenderly . " You know all I can tell you . You know I have cared for you all my life . And I 'll wait now till you tell me I may speak again . Till you put on that little ring of mine , Faith ! " There was a little loving reproach in these last words . " Please take me home , now , Paul ! " They were close upon the return path around the Lake . A look of disappointed pain passed over Paul Rushleigh 's features . This was hardly the happy reception , however shy , he had hoped and looked for . Still he hoped , however . He could not think she did not care for him . She , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years . But , obedient to her wish , he touched his horse with the lash , and urged him homeward . Paul helped her from the wagon at the little white gate at Cross Corners , and then they both remembered that she was to have gone to Lakeside to tea . " What shall I tell Margaret ? " he asked . " Oh , do n't tell her anything ! I mean -- tell her , I could n't come to-night . And , Paul -- forgive me ! I do want so to do what is right ! " " Is n't it right to let me try and make you happy all your life ? " A light had broken upon her -- confusedly , it is true -- yet that began to show her to herself more plainly than any glimpse she had had before , as Paul 's words , simple , yet burning with his strong sure love , came to her , with their claim to honest answer . She saw what it was he brought her ; she felt it was less she had to give him back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing all the way through life , if she took this lot that lay before her now . Would he not miss a something in her , also ? Yet , must she needs insist on the greatest , the rarest , that God ever sends ? Why should she , more than others ? Would she wrong him more , to give him what she could , or to refuse him all ? " I ought -- if I do --  " she said , tremulously , " to care as you do ! " " You never can , Faith ! " cried the young man , impetuously . " I care as a man cares ! Let me love you ! care a little for me , and let it grow to more ! " Men , till something is accorded , are willing to take so little ! And then the little must become so entire ! " Well , I declare ! " exclaimed Mis ' Battis , as Faith came in . " Who 'd a thought o ' seein ' you home to tea ! I s'pose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is , I do n't want any . Where is my mother ? " " She and your pa 's gone down to Dr. Wasgatt 's . I knew ' t would be contrary to the thirty-nine articles that they should get away from there without their suppers , and so I let the fire right down , and blacked the stove . " " Never mind , " said Faith , abstractedly . " I do n't feel hungry . " And she went away , upstairs . " ' M ! " said Mis ' Battis , significantly , to herself , running a released knitting needle through her hair , " do n't tell me ! I 've been through the mill ! " Half an hour after , she came up to Faith 's door . " The minister 's downstairs , " said she . " Hope to goodness , he 's had his supper ! " " Oh , if I dared ! " thought Faith ; and her heart throbbed tumultuously . " Why ca n't there be somebody to tell me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how she could have leaned upon this friend ! How she could have trusted her conscience and her fate to his decision ! " Does anything trouble you to-night , Miss Faith ? " asked Mr. Armstrong , watching her sad , abstracted look in one of the silent pauses that broke their attempts at conversation . " Are you ill , or tired ? " " Oh , no ! " answered Faith , quickly , from the surface , as one often does when thoughts lie deep . " I am quite well . Only -- I am sometimes puzzled . " " About what is ? Or about what ought to be ? " " About doing . So much depends . I get so tired -- feeling how responsible everything makes me . I wish I were a little child again ! Or that somebody would just take me and tell me where to go , and where to stay , and what to do , and what not . From minute to minute , as the things come up . " Roger Armstrong , with his great , chastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so gladly he would have taken her , at that moment , to his heart , and bid her lean on him for all that man might give of help -- of love -- of leading ! If she had told him , in that moment , all her doubt , as for the instant of his pause she caught her breath with swelling impulse to do ! " ' And they shall all be led of God ' ; " said the minister . " It is only to be willing to take His way rather than one 's own . All this that seems to depend painfully upon oneself , depends , then , upon Him . The act is human -- the consequences become divine . " Faith was silenced then . There was no appeal to human help from that . Her impulse throbbed itself away into a lonely passiveness again . There was a distance between these two that neither dared to pass . A word was spoken between mother and daughter as they parted for the night . " Mother ! I have such a thing to think of -- to decide ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her mother 's neck , as the good-night kiss was taken . " Decide for your own happiness , Faithie . We have seen and understood for a long time . If it is to be as we think , nothing could give us a greater joy for you . " Ah ! how much had father and mother seen and understood ? The daughter went her way , to wage her own battle in secret ; to balance and fix her decision between her own heart and God . So we find ourselves left , at the last , in all the great crises of our life . Late that night , while Mr. and Mrs. Gartney were felicitating each other , cheerily , upon the great good that had fallen to the lot of their cherished child , that child sat by her open window , looking out into the summer night ; the tossing elm boughs whispering weird syllables in her ears , and the stars looking down upon her soul struggle , so silently , from so far ! " Mr. Rushleigh 's here ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breakfast room , where , at a rather later hour than usual , Mrs. Gartney and Faith were washing and wiping the silver and china , and Mr. Gartney still lingered in his seat , finishing somebody 's long speech , reported in the evening paper of yesterday . " Mr. Rushleigh 's here , on his long-tailed black horse ! And he says he 'll give me a ride , but not yet . He wants to see papa . Make haste , papa . " Faith dropped her towel , and as Mr. Gartney rose to go out and meet his visitor , just whispered , hurriedly , to her mother : " I 'll come down again . I 'll see him before he goes . " And escaped up the kitchen staircase to her own room . Paul Rushleigh came , he told Mr. Gartney , because , although Faith had not authorized him to appeal to her father to ratify any consent of hers , he thought it right to let him know what he had already said to his daughter . He did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly with Mr. Gartney in the matter , and would wait , then , till she should be quite ready to give him her own answer . He explained the prospect his father offered him , and the likelihood of his making a permanent home at Kinnicutt . " That is , " he added , " if I am to be so happy as to have a home , anywhere , of my own . " Mr. Gartney was delighted with the young man 's unaffected warmth of heart and noble candor . " I could not wish better for my daughter , Mr. Rushleigh , " he replied . " And she is a daughter whom I may fairly wish the best for , too . " Mr. Gartney rose . " I will send Faith , " said he . " I do not ask for her , " answered Paul , a flush of feeling showing in his cheek . " I did not come , expecting it -- my errand was one I owed to yourself -- but Faith knows quite well how glad I shall be if she chooses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall from parlor to sitting room , a light step came over the front staircase . Faith passed her father , with a downcast look , as he motioned with his hand toward the room where Paul stood , waiting . The bright color spread to her temples as she glided in . She held , but did not wear , the little turquoise ring . Paul saw it , as he came forward , eagerly . A thrill of hope , or dread -- he scarce knew which -- quivered suddenly at his heart . Was he to take it back , or place it on her finger as a pledge ? " I have been thinking , Paul , " said she , tremulously , and with eyes that fell again away from his , after the first glance and greeting , " almost ever since . And I do not think I ought to keep you waiting to know the little I can tell you . I do not think I understand myself . I can not tell , certainly , how I ought -- how I do feel . I have liked you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before all this . I know you deserve to be made very happy . And if it depends on me , I do not dare to say I will not try to do it . If you think , yourself , that this is enough -- that I shall do the truest thing so -- I will try . " And the timid little fingers laid the ring into his hand , to do with as he would . What else could Paul have done ? With the strong arm that should henceforth uphold and guard her , he drew her close ; and with the other hand slipped the simply jeweled round upon her finger . For all word of answer , he lifted it , so encircled , to his lips . Faith shrank and trembled . Hendie 's voice sounded , jubilant , along the upper floor , toward the staircase . " I will go , now , if you wish . Perhaps I ought , " said Paul . " And yet , I would so gladly stay . May I come again , by and by ? " Faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came nearer down the stairs , and passed the door , straight out upon the grassplot , toward the gate , and the long-tailed black horse that stood there , she escaped again to her own chamber . Hendie had his ride . Meanwhile , his sister , down upon her knees at her bedside , struggled with the mystery and doubt of her own heart . Why could she not feel happier ? Would it never be otherwise ? Was this all life had for her , in its holiest gift , henceforth ? But , come what might , she would have God , always ! So , without words , only with tears , she prayed , and at last , grew calm . CHAPTER XXIV . CONFLICT . " O Life , O Beyond , Art thou fair !  - -  art thou sweet ? " MRS . BROWNING . There followed days that almost won Faith back into her outward life of pleasantness . Margaret came over with Madam Rushleigh , and felicitated herself and friend , impetuously . Paul 's mother thanked her for making her son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessing . And Mr. and Mrs. Gartney looked upon their daughter as with new eyes of love . Hendie rode the black horse every day , and declared that " everything was just as jolly as it could be ! " Paul drove her out , and walked with her , and talked of his plans , and all they would do and have together . And she let herself be brightened by all this outward cheer and promise , and this looking forward to a happiness and use that were to come . But still she shrank and trembled at every loverlike caress , and still she said , fearfully , every now and then : " Paul -- I do n't feel as you do . What if I do n't love you as I ought ? " And Paul called her his little oversensitive , conscientious Faithie , and persuaded himself and her that he had no fear -- that he was quite satisfied . When Mr. Armstrong came to see her , gravely and tenderly wishing her joy , and looked searchingly into her face for the pure content that should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wept . She was very weak , you say ? She ought to have known her own mind better ? Perhaps . I speak of her as she was . There are mistakes like these in life ; there are hearts that suffer thus , unconscious of their ail . The minister waited while the momentary burst of emotion subsided , and something of Faith 's wonted manner returned . " It is very foolish of me , " she said , " and you must think me very strange . But , somehow , tears come easily when one has been feeling a great deal . And such kind words from you touch me . " " My words and thoughts will always be kind for you , my child . And I know very well that tears may mean sweeter and deeper things than smiles . I will not try you with much talking now . You have my affectionate wishes and my prayers . If there is ever any help that I can give , to you who have so much loving help about you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The hour was past when Faith , if she could ever , could have asked of him the help she did most sorely need . And so , with a gentle hand clasp , he went away . Mr. Gartney began to be restless about Michigan . He wanted to go and see this wild estate of his . He would have liked to take his wife , now that haying would soon be over , and he could spare the time from his farm , and make it a pleasant summer journey for them both . But he could neither leave Faith , nor take her , well , it seemed . Hendie might go . Fathers always think their boys ready for the world when once they are fairly out of the nursery . One day , Paul came to Cross Corners with news . Mr. Rushleigh had affairs to be arranged and looked to , in New York -- matters connected with the mills , which had , within a few weeks , begun to run ; he had been there , once , about them ; he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an authorized messenger ; he could not just now very well leave Kinnicutt . Besides , he wanted Paul to see and know his business friends , and to put himself in the way of valuable business information . Would Faith spare him for a week or two -- he bade his son to ask . Madam Rushleigh would accompany Paul ; and before his return he would go with his mother to Saratoga , where her daughter Gertrude and Mrs. Philip Rushleigh were , and where he was to leave her for the remainder of their stay . Margaret liked Kinnicutt better than any watering-place ; and she and her father had made a little plan of their own , which , if Faith would go back with him , they would explain to her . So Faith went over to Lakeside to tea , and heard the plan . " We are going to make our first claim upon you , Faith , " said the elder Mr. Rushleigh , as he led his daughter-in-law elect out on the broad piazza under the Italian awnings , when the slight summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , while madam and the yonker are gone . Your father tells me he wishes to make a Western journey . Now , why not send him off at this very time ? I think your mother intends accompanying him ? " " It had been talked of , " Faith said ; " and perhaps her father would be very glad to go when he could leave her in such good keeping . She would tell him what Mr. Rushleigh had been so kind as to propose . " It was a suggestion of real rest to Faith -- this free companionship with Margaret again , in the old , girlish fashion -- and the very thoughtful look , that was almost sad , which had become habitual to her face , of late , brightened into the old , careless pleasure , as she spoke . Old Mr. Rushleigh saw something in this that began to seem to him more than mere maidenly shyness . By and by , Margaret called her brother to sing with her . " Come , Faithie , " said Paul , drawing her gently by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . " Faith went ; more , it seemed , of his will , than her own . " How does that appear to you ? " said Mr. Rushleigh to his wife . " Is it all right ? Does the child care for Paul ? " " Care ! " exclaimed the mother , almost surprised into too audible speech . " How can she help caring ? And has n't it grown up from childhood with them ? What put such a question into your head ? I should as soon think of doubting whether I cared for you . " It was easier for the father to doubt , jealously , for his son , than for the mother to conceive the possibility of indifference in the woman her boy had chosen . " Besides , " added Mrs. Rushleigh , " why , else , should she have accepted him ? I know Faith Gartney is not mercenary , or worldly ambitious . " " I am quite sure of that , as well , " answered her husband . " It is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is really a doubt of anything ; but , Gertrude , she must not marry the boy unless her whole heart is in it ! A sharp stroke is better than a lifelong pain . " " I 'm sure I ca n't tell what has come over you ! She ca n't ever have thought of anybody else ! And she seems quite one of ourselves . " " Yes ; that 's just the uncertainty , " replied Mr. Rushleigh . " Whether it is n't as much Margaret , and you and I , as Paul . Whether she fully knows what she is about . She ca n't marry the family , you know . We shall die , and go off , and Heaven knows what ; Paul must be the whole world to her , or nothing . I hope he has n't hurried her -- or let her hurry herself . " " Hurry ! She has had years to make up her mind in ! " Mrs. Rushleigh , woman as she was , would not understand . " We shall go , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the moonlight with Faith at the little white gate under the elms , after driving her home ; " and I must have you all the time to myself , until then ! " Faith wondered if it were right that she should n't quite care to be " had all the time to himself until then " ? Whether such demonstrativeness and exclusiveness of affection was ever a little irksome to others as to her ? Faith thought and questioned , often , what other girls might feel in positions like her own , and tried to judge herself by them ; it absolutely never occurred to her to think how it might have been if another than Paul had stood in this relation toward herself . The young man did not quite have his own way , however . His father went down to Mishaumok on one of the three days , and left him in charge at the mills ; and there were people to see , and arrangements to make ; but some part of each day he did manage to devote to Faith , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul stayed to tea at Cross Corners . On the last evening , they sat together , by the hillside door , in the summer parlor . " Faithie , " said Paul , a little suddenly , " there is something you must do for me -- do you know ? " " What is it ? " asked Faith , quite calmly . " You must wear this , now , and keep the forget-me-not for a guard . " He held her hand , that wore the ring , in one of his , and there was a flash of diamonds as he brought the other toward it . Then Faith gave a quick , strange cry . " I ca n't ! I ca n't ! Oh , Paul ! do n't ask me ! " And her hand was drawn from the clasp of his , and her face was hidden in both her own . Paul drew back -- hurt , silent . " If I could only wait ! " she murmured . " I do n't dare , yet ! " She could wear the forget-me-not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship , it belonged to the past ; but this definite pledge for the future -- these diamonds ! " Do you not quite belong to me , even yet ? " asked Paul , with a resentment , yet a loving and patient one , in his voice . " I told you , " said Faith , " that I would try -- to be to you as you wish ; but Paul ! if I could n't be so , truly ?  - -  I do n't know why I feel so uncertain . Perhaps it is because you care for me too much . Your thought for me is so great , that mine , when I look at it , never seems worthy . " Paul was a man . He could not sue , too cringingly , even for Faith Gartney 's love . " And I told you , Faith , that I was satisfied to be allowed to love you . That you should love me a little , and let it grow to more . But if it is not love at all -- if I frighten you , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must let you go . And yet -- oh , Faith ! " he cried -- the sternness all gone , and only the wild love sweeping through his heart , and driving wild words before it --  " it ca n't be that it is no love , after all ! It would be too cruel ! " At those words , " I must let you go , " spoken apparently with calmness , as if it could be done , Faith felt a bound of freedom in her soul . If he would let her go , and care for her in the old way , only as a friend ! But the strong passionate accents came after ; and the old battle of doubt and pity and remorse surged up again , and the cloud of their strife dimmed all perception , save that she was very , very wretched . She sobbed , silently . " Do n't let us say good-by , so , " said Paul . " Do n't let us quarrel . We will let all wait , as you wish , till I come home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held her , half bound . " And your father , Paul ? And Margaret ? How can I let them receive me as they do -- how can I go to them as I have promised , in all this indecision ? " " They want you , Faith , for your own sake . There is no need for you to disappoint them . It is better to say nothing more until we do know . I ask it of you -- do not refuse me this -- to let all rest just here ; to make no difference until I come back . You will let me write , Faith ? " " Why , yes , Paul , " she said , wonderingly . It was so hard for her to comprehend that it could not be with him , any longer , as it had been ; that his written or his spoken word could not be , for a time , at least , mere friendly any more . And so she gave him , unwittingly , this hope to go with . " I think you do care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said he , half sadly and very wistfully , as they parted . " I do care , very much , " Faith answered , simply and earnestly . " I never can help caring . It is only that I am afraid I care so differently from you ! " She was nearer loving him at that moment , than she had ever been . Who shall attempt to bring into accord the seeming contradictions of a woman 's heart ? CHAPTER XXV . A GAME AT CHESS . " Life 's burdens fall , its discords cease , I lapse into the glad release Of nature 's own exceeding peace . " WHITTIER . " I do n't see , " said Aunt Faith , " why the child ca n't come to me , Henderson , while you and Elizabeth are away . I do n't believe in putting yourself under obligations to people till you 're sure they 're going to be something to you . Things do n't always turn out according to the Almanac . " " She goes just as she always has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Paul is to be away . It is a visit to Margaret . Still , I shall be absent at least a fortnight , and it might be well that she should divide her time , and come to Cross Corners for a few days , if it is only to see the house opened and ready . Luther can have a bed here , if Mis ' Battis should be afraid . " Mis ' Battis was to improve the fortnight 's interval for a visit to Factory Village . " Well , fix it your own way , " said Miss Henderson . " I 'm ready for her , any time . Only , if she 's going to peak and pine as she has done ever since this grand match was settled for her , Glory and I 'll have our hands full , nursing her , by then you get back ! " " Faith is quite well , " said Mrs. Gartney . " It is natural for a girl to be somewhat thoughtful when she decides for herself such an important relation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should say she was taking it pretty hard , " said the old lady . Mr. and Mrs. Gartney left home on Monday . Faith and Mis ' Battis remained in the house a few hours after , setting all things in that dreary " to rights " before leaving , which is almost , in its chillness and silence , like burial array . Glory came over to help ; and when all was done -- blinds shut , windows and doors fastened , fire out , ashes removed -- stove blackened -- Luther drove Mis ' Battis and her box over to Mrs. Pranker 's , and Glory took Faith 's little bag for her to the Old House . This night she was to stay with her aunt . She wanted just this little pause and quiet before going to the Rushleighs ' . " Tell Aunt Faith I 'm coming , " said she , as she let herself and Glory out at the front door , and then , locking it , put the key in her pocket . " I 'll just walk up over the Ridge first , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was the peace of a rested body and soul upon her face when she came down again a half hour after , and crossed the lane , and entered , through the stile , upon the field path to the Old House . Heart and will had been laid asleep -- earthly plan and purpose had been put aside in all their incompleteness and uncertainty -- and only God and Nature had been permitted to come near . Mr. Armstrong walked down and met her midway in the field . " How beautiful mere simpleness and quiet are , " said Faith . " The cool look of trees and grass , and the stillness of this evening time , are better even than flowers , and bright sunlight , and singing of birds ! " " ' He maketh me to lie down in green pastures : He leadeth me beside the still waters : He restoreth my soul : He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name 's sake . ' " They did not disturb the stillness by more words . They came up together , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that offered its broad invitation to their entering feet , and where Aunt Faith at this moment stood , watching and awaiting them . " Go into the blue bedroom , and lay off your things , child , " she said , giving Faith a kiss of welcome , " and then come back and we 'll have our tea . " Faith disappeared through passages and rooms beyond . Aunt Henderson turned quickly to the minister . " You 're her spiritual adviser , ai n't you ? " she asked , abruptly . " I ought to be , " answered Mr. Armstrong . " Why do n't you advise her , then ? " " Spiritually , I do and will , in so far as so pure a spirit can need a help from me . But -- I think I know what you mean , Miss Henderson -- spirit and heart are two . I am a man ; and she is -- what you know . " Miss Henderson 's keen eyes fixed themselves , for a minute , piercingly and unflinchingly , on the minister 's face . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house to see the tea brought in . She knew , now , all there was to tell . Faith 's face interpreted itself to Mr. Armstrong . He saw that she needed , that she would have , rest . Rest , this night , from all that of late had given her weariness and trouble . So , he did not even talk to her in the way they mostly talked together ; he would not rouse , ever so distantly , thought , that might , by so many subtle links , bear round upon her hidden pain . But he brought , after tea , a tiny chessboard , and set the delicate carved men upon it , and asked her if she knew the game . " A little , " she said . " What everybody always owns to knowing -- the moves . " " Suppose we play . " It was a very pleasant novelty -- sitting down with this grave , earnest friend to a game of skill -- and seeing him bring to it all the resource of power and thought that he bent , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Miss Faith ! You do n't mean that ! You put your queen in danger . " " My queen is always a great trouble to me , " said Faith , smiling , as she retracted the half-made move . " I think I do better when I give her up in exchange . " " Excuse me , Miss Faith ; but that always seems to me a cowardly sort of game . It is like giving up a great power in life because one is too weak to claim and hold it . " " Only I make you lose yours , too . " " Yes , there is a double loss and inefficiency . Does that make a better game , or one pleasanter to play ? " " There are two people , in there , talking riddles ; and they do n't even know it , " said Miss Henderson to her handmaid , in the kitchen close by . Perhaps Mr. Armstrong , as he spoke , did discern a possible deeper significance in his own words ; did misgive himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he made rapid , skillful movements on the board , that brought the game into new complications , and taxed all Faith 's attention to avert their dangers to herself . For half an hour , there was no more talking . Then Faith 's queen was put in helpless peril . " I must give her up , " said she . " She is all but gone . " A few moves more , and all Faith 's hope depended on one little pawn , that might be pushed to queen and save her game . " How one does want the queen power at the last ! " said she . " And how much easier it is to lose it , than to get it back ! " " It is like the one great , leading possibility , that life , in some sort , offers each of us , " said Mr. Armstrong . " Once lost -- once missed -- we may struggle on without it -- we may push little chances forward to partial amends ; but the game is changed ; its soul is gone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious checkmate . Glory came in to the cupboard , now , and began putting up the tea things she had brought from washing . Mr. Armstrong had done just what , at first , he had meant not to do . Had he bethought himself better , and did he seize the opening to give vague warning where he might not speak more plainly ? Or , had his habit , as a man of thought , discerning quick meaning in all things , betrayed him into the instant 's forgetfulness ? However it might be , Glory caught glimpse of two strange , pained faces over the little board and its mystic pieces . One , pale -- downcast -- with expression showing a sudden pang ; the other , suffering also , yet tender , self-forgetful , loving -- looking on . " I do n't know whichever is worst , " she said afterwards , without apparent suggestion of word or circumstance , to her mistress ; " to see the beautiful times that there are in the world , and not be in ' em -- or to see people that might be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all out on the front stoop , later . They sat in the cool , summer dusk , and looked out between the arched lattices where the vines climbed up , seeing the stars rise , far away , eastwardly , in the blue ; and Mr. Armstrong , talking with Faith , managed to win her back into the calm he had , for an instant , broken ; and to keep her from pursuing the thought that by and by would surely come back , and which she would surely want all possible gain of strength to grapple with . Faith met his intention bravely , seconding it with her own . These hours , to the last , should still be restful . She would not think , to-night , of those words that had startled her so -- of all they suggested or might mean -- of life 's great possibility lost to him , away back in the sorrowful past , as she also , perhaps was missing it -- relinquishing it -- now . She knew not that his thought had been utterly self-forgetful . She believed that he had told her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreary syllables --  " the game is changed . Its soul is gone ! " CHAPTER XXVI . LAKESIDE . " Look ! are the southern curtains drawn ? Fetch me a fan , and so begone ! . . . . . Rain me sweet odors on the air , And wheel me up my Indian chair ; And spread some book not overwise Flat out before my sleepy eyes . " O. W. HOLMES . The Rushleighs ' breakfast room at Lakeside was very lovely in a summer 's morning . Looking off , northwestwardly , across the head of the Pond , the long windows , opening down to the piazza , let in all the light and joy of the early day , and that indescribable freshness born from the union of woods and water . Faith had come down long before the others , this fair Wednesday morning . Mr. Rushleigh found her , when he entered , sitting by a window -- a book upon her lap , to be sure -- but her eyes away off over the lake , and a look in them that told of thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought home Paul 's first letter . When he gave it to her , at tea time , with a gay and kindly word , the color that deepened vividly upon her face , and the quiet way in which she laid it down beside her plate , were nothing strange , perhaps ; but -- was he wrong ? the eyes that drooped so quickly as the blushes rose , and then lifted themselves again so timidly to him as he next addressed her , were surely brimmed with feeling that was not quite , or wholly glad . And now , this wistful , silent , musing , far-off look ! " Good morning , Faithie ! " " Good morning . " And the glance came back -- the reverie was broken -- Faith 's spirit informed her visible presence again , and bade him true and gentle welcome . " You have n't your morning paper yet ? I 'll bring it . Thomas left it in the library , I think . He came back from the early train , half an hour ago . " " Ca n't you women tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Rushleigh to his daughter , who entered by the other door , as Faith went out into the hall . " What ails Faith , Margaret ? " " Nothing of consequence , I think . She is tired with all that has been going on , lately . And then she 's the shyest little thing ! " " It 's a sort of shyness that do n't look so happy as it might , it seems to me . And what has become of Paul 's diamonds , I wonder ? I went with him to choose some , last week . I thought I should see them next upon her finger . " Margaret opened her eyes widely . Of course , this was the first she had heard of the diamonds . Where could they be , indeed ? Was anything wrong ? They had not surely quarreled ! Faith came in with the paper . Thomas brought up breakfast . And presently , these three , with all their thoughts of and for each other , that reached into the long years to come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were gathered at the table , seemingly with no further anxiety than to know whether one or another would have toast or muffins -- eggs or raspberries . Do we not -- and most strangely and incomprehensively -- live two lives ? " I must write to my mother , to-day , " said Margaret , when her father had driven away to the mills , and they had brought in a few fresh flowers from the terrace for the vases , and had had a little morning music , which Margaret always craved , " as an overture , " she said , " to the day . " " I must write to my mother ; and you , I suppose , will be busy with answering Paul ? " A little consciousness kept her from looking straight in Faith 's face , as she spoke . Had she done so , she might have seen that a paleness came over it , and that the lips trembled . " I do n't know , " was the answer . " Perhaps not , to-day . " " Not to-day ? Wo n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , to be sure ; but I fancied lovers were such uneasy , exacting creatures ! " " Paul is very patient , " said Faith -- not lightly , as Margaret had spoken , but as one self-reproached , almost , for abusing patience --  " and they go to-morrow to Lake George . He wo n't look for a letter until he gets to Saratoga . " She had calculated her time as if it were the minutes of a reprieve . When Paul Rushleigh , with his mother , reached Saratoga , he found two letters there , for him . One kind , simple , but reticent , from Faith -- a mere answer to that which she could answer , of his own . The other was from his father . " There seems , " he wrote to his son , toward the close , " to be a little cloud upon Faith , somehow . Perhaps it is one you would not wish away . It may brighten up and roll off , at your return . You , possibly , understand it better than I. Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , impelled to warn you against letting her deceive herself and you , by giving you less than , for her own happiness and yours , she ought to be able to give . Do not marry the child , Paul , if there can be a doubt of her entire affection for you . You had better go through life alone , than with a wife 's half love . If you have reason to imagine that she feels bound by anything in the past to what the present can not heartily ratify -- release her . I counsel you to this , not more in justice to her , than for the saving of your own peace . She writes you to-day . It may be that the antidote comes with the hurt . I may be quite mistaken . But I hurt you , my son , only to save a sorer pain . Faith is true . If she says she loves you , believe her , and take her , though all the world should doubt . But if she is fearful -- if she hesitates -- be fearful , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Heaven ! " Paul Rushleigh thanked his father , briefly , for his admonition , in reply . He wrote , also , to Faith -- affectionately , but with something , at last , of her own reserve . He should not probably write again . In a week , or less , he would be home . And behind , and beyond all this , that could be put on paper , was the hope of a life -- the sharp doubt of days -- waiting the final word ! In a week , he would be home ! A week ! It might bring much ! Wednesday had come round again . Dinner was nearly ended at Lakeside . Cool jellies , and creams , and fruits , were on the table for dessert . Steaming dishes of meats and vegetables had been gladly sent away , but slightly partaken . The day was sultry . Even now , at five in the afternoon , the heat was hardly mitigated from that of midday . They lingered over their dessert , and spoke , rather languidly , of what might be done after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I must go down to the mills again , before night . If either , or both of you , like a drive , I shall be glad to have you with me . " " Those hot mills ! " exclaimed Margaret . " What an excursion to propose ! " " I could find you a very cool corner , even in those hot mills , " replied her father . " My little sanctum , upstairs , that overlooks the river , and gets its breezes , is the freshest place I have been in , to-day . Will you go , Faith ? " " Oh , yes ! she 'll go ! I see it in her eyes ! " said Margaret . " She is getting to be as much absorbed in all those frantic looms and things -- that set me into a fever just to think of , whizzing and humming all day long in this horrible heat -- as you are ! I believe she expects to help Paul overseer the factory , one of these days , she is so fierce to peer into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means mischief ! You had a funny look in your face , Faithie , the other day , when you stood there by the great rope that hoists the water gate , and Mr. Blasland was explaining it to us ! " " I was thinking , I remember , " said Faith , " what a strange thing it was to have one 's hand on the very motive power of it all . To see those great looms , and wheels , and cylinders , and spindles , we had been looking at , and hear nothing but their deafening roar all about us , and to think that even I , standing there with my hand upon the rope , might hush it all , and stop the mainspring of it in a minute ! " Ah , Faithie ! Did you think , as you said this , how your little hand lay , otherwise , also , on the mainspring and motive of it all ? One of the three , at least , thought of it , as you spoke . " Well -- your heart 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So , do n't mind me . I have n't a bit of a plan for your entertainment , here . I should n't , probably , speak to you , if you stayed . It 's too hot for anything but a book , and a fan , and a sofa by an open window ! " Faith laughed ; but , before she could reply , a chaise rolled up to the open front door , and the step and voice of Dr. Wasgatt were heard , as he inquired for Miss Gartney . Faith left her seat , with a word of excuse , and met him in the hall . " I had a patient up this way , " said he , " and came round to bring you a message from Miss Henderson . Nothing to be frightened at , in the least ; only that she is n't quite so well as ordinary , these last hot days , and thought perhaps you might as lief come over . She said she was expecting you for a visit there , before your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faith motioned to conduct him to the drawing-room --  " ca n't come in . Sorry I could n't offer to take you down ; but I 've got more visits to make , and they lie round the other way . " " Is Aunt Faith ill ? " " Well -- no . Not so but that she 'll be spry again in a day or two ; especially if the weather changes . That ankle of hers is troublesome , and she had something of an ill turn last night , and called me over this morning . She seems to have taken a sort of fancy that she 'd like to have you there . " " I 'll come . " And Faith went back , quickly , as Dr. Wasgatt departed , to make his errand known , and to ask if Mr. Rushleigh would mind driving her round to Cross Corners , after going to his mills . " Wait till to-morrow , Faithie , " said Margaret , in the tone of one whom it fatigues to think of an exertion , even for another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ; and there is n't time for anything to-night . " " I think I ought to go now , " answered Faith . " Aunt Henderson never complains for a slight ailment , and she might be ill again , to-night . I can take all I shall need before to-morrow in my little morocco bag . I wo n't keep you waiting a minute , " she added , turning to Mr. Rushleigh . " I can wait twenty , if you wish , " he answered kindly . But in less than ten , they were driving down toward the river . Margaret Rushleigh had betaken herself to her own cool chamber , where the delicate straw matting , and pale green , leaf-patterned chintz of sofa , chairs , and hangings , gave a feeling of the last degree of summer lightness and daintiness , and the gentle air breathed in from the southwest , sifted , on the way , of its sunny heat , by the green draperies of vine and branch it wandered through . Lying there , on the cool , springy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mishaumok -- she forgot the wheels and the spindles -- the hot mills , and the ceaseless whir . Just at that moment of her utter comfort and content , a young factory girl dropped , fainting , in the dizzy heat , before her loom . CHAPTER XXVII . AT THE MILLS . " For all day the wheels are droning , turning ,  --  Their wind comes in our faces ,  --  Till our hearts turn , our head with pulses burning ,  --  And the walls turn in their places . " MRS . BROWNING . Faith sat silent by Mr. Rushleigh 's side , drinking in , also , with a cool content , the river air that blew upon their faces as they drove along . " Faithie ! " said Paul 's father , a little suddenly , at last --  " do you know how true a thing you said a little while ago ? " " How , sir ? " asked Faith , not perceiving what he meant . " When you spoke of having your hand on the mainspring of all this ? " And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he held , along the line of factory buildings that lay before them . A deep , blazing blush burned , at his words , over Faith 's cheek and brow . She sat and suffered it under his eye -- uttering not a syllable . " I knew you did not know . You did not think of it so . Yet it is true , none the less . Faith ! Are you happy ? Are you satisfied ? " Still a silence , and tears gathering in the eyes . " I do not wish to distress you , my dear . It is only a little word I should like to hear you speak . I must , so far as I can , see that my children are happy , Faith . " " I suppose , " said Faith , tremulously , struggling to speech --  " one can not expect to be utterly happy in this world . " " One does expect it , forgetting all else , at the moment when is given what seems to one life 's first , great good -- the earthly good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Faithie . Pure , present content is seldom overwise . " " Only , " said Faith , still tremblingly , " that the responsibility comes with the good . That feeling of having one 's hand upon the mainspring is a fearful one . " " I am not given , " said Mr. Rushleigh , " to quoting Bible at all times ; but you make a line of it come up to me . ' There is no fear in love . Perfect love casteth out fear . ' " " Be sure of yourself , dear child . Be sure you are content and happy ; and tell me so , if you can ; or , tell me otherwise , if you must , without a reserve or misgiving , " he said again , as they drove down the mill entrance ; and their conversation , for the time , came , necessarily , to an end . Coming into the mill yard , they were aware of a little commotion about one of the side doors . The mill girl who had fainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions , slowly recovering . " It is Mary Grover , sir , from up at the Peak , " said one of them , in reply to Mr. Rushleigh 's question . " She has n't been well for some days , but she 's kept on at her work , and the heat , to-day , was too much for her . She 'd ought to be got home , if there was any way . She ca n't ever walk . " " I 'll take her , myself , " said the mill owner , promptly . " Keep her quiet here a minute or two , while I go in and speak to Blasland . " But first he turned to Faith again . " What shall I do with you , my child ? " " Dear Mr. Rushleigh , " said she , with all her gratitude for his just spoken kindness to herself and her appreciation of his ready sympathy for the poor workgirl , in her voice --  " do n't think of me ! It 's lovely out there over the footbridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance is nearly nothing to Aunt Faith 's . I should like the walk -- really . " " Thank you , " said Mr. Rushleigh . " I believe you would . Then I 'll take Mary Grover up to the Peak . " And he shook her hand , and left her standing there , and went up into the mill . Two of the girls who had come out with Mary Grover , followed him and returned to their work . One , sitting with her in the doorway , on one of the upper steps , and supporting her yet dizzy head upon her shoulder , remained . Faith asked if she could do anything , and was answered , no , with thanks . She turned away , then , and walked over the planking above the race way , toward the river , where a pretty little footbridge crossed it here , from the end of the mill building . Against this end , projected , on this side , a square , tower-like appendage to the main structure , around which one must pass to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a staircase leading up . This was the entrance to Mr. Rushleigh 's " sanctum , " above , which communicated , also , with the second story of the mill . Here Faith paused . She caught , from around the corner , a sound of the angry voices of men . " I tell you , I 'll stay here till I see the boss ! " " I tell you , the boss wo n't see you . He 's done with you . " " Let him be done with me , then ; and not go spoiling my chance with other people ! I 'll see it out with him , somehow , yet . " " Better not threaten . He wo n't go out of his way to meddle with you ; only it 's no use your sending anybody here after a character . He 's one of the sort that speaks the truth and shames the devil . " " I 'll let him know he ai n't boss of the whole country round ! D --  -- d if I do n't ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from facing the speakers ; and took refuge up the open staircase . Above -- in the quiet little countingroom , shut off by double doors at the right from the great loom chamber of the mill , and opening at the front by a wide window upon the river that ran tumbling and flashing below , spanned by the graceful little bridge that reached the green slope of the field beyond -- it was so cool and pleasant -- so still with continuous and softened sound -- that Faith sat down upon the comfortable sofa there , to rest , to think , to be alone , a little . She had Paul 's letter in her pocket ; she had his father 's words fresh upon ear and heart . A strange peace came over her , as she placed herself here ; as if , somehow , a way was soon to be opened and made clear to her . As if she should come to know herself , and to be brave to act as God should show her how . She heard , presently , Mr. Rushleigh 's voice in the mill yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thinking that he should be here no more , to-night , he had shut and fastened it . It was no matter . She would go through the mill , by and by , and look at the looms ; and so out , and over the river , then , to Aunt Faith 's . CHAPTER XXVIII . LOCKED IN . " How idle it is to call certain things godsends ! as if there were anything else in the world . "  - -  HARE . It is accounted a part of the machinery of invention when , in a story , several coincident circumstances , that apart , would have had no noticeable result , bear down together , with a nice and sure calculation upon some catastrophe or denouement that develops itself therefrom . Last night , a man -- an employee in Mr. Rushleigh 's factory -- had been kept awake by one of his children , taken suddenly ill . A slight matter -- but it has to do with our story . Last night , also , Faith -- Paul 's second letter just received -- had lain sleepless for hours , fighting the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-love , and indecision . She had felt , or had thought she felt -- thus , or so -- in the days that were past . Why could she not be sure of her feeling now ? The new wine in the old bottles -- the new cloth in the old garment -- these , in Faith 's life , were at variance . What satisfied once , satisfied no longer . Was she to blame ? What ought she to do ? There was a seething -- a rending . Poor heart , that was likely to be burst and torn -- wonderingly , helplessly -- in the half-comprehended struggle ! So it happened , that , tired with all this , sore with its daily pressure and recurrence , this moment of strange peace came over her , and soothed her into rest . She laid herself back , there , on the broad , soft , old-fashioned sofa , and with the river breeze upon her brow , and the song of its waters in her ears , and the deadened hum of the factory rumbling on -- she fell asleep . How long it had been , she could not tell ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or near the morning ; but she felt cold and cramped ; everything save the busy river was still , and the daylight was all gone , and stars out bright in the deep , moonless sky , when she awoke . Awoke , bewilderedly , and came slowly to the comprehension that she was here alone . That it was night -- that nobody could know it -- that she was locked up here , in the great dreary mill . She raised herself upon the sofa , and sat in a terrified amaze . She took out her watch , and tried to see , by the starlight , the time . The slender black hands upon its golden face were invisible . It ticked -- it was going . She knew , by that , it could not be far beyond midnight , at the most . She was chilly , in her white dress , from the night air . She went to the open window , and looked out from it , before she drew it down . Away , over the fields , and up and down the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here alone . She shut the window , softly , afraid of the sounds herself might make . She opened the double doors from the countingroom , and stood on the outer threshold , and looked into the mill . The heavy looms were still . They stood like great , dead creatures , smitten in the midst of busy motion . There was an awfulness in being here , the only breathing , moving thing -- in darkness -- where so lately had been the deafening hum of rolling wheels , and clanking shafts , and flying shuttles , and busy , moving human figures . It was as if the world itself were stopped , and she forgotten on its mighty , silent course . Should she find her way to the great bell , ring it , and make an alarm ? She thought of this ; and then she reasoned with herself that she was hardly so badly off , as to justify her , quite , in doing that . It would rouse the village , it would bring Mr. Rushleigh down , perhaps -- it would cause a terrible alarm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer of loneliness and discomfort . She was safe . It would soon be morning . The mill would be opened early . She would go back to the sofa , and try to sleep again . Nobody could be anxious about her . The Rushleighs supposed her to be at Cross Corners . Her aunt would think her detained at Lakeside . It was really no great matter . She would be brave , and quiet . So she shut the double doors again , and found a coat of Paul 's , or Mr. Rushleigh 's , in the closet of the countingroom , and lay down upon the sofa , covering herself with that . For an hour or more , her heart throbbed , her nerves were excited , she could not sleep . But at last she grew calmer , her thought wandered from her actual situation -- became indistinct -- and slumber held her again , dreamily . There was another sleeper , also , in the mill whom Faith knew nothing of . Michael Garvin , the night watchman -- the same whose child had been ill the night before -- when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it but a few minutes , going his silent round within the building , and recording his faithfulness by the half-hour pin upon the watch clock . Six times he had done this , already . It was half past ten . He had gone up , now , by the stairs from the weaving room , into the third story . These stairs ascended at the front , from within the chamber . Michael Garvin went on nearly to the end of the room above -- stopped , and looked out at a window . All still , all safe apparently . He was very tired . What harm in lying down somewhere in a corner , for five minutes ? He need not shut his eyes . He rolled his coat up for a pillow , and threw it against the wall beneath the window . The next instant he had stretched his stalwart limbs along the floor , and before ten minutes of his seventh half hour were spent -- long before Faith , who thought herself all alone in the great building , had lost consciousness of her strange position -- he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third story ! So , since the days of the disciples , men have grown heavy and forgotten their trust . So they have slumbered upon decks , at sea . So sentinels have lain down at picket posts , though they knew the purchase of that hour of rest might be the leaden death ! Faith Gartney dreamed , uneasily . She thought herself wandering , at night , through the deserted streets of a great city . She seemed to have come from somewhere afar off , and to have no place to go to . Up and down , through avenues sometimes half familiar , sometimes wholly unknown , she went wearily , without aim , or end , or hope . " Tired ! tired ! tired ! " she seemed to say to herself . " Nowhere to rest -- nobody to take care of me ! " Then -- city , streets , and houses disappeared ; the scenery of her dream rolled away , and opened out , and she was standing on a high , bare cliff , away up in wintry air ; threatening rocky avalanches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still crying out in loneliness and fear . Still with none to comfort or to help . Standing on the sheer edge of the precipice -- behind her , suddenly , a crater opened . A hissing breath came up , and the chill air quivered and scorched about her . Her feet were upon a volcano ! A lake of boiling , molten stone heaved -- huge , brazen , bubbling -- spreading wider and wider , like a great earth ulcer , eating in its own brink continually . Up in the air over her , reared a vast , sulphurous canopy of smoke . The narrowing ridge beneath her feet burned -- trembled . She hovered between two destructions . Instantly -- in that throbbing , agonizing moment of her dream , just after which one wakes -- she felt a presence -- she heard a call -- she thought two arms were stretched out toward her -- there seemed a safety and a rest near by ; she was borne by an unseen impulse , along the dizzy ridge that her feet scarce touched , toward it ; she was taken -- folded , held ; smoke , fire , the threatening danger of the cliff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menaced still , she thought not ; a voice she knew and trusted was in her ear ; a grasp of loving strength sustained her ; she was utterly secure . So vividly she felt the presence -- so warm and sure seemed that love and strength about her -- that waking out of such pause of peace , before her senses recognized anything that was real without , she stretched her hands , as if to find it at her side , and her lips breathed a name -- the name of Roger Armstrong . Then she started to her feet . The kind , protecting presence faded back into her dream . The horrible smoke , the scorching smell , were true . A glare smote sky and trees and water , as she saw them from the window . There was fire near her ! Could it be among the buildings of the mill ? The long , main structure ran several feet beyond the square projection within which she stood . Upon the other side , close to the front , quite away , of course , from all observation hence , joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming one with the first . Here were the carding rooms . Then beyond , detached , were houses for storage and other purposes connected with the business . Was it from one of these the glare and smoke and suffocating burning smell were pouring ? Or , lay the danger nearer -- within these close , contiguous walls ? Vainly she threw up the one window , and leaned forth . She could not tell . * * * * * At this moment , Roger Armstrong , also , woke from out a dream . In this strange , second life of ours , that replaces the life of day , do we not meet interiorly ? Do not thoughts and knowledges cross , from spirit to spirit , over the abyss , that lip , and eye , and ear , in waking moments , neither send nor receive ? That even mind itself is scarcely conscious of ? Is not the great deep of being , wherein we rest , electric with a sympathetic life -- and do not warnings and promises and cheer pulse in upon us , mysteriously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only is awake and keen ? Do not two thoughts , two consciousnesses , call and answer to each other , mutely , in twin dreams of night ? Roger Armstrong came in , late , that evening , from a visit to a distant sick parishioner . Then he sat , writing , for an hour or two longer . By and by , he threw down his pen -- pushed back his armchair before his window -- stretched his feet , wearily , into the deep , old-fashioned window seat -- leaned his head back , and let the cool breeze stir his hair . So it soothed him into sleep . He dreamed of Faith . He dreamed he saw her stand , afar off , in some solitary place , and beckon , as it were , visibly , from a wide , invisible distance . He dreamed he struggled to obey her summons . He battled with the strange inertia of sleep . He strove -- he gasped -- he broke the spell and hastened on . He plunged -- he climbed -- he stood in a great din that bewildered and threatened ; there was a lurid light that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of all -- beyond -- she beckoned still . " Faith ! Faith ! What danger is about you , child ? " These words broke forth from him aloud , as he started to his feet , and stretched his hands , impulsively , out before him , toward the open window . His eyes flashed wide upon that crimson glare that flooded sky and field and river . There was fire at the mills ! Not a sound , yet , from the sleeping village . * * * * * The heavy , close-fitting double doors between the countingroom and the great mill chamber were shut . Only by opening these and venturing forth , could Faith gain certain knowledge of her situation . Once more she pulled them open and passed through . A blinding smoke rushed thick about her , and made her gasp for breath . Up through the belt holes in the floor , toward the farther end of the long room , sprang little tongues of flame that leaped higher and higher , even while she strove for sight , that single , horrified , suffocating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shafts of silent looms . In at the windows on the left , came the vengeful shine of those other windows , at right angles , in the adjacent building . The carding rooms , and the whole front of the mill , below , were all in flames ! In frantic affright , in choking agony , Faith dashed herself back through the heavy doors , that swung on springs , and closed tightly once more after her . Here , at the open window , she took breath . Must she wait here , helpless , for the fiery death ? Down below her , the narrow brink -- the rushing river . No foothold -- no chance for a descent . Behind her , only those two doors , barring out flame and smoke ! And the little footbridge , lying in the light across the water , and the green fields stretching away , cool and safe beyond . A little farther -- her home ! " Fire ! " She cried the fearful word out upon the night , uselessly . There was no one near . The village slumbered on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout of a man might reach it , but no tone of hers . There were no completed or occupied dwelling houses , as yet , about the new mills . Mr. Rushleigh was putting up some blocks ; but , for the present , there was nothing nearer than the village proper of Kinnicutt on the one hand , and as far , or farther , on the other the houses at Lakeside . The flames themselves , alone , could signal her danger , and summon help . How long would it be first ? Thoughts of father , mother , and little brother -- thoughts of the kind friends at Lakeside , parted from but a few hours before -- thoughts of the young lover to whom the answer he waited for should be given , perhaps , so awfully ; through all , lighting , as it were , suddenly and searchingly , the deep places of her own soul , the thought -- the feeling , rather , of that presence in her dream ; of him who had led her , taught her , lifted her so , to high things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ! Of all human influence or love , his was nearest and strongest , spiritually , to her , now ! All at once , across these surging , crowding , agonizing feelings , rushed an inspiration for the present moment . The water gate ! The force pump ! The apparatus for working these lay at this end of the building . She had been shown the method of its operation ; they had explained to her its purpose . It was perfectly simple . Only the drawing of a rope over a pulley -- the turning of a faucet . She could do it , if she could only reach the spot . Instantly and strangely , the cloud of terror seemed to roll away . Her faculties cleared . Her mind was all alert and quickened . She thought of things she had heard of years before , and long forgotten . That a wet cloth about the face would defend from smoke . That down low , close to the floor , was always a current of fresher air . She turned a faucet that supplied a basin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saturated it with water . Then she tied it across her forehead , letting it hang before her face like a veil . She caught a fold of it between her teeth . And so , opening the doors between whose cracks the pent-up smoke was curling , she passed through , crouching down , and crawled along the end of the chamber , toward the great rope in the opposite corner . The fire was creeping thitherward , also , to meet her . Along from the front , down the chamber on the opposite side , the quick flames sprang and flashed , momently higher , catching already , here and there , from point to point , where an oiled belt or an unfinished web of cloth attracted their hungry tongues . As yet , they were like separate skirmishers , sent out in advance ; their mighty force not yet gathered and rolled together in such terrible sheet and volume as raged beneath . She reached the corner where hung the rope . Close by , was the faucet in the main pipe fed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hose , attached and ready . She turned the faucet , and laid hold of the long rope . A few pulls , and she heard the dashing of the water far below . The wheel was turning . The pipes filled . She lifted the end of the coiled hose , and directed it toward the forward part of the chamber , where flames were wreathing , climbing , flashing . An impetuous column of water rushed , eager , hissing , upon blazing wood and heated iron . Still keeping the hose in her grasp , she crawled back again , half stifled , yet a new hope of life aroused within her , to the double doors . Before these , with the little countingroom behind her , as her last refuge , she took her stand . How long could she fight off death ? Till help came ? All this had been done and thought quickly . There had been less time than she would have believed , since she first woke to the knowledge of this , her horrible peril . The flames were already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt holes the water poured upon the fiercer blaze below , that swept across the forward and central part of the great spinning room , from side to side . At this moment , a cry , close at hand . " Fire ! " A man was swaying by a rope , down from a third-story window . " Fire ! " came again , instantly , from without , upon another side . It was a voice hoarse , excited , strained . A tone Faith had never heard before ; yet she knew , by a mysterious intuition , from whom it came . She dropped the hose , still pouring out its torrent , to the floor , and sprang back , through the doors , to the countingroom window . The voice came from the riverside . A man was dashing down the green slope , upon the footbridge . Faith stretched her arms out , as a child might , wakened in pain and terror . A cry , in which were uttered the fear , the horror , that were now first fully felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that itself came like a sudden pang , escaped her , piercingly , thrillingly . Roger Armstrong looked upward as he sprang upon the bridge . He caught the cry . He saw Faith stand there , in her white dress , that had been wet and blackened in her battling with the fire . A great soul glance of courage and resolve flashed from his eyes . He reached his uplifted arms toward her , answering hers . He uttered not a word . " Round ! round ! " cried Faith . " The door upon the other side ! " Roger Armstrong , leaping to the spot , and Michael Garvin , escaped by the long rope that hung vibrating from his grasp , down the brick wall of the building , met at the staircase door . " Help me drive that in ! " cried the minister . And the two men threw their stalwart shoulders against the barrier , forcing lock and hinges . Up the stairs rushed Roger Armstrong . Answering the crash of the falling door , came another and more fearful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and supports beneath the forward portion of the second floor had given way , and the heavy looms that stood there had gone plunging down . A horrible volume of smoke and steam poured upward , with the flames , from out the chasm , and rushed , resistlessly , everywhere . Roger Armstrong dashed into the little countingroom . Faith lay there , on the floor . At that fearful crash , that rush of suffocating smoke , she had fallen , senseless . He seized her , frantically , in his arms to bear her down . " Faith ! Faith ! " he cried , when she neither spoke nor moved . " My darling ! Are you hurt ? Are you killed ? Oh , my God ! must there be another ? " Faith did not hear these words , uttered with all the passionate agony of a man who would hold the woman he loves to his heart , and defy for her even death . She came to herself in the open air . She felt herself in his arms . She only heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his old tone , as her consciousness returned , and he saw it : " My dear child ! " But she knew then all that had been a mystery to her in herself before . She knew that she loved Roger Armstrong . That it was not a love of gratitude and reverence , only ; but that her very soul was rendered up to him , involuntarily , as a woman renders herself but once . That she would rather have died there , in that flame and smoke , held in his arms -- gathered to his heart -- than have lived whatever life of ease and pleasantness -- aye , even of use -- with any other ! She knew that her thought , in those terrible moments before he came , had been -- not father 's or mother 's , only ; not her young lover , Paul 's ; but , deepest and mostly , his ! CHAPTER XXIX . HOME . " The joy that knows there is a joy --  That scents its breath , and cries , ' t is there ! And , patient in its pure repose , Receiveth so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved the mill from utter destruction . For one fearful moment , when that forward portion of the loom floor fell through , and flame , and vapor , and smoke rioted together in a wild alliance of fury , all seemed lost . But the great water wheel was plying on ; the river fought the fire ; the rushing , exhaustless streams were pouring out and down , everywhere ; and the crowd that in a few moments after the first alarm , and Faith 's rescue , gathered at the spot , found its work half done . A little later , there were only sullen smoke , defeated , smoldering fires , blackened timbers , the burned carding rooms , and the ruin at the front , to tell the awful story of the night . Mr. Armstrong had carried Faith into one of the unfinished factory houses . Here he was obliged to leave her for a few moments , after making such a rude couch for her as was possible , with a pile of clean shavings , and his own coat , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " The first horse and vehicle which comes , Miss Faith , I shall impress for your service , " he said ; " and to do that I must leave you . I have made that frightened watchman promise to say nothing , at present , of your being here ; so I trust the crowd may not annoy you . I shall not be gone long , nor far away . " The first horse and vehicle which came was the one that had brought her there in the afternoon but just past , yet that seemed , strangely , to have been so long ago . Mr. Rushleigh found her lying here , quiet , amidst the growing tumult -- exhausted , patient , waiting . " My little Faithie ! " he cried , coming up to her with hands outstretched , and a quiver of strong feeling in his voice . " To think that you should have been in this horrible danger , and we all lying in our beds , asleep ! I do not quite understand it all . You must tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have done . You have saved me half my property here -- do you know it , child ? Can I ever thank you for your courage ? " " Oh , Mr. Rushleigh ! " cried Faith , rising as he came to her , and holding her hands to his , " do n't thank me ! and do n't wait here ! They 'll want you -- and , oh ! my kind friend ! there will be nothing to thank me for , when I have told you what I must . I have been very near to death , and I have seen life so clearly ! I know now what I did not know yesterday -- what I could not answer you then ! " " Let it be as it may , I am sure it will be right and true , and I shall honor you , Faith ! And we must bear what is , for it has come of the will of God , and not by any fault of yours . Now , let me take you home . " " May I do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armstrong , who entered at this moment , with garments he had brought from somewhere to wrap Faith . " I must go home , " said Faith . " To Aunt Henderson 's . " " You shall do as you like , " answered Mr. Rushleigh . " But it belongs to us to care for you , I think . " " You do -- you have cared for me already , " said Faith , earnestly . And Mr. Rushleigh helped to wrap her up , and kissed her forehead tenderly , and Roger Armstrong lifted her into the chaise , and seated himself by her , and drove her away from out the smoke and noise and curious crowd that had begun to find out she was there , and that she had been shut up in the mill , and had saved herself and stopped the fire ; and would have made her as uncomfortable as crowds always do heroes or heroines -- had it not been for the friend beside her , whose foresight and precaution had warded it all off . And the mill owner went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his property . Glory McWhirk had been up and watching the great fire , since Roger Armstrong first went out . She had seen it from the window of Miss Henderson 's room , where she was to sleep to-night ; and had first carefully lowered the blinds lest the light should waken her mistress , who , after suffering much pain , had at length , by the help of an anodyne , fallen asleep ; and then she had come round softly to the southwest room , to call the minister . The door stood open , and she saw him sitting in his chair , asleep . Just as she crossed the threshold to come toward him , he started , and spoke those words out of his restless dream : " Faith ! Faith ! What danger is about you , child ? " They were instinct with his love . They were eager with his visionary fear . It only needed a human heart to interpret them . Glory drew back as he sprang to his feet , and noiselessly disappeared . She would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he waked . " He dreamed about her ! and he called her Faith . How beautiful it is to be cared for so ! " Glory -- while we have so long been following Faith -- had no less been living on her own , peculiar , inward life , that reached to , that apprehended , that seized ideally -- that was denied , so much ! As Glory had seen , in the old years , children happier than herself , wearing beautiful garments , and " hair that was let to grow , " she saw those about her now whom life infolded with a grace and loveliness she might not look for ; about whom fair affections , " let to grow , " clustered radiant , and enshrined them in their light . She saw always something that was beyond ; something she might not attain ; yet , expectant of nothing , but blindly true to the highest within her , she lost no glimpse of the greater , through lowering herself to the less . Her soul of womanhood asserted itself ; longing , ignorantly , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " But she would rather recognize it afar -- rather have her joy in knowing the joy that might be -- than shut herself from knowledge in the content of a common , sordid lot . She did not think this deliberately , however ; it was not reason , but instinct . She renounced unconsciously . She bore denial , and never knew she was denied . Of course , the thought of daring to covet what she saw , had never crossed her , in her humbleness . It was quite away from her . It was something with which she had nothing to do . " But it must be beautiful to be like Miss Faith . " And she thanked God , mutely , that she had this beautiful life near her , and could look on it every day . She could not marry Luther Goodell . " A vague unrest And a nameless longing filled her breast " ; But , unlike the maiden of the ballad , she could not smother it down , to break forth , by and by , defying the " burden of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a keen torture then . Faith had read to her this story of Maud , one day . " I should n't have done so , " she had said , when it was ended . " I 'd rather have kept that one minute under the apple trees to live on all the rest of my days ! " She could not marry Luther Goodell . Would it have been better that she should ? That she should have gone down from her dreams into a plain man 's life , and made a plain man happy ? Some women , of far higher mental culture and social place , have done this , and , seemingly , done well . Only God and their own hearts know if the seeming be true . Glory waited . " Everybody need n't marry , " she said . This night , with those words of Mr. Armstrong 's in her ears , revealing to her so much , she stood before that window of his and watched the fire . Doors were open behind her , leading through to Miss Henderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirred . If she had known what she did not know -- that Faith Gartney stood at this moment in that burning mill , looking forth despairingly on those bright waters and green fields that lay between it and this home of hers -- that were so near her , she might discern each shining pebble and the separate grass blades in the scarlet light , yet so infinitely far , so gone from her forever -- had she known all this , without knowing the help and hope that were coming -- she would yet have said " How beautiful it would be to be like Miss Faith ! " She watched the fire till it began to deaden , and the glow paled out into the starlight . By and by , up from the direction of the river road , she saw a chaise approaching . It was stopped at the corner , by the bar place . Two figures descended from it , and entered upon the field path through the stile . One -- yes -- it was surely the minister ! The other -- a woman . Who ? Miss Faith ! Glory met them upon the doorstone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disturbing my aunt , " said she . " Take care of her , Glory , " said her companion . " She has been in frightful danger . " " At the fire ! And you --  --  " " I was there in time , thank God ! " spoke Roger Armstrong , from his soul . The two girls passed through to the blue bedroom , softly . Mr. Armstrong went back to the mills again , with horse and chaise . Glory shut the bedroom door . " Why , you are all wet , and draggled , and smoked ! " said she , taking off Faith 's outer , borrowed garments . " What has happened to you -- and how came you there , Miss Faith ? " " I fell asleep in the countingroom , last evening , and got locked in . I was coming home . I ca n't tell you now , Glory . I do n't dare to think it all over , yet . And we must n't let Aunt Faith know that I am here . " These sentences they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought warm water , and bathed and rubbed Faith 's feet , and helped her to undress , and put her night clothes on , and covered her in bed with blankets , and then went away softly to the kitchen , whence she brought back , presently , a cup of hot tea , and a biscuit . " Take these , please , " she said . " I do n't think I can , Glory . I do n't want anything . " " But he told me to take care of you , Miss Faith ! " That , also , had a power with Faith . Because he had said that , she drank the tea , and then lay back -- so tired ! * * * * * " I waited up till you came , sir , because I thought you would like to know , " said Glory , meeting Mr. Armstrong once more upon the doorstone , as he returned a second time from the fire . " She 's gone to sleep , and is resting beautiful ! " " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the minister ; and he put his hand forth , and grasped hers as he spoke . " Now go to bed , and rest , yourself . " It was reward enough . From the plenitude that waits on one life , falls a crumb that stays the craving of another . CHAPTER XXX . AUNT HENDERSON 'S MYSTERY . " Oh , the little birds sang east , and the little birds sang west , And I said in underbreath ,  - -  All our life is mixed with death , And who knoweth which is best ? " Oh , the little birds sang east , and the little birds sang west , And I smiled to think God 's greatness flowed around our incompleteness ,  --  Round our restlessness , His rest . " MRS . BROWNING . " So the dreams depart , So the fading phantoms flee , And the sharp reality Now must act its part . " WESTWOOD . It was a little after noon of the next day , when Mr. Rushleigh came to Cross Corners . Faith was lying back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror , excitement , and fatigue she had gone through -- in the large easy-chair which had been brought for her into the southeast room . Miss Henderson had been removed from her bed to the sofa here , and the two were keeping each other quiet company . Neither could bear the strain of nerve to dwell long or particularly on the events of the night . The story had been told , as simply as it might be ; and the rest and the thankfulness were all they could think of now . So there were deep thoughts and few words between them . On Faith 's part , a patient waiting for a trial yet before her . " It 's Mr. Rushleigh , come over to see Miss Faith . Shall I bring him in ? " asked Glory , at the door . " Will you mind it , aunt ? " asked Faith . " I ? No , " said Miss Henderson . " Will you mind my being here ? That 's the question . I 'd take myself off , without asking , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faith ! There is something I have to say to Mr. Rushleigh which will be very hard to say , but no more so because you will be by to hear it . It is better so . I shall only have to say it once . I am glad you should be with me . " " Brave little Faithie ! " said Mr. Rushleigh , coming in with hands outstretched . " Not ill , I hope ? " " Only tired , " Faith answered . " And a little weak , and foolish , " as the tears would come , in answer to his cordial words . " I am sorry . Miss Henderson , that I could not have persuaded this little girl to go home with me last night -- this morning , rather . But she would come to you . " " She did just right , " Aunt Faith replied . " It 's the proper place for her to come to . Not but that we thank you all the same . You 're very kind . " " Kinder than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his seat beside her . Mr. Rushleigh would not let her lead him that way yet . He ignored the little whisper , and by a gentle question or two drew from her that which he had come , especially , to learn and speak of to-day -- the story of the fire , and her own knowledge of , and share in it , as she alone could tell it . Now , for the first time , as she recalled it to explain her motive for entering the mill at all , the rough conversation she had overheard between the two men upon the river bank , suggested to Faith , as the mention of it was upon her lips , a possible clew to the origin of the mischief . She paused , suddenly , and a look of dismayed hesitation came over her face . " I ought to tell you all , I suppose , " she continued . " But pray , sir , do not conclude anything hastily . The two things may have had nothing to do with each other . " And then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her ears . Pausing , timidly , to look up in her listener 's face , to judge of its expression , a smile there surprised her . " See how truth is always best , " said Mr. Rushleigh . " If you had kept back your knowledge of this , you would have sealed up a painful doubt for your own tormenting . That man , James Regan , came to me this morning . There is good in the fellow , after all . He told me , just as you have , and as Hardy did , the words he spoke in passion . He was afraid , he said , they might be brought up against him . And so he came to ' own up , ' and account for his time ; and to beg me to believe that he never had any definite thought of harm . I told him I did believe it ; and then the poor fellow , rough as he is , turned pale , and burst into tears . Last night gave him a lesson , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of him . Blasland says , ' he worked like five men and a horse , ' at the fire . " Faith 's face glowed as she listened , at the nobleness of these two ; of the generous , Christian gentleman -- of the coarse workman , who wore his nature , like his garb -- the worse part of an everyday . Fire and loss are not all calamity , when such as this comes of them . Her own recital was soon finished . Mr. Rushleigh listened , giving his whole sympathy to the danger she had faced , his fresh and fervent acknowledgment and admiring praise to the prompt daring she had shown , as if these things , and naught else , had been in either mind . At these thanks -- at this praise -- Faith shrank . " Oh , Mr. Rushleigh ! " she interrupted , with a low , pained , humbled entreaty --  " do n't speak so ! Only forgive me -- if you can ! " Her hands lifted themselves with a slight , imploring gesture toward him . He laid his own upon them , gently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproach yourself , Faith , " he answered , meeting her meaning , frankly , now . " There are things beyond our control . All we can do is to be simply true . There is something , I know , which you think lies between us to be spoken of . Do not speak at all , if it be hard for you . I will tell the boy that it was a mistake -- that it can not be . " But the father 's lip was a little unsteady , to his own feeling , as he said the words . " Oh , Mr. Rushleigh ! " cried Faith . " If everything could only be put back as it was , in the old days before all this ! " " But that is what we ca n't do . Nothing goes back precisely to what it was before . " " No , " said Aunt Faith , from her sofa . " And never did , since the days of Humpty Dumpty . You might be glad to , but you ca n't do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they are . And they 're never just alike , two minutes together . They 're altering , and working , and going on , all the time . And that 's a comfort , too , when you come to think of it . " " There is always comfort , somehow , when there has been no willful wrong . And there has been none here , I am sure . " Faith , with the half smile yet upon her face , called there by her aunt 's quaint speaking , bent her head , and burst into tears . " I came to reassure and to thank you , Faith -- not to let you distress yourself so , " said Mr. Rushleigh . " Margaret sent all kind messages ; but I would not bring her . I thought it would be too much for you , so soon . Another day , she will come . We shall always claim old friendship , my child , and remember our new debt ; though the old days themselves can not quite be brought back again as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even , by and by . " " Let Margaret know , before she comes , please , " whispered Faith . " I do n't think I could tell her . " " You shall not have a moment of trial that I can spare you . But -- Paul will be content with nothing , as a final word , that does not come from you . " " I will see him when he comes . I wish it . Oh , sir ! I am so sorry . " " And so am I , Faith . We must all be sorry . But we are only sorry . And that is all that need be said . " The conversation , after this , could not be prolonged . Mr. Rushleigh took his leave , kindly , as he had made his greeting . " Oh , Aunt Faith ! What a terrible thing I have done ! " " What a terrible thing you came near doing , you mean , child ! Be thankful to the Lord -- He 's delivered you from it ! And look well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out of fire and misery you must have been saved for something ! " Then Aunt Faith called Glory , and told her to bring an egg , beat up in milk --  " to a good froth , mind ; and sugared and nut-megged , and a teaspoonful of brandy in it . " This she made Faith swallow , and then bade her put her feet up on the sofa , and lean back , and shut her eyes , and not speak another word till she 'd had a nap . All which , strangely enough , Faith -- wearied , troubled , yet relieved -- obeyed . For the next two days , what with waiting on the invalids -- for Faith was far from well -- and with answering the incessant calls at the door of curious people flocking to inquire , Glory McWhirk was kept busy and tired . But not with a thankless duty , as in the days gone by , that she remembered ; it was heart work now , and brought heart love as its reward . It was one of her " real good times . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help and ministry also , just when it could be given most effectually . It was a beautiful lull of peace between the conflict that was past , and the final pang that was to come . Faith accepted it with a thankfulness . Such joy as this was all life had for her , henceforth . There was no restlessness , no selfishness in the love that had so suddenly asserted itself , and borne down all her doubts . She thought not of it , as love , any more . She never dreamed of being other to Mr. Armstrong than she was . Only , that other life had become impossible to her . Here , if she might not elsewhere , she had gone back to the things that were . She could be quite content and happy , so . It was enough to rest in such a friendship . If only she had once seen Paul , and if he could but bear it ! And Roger Armstrong , of intent , was just what he had always been -- the kind and earnest friend -- the ready helper -- no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear ; he had read her perplexity -- her indecision ; he had feared , unselfishly , for the mistake she was making . Miss Henderson had told him , now , in few , plain words , how things were ending ; he strove , in all pleasant and thoughtful ways , to soothe and beguile her from her harassment . He dreamed not how the light had come to her that had revealed to her the insufficiency of that other love . He laid his own love back , from his own sight . So , calmly , and with what peace they might , these hours went on . " I want to see that Sampson woman , " said Aunt Faith , suddenly , to her niece , on the third afternoon of their being together . " Do you think she would come over here if I should send for her ? " Faith flashed a surprised look of inquiry to Miss Henderson 's face . " Why , aunt ? " she asked . " Never mind why , child . I ca n't tell you now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want her . Something I should like to know , and that I suppose she could tell me . Do you think she 'd come ? " " Why , yes , auntie . I do n't doubt it . I might write her a note . " " I wish you would . Mr. Armstrong says he 'll drive over . And I 'd like to have you do it right off . Now , do n't ask me another word about it , till she 's been here . " Faith wrote the note , and Mr. Armstrong went away . Miss Henderson seemed to grow tired , to-day , after her dinner , and at four o'clock she said to Glory , abruptly : " I 'll go to bed . Help me into the other room . " Faith offered to go too , and assist her . But her aunt said , no , she should do quite well with Glory . " And if the Sampson woman comes , send her in to me . " Faith was astonished , and a little frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nurse ? Was it professionally that she wished to see her ? She knew the peculiar whim , or principle , Miss Sampson always acted on , of never taking cases of common illness . She could not have sent for her in the hope of keeping her merely to wait upon her wants as an invalid , and relieve Glory ? Was her aunt aware of symptoms in herself , foretokening other or more serious illness ? Faith could only wonder , and wait . Glory came back , presently , into the southeast room , to say to Faith that her aunt was comfortable , and thought she should get a nap . But that whenever the nurse came , she was to be shown in to her . The next half hour , that happened which drove even this thought utterly from Faith 's mind . Paul Rushleigh came . Faith lay , a little wearily , upon the couch her aunt had quitted ; and was thinking , at the very moment -- with that sudden , breathless anticipation that sweeps over one , now and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not probably bring him home -- when she caught the sound of a horse 's feet that stopped before the house , and then a man 's step upon the stoop . It was his . The moment had come . She sprang to her feet . For an instant she would have fled -- anywhither . Then she grew strangely calm and strong . She must meet him quietly . She must tell him plainly . Tell him , if need be , all she knew herself . He had a right to all . Paul came in , looking grave ; and greeted her with a gentle reserve . A moment , they stood there as they had met , she with face pale , sad , that dared not lift itself ; he , not trusting himself to the utterance of a word . But he had come there , not to reproach , or to bewail ; not even to plead . To hear -- to bear with firmness -- what she had to tell him . And there was , in truth , a new strength and nobleness in look and tone , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way -- if all had gone prosperously with him -- he would have been , still -- recipient of his father 's bounty , and accepted of his childish love -- scarcely more than a mere , happy boy . This pain , this struggle , this first rebuff of life , crowned him , a man . Faith might have loved him , now , if she had so seen him , first . Yet the hour would come when he should know that it had been better as it was . That so he should grow to that which , otherwise , he had never been . " Faith ! My father has told me . That it must be all over . That it was a mistake . I have come to hear it from you . " Then he laid in her hand his father 's letter . " This came with yours , " he said . " After this , I expected all the rest . " Faith took the open sheet , mechanically . With half-blinded eyes , she glanced over the few earnest , fatherly , generous lines . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes . That is it . He saw it . It would have been no true marriage , Paul , before Heaven ! " " Then why did I love you , Faith ? " cried the young man , impetuously . " I do n't know , " she said , meditatively , as if she really were to answer that . " Perhaps you will come to love again , differently , yet , Paul ; and then you may know why this has been . " " I know , " said Paul , sadly , " that you have been outgrowing me , Faith . I have felt that . I know I 've been nothing but a careless , merry fellow , living an outside sort of life ; and I suppose it was only in this outside companionship you liked me . But there might be something more in me , yet ; and you might have brought it out , maybe . You were bringing it out . You , and the responsibilities my father put upon me . But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Not too late , Paul , for that noble part of you to grow . It was that I came so near really loving at the last . But -- Paul ! a woman do n't want to lead her husband . She wants to be led . I have thought , " she added , timidly , " so much of that verse in the Epistle -- 'the head of the woman is the man , and the head of the man is Christ , and the head of Christ is God . ' " " You came near loving me ! " cried Paul , catching at this sentence , only , out of all that should , by and by , nevertheless , come out in letters of light upon his thought and memory . " Oh , Faith ! you may , yet ! It is n't all quite over ? " Then Faith Gartney knew she must say it all . All -- though the hot crimson flushed up painfully , and the breath came quick , and she trembled from head to foot , there , where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its might , came up from heart to lip , and the crimson paled , and the breath grew calm , and she stood firm with her pure resolve , even in her maidenly shame , before him . There are instants , when all thought of the moment itself , and the look and the word of it , are overborne and lost . " No , Paul . I will tell you truly . With my little , childish heart , I loved you . With the love of a dear friend , I hold you still , and shall hold you , always . But , Paul ! no one else knows it , and I never knew it till I stood face to face with death -- with my soul I have come to love another ! " Deep and low these last words were -- given up from the very innermost , and spoken with bowed head and streaming eyes . Paul Rushleigh took her hand . A manly reverence in him recognized the pure courage that unveiled her woman 's heart , and showed him all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceived me . You are always noble . Forgive me that I have made you struggle to love me ! " With these words , he went . Faith flung herself upon the sofa , and hid her face in its cushion , hearing , through her sobs , the tread of his horse as he passed down the road . This chapter of her life story was closed . CHAPTER XXXI . NURSE SAMPSON 'S WAY OF LOOKING AT IT . " I can believe , it shall you grieve , And somewhat you distrain ; But afterward , your paines hard , Within a day or twain , Shall soon aslake ; and ye shall take Comfort to you again . " OLD ENGLISH BALLAD . Glory looked in , once , at the southeast room , and saw Faith lying , still with hidden face ; and went away softly , shutting the door behind her as she went . When Mr. Armstrong and Miss Sampson came , she met them at the front entrance , and led the nurse directly to her mistress , as she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Perhaps the hollow Paul Rushleigh 's horse had pawed at the gatepost , and the closed door of the keeping room , revealed something to his discernment that kept him from seeking Faith just then . There was a half hour of quiet in the old house . A quiet that ever brooded very much . Then Nurse Sampson came out , with a look on her face that made Faith gaze upon her with an awed feeling of expectation . She feared , suddenly , to ask a question . It was not a long-drawn look of sympathy . It was not surprised , nor shocked , nor excited . It was a look of business . As if she knew of work before her to do . As if Nurse Sampson were in her own proper element , once more . Faith knew that something -- she could not guess what -- something terrible , she feared -- had happened , or was going to happen , to her aunt . It was in the softening twilight that Miss Henderson sent for her to come in . Aunt Faith leaned against her pillows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a strange gentleness in look and word and touch , as she greeted the young girl who came to her bedside with a face that wore at once its own subduedness of fresh-past grief , and a wondering , loving apprehension of something to be disclosed concerning the kind friend who lay there , invested so with such new grace of tenderness . Was there a twilight , other than that of day , softening , also , around her ? " Little Faith ! " said Aunt Henderson . Her very voice had taken an unwonted tone . " Auntie ! It is surely something very grave ! Will you not tell me ? " " Yes , child . I mean to tell you . It may be grave . Most things are , if we had the wisdom to see it . But it is n't very dreadful . It 's what I 've had warning enough of , and had mostly made up my mind to . But I was n't quite sure . Now , I am . I suppose I 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be greater , at my years , than it would have been if I 'd been younger . And I may die . That 's all . " The words , of old habit , were abrupt . The eye and voice were tender with unspoken love . Faith turned to Miss Sampson , who sat by . " And then , again , she may n't , " said the nurse . " I shall stay and see her through . There 'll have to be an operation . At least , I think so . We 'll have the doctor over , to-morrow . And now , if there 's one thing more important than another , it 's to keep her cheerful . So , if you 've got anything bright and lively to say , speak out ! If not , keep out ! She 'll do well enough , I dare say . " Poor Faith ! And , without this new trouble , there was so much that she , herself , was needing comfort for ! " You 're a wise woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Aunt Faith . " The best thing to take people out of their own worries , is to go to work and find out how other folks ' worries are getting on . He 's been here , has n't he , child ? " It was not so hard for Aunt Faith , who had borne secretly , so long , the suspicion of what was coming , and had lived on , calmly , nevertheless , in her daily round , to turn thus from the announcement of her own state and possible danger , to thought and inquiry for the affairs of another , as it was for that other , newly apprised , and but half apprised , even , of what threatened , to leave the subject there , and answer . But she saw that Miss Henderson spoke only truth in declaring it was the best way to take her out of her worries ; she read Nurse Sampson 's look , and saw that she , at any rate , was quite resolved her patient should not be let to dwell longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off all her own anxious questionings , till she should see the nurse alone , and said , in a low tone -- yes , Paul Rushleigh had been there . " And you 've told him the truth , like a woman , and he 's heard it like a man ? " " I 've told him it must be given up . Oh , it was hard , auntie ! " " You need n't worry . You 've done just the rightest thing you could do . " " But it seems so selfish . As if my happiness were of so much more consequence than his . I 've made him so miserable , I 'm afraid ! " " Miss Sampson ! " cried Aunt Faith , with all her old oddity and suddenness , " just tell this girl , if you know , what kind of a commandment a woman breaks , if she ca n't make up her mind to marry the first man that asks her ! ' Tai n't in my Decalogue ! " " I ca n't tell what commandment she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pretty sure of her own mind before she does marry ! " said Miss Sampson , energetically . " Talk of making a man miserable ! Supposing you do for a little while ? ' Two n't last long . Right 's right , and settles itself . Wrong never does . And there is n't a greater wrong than to marry the wrong man . To him as well as to you . And it wo n't end there -- that 's the worst of it . There 's more concerned than just yourself and him ; though you may n't know how , or who . It 's an awful thing to tangle up and disarrange the plans of Providence . And more of it 's done , I verily believe , in this matter of marrying , than any other way . It 's like mismatching anything else -- gloves or stockings -- and wearing the wrong ones together . They do n't fit ; and more'n that , it spoils another pair . I believe , as true as I live , if the angels ever do cry over this miserable world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paired off , all right , out of heaven , getting mixed up and mismated as they do down here ! Why , it 's fairly enough to account for all the sin and misery there is in the world ! If it was n't for Adam and Eve and Cain , I should think it did ! " " But it 's very hard , " said Faith , smiling , despite all her saddening thoughts , at the characteristic harangue , " always to know wrong from right . People may make mistakes , if they mean ever so well . " " Yes , awful mistakes ! There 's that poor , unfortunate woman in the Bible . I never thought the Lord meant any reflection by what he said -- on her . She 'd had six husbands . And he knew she had n't got what she bargained for , after all . Most likely she never had , in the whole six . And if things had got into such a snarl as that eighteen hundred years ago , how many people , do you think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be right for anybody ? I 've thought it all over , many a time . I 've had reasons of my own , and I 've seen plenty of reasons as I 've gone about the world . And my conclusion is , that matrimony 's come to be more of a discipline , nowadays , than anything else ! " It was strange cheer ; and it came at a strange moment ; with the very birth of a new anxiety . But so our moments and their influences are mingled . Faith was roused , strengthened , confirmed in her own thought of right , beguiled out of herself , by the words of these two odd , plain-dealing women , as she would not have been if a score of half-comprehending friends had soothed her indirectly with inanities , and delicate half-handling of that which Aunt Faith and Nurse Sampson went straight to the heart of , and brought out , uncompromisingly , into the light . So much we can endure from a true earnestness and simplicity , rough and homely though it be , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface sympathy . She had a word that night from Robert Armstrong , when he came , late in the evening , from a conversation with Aunt Faith , and found her at the open door upon the stoop . It was only a hand grasp , and a fervent " God bless you , child ! You have been brave and true ! " and he passed on . But a balm and a quiet fell deep into her heart , and a tone , that was a joy , lingered in her ear , and comforted her as no other earthly comfort could . But this was not all earthly ; it lifted her toward heaven . It bore her toward the eternal solace there . Aunt Faith would have no scenes . She told the others , in turn , very much as she had told Faith , that a suffering and an uncertainty lay before her ; and then , by her next word and gesture , demanded that the life about her should go right on , taking as slightly as might be its coloring from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a wail . There was something for each to do . Miss Henderson , by Nurse Sampson 's advice , remained mostly in her bed . In fact , she had kept back the announcement of this ailment of hers , just so long as she could resist its obvious encroachment . The twisted ankle had been , for long , a convenient explanation of more than its own actual disability . But it was not a sick room -- one felt that -- this little limited bound in which her life was now visibly encircled . All the cheer of the house was brought into it . If people were sorry and fearful , it was elsewhere . Neither Aunt Faith nor the nurse would let anybody into " their hospital , " as Miss Sampson said , " unless they came with a bright look for a pass . " Every evening , the great Bible was opened there , and Mr. Armstrong read with them , and uttered for them words that lifted each heart , with its secret need and thankfulness , to heaven . All together , trustfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been called in . Quite surprised he was , at this new development . He " had thought there was something a little peculiar in her symptoms . " But he was one of those AEsculapian worthies who , having lived a scientifically uneventful life , plodding quietly along in his profession among people who had mostly been ill after very ordinary fashions , and who required only the administering of stereotyped remedies , according to the old stereotyped order and rule , had quite forgotten to think of the possibility of any unusual complications . If anybody were taken ill of a colic , and sent for him and told him so , for a colic he prescribed , according to outward indications . The subtle signs that to a keener or more practiced discernment , might have betokened more , he never thought of looking for . What then ? All can not be geniuses ; most men just learn a trade . It is only a Columbus who , by the drift along the shore of the fact or continent he stands on , predicates another , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from Mishaumok to consult . Mr. and Mrs. Gartney would be home , now , in a day or two , and Aunt Faith preferred to wait till then . Mis ' Battis opened the Cross Corners house , and Faith went over , daily , to direct the ordering of things there . " Faith ! " said Miss Henderson , on the Wednesday evening when they were to look confidently for the return of their travelers next day , " come here , child ! I have something to say to you . " Faith was sitting alone , there , with her aunt , in the twilight . " There 's one thing on my mind , that I ought to speak of , as things have turned out . When I thought , a few weeks ago , that you were provided for , as far as outside havings go , I made a will , one day . Look in that right-hand upper bureau drawer , and you 'll find a key , with a brown ribbon to it . That 'll unlock a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and take out the paper that lies on the top , and bring it to me . " Faith did all this , silently . " Yes , this is it , " said Miss Henderson , putting on her glasses , which were lying on the counterpane , and unfolding the single sheet , written out in her own round , upright , old-fashioned hand . " It 's an old woman 's whim ; but if you do n't like it , it sha n't stand . Nobody knows of it , and nobody 'll be disappointed . I had a longing to leave some kind of a happy life behind me , if I could , in the Old House . It 's only an earthly clinging and hankering , maybe ; but I 'd somehow like to feel sure , being the last of the line , that there 'd be time for my bones to crumble away comfortably into dust , before the old timbers should come down . I meant , once , you should have had it all ; but it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as if there was going to be other kind of work cut out for you to do . And I 'm persuaded there is yet , somewhere . So I 've done this ; and I want you to know it beforehand , in case anything goes wrong -- no , not that , but unexpectedly -- with me . " She reached out the paper , and Faith took it from her hand . It was not long in reading . A light shone out of Faith 's eyes , through the tears that sprang to them , as she finished it , and gave it back . " Aunt Faith ! " she said , earnestly . " It is beautiful ! I am so glad ! But , auntie ! You 'll get well , I know , and begin it yourself ! " " No , " said Miss Henderson , quietly . " I may get over this , and I do n't say I should n't be glad to . But I 'm an old tree , and the ax is lying , ground , somewhere , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks ca n't change their ways , and begin new plans and doings . I 'm only thankful that the Lord has sent me a thought that lightens all the dread I 've had for years about leaving the old place ; and that I can go , thinking maybe there 'll be His work doing in it as long as it stands . " " I do n't know , " she resumed , after a pause , " how your father 's affairs are now . The likelihood is , if he has any health , that he 'll go into some kind of a venture again before very long . But I shall have a talk with him , and if he is n't satisfied I 'll alter it so as to do something more for you . " " Something more ! " said Faith . " But you have done a great deal , as it is ! I did n't say so , because I was thinking so much of the other . " " It wo n't make an heiress of you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than nothing , if other means fall short . And I do n't feel , somehow , as if you need be a burden on my mind . There 's a kind of a certainty borne in on me , otherwise . I ca n't help thinking that what I 've done has been a leading . And if it has , it 's right . Now , put this back , and tell Miss Sampson she may bring my gruel . " CHAPTER XXXII . GLORY McWHIRK 'S INSPIRATION . " No bird am I to sing in June , And dare not ask an equal boon . Good nests and berries red are Nature 's To give away to better creatures ,  --  And yet my days go on , go on . " MRS . BROWNING . Mr. and Mrs. Gartney arrived on Thursday . Two weeks and three days they had been absent ; and in that time how the busy sprites of change and circumstance had been at work ! As if the scattered straws of events , that , stretched out in slender windrows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been raked together , and rolled over -- crowded close , and heaped , portentous , into these eighteen days ! Letters had told them something ; of the burned mill , and Faith 's fearful danger and escape ; of Aunt Henderson 's continued illness , and its present serious aspect ; and with this last intelligence , which met them in New York but two days since , Mrs. Gartney found her daughter 's agitated note of pained avowal , that she " had come , through all this , to know herself better , and to feel sure that this marriage ought not to be " ; that , in short , all was at length over between her and Paul Rushleigh . It was a meeting full of thought -- where much waited for speech that letters could neither have conveyed nor satisfied -- when Faith and her father and mother exchanged the kiss of love and welcome , once more , in the little home at Cross Corners . It was well that Mis ' Battis had made waffles , and spread a tempting summer tea with these and her nice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with such faint impatience as her huge calm was capable of , that " they would jest set right down , while things was good and hot " ; and that Hendie was full of his wonderful adventures by boat and train , and through the wilds ; so that these first hours were gotten over , and all a little used to the old feeling of being together again , before there was opportunity for touching upon deeper subjects . It came at length -- the long evening talk , after Hendie was in bed , and Mr. Gartney had been over to the old house , and seen his aunt , and had come back , to find wife and daughter sitting in the dim light beside the open door , drawn close in love and confidence , and so glad and thankful to have each other back once more ! First -- Aunt Faith ; and what was to be done -- what might be hoped -- what must be feared -- for her . Then , the terrible story of the fire ; and all about it , that could only be got at by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and over , and repetition , whereby we do the best -- the feeble best -- we can , to satisfy great askings and deep sympathies that never can be anyhow made palpable in words . And , last of all -- just with the good-night kiss -- Faith and her mother had had it all before , in the first minutes they were left alone together -- Mr . Gartney said to his daughter : " You are quite certain , now , Faith ? " " Quite certain , father " ; Faith answered , low , with downcast eyes , as she stood before him . Her father laid his hand upon her head . " You are a good girl ; and I do n't blame you ; yet I thought you would have been safe and happy , so . " " I am safe and happy here at home , " said Faith . " Home is in no hurry to spare you , my child . " And Faith felt taken back to daughterhood once more . Margaret Rushleigh had been to see her , before this . It was a painful visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the effort , on either side , to show that things , except in the one particular , were still unchanged . Faith felt how true it was that " nothing could go back , precisely , to what it was before . " There was another visit , a day or two after the reassembling of the family at Cross Corners . This was to say farewell . New plans had been made . It would take some time to restore the mills to working order , and Mr. Rushleigh had not quite resolved whether to sell them out as they were , or to retain the property . Mrs. Rushleigh wished Margaret to join her at Newport , whither the Saratoga party was to go within the coming week . Then there was talk of another trip to Europe . Margaret had never been abroad . It was very likely they would all go out in October . Paul 's name was never mentioned . Faith realized , painfully , how her little hand had been upon the motive power of much that was all ended , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mishaumok , and had held consultation with Dr. Wasgatt upon Miss Henderson 's case . It had been decided to postpone the surgical operation for two or three weeks . Meanwhile , she was simply to be kept comfortable and cheerful , strengthened with fresh air , and nourishing food , and some slight tonics . Faith was at the old house , constantly . Her aunt craved her presence , and drew her more and more to herself . The strong love , kept down by a stiff , unbending manner , so , for years -- resisting almost its own growth -- would no longer be denied or concealed . Faith Gartney had nestled herself into the very core of this true , upright heart , unpersuadable by anything but clear judgment and inflexible conscience . " I had a beautiful dream last night , Miss Faith , " said Glory , one morning , when Faith came over and found the busy handmaiden with her churn upon the doorstone , " about Miss Henderson . I thought she was all well , and strong , and she looked so young , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a May Day . And we had it out here in the field . And everybody had a crown ; and everybody was queen . And the little children danced round the old apple tree , and climbed up , and rode horseback in the branches . And Miss Henderson was out there , dressed in white , and looking on . It do n't seem so -- just to say it ; but I could n't tell you how beautiful it was ! " " Dreams are strange things , " said Faith , thoughtfully . " It seems as if they were sent to us , sometimes -- as if we really had a sort of life in them . " " Do n't they ? " cried Glory , eagerly . " Why , Miss Faith , I 've dreamed on , and on , sometimes , a whole story out ! And , after all , we 're asleep almost as much as we 're awake . Why is n't it just as real ? " " I had a dream that night of the fire , Glory . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the sofa . And it seemed as if I were on the top of a high , steep cliff , with no way to get down . And all at once , there was fire behind me -- a burning mountain ! And it came nearer , and nearer , till it scorched my very feet ; and there was no way down . And then -- it was so strange !  - -  I knew Mr. Armstrong was coming . And two hands took me -- just as his did , afterwards -- and I felt so safe ! And then I woke , and it all happened . When he came , I felt as if I had called him . " The dasher of the churn was still , and Glory stood , breathless , in a white excitement , gazing into Faith 's eyes . " And so you did , Miss Faith ! Somehow -- through the dreamland -- you certainly did ! " Faith went in to her aunt , and Glory churned and pondered . Were these two to go on , dreaming , and calling to each other " through the dreamland , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speak out ? This thought , in vague shape , turned itself , restlessly , in Glory 's brain . Other brains revolved a like thought , also . " Somebody talked about a ' ripe pear , ' once . I wonder if that one is n't ever going to fall ! " Nurse Sampson wondered thus , as she settled Miss Henderson in her armchair before the window , and they saw Roger Armstrong and Faith Gartney walk up the field together in the sunset light . " I suppose it would n't take much of a jog to do it . But , maybe , it 's as well to leave it to the Lord 's sunshine . He 'll ripen it , if He sees fit . " " It 's a pretty picture , anyhow . There 's the new moon exactly over their right shoulders , if they 'd only turn their heads to look at it . I do n't think much of signs ; but , somehow , I always do like to have that one come right ! " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , or not , " replied Aunt Faith . Glory sat on the flat doorstone . She had the invariable afternoon knitting work in her hand ; but hand and work had fallen to her lap , and her eyes were away upon the glittering , faint crescent of the moon , that pierced the golden mist of sunset . Close by , the evening star had filled his chalice of silver splendor . " The star and the moon only see each other . I can see both . It is better . " She had come to the feeling of Roger Armstrong 's sermon . To receive consciously , as she had through her whole , life intuitively and unwittingly , all beauty of all being about her into the secret beauty of her own . She could be glad with the gladness of the whole world . The two came up , and Glory rose , and stood aside . " You have had thoughts , to-night , Glory , " said the minister . " Where have they been ? " " Away , there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They turned , and followed her gesture ; and from up there , at their right , beyond , came down the traditional promise of the beautiful young moon . Glory had shown it them . " And I 've been thinking , besides , " said Glory , " about that dream of yours , Miss Faith . I 've thought of it all day . Please tell it to Mr. Armstrong ? " And Glory disappeared down the long passage to the kitchen , and left them standing there , together . She went straight to the tin baker before the fire , and lifted the cover , to see if her biscuits were ready for tea . Then she seated herself upon a little bench that stood against the chimney-side , and leaned her head against the bricks , and looked down into the glowing coals . " It was put into my head to do it ! " she said , breathlessly , to herself . " I hope it was n't ridiculous ! " So she sat , and gazed on , into the coals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new moon and the bright star above them in the saffron depths . They stood alone , except for each other , in this still , radiant beauty of all things . Miss Henderson 's window was around a projection of the rambling , irregular structure , which made the angle wherein the pleasant old doorstone lay . " May I have your dream , Miss Faith ? " She need not be afraid to tell a simple dream . Any more , at this moment , than when she told it to Glory , that morning , on that very spot . Why did she feel , that if she should speak a syllable of it now , the truth that lay behind it would look out , resistless , through its veil ? That she could not so keep down its spirit-meaning , that it should not flash , electric , from her soul to his ? " It was only -- that night , " she said , tremulously . " It seemed very strange . Before the fire , I had the dream . It was a dream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I held out my hands -- and I found you there -- and you saved me . Oh , Mr. Armstrong ! As you did save me , afterwards ! " Roger Armstrong turned , and faced her . His deep , earnest eyes , lit with a new , strange radiance , smote upon hers , and held them spellbound with their glance . " I , too , dreamed that night , " said he , " of an unknown peril to you . You beckoned me . I sprang from out that dream , and rushed into the night -- until I found you ! " Their two souls met , in that brief recital , and knew that they had met before . That , through the dreamland , there had been that call and answer . Faith neither spoke , nor stirred , nor trembled . This supreme moment of her life held her unmoved in its own mightiness . Roger Armstrong held out both his hands . " Faith ! In the sight of God , I believe you belong to me ! " At that solemn word , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faith stretched her hands in answer , and laid them into his , and bowed her head above them . " In the sight of God , I belong to you ! " So she gave herself . So she was taken . As God 's gift , to the heart that had been earthly desolate so long . There was no dread , no shrinking , in that moment . A perfect love cast out all fear . And the new moon and the evening star shone down together in an absolute peace . CHAPTER XXXIII . LAST HOURS . " In this dim world of clouding cares We rarely know , till ' wildered eyes See white wings lessening up the skies , The angels with us unawares . . . . . . " Strange glory streams through life 's wild rents , And through the open door of death We see the heaven that beckoneth To the beloved going hence . " GERALD MASSEY . " Read me the twenty-third Psalm , " said Miss Henderson . It was the evening before the day fixed upon by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submit to . Faith was in her place by the bedside , her hand resting in that of her aunt . Mr. Armstrong sat near -- an open Bible before him . Miss Sampson had gone down the field for a " snatch of air . " Clear upon the stillness fell the sacred words of cheer . There was a strong , sure gladness in the tone that uttered them , that told they were born anew , in the breathing , from a heart that had proved the goodness and mercy of the Lord . In a solemn gladness , also , two other hearts received them , and said , silently , Amen ! " Now the fourteenth of St. John . " " ' In my father 's house are many mansions . ' ' I will dwell in the house of the Lord , forever . ' Yes . It holds us all . Under one roof . One family -- whatever happens ! Now , put away the book , and come here ; you two ! " It was done ; and Roger Armstrong and Faith Gartney stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't said so before , because I would n't set people troubling beforehand . But in my own mind , I 'm pretty sure of what 's coming . And if I had n't felt so all along , I should now . When the Lord gives us our last earthly wish , and the kind of peace comes over that seems as if it could n't be disturbed by anything , any more , we may know , by the hush of it , that the day is done . I 'm going to bid you good night , Faith , and send you home . Say your prayers , and thank God , for yourself and for me . Whatever you hear of me , to-morrow , take it for good news ; for it will be good . Roger Armstrong ! Take care of the child ! Child ! love your husband ; and trust in him ; for you may ! " Close , close -- bent Faith above her aunt , and gave and took that solemn good-night kiss . " ' The grace of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the communion of the Holy Ghost , be with us all . Amen ! ' " With the word of benediction , Roger Armstrong turned from the bedside , and led Faith away . And the deeper shadows of night fell , and infolded the Old House , and the hours wore on , and all was still . Stillest , calmest of all , in the soul of her who had dwelt there for nearly threescore years and ten , and who knew , none the less , that it would be surely home to her wheresoever her place might be given her next , in that wide and beautiful " House of the Lord ! " It was a strange day that succeeded ; when they sat , waiting so , through those morning hours , keeping such Sabbath as heart and life do keep , and are keeping , somewhere , always , in whatever busy workday of the world , when great issues come to solemnize the time . Almost as still at the Old House as at Cross Corners . No hurry . No bustle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all direction of the nurse . Mr. Armstrong in his own room , in readiness always , for any act or errand that might be required of him . Henderson Gartney alone in that ancient parlor at the front . The three physicians and Miss Sampson shut with Aunt Faith into her room . A faint , breathless odor of ether creeping everywhere , even out into the summer air . It was eleven o'clock , when a word was spoken to Roger Armstrong , and he took his hat and walked across the field . Faith , with pale , asking face , met him at the door . " Well -- thus far , " was the message ; and a kiss fell upon the uplifted forehead , and a look of boundless love and sympathy into the fair , anxious eyes . " All has been done ; and she is comfortable . There may still be danger ; but the worst is past . " Then a brazen veil fell from before the face of day . The sunshine looked golden again , and the song of birds rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be broken . They could speak common words , once more . Faith and her mother sat there , in the hillside parlor , talking thankfully , and happily , with Roger Armstrong . So a half hour passed by . Mr. Gartney would come , with further tidings , when he had been able to speak with the physicians . The shadows of shrub and tree crept and shortened to the lines of noon , and still , no word . They began to wonder , why . Mr. Armstrong would go back . He might be wanted , somehow . They should hear again , immediately , unless he were detained . He was not detained . They watched him up the field , and into the angle of the doorway . He was hidden there a moment , but not more . Then they saw him turn , as one lingering and reluctant , and retrace his steps toward them . " Faith ! Stay here , darling ! Let me meet him first , " said Mrs. Gartney . Faith shrank back , fearful of she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A sudden , panic dread and terror seized her . She felt her hearing sharpened , strained , involuntarily . She should catch that first word , however it might be spoken . She dared not hear it , yet . Out at the hillside door , into the shade of the deep evergreens , she passed , with a quick impulse . Thither Roger Armstrong followed , presently , and found her . With the keen instinct of a loving sympathy , he knew she fled from speech . So he put his arm about her , silently , tenderly ; and led her on , and up , under the close , cool shade , the way their steps had come to know so well . " Take it for good news , darling . For it is good , " he said , at last , when he had placed her in the rocky seat , where she had listened to so many treasured words -- to that old , holy confidence -- of his . And there he comforted her . * * * * * A sudden sinking -- a prostration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendants ; and , almost with their notice of the change , the last , pale , gray shadow had swept up over the calm , patient face , and good Aunt Faith had passed away . Away -- for a little . Not out of God 's house . Not lost out of His household . * * * * * This was her will . " I , Faith Henderson , spinster , in sound mind , and of my own will , direct these things . " That to my dear grandniece , Faith Henderson Gartney , be given from me , as my bequest , that portion of my worldly property now invested in two stores in D --  --  Street , in the city of Mishaumok . That this property and interest be hers , for her own use and disposal , with my love . " Also , that my plate , and my box of best house linen , which stands beside the press in the northwest chamber , be given to her , Faith Henderson Gartney ; and that my nephew , Henderson Gartney , shall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispose of any books , or articles of old family value and interest . But that beds , bedding , and all heavy household furniture , with a proper number of chairs and other movables , be retained in the house , for its necessary and suitable furnishing . " And then , that all this residue of personal effects , and my real estate in the Old Homestead at Kinnicutt Cross Corners , and my shares in the Kinnicutt Bank , be placed in the hands of my nephew , Henderson Gartney , to be held in trust during the natural life of my worthy and beloved handmaiden , Gloriana McWhirk ; for her to occupy said house , and use said furniture , and the income of said property , so long as she can find at least four orphan children to maintain therewith , and ' make a good time for , every day .

" And if there be any failure of a legal binding in this paper that I write , I charge it upon my nephew , Henderson Gartney , on his conscience , as I believe him to be a true and honest man , to see that these my effects are so disposed of , according to my plain will and intention . " ( Signed ) FAITH HENDERSON . " ( Witnessed ) ROGER ARMSTRONG , HIRAM WASGATT , LUTHER GOODELL . " CHAPTER XXXIV . MRS . PARLEY GIMP . " The best laid schemes o ' mice an ' men Gang aft agley . " BURNS . Kinnicott had got an enormous deal to talk about . The excitement of the great fire , and the curiosity and astonishment concerning Miss Gartney 's share in the events of that memorable night had hardly passed into the quietude of things discussed to death and laid away , unwillingly , in their graves , when all this that had happened at Cross Corners poured itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . Not all , quite , at once , however . Faith 's engagement was not , at first , spoken of publicly . There was no need , in this moment of their common sorrow , to give their names to the little world about them , for such handling as it might please . Yet the little world found plenty to say , and a great many plans to make for them , none the less . Miss Henderson 's so long unsuspected , and apparently brief illness , her sudden death , and the very singular will whose provisions had somehow leaked out , as matters of the sort always do , made a stir and ferment in the place , and everybody felt bound to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion which should account for all , and to get a clear idea of what everybody immediately concerned would do , or ought , in the circumstances , to do next , before they -- the first everybodies -- could eat and sleep , and go comfortably about their own business again , in the ordinary way . They should think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a very hard matter , most likely , to set it aside . All that farm , and the Old Homestead , and her money in the bank , going to that Glory McWhirk ! Why , it was just ridiculous . The old lady must have been losing her faculties . One thing was certain , anyway . The minister was out of a boarding place again . So that question came up , in all its intricate bearings , once more . This time Mrs. Gimp struck , while , as she thought , the iron was hot . Mr. Parley Gimp met Mr. Armstrong , one morning , in the village street , and waylaid him to say that " his good lady thought she could make room for him in their family , if it was so that he should be looking out for a place to stay at . " Mr. Armstrong thanked him ; but , for the present , he was to remain at Cross Corners . " At the Old House ? " " No , sir . At Mr. Gartney 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Parley Gimp called , one day , a week or two later , when the minister was out . A visit of sympathetic scrutiny . " Yes , it was a great loss , certainly . But then , at her age , you know , ma'am ! We must all expect these things . It was awfully sudden , to be sure . Must have been a terrible shock . Was her mind quite clear at the last , ma'am ? " " Perfectly . Clear , and calm , and happy , through it all . " " That 's very pleasant to think of now , I 'm sure . But I hear she 's made a very extraordinary arrangement about the property . You ca n't tell , though , to be sure , about all you hear , nowadays . " " No , Mrs. Gimp . That is very true , " said Mrs. Gartney . " Everybody always expected that it would all come to you . At least , to your daughter . She seemed to make so much of her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her . " " Well , I must say !  - -  and so Mr. Armstrong is to board here , now ? A little out of the way of most of the parish , is n't it ? I never could see , exactly , what put it into his head to come so far . Not but what he makes out to do his duty as a pastor , pretty prompt , too . I do n't hear any complaints . He 's rather off and on about settling , though . I guess he 's a man that keeps his intentions pretty close to himself -- and all his affairs , for that matter . Of course he 's a perfect right to . But I will say I like to know all about folks from the beginning . It aggravates me to have to begin in the middle . I tell Serena , it 's just like reading a book when the first volume 's lost . I do n't suppose I 'm much more curious than other people ; but I should like to know just how old he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mother were ; and where he came from in the first place , and what he lives on , for ' tai n't our salary , I know that ; he 's given away more'n half of it a'ready -- right here in the village . I 've said to my husband , forty times , if I 've said it once , ' I declare , I 've a great mind to ask him myself , straight out , just to see what he 'll say . ' " " And why not ? " asked a voice , pleasantly , behind her . Mr. Armstrong had come in , unheard by the lady in her own rush of words , and had approached too near , as this suddenly ceased , to be able to escape again unnoticed . Mis ' Battis told Luther Goodell afterwards , that she " jest looked in from the next room , at that , and if ever a woman felt cheap -- all over -- and as if she had n't a right to her own toes and fingers , and as if every thread and stitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gimp , that minit ! " " Has Faith returned ? " Mr. Armstrong asked , of Mrs. Gartney , after a little pause in which Mrs. Gimp showed no disposition to develop into deed her forty-times declared " great mind . " " I think not . She said she would remain an hour or two with Glory , and help her to arrange those matters she came in , this morning , to ask us about . " " I will walk over . " And the minister took his hat again , and with a bow to the two ladies , passed out , and across the lane . " Faith ! " ejaculated the village matron , her courage and her mind to meddle returning . " Well , that 's intimate ! " It might as well be done now , as at any time . Mr. Armstrong , himself , had heedlessly precipitated the occasion . It had only been , among them , a question of how and when . There was nothing to conceal . " Yes , " replied Mrs. Gartney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Did she go out the door , ma'am ? Or has she melted down into the carpet ? ' Cause , I have heerd of people sinkin ' right through the floor , " said Mis ' Battis , who " jest looked in " a second time , as the bewildered visitor receded. * * * * * The pleasant autumn months , mellowing and brightening all things , seemed also to soften and gild their memories of the life that had ended , ripely and beautifully , among them . Glory , after the first overwhelm of astonishment at what had befallen her -- made fully to understand that which she had a right , and was in duty bound to do -- entered upon the preparations for her work with the same unaffected readiness with which she would have done the bidding of her living mistress . It was so evident that her true humbleness was untouched by all . " It 's beautiful ! " and the tears and smiles would come together as she said it . " But then , Miss Faith -- Mr . Armstrong ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Faith and Mr. Armstrong did help with heart and hand , and every word of counsel that she needed . " I must buy some cotton and calico , and make some little clothes and tyers . Had n't I better ? When they come , I 'll have them to take care of . " And with the loving anticipation of a mother , she made up , and laid away , Faith helping her in all , her store of small apparel for little ones that were to come . She had gone down , one day , to Mishaumok , and found out Bridget Foye , at the old number in High Street . And to her she had intrusted the care of looking up the children -- to be not less than five , and not more than eight or nine years of age -- who should be taken to live with her at " Miss Henderson 's home , " and " have a good time every day . " " I must get them here before Christmas , " said Glory to her friends . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimney , and put sugarplums and picture books in ! " She was going back eagerly into her child life -- rather into the life her childhood wist of , but missed -- and would live it all over , now , with these little ones , taken already , before even they were seen or found , out of their strangerhood into her great , kindly heart ! A plain , capable , motherly woman had been obtained , by Mr. Armstrong 's efforts and inquiry , who would live with Glory as companion and assistant . There was the dairy work to be carried on , still . This , and the hay crops , made the principal income of the Old Farm . A few fields were rented for cultivation . " Just think , " cried Glory when the future management of these matters was talked of , " what it will be to see the little things let out a-rolling in the new hay ! " Her thoughts passed so entirely over herself , as holder and arbiter of means , to the good -- the daily little joy -- that was to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and calculated , they told her that she might safely venture to receive , in the end , six children . But that , for the present , four would perhaps be as many as it would be wise for her to undertake . " You know best , " she said , " and I shall do whatever you say . But I do n't feel afraid -- any more , that is , for taking six than four . I shall just do for them all the time , whether or no . " " And what if they are bad and troublesome , Glory ? " " Oh , they wo n't be , " she replied . " I shall love them so ! " CHAPTER XXXV . INDIAN SUMMER . " ' T is as if the benignant Heaven Had a new revelation given , And written it out with gems ; For the golden tops of the elms And the burnished bronze of the ash And the scarlet lights that flash From the sumach 's points of flame , Like blazonings on a scroll Spell forth an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is of no use to dispute about the Indian summer . I never found two people who could agree as to the time when it ought to be here , or upon a month and day when it should be decidedly too late to look for it . It keeps coming . After the equinoctial , which begins to be talked about with the first rains of September , and is n't done with till the sun has measured half a dozen degrees of south declination , all the pleasant weather is Indian summer -- away on to Christmastide . For my part , I think we get it now and then , little by little , as " the kingdom " comes . That every soft , warm , mellow , hazy , golden day , like each fair , fragrant life , is a part and outcrop of it ; though weeks of gale and frost , or ages of cruel worldliness and miserable sin may lie between . It was an Indian summer day , then ; and it was in October . Faith and Mr. Armstrong walked over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " little chapel , " as Faith had called it , since the time , last winter , when she and Glory had met the minister there , in the still , wonderful , pure beauty that enshrined it on that " diamond morning . " The elms that stood then , in their icy sheen , about the meadows , like great cataracts of light , were soft with amber drapery , now ; translucent in each leaf with the detained sunshine of the summer ; and along the borders of the wood walk , scarlet flames of sumach sprang out , vivid , from among the lingering green ; and birches trembled with their golden plumes ; and bronzed ash boughs , and deep crimsons and maroons and chocolate browns and carbuncle red that crowned the oaks with richer and intenser hues , made up a wealth and massiveness of beauty wherein eye and thought reveled and were sated . Over and about all , the glorious October light , and the dreamy warmth that was like a palpable love . They stood on the crisp moss carpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , with its cherubim that waved illumined wings of tenderer radiance now -- and gazed over the broad outspread of marvelous color ; and thought of the summer that had come and gone since they had stood there , last , together , and of the beauty that had breathed alike on earth and into life , for them . " Faith , darling ! Tell me your thought , " said Roger Armstrong . " This was my thought , " Faith answered , slowly . " That first sermon you preached to us -- that gave me such a hope , then -- that comes up to me so , almost as a warning , now ! The poor -- that were to have the kingdom ! And then , those other words -- 'how hardly shall they who have riches enter in ! ' And I am so rich ! It frightens me . " " Entire happiness does make one tremble . Only , if we feel God in it , and stand but the more ready for His work , we may be safe . " " His work -- yes , " Faith answered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if , somehow , I were not worthy of a hard life . As if all things had been made too easy for me . And I had thought , so , of some great and difficult thing to do . " Then Faith told him of the oracle that , years ago , had first wakened her to the thought of what life might be ; of the " high and holy work " that she had dreamed of , and of her struggles to fulfill it , feebly , in the only ways that as yet had opened for her . " And now -- just to receive all -- love , and help , and care -- and to rest , and to be so wholly happy ! " " Believe , darling , that we are led , through all . That the oil of joy is but as an anointing for a nobler work . It is only so I dare to think of it . We shall have plenty to do , Faithie ! And , perhaps , to bear . It will all be set before us , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , any more . That is what makes me almost feel unworthy . Look at Nurse Sampson . Look at Glory . They have only their work , and the love of God to help them in it . And I --  ! Oh , I am not poor any longer . The words do n't seem to be for me . " " Let us take them with their double edge of truth , then . Holding ourselves always poor , in sight of the infinite spiritual riches of the kingdom . Blessed are the poor , who can feel , even in the keenest earthly joy , how there is a fullness of life laid up in Him who gives it , of whose depth the best gladness here is but a glimpse and foretaste ! We will not be selfishly or unworthily content , God helping us , my little one ! " " It is so hard not to be content ! " whispered Faith , as the strong , manly arm held her , in its shelter , close beside the noble , earnest heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards , as they walked down over the fragrant pathway of fallen pine leaves , " that I have never known an instance of one more evidently called , commissioned , and prepared for a good work in the world , than Glory . Her whole life has been her education for it . It is not without a purpose , when a soul like hers is left to struggle up through such externals of circumstance . We can love and help her in it , Faith ; and do something , in our way , for her , as she will do , in hers , for others . " " Oh , yes ! " assented Faith , impulsively . " I have wished --  " but there she stopped . " Am I to hear no more ? " asked Mr. Armstrong , presently . " Have I not a right to insist upon the wish ? " " I forgot what I was coming to , " said Faith , blushing deeply . " I spoke of it , one day , to mother . And she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now . That some one else would be concerned , as well as I. " " And some one else will be sure to wish as you do . Only there may be a wisdom in waiting . Faithie -- I have never told you yet -- will you be frightened if I tell you now -- that I am not a poor man , as the world counts poverty ? My friend , of whom you know , in those terrible days of the commencing pestilence , having only his daughter and myself to care for , made his will ; in provision against whatever might befall them there . By that will -- through the fearful sorrow that made it effective -- I came into possession of a large property . Your little inheritance , Faithie , goes into your own little purse for private expenditures or charities . But for the present , as it seems to me , Glory has ample means for all that it is well for her to undertake . By and by , as she gains in years and in experience , you will have it in your power to enlarge her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may grow into a wider benefit than even she , herself , foresaw . " Faith was not frightened . These were not the riches that could make her tremble with a dread lest earth should too fully satisfy . This was only a promise of new power to work with ; a guarantee that God was not leaving her merely to care for and to rest in a good that must needs be all her own . " We shall find plenty to do , Faithie ! " Mr. Armstrong repeated ; and he held her hand in his with a strong pressure that told how the thought of that work to come , and her sweet and entire association in it , leaped along his pulses with a living joy . Faith caught it ; and all fear was gone . She could not shrink from the great blessedness that was laid upon her , any more than Nature could refuse to wear her coronation robes , that trailed their radiance in this path they trod . Life held them in a divine harmony . The October sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , that transfigured earth about them ; all tints -- all redolence -- all broad beatitude of globe and sky -- were none too much to breathe out and make palpable the glad and holy auspice of the hour . * * * * * Mr. Gartney had gradually relinquished his half-formed thought of San Francisco . Already the unsettled and threatening condition of affairs in the country had begun to make men feel that the time was not one for new schemes or adventurous changes . Somehow , the great wheels , mercantile and political , had slipped out of their old grooves , and went laboring , as it were , roughly and at random , with fierce clattering and jolting , quite off the ordinary track ; so that none could say whether they should finally regain it , and roll smoothly forward , as in the prosperous and peaceful days of the past , or should bear suddenly and irretrievably down to some horrible , unknown crash and ruin . Henderson Gartney , however , was too restless a man to wait , with entire passiveness , the possible turn and issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great a part of his burden and anxiety lifted from him in the marriages , actual and prospective , of his two daughters -- and his means augmented by the sale of a portion of his Western property which he had effected during his summer visit thereto -- it was little to be looked for that he should consent to vegetate , idly and quietly , through a second winter at Cross Corners . The first feeling of some men , apparently , when they have succeeded in shuffling off a load of difficulty , is a sensation of the delightful ease with which they can immediately shoulder another . As when one has just cleared a desk or drawer of rubbish , there is such a tempting opportunity made for beginning to stow away and accumulate again . Well ! the principle is an eternal one . Nature does abhor a vacuum . The greater portion of the ensuing months , therefore , Mr. Gartney spent in New York ; whither his wife and children accompanied him , also , for a stay of a few weeks ; during which , Faith and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and set in train of preparation certain matters beyond the range of Kinnicutt capacity and resource . Mr. Armstrong , too , was obliged to be absent from his parish for a little time . Affairs of his own required some personal attention . He chose these weeks while the others , also , were away . It was decided that the marriage should take place in the coming spring ; and that then the house at Cross Corners should become the home of Mr. Armstrong and Faith ; and that Mr. Gartney should remove , permanently , to New York , where he had already engaged in some incidental and preliminary business transactions . His purpose was to fix himself there , as a shipping and commission merchant , concerning himself , for a large proportion , with California trade . The house in Mishaumok had been rented for a term of five years . One change prepares the way for another . Things never go back precisely to what they were before . Mr. Armstrong , after serious thought , had come to this conclusion of accepting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as its pastor , because the place itself had become endeared to him for its associations ; because , also , it was Faith 's home , which she had learned to love and cling to ; because she , too , had a work here , in assisting Glory to fulfill the terms of her aunt 's bequest ; and because , country parish though it was , and a limited sphere , as it might seem , for his means and talents , he saw the way here , not only to accomplish much direct good in the way of his profession , but as well for a wider exercise of power through the channel of authorship ; for which a more onerous pastoral charge would not have left him the needful quiet or leisure . So , with these comings and goings , these happy plans , and helpings and onlookings , the late autumn weeks merged in winter , and days slipped almost imperceptibly by , and Christmas came . Three little orphan girls had been welcomed into " Miss Henderson 's Home . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Glory gave the other two an extra kiss each , every morning . CHAPTER XXXVI . CHRISTMASTIDE . " Through suffering and through sorrow thou hast past , To show us what a woman true may be ; They have not taken sympathy from thee , Nor made thee any other than thou wast ; . . . . . " Nor hath thy knowledge of adversity Robbed thee of any faith in happiness , But rather cleared thine inner eye to see How many simple ways there are to bless . " LOWELL . " And if any painter drew her , He would paint her unaware , With a halo round the hair . " MRS . BROWNING . There were dark portents abroad . Rumors , and threats , and prognostications of fear and strife teemed in the columns of each day 's sheet of news , and pulsed wildly along the electric nerves of the land ; and men looked out , as into a coming tempest , that blackened all the southerly sky with wrath ; and only that the horror was too great to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunken , and bought and sold , and planted and builded , as they did , after the age-old manner of man , in these days before the flood that was to come . Civil war , like a vulture of hell , was swooping down from the foul fastness of iniquity that had hatched her in its high places , and that reared itself , audaciously , in the very face of Heaven . And a voice , as of a mighty angel , sounded " Woe ! woe ! woe ! to the inhabiters of earth ! " And still men but half heard and comprehended ; and still they slept and rose , and wrought on , each in his own work , and planned for the morrow , and for the days that were to be . And in the midst of all , came the blessed Christmastide ! Yes ! even into this world that has rolled its seething burden of sin and pain and shame and conflict along the listening depths through waiting cycles of God 's eternity , was Christ once born ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their simple faith and holy unconsciousness , were looking for the Christmas good , and wondering only what the coming joy should be . The shops and streets of Mishaumok were filled with busy throngs . People forgot , for a day , the fissure that had just opened , away there in the far Southland , and the fierce flames that shot up , threatening , from the abyss . What mattered the mass meetings , and the shouts , and the guns , along those shores of the Mexican Gulf ? To-night would be Christmas Eve ; and there were thousands of little stockings waiting to be hung by happy firesides , and they must all be filled for the morrow . So the shops and streets were crowded , and people with arms full of holiday parcels jostled each other at every corner . There are odd encounters in this world tumble that we live in . In the early afternoon , at one of the bright show cases , filled within and heaped without with toys , two women met -- as strangers are always meeting , with involuntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant , never to approach again , perhaps , in all the coming combinations of time . These two women , though , had met before . One , sharp , eager -- with a stylish-shabby air of dress about her , and the look of pretense that shopmen know , as she handled and asked prices , where she had no actual thought of buying -- holding by the hand a child of six , who dragged and teased , and got an occasional word that crushed him into momentary silence , but who , tired with the sights and the Christmas shopping , had nothing for it but to begin to drag and tease again ; another , with bright , happy , earnest eyes and flushing cheeks , and hair rolled back in a golden wealth beneath her plain straw bonnet ; bonnet , and dress , and all , of simple black ; these two came face to face . The shabby woman with a sharp look recognized nothing . Glory McWhirk knew Mrs. Grubbling , and the child of six that had been the Grubbling baby . All at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not a moment had gone by since she held him so in the little , dark , upper entry in Budd Street , where he had toddled to her in his nightgown , for her grieved farewell , was hugging and kissing him , with the old , forgetting and forgiving love . Mrs. Grubbling looked on in petrified amaze . Glory had transferred a fragrant white paper parcel from her pocket to the child 's hands , and had thrust upon that a gay tin horse from the counter , before it occurred to her that the mother might , possibly , neither remember nor approve . " I beg your pardon , ma'am , for the liberty ; and it 's very likely you do n't know me . I 'm Glory McWhirk , that used to live with you , and mind the baby . " " I 'm sure I 'm glad to see you , Glory , " said Mrs. Grubbling patronizingly ; " and I hope you 've been doing well since you went away from me . " As if she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a doubt as to whether going farther had not been faring worse . I have no question that Mrs. Grubbling fancied , at the moment , that the foundation of all the simple content and quiet prosperity that evidenced themselves at present in the person of her former handmaid , had been laid in Budd Street . " And where are you living now ? " proceeded she , as Glory resigned the boy to his mint stick , and was saying good-by . " Out in Kinnicutt , ma'am ; at Miss Henderson 's , where I have been ever since . " She never thought of triumphing . She never dreamed of what it would be to electrify her former mistress with the announcement that she whom she had since served had died , and left her , Glory McWhirk , the life use of more than half her estate . That she dwelt now , as proprietress , where she had been a servant . Her humbleness and her faithfulness were so entire that she never thought of herself as occupying , in the eyes of others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still ; doing her behest , simply , as if she had but left her there in keeping , while she went a journey . So she bade good-by , and courtesied to Mrs. Grubbling and gathered up her little parcels , and went out . Fortunately , Mrs. Grubbling was half stunned , as it was . It is impossible to tell what might have resulted , had she then and there been made cognizant of more . Not to the shorn lamb , alone , always , are sharp winds beneficently tempered . There is a mercy , also , to the miserable wolf . Glory had one trouble , to-day , that hindered her pure , free and utter enjoyment of what she had to do . All day she had seen , here and there along the street , little forlorn and ragged ones , straying about aimlessly , as if by any chance , a scrap of Christmas cheer might even fall to them , if only they kept out in the midst of it . There was a distant wonder in their faces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced at the fair , fresh burdens they carried ; and around the confectioners ' windows they would cluster , sometimes , two or three together , and look ; as if one sense could take in what was denied so to another . She knew so well what the feeling of it was ! To see the good times going on , and not be in ' em ! She longed so to gather them all to herself , and take them home , and make a Christmas for them ! She could only drop the pennies that came to her in change loose into her pocket , and give them , one by one , along the wayside . And she more than once offered a bright quarter ( it was in the days when quarters yet were , reader ! ) , when she might have counted out the sum in lesser bits , that so the pocket should be kept supplied the longer . * * * * * Down by the  - -   - -   Railway Station , the streets were dim , and dirty , and cheerless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red coals gleamed cheerful in the already gathering dusk of the winter afternoon . A New York train was going out ; and all sorts of people -- from the well-to-do , portly gentleman of business , with his good coat buttoned comfortably to his chin , his tickets bought , his wallet lined with bank notes for his journey , and secretly stowed beyond the reach ( if there be such a thing ) of pickpockets , and the Mishaumok Journal , Evening Edition , damp from the press , unfolded in his fingers , to the care-for-naught , dare-devil little newsboy who had sold it to him , and who now saunters off , varying his monotonous cry with : " Jour-nal , gentlemen ! Eve-nin ' ' dition ! Georgy out ! " ( " What 's that ? " exclaims an inconsiderate . ) " Georgy out ! ( Little brother o ' mine . Seen him anywhere ? ) Eve-nin ' ' dition ! Jour-nal , gentleman ! " and the shivering little candy girl , threading her way with a silent imploringness among the throng -- were bustling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the platforms , till one would think , assuredly , that the center of all the world 's activity , at this moment , lay here ; and that everybody not going in this particular express train to New York , must be utterly devoid of any aim or object in life , whatever . So we do , always , carry our center about with us . A little while ago all the world was buying dolls and tin horses . Horizons shift and ring themselves about us , and we , ourselves , stand always in the middle . By and by , however , the last call was heard . " Passengers for New York ! Train ready ! All aboard ! " And with the ringing of the bell , and the mighty gasping of the impatient engine , and a scuffle and scurry of a minute , in which carpetbags and babies were gathered up and shouldered indiscriminately , the rooms and the platforms were suddenly cleared of all but a few stragglers , and half a dozen women with Christmas bundles , who sat waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , purple with the bitter cold , looked in at the door . " It 's good and warm in there . Less ' go ! " And the older drew the younger into the room , toward the glowing stove . They looked as if they had been wandering about in the dreary streets till the chill had touched their very bones . The larger of the two , a boy -- torn hopelessly as to his trousers , dilapidated to the last degree as to his fragment of a hat -- knees and elbows making their way out into the world with the faintest shadow of opposition -- had , perhaps from this , a certain look of pushing knowingness that set itself , by the obscure and inevitable law of compensation , over against the gigantic antagonism of things he found himself born into ; and you knew , as you looked at him , that he would , somehow , sooner or later , make his small dint against the great dead wall of society that loomed itself in his way ; whether society or he should get the worst of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girl . A flower thrown down in the dirt . A jewel encrusted with mean earth . Little feet in enormous coarse shoes , cracked and trodden down ; bare arms trying to hide themselves under a bit of old woolen shawl ; hair tangled beneath a squalid hood ; out from amidst all , a face of beauty that peeped , like an unconscious draft of God 's own signing , upon humanity . Was there none to acknowledge it ? An official came through the waiting room . The boy showed a slink in his eyes , like one used to shoving and rebuff , and to getting off , round corners . The girl stood , innocent and unheeding . " There ! out with you ! No vagrums here ! " Of course , they could n't have all Queer Street in their waiting rooms , these railway people ; and the man 's words were rougher than his voice . But these were two children , who wanted cherishing ! The slink in the boy 's eye worked down , and became a sneak and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following . " Stop ! " called a woman 's voice , sharp and authoritative . " Do n't you stir a single step , either of you , till you get warm ! If there is n't any other way to fix it , I 'll buy you both a ticket somewhere and then you 'll be passengers . " It was a tall , thin , hoopless woman , with a carpetbag , a plaid shawl , and an umbrella ; and a bonnet that , since other bonnets had begun to poke , looked like a chaise top flattened back at the first spring . In a word , Mehitable Sampson . Something twitched at the corners of the man 's mouth as he glanced round at this sudden and singular champion . Something may have twitched under his comfortable waistcoat , also . At any rate , he passed on ; and the children -- the brief battledore over in which they had been the shuttlecocks -- crept back , compliant with the second order , much amazed , toward the stove . Miss Sampson began to interrogate . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This one ai n't my sister . " Children always set people right before they answer queries . " Well -- whoever she is , then . Why do n't you both go home ? " " ' Cause it 's cold there , too . And we was sent to find sticks . " " If she is n't your sister , who does she belong to ? " " She do n't belong to nobody . She lived upstairs , and her mother died , and she came down to us . But she 's goin ' to be took away . Mother 's got five of us , now . She 's goin ' to the poorhouse . She 's a regular little brick , though ; ai n't yer , Jo ? " The pretty , childish lips that had begun to grow red and lifelike again , parted , and showed little rows of milk teeth , like white shells . The blue eyes and the baby smile went up , confidingly , to the young ragamuffin 's face . There had been kindness here . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was benevolently evincing it , in the best way he could , by teaching her good-natured slang . " Yes ; I 'm a little brick , " she lisped . Miss Sampson 's keen eyes went from one to the other , resting last and long on Jo . " I should n't wonder , " she said , deliberately , " if you was Number Four ! " " Whereabouts do you live ? " suddenly , to the boy . " Three doors round the corner . ' Tai n't number four , though . It 's ninety-three . " " What 's your name ? " " Tim Rafferty . " " Tim Rafferty ! Did anybody ever trust you with a carpetbag ? " " I 've carried ' em up . But then they mostly goes along , and looks sharp . " " Well , now I 'm going to leave you here , with this one . If anybody speaks to you , say you was left in charge . Do n't stir till I come back . And -- look here ! if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wavy hair , and a black gown and bonnet , and if she comes and speaks to you , as most likely she will , tell her I said I should n't wonder if this was Number Four ! " And Nurse Sampson went out into the street . When she came back , the children sat there , still ; and Glory McWhirk was with them . " I do n't know as I 'd any business to meddle ; and I have n't made any promises ; but I 've found out that you can do as you choose about it , and welcome . And I could n't help thinking you might like to have this one for Number Four . " Glory had already nestled the poor , tattered child close to her , and given her a cake to eat from the refreshment counter . Tim Rafferty delivered up the carpetbag , in proud integrity . To be sure , there were half a dozen people in the room who had witnessed its intrustment to his hands ; but I think he would have waited there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miss Sampson gave him ten cents , and recounted to Glory what she had learned at number ninety-three . " She 's a strange child , left on their hands ; and they 're as poor as death . They were going to give her in charge to the authorities . The woman said she could n't feed her another day . That 's about the whole of it . If Tim do n't bring her back , they 'll know where she is , and be thankful . " " Do you want to go home with me , and hang up your stocking , and have a Christmas ? " " My golly ! " ejaculated Tim , staring . The little one smiled shyly , and was mute . She did n't know what Christmas was . She had been cold , and she was warm , and her mouth and hands were filled with sweet cake . And there were pleasant words in her ears . That was all she knew . As much as we shall comprehend at first , perhaps , when the angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us the first morsel of heavenly good to stay our cravings . This was how it ended . Tim had a paper bag of apples and cakes , with some sugar pigs and pussy cats put in at the top , and a pair of warm stockings out of Glory 's bag , to carry home , for himself ; and he was to say that the lady who came to see his mother had taken Jo away into the country . To Miss Henderson 's , at Kinnicutt . Glory wrote these names upon a paper . Tim was to be a good boy , and some day they would come and see him again . Then Nurse Sampson 's plaid shawl was wrapped about little Jo , and pinned close over her rags to keep out the cold of Christmas Eve ; and the bell rang presently ; and she was taken out into the bright , warm car , and tucked up in a corner , where she slept all the hour that they were steaming over the road . And so these three went out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glory carried home the Christ gift that had come to her . Tim went back , alone , to number ninety-three . He had his bag of good things , and his warm stockings , and his wonderful story to tell . And there was more supper and breakfast for five than there would have been for six . Nevertheless , somehow , he missed the " little brick . " Out at Cross Corners , Miss Henderson 's Home was all aglow . The long kitchen , which , by the outgrowth of the house for generations , had come to be a central room , was flooded with the clear blaze of a great pine knot , that crackled in the chimney ; and open doors showed neat adjoining rooms , in and out which the gleams and shadows played , making a suggestive pantomime of hide and seek . It was a grand old place for Christmas games ! And three little bright-faced girls sat round the knee of a tidy , cheery old woman , who told them , in a quaint Irish brogue , the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught by the fox , and got away , again , safe , to her own little house in the woods , where she " lived happy iver afther , an ' got a fine little brood of chickens to live wid her ; an ' pit ' em all intill warrum stockings and shoes , an ' round-o-caliker gowns . " And they carped at no discrepancies or improbabilities ; but seized all eagerly , and fused it in their quick imaginations to one beautiful meaning ; which , whether it were of chicken comfort , overbrooded with warm love , or of a clothed , contented childhood , in safe shelter , mattered not a bit . Into this warm , blithe scene came Glory , just as the fable was ended for the fourth time , bringing the last little chick , flushed and rosy from a bath ; born into beauty , like Venus from the sea ; her fair hair , combed and glossy , hanging about her neck in curls ; and wrapped , not in a " round-o-caliker , " but in a scarlet-flannel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bread and milk , and gingerbread , and ate their suppers by the fire . And then Glory told them the old story of Santa Claus ; and how , if they hung their stockings by the chimney , there was no knowing what they might n't find in them to-morrow . " Only , " she said , " whatever it is , and whoever He sends it by , it all comes from the good Lord , first of all . " And then , the two white beds in the two bedrooms close by held four little happy bodies , whose souls were given into God 's keeping till his Christmas dawn should come , in the old , holy rhyme , said after Glory . By and by , Faith and Mr. Armstrong and Miss Sampson came over from the Corner House , with parcels from . Kriss Kringle . And now there was a gladsome time for all ; but chiefly , for Glory . What unpacking and refolding in separate papers ! Every sugar pig , and dog , and pussy cat must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a long time finding out all that Santa Claus had brought them . What stuffing , and tying , and pinning , inside , and outside , and over the little red woolen legs that hung , expectant , above the big , open chimney ! How Glory laughed , and sorted , and tied and made errands for string and pins , and seized the opportunity for brushing away great tears of love , and joy , and thankfulness , that would keep coming into her eyes ! And then , when all was done , and she and Faith came back from a little flitting into the bedrooms , and a hovering look over the wee , peaceful , sleeping faces there , and they all stood , for a minute , surveying the goodly fullness of small delights stored up and waiting for the morrow -- how she turned suddenly , and stretched her hands out toward the kind friends who had helped and sympathized in all , and said , with a quick overflow of feeling , that could find only the old words wherein to utter herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful time ! And to think that I should be in it ! " Miss Henderson 's will was fulfilled . A happy , young life had gathered again about the ancient hearthstone that had seen two hundred years of human change . The Old House , wherefrom the last of a long line had passed on into the Everlasting Mansions , had become God 's heritage . Nurse Sampson spent her Christmas with the Gartneys . They must have her again , they told her , at parting , for the wedding ; which would be in May . " I may be a thousand miles off , by that time . But I shall think of you , all the same , wherever I am . My work is coming . I feel it . There 's a smell of blood and death in the air ; and all the strong hearts and hands 'll be wanted . You 'll see it . " And with that , she was gone . CHAPTER XXXVII . THE WEDDING JOURNEY . " The tree Sucks kindlier nurture from a soil enriched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , In heart and spirit , from deciduous hopes And things that seem to perish . " " A stream always among woods or in the sunshine is pleasant to all and happy in itself . Another , forced through rocks , and choked with sand , under ground , cold , dark , comes up able to heal the world . "  - -  FROM " SEED GRAIN . " " Shall we plan a wedding journey , Faith ? " It was one evening in April that Mr. Armstrong said this . The day for the marriage had been fixed for the first week in May . Faith had something of the bird nature about her . Always , at this moment of the year , a restlessness , akin to that which prompts the flitting of winged things that track the sunshine and the creeping greenness that goes up the latitudes , had used to seize her , inwardly . Something that came with the swelling of tender buds , and the springing of bright blades , and the first music born from winter silence , had prompted her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beautiful earth ! " It had been one of her unsatisfied longings . She had thought , what a joy it would be if she could have said , frankly , " Father , mother ! let us have a pleasant journey in the lovely weather ! " And now , that one stood at her side , who would have taken her in his tender guardianship whithersoever she might choose -- now that there was no need for hesitancy in her wish -- this child , who had never been beyond the Hudson , who had thought longingly of Catskill , and Trenton , and Niagara , and had seen them only in her dreams -- felt , inexplicably , a contrary impulse , that said within her , " Not yet ! " Somehow , she did not care , at this great and beautiful hour of her life , to wander away into strange places . Its holy happiness belonged to home . " Not now . Unless you wish it . Not on purpose . Take me with you , some time , when , perhaps , you would have gone alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin our quiet life , then , darling , shall we ? The life that is to be our real blessedness , and that has no need to give itself a holiday , as yet . And let the workdays and the holidays be portioned as God pleases ? " " It will be better -- happier , " Faith answered , timidly . " Besides , with all this fearful tramping to war through the whole land , how can one feel like pleasure journeying ? And then "  - -  there was another little reason that peeped out last --  " they would have been so sure to make a fuss about us in New York ! " The adjuncts of life had been much to her in those restless days when a dark doubt lay over its deep reality . She had found a passing cheer and relief in them , then . Now , she was so sure , so quietly content ! It was a joy too sacred to be intermeddled with . So a family group , only , gathered in the hillside parlor , on the fair May morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made Faith Gartney and Roger Armstrong one . It was all still , and bright , and simple . Glory , standing modestly by the door , said within herself , " it was like a little piece of heaven . " And afterwards -- not the bride and groom -- but father , mother , and little brother , said good-by , and went away upon their journey , and left them there . In the quaint , pleasant home , that was theirs now , under the budding elms , with the smile of the May promise pouring in . And Glory made a May Day at the Old House , by and by . And the little children climbed in the apple branches , and perched there , singing , like the birds . And was there not a white-robed presence with them , somehow , watching all ? * * * * * Nearly three months had gone . The hay was down . The distillation of sweet clover was in all the air . The little ones at the Old House were out , in the lengthening shadows of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elastic heaps . Faith Armstrong stood with Glory , in the porch angle , looking on . Calm and beautiful . Only the joy of birds and children making sound and stir across the summer stillness . Away over the broad face of the earth , out from such peace as this , might there , if one could look -- unroll some vision of horrible contrast ? Were blood , and wrath , and groans , and thunderous roar of guns down there under that far , fair horizon , stooping in golden beauty to the cool , green hills ? Faith walked down the field path , presently , to meet her husband , coming up . He held in his hand an open paper , that he had brought , just now from the village . There was news . Rout , horror , confusion , death , dismay . The field of Manassas had been fought . The Union armies were falling back , in disorder , upon Washington . Breathlessly , with pale faces , and with hands that grasped each other in a deep excitement that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . Down there , on those Virginian plains , was this . And they were here , in quiet safety , among the clover blooms , and the new-cut hay . Elsewhere , men were mown . " Roger ! " said Faith , when , by and by , they had grown calmer over the fearful tidings , and had had Bible words of peace and cheer for the fevered and bloody rumors of men --  " might n't we take our wedding journey , now ? " All the bright , early summer , in those first months of their life together , they had been finding work to do . Work they had hardly dreamed of when Faith had feared she might be left to a mere , unworthy , selfish rest and happiness . The old New England spirit had roused itself , mightily , in the little country town . People had forgotten their own needs , and the provision they were wont to make , at this time , each household for itself . Money and material , and quick , willing hands were found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zeal , and noble sympathies , and hearty prayers wove themselves in , with toil of thread and needle , to homely fabrics , and embalmed , with every finger touch , all whereon they labored . They had remembered the old struggle wherein their country had been born . They were glad and proud to bear their burden in this grander one wherein she was to be born anew , to higher life . Roger Armstrong and his wife had been the spring and soul and center of all . And now Faith said : " Roger ! may n't we take our wedding journey ? " Not for a bridal holiday -- not for gay change and pleasure -- but for a holy purpose , went they out from home . Down among the wounded , and war-smitten . Bearing comfort of gifts , and helpful words , and prayers . Doing whatsoever they found to do , now ; seeking and learning what they might best do , hereafter . Truly , God left them not without a work . A noble ministry lay ready for them , at this very threshold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they found Nurse Sampson . " I told you so , " she said . " I knew it was coming . And the first gun brought me down here to be ready . I 've been out to Western Virginia ; and I came back here when we got the news of this . I shall follow round , wherever the clouds roll . " In Washington , still another meeting awaited them . Paul Rushleigh , in a Captain 's uniform , came , one day , to the table of their hotel . The first gun had brought him , also , where he could be ready . He had sailed for home , with his father , upon the reception , abroad , of the tidings of the fall of Sumter . " Your country will want you , now , my son , " had been the words of the brave and loyal gentleman . And , like another Abraham , he had set his face toward the mount of sacrifice . There was a new light in the young man 's eye . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan or hope of a mere happy living in the earth . He met his old friends frankly , generously ; and , seemingly , without a pang . They were all one now , in the sublime labor that , in their several spheres , lay out before them . " You were right , Faith , " he said , as he stood with them , and spoke briefly of the past , before they parted . " I shall be more of a man , than if I 'd had my first wish . This war is going to make a nation of men . I 'm free , now , to give my heart and hand to my country , as long as she needs me . And by and by , perhaps , if I live , some woman may love me with the sort of love you have for your husband . I feel now , how surely I should have come to be dissatisfied with less . God bless you both ! " " God bless you , Paul ! " THE END . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ADELINE DUTTON ( Train ) WHITNEY , American novelist and poet , was born in Boston , September 15 , 1824 , and was married to Seth D. Whitney , of Milton , Mass. , in 1843 . Writing little for publication in early life , she produced , in 1863 , Faith Gartney 's Girlhood , which brought her great popularity both at home and in England , where the novel gained especially favorable commendation . Although planned purely as a girl 's book , the story of Faith grew into her womanhood , and after the lapse of almost half a century continues to be a prime favorite . It is a purely told story of New England life , especially with dramatic incidents and an excellent bit of romance . The Gayworthys : a Story of Threads and Thrums ( 1865 ) , continued Mrs. Whitney 's popularity and received flattering notices from the London Reader , Athenaeum , Pall Mall Gazette , and Spectator .

CHAPTER I. THE OLD STONE HOUSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search the coast for miles and not find another bit of nature so bare and rent and ragged as this . So fiercely had the storms driven over it , so wildly had the wind and waves beat , that the few cedars which once flourished as its only bit of greenness were long ago dead , and now held up only bleached and ragged hands . Jutting out into the sea , the surf rolled and thundered along its jagged shore of rock and sand , and was never silent . It would have been an island but for the narrow strips of sand , heaped high and ridgelike , which bound it to the main land ; and this slender bridge , it often seemed , would be torn away by the ravenous sea which gnawed and engulfed great tracts at once , and yet heaped it higher and broader in the next storm . Beyond , on the firm and unyielding land , the pine woods stood up , vast , dim , and silent , stretching away into the interior . So , with the great dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front , Culm Rock seemed shut out from all the rest of the world . True , sails flitted along the horizon , and the smoke of foreign-bound steamers trailed against the sky , giving token of the great world 's life and stir ; and there were Skipper Ben and the " White Gull " who touched at the little wharf at Culm every week ; but for these , the people -- for there were people who dwelt here -- might have lived in another sphere for aught they knew or were conscious of what was transpiring in the wonderful land which lay beyond the stretch of sea , and between which and themselves the " White Gull " was the only means of communication . Do you wonder that people could spend their lives here , die , and never have seen the world without ? There were only a dozen houses ,  - -  poor , racked , weather-beaten things , nestled on a bit of sand on a far corner of Culm ,  - -  inhabited by fishermen and their families . They were rough , hardy folk , but ignorant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great sea , and a poor and scanty enough living at that . Skipper Ben brought them molasses and calicoes down in the " White Gull , " and took their fish in exchange ; and if he told them a bit of news from the great city and the greater world , it was all very well . If he failed to do this , it was all very well too . Back of the fisher huts , the rocks rose high and dark , and quite hid the pine woods and the isthmus of yellow sand , and everything that could make Culm at all cheery or pleasant . This eminence was Wind Cliff , and served as a landmark for all the sailors whose path lay along the coast . Around this the gulls were alway flitting and screaming , and their nests were everywhere in the crevices of the rocks . Bald and gray it rose , scarred and rent with storms and age , and so steep as to be almost inaccessible . It fronted the north-west , and from its sharp tip the rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its great hollows down by the shore a house -- such a house as you would not have looked for at Culm -- with walls of stone and tall , ancient chimneys and deep-set windows , like eyes looking forever at the sea . It was so dark and weather-beaten that at first sight you might almost fancy it to be but some quaint , odd shape which the rocks had taken , by dint of the stress of winds and waves beating upon them for long ages . But a house it was , and made by human hands , and human beings dwelt in it . At night the red light from its windows streamed out upon the water , and in many a dark and tempestuous watch had Skipper Ben guided the " White Gull " into port through the friendly gleaming of this beacon . For a long period of years the old house had stood empty and tenantless , the windows and doors broken and gone , the wind sweeping through and the rain beating in , and everything but the stout walls and chimneys a ruin . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smugglers and pirates who made it their haunt , with other fanciful stories which always seem to linger about the sea , and in which there was not the faintest shadow of truth . Desolate and neglected , it stood there year after year , till , one day , Skipper Ben brought down carpenters and masons on the " White Gull , " and straightway they went at work upon the old house . Doors went up , windows went in , a piazza pushed itself out towards the sea-front , and there was great bustle and activity about it for weeks . Then the laborers went away , and when the skipper came again , he brought , instead of groceries and store-cloth , a great quantity of furniture , the like of which the poor people at Culm Rock had never seen , and with the furniture came the master of the new house -- a sorrowful , bowed man -- and his housekeeper , a thin , wrinkled negro woman . Then the smoke curled out of the great stone chimneys once more , the light streamed from the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last the old house had found a tenant and no longer yawned bare and empty . The " White Gull " came more than once with a cargo for the master of the stone house , who , the skipper told the Culm folk , " was a mighty rich man , but the down-heartedest chap he 'd ever cast eyes on . Why , man , he just sot lookin ' over the rail the best part o ' the way down , with his eyes in the water , and said no more nor a stone . What ye think ? Now lookee here , men , let me give ye a bit o ' advice . Do n't ye go to pesterin ' him with yer talk and yer questions ; fur he 's diff'rent make ' an I be , an ' ' two n't do . Let him alone , an ' keep yer own side o ' the Rock . " The skipper 's word was looked upon with respect by all the fish-folk , and they heeded his advice . So , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lived in the greatest seclusion . He never came within the limits of the little village , and whenever he was seen , it was only as pacing slowly along the shore . He passed the fishermen as they were hanging up their seines in the sun without heeding them , or acknowledging their respectful bows . The old black housekeeper came down to the village sometimes after fish or gulls ' eggs , but went her way without satisfying the eager questions with which the women plied her . So one year passed away , then a second , and the master of the stone house was still as much a mystery to the poor fishers as ever . He rarely walked upon the sand , gave them not a look if ever they chanced to meet , and living , apparently , for no one but himself , took not the slightest interest in their welfare , cared naught for wreck or disaster on the shore , and seemed always stern and sorrowful . No company ever came down on the " White Gull " to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , apparently . Skipper Ben brought stores for him occasionally , and sometimes a letter ; but this last event was a rare one , and the man seemed to have little more communication with the great world out of which he had come than did the humble Culm fishermen . With winds and storms , the third year rolled around , and the master of the old house was still as much of a recluse as ever ; but the Culm people had ceased to regard him with any interest , and the man led a most solitary life , hardly seeing a human being , other than his housekeeper , from month to month . Do you wonder what could make him so stern and sad ? Here is his story :  --  One sweet and golden summer day , a man stood by the bedside of his wife ,  - -  he , crushed and heart-broken ; she , faint and dying , but calm and loving and comforting . She held his hand , and whispered brokenly such words as she could only hope to comfort him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips was , " Oh , Richard , do n't fail -- do n't fail to -- to find Him and cling to Him , and come -- come up -- too . " And with that she was dead . And the man left the bedside , and went out into the summer fields , where the birds were flitting and the bees droning and the wide earth seemed brimming with life and joy , and prayed that he might die too , since she was gone . But the birds sang on as joyously as ever , and the sun shone no less brightly because of the sorrow in the earth , and after his first tears were shed , his heart began to grow hard and bitter , and he put away the dying whisper , and went back to the dear dead face , cold and stern . His friends came to console him , but he would not listen , and after it was all over , and the gentle face hidden forever under the brown earth , he began to think of fleeing to some spot where he might find rest and quietness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who had left him , smothering his sorrow , and living as if she had not been . " I have been robbed , " he said , bitterly ; " all my happiness has been stolen from me . I ca n't seek Him ; I will not . Oh , if there is a kind and merciful God , why has he stricken me ? why has he taken all the joy out of my life ? why has he left me without a comforter in the world ? " So , without seeking for a Comforter , without striving to " find Him , " as the dear voice had whispered , he turned away and strove to crush out the love and the tender memories which haunted his heart , and most of all that dying whisper which said , " Do n't fail -- do n't fail to find Him . " Grown suddenly stern and morose , Richard Trafford looked about him for a refuge where he might flee from all society , and most of all from the spot where her presence seemed yet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and purchased the old stone house . Here , he thought , with the everlasting sound of the sea in his ears , with all the wildness and barrenness about him , and apart from the rest of mankind , he would bury himself , and forget all the bright and happy days which had passed . He left his friends without giving them any clew to his whereabouts , and with faithful old Hagar , who persisted in following him , took up his abode by the sea . But do you think his sorrow lessened ? Do you think he found peace and happiness again ? He carried his hard and bitter heart with him , and there was no happiness to be found by the sea . One year after another rolled away until the three were gone , and still he was wandering along his own thorny path , bowed with his sorrow , sighing and lamenting for the bright form which had left him , and still deaf to its whisper , " Find Him , and come up too . " He walked on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great rooms of the stone house , oppressed and heavy-hearted ; he shut himself up in his library and pored over books in vain . His sorrow clung to him , followed him everywhere ; his heart was stubborn and bitter and rebellious . Perhaps he despaired of ever losing the burden , for one day he brought out a portrait , wrapped and swathed with great care , and , tearing all the veilings off , gazed once more on the sainted face which he had not looked upon for three long and heavy years . He did not hide it again , but hung it upon his library wall , where the tender face and calm and loving eyes looked down and almost melted him to tears . He wondered how he could have kept it veiled and hidden so long . He wondered if those three years had not been spent in vain , unless it were to learn that he could not crush out his sweet memories if he tried . He sank down into his chair as he thought of this , and going back over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blank they were , thought , with a heavy sigh , what a shipwreck his life had been , and how he was now floating about without rudder or compass or anchor , merely a drifting wreck . And as he sits there in the sunshine which streams through the wide , high old window , we will see him for the first time . CHAPTER II . LETTERS . Richard Trafford was a man of forty ; but his hair was tinged with gray , and grief and wretchedness had worn heavy lines in his face . As he sat in the library this September afternoon , looking up at the portrait on the wall , he seemed almost an old man . The room was wide and high , with tall oaken bookcases at either end . Two great windows , before one of which he sat , looked out upon the sea and the white line of foam curling upon the sand . The waves were but mere ripples this calm afternoon , but from the shore there came up a ceaseless , steady murmur that made itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by Trafford 's eyes turned from the calm face above him and looked out seaward . White and shining lay the vast expanse , with here and there the faint film of a sail upon the horizon . Nothing to be seen but water and the great dome of sky and the little spit of yellow sand where the tide was murmuring . How many sunny afternoons he had thus looked out upon the sea , vast and gleaming ! How many lonely afternoons and long , weary nights he had listened to the slow chanting of the tide , watched it creep up the sand with its puffs of thick foam , watched it as it slowly receded and left its burden of weed and shell behind ! Flowing and ebbing forever , alway at its work , in and out , in and out , through storm and shine , through night and day , it seemed to mock his own idle , useless life , and reproach him with its never silent voice . Of what use , he wondered as he sat there , was such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its work again , the ships go on , the sun shine warm and bright over all ,  - -  and he ? For him to-morrow would be but the repetition of to-day ; the same dragging hours , the same apathetic poring over books , the same half-hours at the organ with the music-books , playing sad melodies which accorded well with his own sombre feelings . He looked up at the portrait and sighed ; remembered the dear one 's dying words , and thought , " I might have found Him once ; but it 's too late now . All that passed away a long time ago , and now , it 's only to plod on and on , year in and year out , till the end . " And what then ? There came a soft rap at the door . " Come in , Hagar , " said he , heavily , without taking his eyes off the sea ; and then the door was pushed open , and a head , surmounted by a great yellow turban , looked in . " Somethin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner of the turban , without coming in , however . " What is it ? " said Trafford , abstractedly . The door opened wider , and the old housekeeper entered . She was bent and thin , with great wrinkles in her forehead and face , and wherever a tuft of wool peeped out from under the fanciful headgear , it showed quite gray ; but her step was quick and firm as she went across the floor to the figure by the great window . " A letter , Mas'r Dick , " said she , standing by Trafford 's chair ; " dat yer old skipper brought it . Said he brung it straight from de city . " " Ben Tate ? " asked the master . Hagar nodded assent . " Said ye was to hev it dis yer afternoon , sure , " said she ; " ' twa' n't no letter to be lyin ' ' round in dem Culm huts , so he cum up here wid it hisself . Be it frum Hastings , Mas'r Dick ? " Hagar had lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown up to manhood under her eyes , had married , and she went to live with the young people . She had seen the wife fade and die , and the husband grow stern and gloomy , and out of solicitude and affection had clung faithfully to him through all fortunes . It would seem , to hear her talk , that she never had quite realized that Richard Trafford , the man of forty , was any other than " Mas'r Dick , " the boy whose smartness at school , and whose popularity among his companions , had always been her boast and pride . Gray and worn he was getting , gloomy , sad , even harsh at times to her , yet he was only " Mas'r Dick , " and her own little boy , for whom she must watch and care to the best of her ability . Now , as she queried where the letter might be from , she dropped down in a chair a little way from him , and waited till he should see fit to answer her question ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been represented to Hagar by Hastings ,  - -  that great city where their old home had been , where her own childhood had been spent , and where all the friends of her kin and color dwelt . It was a hard matter to tear herself away from them all and follow Richard Trafford to dreary Culm Rock ; but , with some tears and sighing , she had said to her people , " Yer do n't know nuffin about it . Ye hab n't got any ' Mas'r Dick ; ' so how ken ye ? ' Tai n't in dis yer old heart to let de chile go off sufferin ' all by hisself , now ! Bress de Lord , I 'll stick to de poor boy , an ' keep him frum jes ' worryin ' his life out . " So here she was in her old age , away from all her people , yet happy because it was to serve " Mas'r Dick . " Trafford took up the letter ,  - -  a large , thick one , bearing the marks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fish , as if it had performed its journey in company with herring and cod ,  - -  and said , " Yes , Hagar ; it 's from Hastings , of course . " The old housekeeper lingered , looked at the master in hopes that he would bid her stay , and then , as he tore open the letter with a moody face , went slowly out , closing the door softly behind her . The handwriting was unfamiliar , and Trafford wondered where it came from , feeling vexed that it should have arrived at that moment ; and so began to read an emphatically business letter :  --  " HASTINGS , Sept. 7th . " To Mr. Richard Trafford , of Culm Rock : " SIR ,  - -  I am sorry to be under the painful necessity of informing you of your brother 's death . The Rev. Oliver Trafford died the 15th of March last , leaving me as the executor of his estate . He was anxious to see you till the very last ; but as we had no clew to your whereabouts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ago , that pleasure was denied him . He left one child -- a boy of fourteen , or thereabouts -- for whose welfare he was much distressed . He often expressed it as his desire that , should you ever make your appearance , this boy might be received by you as your own , and , indeed , left written statements to that effect . There is , also , among his private papers , a sealed letter for you , which , I doubt not , contains some such request . The boy , I am happy to say , is not likely to prove a burden or trouble to you , being obedient and all that could be desired . He is smart and sprightly , and quite a favorite in the circle in which his father moved , and from my own acquaintance with him ( very intimate during the past six months ) can assure you that he will prove anything but a poor acquisition . " As to the estate , I am sorry to say that Mr. Trafford left but little of value ,  - -  enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear you are a gentleman of fortune , this , I presume , is a matter of very little moment . I shall be happy to show you your brother 's accounts at any time , and to have the honor of answering any inquiries which you may be disposed to make . I enclose a note from your nephew . Awaiting your decision in the matter , I am , sir , your most obedient servant , " Thomas Gray . " Room 8 , at No. 67 Court St. " With a gloomy face , Trafford laid down the lawyer 's letter , and took up his nephew 's . He did not remember ever having seen the boy . He was , most likely , a crazy , boisterous lad , that would be forever in mischief , and bring the house about their heads . As for having him at Culm Rock , it was too preposterous a thought to be entertained for a moment . He had decided at once how Mr. Gray 's letter should be answered , and felt too indifferent to care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter to him ? Yet , after a time , he thought better of it , and took up the note again , saying to himself , " I 'll read it , if only because it 's poor Noll 's boy ; " and opening the missive , found therein the following frank boy 's letter :  --  " HASTINGS , Sept. 7th . " DEAR UNCLE RICHARD ,  - -  I do n't know what to say to you -- it all seems so strange and awkward . Mr. Gray said I was to write , however , and send the note with his ; so I am trying . It is such a long time since I saw you that I 've forgotten your face , and I think you must have forgotten that there was such a person as myself in the world . Papa died almost six months ago , and he said all the time , at the last , ' Go for Uncle Richard ! ' but I did n't know where you were , and Mr. Gray could not find out till a short time ago ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what he wanted to say , but he told me that I was to live with you and be your boy ; and Mr. Gray says the papers say the same thing . " Here the writer had evidently faltered , and been at a loss how to proceed further with intelligence which it , apparently , was very irksome for him to disclose ; but he continued with , " There are only you and me left , and I am sure I would like very much to be your boy and live with you , as papa said ; but -- but I do n't know -- I mean -- Well , I ca n't say it , Uncle Richard , but I mean that I wish I might know what you thought about it first . I would n't like to come , you know , unless you liked ,  - -  unless you were glad to have me . Mr. Gray has all papa 's business to settle , and I suspect he wants to get me settled , too , somewhere , pretty quick ; and so , if you please , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and only do just as you like about giving him permission to send me . I can find a home somewhere , if you would rather . " My name is Oliver ,  - -  Noll , everybody calls me ; I 'm almost fifteen , and have always been at school in Hastings , and papa used to give me lessons beside . Is there a school at Culm Rock ? I do wish you could have seen papa , dear Uncle Richard , he longed so for you when he died ; but there is a letter for you among his papers , which will be sent to Culm Rock , if I do not come to bring it . Mr. Gray will tell you all about me , I suppose , and the affairs besides ; so I will stop . " Your nephew , " NOLL TRAFFORD . "  - -  And do n't mind what Mr. Gray says , please , and only do as you like . " Richard Trafford finished this letter with something like a grim smile on his lips . " The boy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , " and some of Brother Noll 's gentleness , I fancy . Ah , Noll was always a happier man than I ! " He read the boy 's letter again , wondering what made it seem so bright and pleasant , and feeling vexed with himself for doing it . Why should he care for this boy or this boy 's letter ? Had he not fled to Culm Rock to escape all knowledge of what was transpiring in the world without , to forget friends and kin , if that was possible ? He looked up and met the sweet , grave eyes of his wife looking down into his , and read something there which made his eyes fill and his lip quiver . " Ah , " he sighed , " why did I not try to follow after ? " And with this thought in his heart , he rose and stood by the window , looking down at the crawling tide . His thoughts came back to the boy , presently , and with another grim smile upon his face , he remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a lad of fourteen . He would soon tire of it , and be glad enough to go back to Hastings , he fancied . If he was a wild boy , he should go back on the return of the " White Gull ; " if he could be tolerated , he might stay till he tired of it . It was poor Brother Noll 's boy , after all , he thought , and he could not make his heart quite hard enough to refuse him a home . So , when Skipper Ben returned to Hastings with his next cargo of fish , he carried a letter hidden away under his pea-jacket , and this was what it contained :  --  " CULM ROCK , Sept. 12th . " To Noll Trafford : " Come ; you are welcome . " UNCLE RICHARD . " CHAPTER III . ON THE " WHITE GULL . " The breeze was crisp and fresh that morning , and the skipper anxious to set sail . Everything was in readiness on board the " White Gull , " but still its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stumped up and down the deck , muttering and grumbling to his mate . " Allus jes ' so ! " he said , wrathfully ; " these town folks never up to time . Think o n't , Jack , that ' ere lawyer , Gray , promised to get the youngster here a good half-hour afore sunrise ! Here it 's sun-up already , and this breeze wo n't last forever , nuther . " " Why do n't ye go ' long ' thout him ? " queried Jack Snape from his seat on a bucket . " Would , ef ' twa' n't fur that pesky lawyer ! " growled the skipper ; " an ' ' tai n't every day ye can get a passenger fur the Rock , nuther . Mought as well take what passage-money he can , a fellow mought , Jack . " The mate of the " White Gull " began to whistle , and fumbling in his pea-jacket brought out a pipe and tobacco , with which he proceeded to console himself . Skipper Ben took a few more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at last in grim despair , while the wind came in strong , steady puffs , and the craft rocked and swayed gently on the swell of the tide . The city behind them was hardly awake yet . Its roofs and steeples loomed through a veil of haze or smoke which hovered over and clung about the towers , and only a faint murmur told of the stir and bustle which were presently to reign . On the wharves a few early drays were rumbling down after their loads of merchandise , and one or two vessels had left their moorings , and , taking advantage of the favorable breeze , were standing out to sea , which fact did not at all add to Skipper Ben 's good-nature . " Here they come , " drawled the mate , putting up his pipe ; and then a carriage came rattling down the wharf , stopping in front of the " White Gull . " " Come at last , hev ye ? " shouted the skipper , gruffly . " Call this a half-hour afore sunrise , squire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at his watch , " I thought we were prodigiously early . Driver , put these trunks aboard in a hurry , since the skipper is waiting ; and -- Noll , are you ready ? " The skipper left his craft and came to bear a hand with the trunks , looking askance , meanwhile , at the boy who had got out of the carriage and stood on the wharf 's edge , surveying the " Gull . " " Hope you 'll have a good run , skipper , " said the lawyer , as the baggage went over into a cavernous aperture in the deck ; " fine breeze , I should say . Have a good care of this passenger of yours , man . " " Ay , squire , we 'll manage . Ca n't stop fur words from ye this morning ; should ha ' been a long piece down the coast afore this time o ' day . Bear a hand there , Jack ! " " Good-by , Noll , " said the lawyer ; " keep up a stout heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'll have a fine run down to Culm , and you must send me a line back by the skipper . Good-by ! " and Mr. Gray got into his carriage and rolled back toward the city . Noll Trafford stood leaning against a great post and looking after the lawyer 's carriage with a slight choking in his throat , till the skipper 's gruff " Get aboard here , lad ! " warned him that the " Gull " was about to cast off . Slowly the wharf glided away , and the little coasting vessel stood out into the channel . The city spread itself out behind them , a long maze of brick and slate , with spires and domes showing dimly through the blue haze which wrapped them about . On the far , watery horizon lay a belt of vapory clouds which presently began to rend and tear and float off in ragged masses , and then a great red sun gleamed through and made a golden roadway across the sea , and transformed the misty fleeces of vapor to wonderful hangings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jes ' sunrise ! " muttered the skipper ; " make the best o ' this ' ere breeze , eh , Jack ? " " Ay , " drawled the mate , " we 'll catch it afore long , skipper . " The city 's old cold front suddenly gleamed out in vivid gold , the spires grew rosy in the first rays of sunlight , and , all its dimness and dulness gone , Hastings lay gleaming and glowing in the fair morning light like some vision of fairyland . Noll Trafford , sitting on a great bale of merchandise near the stern of the " Gull , " gazed at the city , slowly sinking and fading in the sea , with a feeling somewhat akin to homesickness . It had never looked so bright to him before as at this moment of his departure from it , and he was leaving behind a great many friends -- all his school acquaintances , all the scenes and haunts that were dear to him -- to go -- where ? He hardly knew , himself , but his bright fancy had pictured Culm as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , be a great beach to ramble upon and hunt for minerals and shells , and where he would soon make plenty of new acquaintances . And Uncle Richard he had pictured to himself as a gentle , kind man ,  - -  grave , perhaps , but who would love him and try to fill the place of his own dead father . So , with these bright visions filling his mind , it was little wonder that he turned from the stern , after Hastings had faded into the merest blue dot on the horizon-line , and looked forward to the time when the journey 's end should be reached , with happy anticipations . Before them lay the vast and boundless sea , with no trace of shore or island save a low blue belt in the south , like a cloud , and the " Gull " began to pitch and toss somewhat with the great ocean-swell . Skipper Ben , having got well in the way of the breeze which was carrying his vessel steadily before it , began to regain his good-humor . Sitting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe and soliloquized to himself about his passenger , who sat regarding Jack Snape 's movements at the helm with much interest . The skipper had three or four boys at home ,  - -  great sturdy , brown-faced , stout-armed fellows ,  - -  between whom and this fair-faced , curly-headed boy there was little resemblance , he felt . " Town breedin ' , town breedin ' , " muttered he ; " it 's curi 's what it 'll make of a lad . This chap 'll grow up with his head full o ' le'rnin ' into a lawyer or parson or somethin ' like , and my lads 'll be skippers like their dad , with no le'rnin ' to speak on . I 'll warrant this lad could get off more book-stuff in five minutes ' an mine ever heerd on . " His eyes followed the boy as he went out to stand by Jack 's elbow and ply this slow-witted gentleman with quick , eager questions . He was slender and rather tall for one of his age , but lithe and agile , as the skipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip him with a turn o ' his hand , " thought he ; yet he regarded the lad with a mixture of kindness and respect , after all . There were other things in the world beside bone and muscle , he remembered , and when the boy came slowly along the deck , after a fruitless attempt to coax the mate into conversation , he put out one of his big red hands and stopped him . Noll looked up , inquiringly . " Goin ' down to Culm for a bit o ' vacation ? to git scarce o ' the books , eh ? " queried the skipper . " Vacation ? Oh , no , " said the boy , quickly ; " I 'm going there to live , to have a home . " The master of the " Gull " came near dropping his pipe with amazement . " You live at Culm ! " said he , incredulous ; " what ye goin ' to live in ? " It was Noll 's turn to look amazed . He suddenly faced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a place is Culm Rock , anyhow ? Is n't it a town ? " A broad grin stretched across the old sailor 's face , then he laughed aloud . " Did ye hear that , Jack ? " he cried ; " here 's a lad what 's goin ' to Culm to live , an ' he wants to know ef it 's a town ! " " ' Two n't take him long to find out after he gets there , " drawled Mr. Snape . Noll turned away and walked to the stern , thinking the skipper was a very uncivil fellow to laugh at his ignorance , and sat down again on the bale , secretly ill at ease on account of these sailors ' words . What kind of a place could Culm Rock be ? All around the boundless waste of waves flashed and glittered under the sun , and the " Gull " sailed steadily on her course with not a fleck of land in sight ,  - -  nothing around but the vast blue of the sea ,  - -  above , only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strange sight to Noll Trafford . He lay on his back on the bale , and looked up into the wonderful depths of the blue dome , where no clouds sailed , and speculated about his destination . Somehow , the bright vision of a pleasant sea town with a shining beach of sand and pebbles had faded , and in its stead there was doubt and perplexity . Was it only a rock , as the name suggested , and no town ? However , Uncle Richard was there , and that was one comfort ; and perhaps the skipper was only joking , after all . He wished , though , that he might know what to expect ; he wondered why he had not thought to ask Mr. Gray before starting . He lay a long time listening to the rush of water about the vessel , a strange and unusual sound to his ears . By and by a brawny hand touched his shoulder , and a gruff voice said ,  --  " Lookee here , lad ! " Noll turned about and saw the skipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ye , I ' low , " said he , good-humoredly ; " but ' t was droll , ennyhow . Hai n't ye never been to Culm afore ? " " Never , " said Noll . " An ' ye do n't know nuthin ' what it 's like ? " " No ; how should I ? " said his passenger ; " I did n't know there was such a place in the world a month ago . " The skipper looked incredulous once more . " An ' now ye goin ' there to live ! " he exclaimed ; " why , there be n't but one house there fit fur such as you , an ' ' tai n't there ye 're bound , not by a long shot ! " " But one house ! Whose is it ? " cried Noll , eagerly . " Why , it be one Trafford 's , one o ' the strangest --  " A sudden expression in the boy 's face checked the words on the skipper 's tongue , and the truth began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cried he , falling back a step or two , " ye be n't goin ' there ? " " Yes , " said Noll , as quietly as he could . " Why not ? " The skipper gave him a long , steady survey , and then stumped away across the deck without another word , leaned over the rail , and began to whistle . Noll looked after him , half determined to follow and demand what he meant , yet half dreading to learn that all his visions were a great way from the truth . Perhaps it would be better to wait , he thought ; night would bring the journey to an end , and then he should know all . So he did not follow the skipper , but kept his seat , while a great many shadowy forebodings crept into his heart , and he began to look back over the trackless waste which they had come , and wish , almost , that he was back in dear old Hastings -- in the old home where papa and he had spent so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun rose royally up to noon , and odors of dinner began to ascend from the hatchway . Noll had a dinner of his own somewhere in a basket , which he brought forth and ate on the bale which served him for a seat , enjoying the novelty in spite of the anxious speculations concerning his new home in which he could not help indulging . After dinner the skipper was in better humor than ever , and took his turn at the helm . Noll , wandering about the deck , stopped to watch him , whereupon the master of the " Gull " good-naturedly answered all his questions , and even allowed him to take the tiller a few minutes , laughing the while at his white hands that could hardly grasp it . " Wish ye could see my lads ' hands ! " he said ; " could take both ' o ' yourn in one uv ' em , an ' not know they was holding anything . But you 'll have browner paws afore ye leave Culm ! " " Of course ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Richard to teach me to row ,  - -  I can swim now ,  - -  and I 'm going to be around the shore half the time . " " Likely enough , likely enough ! " said the skipper , meditatively ; and when Noll had passed on , he muttered , " It 's a pesky shame fur the lad to be sent off and cooped up on the Rock ! Do n't know what he 's comin ' to , nuther . I 'll be blamed ef I ai n't sorry for the boy ! " CHAPTER IV . DISAPPOINTMENTS . It was late afternoon when land loomed up blue on the horizon . Mr. Snape had taken the tiller , and Noll stood leaning over the rail by him , eager and watchful for the first look at Culm . " Mought as well wait a bit , " Jack Snape had drawled out ; " we sha' n't get there fur a long while yet , lad . " But the boy chose to keep his place , and kept his eyes unweariedly on the distant point for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was but tiresome watching , after all , and the brisk breeze seemed to have failed them somewhat , for the vessel 's speed had sensibly diminished . " He 'll be glad ' nough to look t' other way after he gits there , " muttered Skipper Ben , between the whiffs at his pipe ; " my lads ' ud think they 's killed for sartin to be shut up there a week . " He got up at last , knocked the ashes out of his pipe , and disappeared down the hatchway , returning presently with a spy-glass , which he carried to his passenger with , " Lookee here , boy , take this an ' make out what ye ken . ' Tai n't much ye 'll see yet , but mebby ye 'll get a look after a time . " He sat down again , looking at the boy 's face from time to time , and wondering if this sending him to Culm Rock was not some of that Lawyer Gray 's work . The skipper had not a very high opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take shape , and Noll 's glass brought it to his eyes all too faithfully . The skipper saw the eager look and the warm color which had been on his face fade slowly out as the " Gull " drew nearer and nearer the journey 's end , and the warm-hearted sailor waxed indignant . " Mought ha ' told him what ter expect , anyhow ! " he muttered , shaking a great bale with his brawny hands as if it had been Lawyer Gray 's shoulders . The " Gull " stood in toward shore . First , the pine woods , vast and sombre , showed themselves ; then , a little way on , Culm Rock came slowly into view , bald , ragged , and desolate . Noll 's face was very grave , but he kept his place and said nothing . Slowly the curve of the shore unfolded itself , a long line of yellow sand , length after length of scarred and jagged rock . The sound of the surf came faintly out , sounding over the ripple of water about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life , as yet , had showed itself . The vessel kept steadily on till , at last , the whole great breadth of the Rock lay before them , rising huge and massive out of the sea , and , in a sheltered hollow on the shore , a great stone house stood up , gray and weather-beaten as the cliffs about it . " Is that the house ? " Noll asked , turning to the skipper , and laying down his glass . The old sailor nodded assent , thinking to himself that he had never seen it look darker and gloomier , and wondering what the boy thought . " Are n't you going to stop ? " Noll asked , as the " Gull " kept on , and the stone house dropped astern . " Goin ' round to the landin ' , " explained Mr. Snape ; " ' tai n't good moorin 's till ye git half a mile fu'ther round . Ye 'll git ashore pretty quick . " Under the cool and heavy shadow of the Rock they crept , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sun 's setting . All the west was aflame , and the sea glowed and sparkled like molten gold . Even the wretched little Culm fish-huts looked almost fair and comely in this flood of light . Noll Trafford scanned the little wharf , where a motley collection of men were gathered , with a quick-beating heart . Which of them could be Uncle Richard ? Would he give him a kind welcome ? The boy 's spirits began to rise somewhat under the influence of the broad , cheerful glow of sunshine and the speedy prospect of meeting this uncle who was to be as a father to him . The remembrance of the gray old house under the shadow of the rocks around the curve of the shore still lay somewhat heavily on his heart ; but if Uncle Richard were only glad to see him , all that would not matter , he thought . He stood by the prow as the " Gull " moved slowly up to the wharf , eagerly scanning every face that was watching the craft 's motions . A sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for among that idle , shiftless-looking group , there was not one whom he could possibly mistake for his uncle . They were all fishermen , dull-faced , dirty , and out at their elbows . Some frowsy , ill-clad women had come out of their houses , and , with children clinging to their skirts , looked on with idle curiosity . So this was Culm Rock ! Noll 's bright fancies had all fled , and his heart was suddenly very heavy . He looked back across the sea toward Hastings , longingly , and thus verified the skipper 's prediction . If Uncle Richard had only been there to greet him , he thought , chokingly , it would not have mattered so much , but now , it was all forlorn and dreary enough . " ' Tai n't much uv a town after all ; is it ? " drawled Mr. Snape , with a broad grin on his thick features . " Shut up , Jack ! " growled the skipper . " Ca n't ye see the lad 's got all he ken weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough sympathy . " Sorry fur ye ! " he said . " Culm ai n't the place for the like o ' you , an ' what ye cum here fur , I ca n't see . But keep a stout heart , lad , an ' rough it out best way ye can ; ai n't no other way now . " " I 'm going to , " said Noll , with an effort ; " I wo n't mind after a little , I guess . Good-by , skipper ; " and he stepped out on to the little wharf among the fish-folk , who made way , regarding him curiously . " Keep ' long up the shore , " called the master of the " Gull " after him , " and you 'll cum to the house afore long . I 'll send yer trunks up by some o ' these ' ere good-fur-nothin ' Culm folks . Good-by , lad ! " The skipper watched the boyish figure walking away up the sands , and remarked to his mate , " Ef I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd jes ' like the fun o ' bringin ' the ole chap down here on the ' Gull , ' an ' lettin ' him loose to browse on the rocks ,  - -  jes ' to see how he 'd like it ! " Noll walked briskly , trying to keep up good heart by whistling and humming snatches of tunes , looking back over his shoulder at the wonderful gleaming of the west , and the queer picture which the fish-huts and the group of idlers made , with the " Gull " lying by the little wharf , her cloud of canvas yet unfurled and its shadow gleaming white as ivory in the depth of water on which she floated . At his feet the tide was murmuring . How far and vast stretched the sea ! What a minute atom of earth was Culm Rock , compared with the boundless waste of waves which compassed it about ! Bending over all , the evening sky lay cool and serene , flushed , where it met the water , with lovely stains of color . Noll was but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because his heart was filled with conjectures about the stone house and the friend he was to find there . The disappointment of not finding his uncle awaiting him with a warm greeting still lay heavily on his heart ; and as he passed the curve of the shore , and the stone house came in sight , his quick pace slackened , and he walked but slowly . There was no one visible on the piazza . All the doors and windows were closed , though the evening was warm and mild . The boy wondered if his uncle was absent . Perhaps , he thought , with a little thrill of pleasure , that , after all , was the reason why Uncle Richard had failed to meet him . A thin blue film of smoke crept up from one of the tall chimneys , telling him that some one was within the gloomy old structure , which , it seemed to him , looked much more like a grim fortress than a peaceful dwelling . Not a blade of grass or anything green flourished about it ; all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat fast as he went up the piazza-steps , and noted how his footsteps echoed in the silence . He rapped on the great oaken front-door . No one answered the summons . He rapped again , wondering if Uncle Richard was really gone , and his heart began to grow heavy again , as it had done upon his first disappointment at the wharf . The lonely voice of the sea stole up to his ears , and he turned about to look . Twilight was fast settling down upon it , and already the far horizon was hidden ; but along the shore the waves shone and gleamed whitely . Noll 's first pang of genuine homesickness came upon him here . It seemed as if he had not a friend this side of the wide , dark sea . This second summons met with no better success than the first . Noll turned away , went back down the steps , and there stopped to look about him . He discovered some straggling footprints in the sand leading around the corner of the house , and these he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to a long , low projection from the main body of the house , a kitchen it appeared to be , and here he found a wide-open door , from whence came the strains of a hymn half chanted , half sung . Noll rapped . The singing ceased . A slow step came across the kitchen floor , and a voice said , " Bress us ! who 's dis ? " Noll looked up at the wrinkled black face framed by a great yellow turban , and said ,  --  " I 'm Noll Trafford . Didn't -- did n't Uncle Richard expect me ? " Old Hagar threw up both hands crying , shrilly , " Bress de Lord ! is dis Noll Trafford 's boy ? " and then stared blankly at him . " Yes , if you mean Uncle Richard 's brother , " said Noll , still very sad-hearted ; " and was n't he looking for me at all ? " " Bress ye , honey ! " said Hagar , recovering her senses , " he did n't say one single word to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' spose . But do n't ye stan ' on dem yer steps another minnit ; come right in , honey . I 'll see Mas'r Dick dis instant . " Noll followed her into the little kitchen , where on the hearth a fire was crackling and flashing its red flicker over the walls . He sat down on a rough wooden bench by the door , wondering if his uncle could really have forgotten that he was coming , and feeling not all light-hearted , while Hagar clattered away to " see Mas'r Dick . " She came back pretty quick , saying ,  --  " You 's to go right in to de lib'ry , chile , right in jes ' as soon as I git dis yer candle lit ; " and getting down on her knees she puffed away at the coals and burned splinters till she succeeded in coaxing her tallow candle to burn . She got up , came back to where Noll was sitting , and holding the light close to his face , looked down at him long and steadily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curly hair , " you 's de bery picter ob yer father . ' Pears like ' t was him I see 'd dis minnit ' fore me ! Did ye drop down frum de sky , or what , chile ? " " I came down on the ' White Gull , ' " Noll answered . " Well , now ! " said Hagar ; " an ' why did n't yer father come too ? " " Papa ? Oh , why -- papa is dead , " said Noll , with a little quiver in his voice which he could not possibly prevent , he was so lonely and homesick . Old Hagar gave a shrill wail and set her candle down . " Now do n't tell me dat ! " she cried . " Mas'r Oliver dead ? Well , well , honey , we du n no nuffin on dis yer Rock ? De whole ob creation might cum to an ' end , an ' we nebber hear o n't . An ' you 's all alone now , chile ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there wore never truer words spoken . " An ' you 's come down to lib wid yer Uncle Dick ? " " Yes . " " Well , bress de Lord fur dat ! " said Hagar , joyfully ; " could n't a better ting happened to dat yer man , nohow . Jes ' what he wants ,  - -  a boy like yerself , wid yer own father 's face . An ' did Mas'r Dick know ye 's comin ' ? " " Yes , he knew , " said Noll ; " he -- he told me I 'd be welcome . Do you think I am ? " " Why , yes , honey ! What made ye ask dat ? Yer Uncle Dick is a strange man , an ' ye must n't mind if he do n't say much to ye , an '  - -  but come right in de libr'y , chile , fur he 's waitin ' fur ye . Come right along ; I 's lit de lamp in dar ; " and taking up her candle , she led the way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hagar , by way of apology as they entered a long , bare , chilly corridor ; " nobody comes here but me , an ' I do n't mind . It 's only my road frum de libr'y to de kitchen . He nebber comes out here . " From this hall they passed into the dining-room , where stood a supper-table very plainly spread . " Mas'r Dick did n't eat nuffin to-night , " said Hagar , glancing around as she clattered on . At one end of the dining-room they came to a door which the old housekeeper softly opened . " Go right in , honey , " she said to Noll , in a whisper ; " he 's dar , " and then turned away . Richard Trafford sat by one of the great bookcases , reading . The lamplight fell full upon his worn and sorrowful face . He did not hear the door open , did not hear Noll 's light step , and was first conscious of the boy 's presence when two arms were suddenly clasped about his neck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sadness , cried , " Oh , Uncle Richard ! " CHAPTER V. THE FIRST EVENING . Richard Trafford , a little startled , unclasped the boy 's hands without a word , and held him off by one arm . Full in the light he held him , gazing in his face long and keenly . Then he said , " So this is Noll ! " Oh , how coldly the words fell upon the boy 's heart ! How the stern voice and the keen gray eyes chilled him ! Not a word of welcome , after all ,  - -  only those four chilling words . The boy 's disappointment was so great , his heart so lonely and homesick , that he stood with downcast eyes , before his uncle , to hide the tears that glittered in them , and could not answer a word . Trafford released his nephew 's arm with a sigh . The boy was the very counterpart of his father , of Brother Noll , he thought ,  - -  the same fair , high forehead and curling locks , the same deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This resemblance touched him somewhat ; he noted , also , that the boy 's lips quivered a little , and so said , in a kindlier tone ,  --  " You 're very welcome to Culm , Noll . Are you tired with the journey ? " " No -- yes -- some , I mean , " stammered poor Noll , winking hard to keep the tears back . " And you 'd like some supper , I dare say , " continued his uncle . " Yes , by and by , " the nephew managed to answer . A silence fell upon them here ,  - -  long and deep ,  - -  in which the eternal murmur of the sea stole in . Trafford 's eyes did not move from the boy 's face ; and at last he said , taking his hand ,  --  " You 're wonderfully like your father , Noll ,  - -  in more ways than one , I hope . Can a lad like you ever be contented in this old house ? " " I -- I hope so , Uncle Richard , " Noll replied , mocking these words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled grimly . " He 's weary of it already , " he thought ; " and who can wonder ? Noll and I could n't have endured it at his age , I suppose . " Then he added aloud , " If you tire of it , Noll , you shall have liberty to return to Hastings whenever you choose . You 're not to stay against your will , remember . You may find it lonely and dull , perhaps ; if so , I leave you to go or stay , as you choose . " The tone in which this was spoken was so sad that Noll ventured to look up into his uncle 's face . The gray eyes had lost their stern light , and looked very sorrowful . " I -- I will never want to go back , Uncle Richard , if you would like me to stay , " he said , quickly . " Ah , you do n't know what you say , Noll , " Trafford answered , stroking the boy 's hair ; " it 's a lonely place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes find it but a weary resting-place . Ah ! wait and see , wait and see . I 've little hope you 'll stay longer than a month . " At this Noll 's heart gave a leap of joy . " Do you really hope I 'll stay , Uncle Richard ? " he cried . Trafford looked at the boy 's eager , searching face for a second , then answered , " Yes , if you can be contented . " This was hardly such an answer as Noll craved , yet it made his heart lighter . Perhaps it was only Uncle Richard 's way , he thought , which made it seem as though he was not welcome . The old black housekeeper , he remembered , had warned him not to mind it . With this thought , his heart grew somewhat more cheerful , and he began to take a brighter view of things . He noted the tall cases of books and the open organ , and unconsciously these evidences of taste and refinement made the thought of dwelling in the stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , he thought , all the rest would not matter . Trafford let go his hand , saying , " Go and get your supper , Noll ; Hagar will show you . Then , if you like , you can come back . " The boy took two or three steps toward obeying , then , as if remembering some duty unperformed , turned and came back . " I had forgotten the letter ,  - -  papa 's letter ,  - -  Uncle Richard , " he said , drawing the missive from his pocket . " Would you like it now ? " Trafford extended his hand without a word . Noll placed the precious letter therein , and walked away , looking back at the door to see that his uncle had broken the seal . Not till the boy 's footsteps had died away did the uncle look upon the hurriedly-traced lines which the note contained . The letters were feebly made , hinting of the weakness of the hand which traced them . This was what he found :  --  " MY DEAR DICK ,  - -  I write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will ever reach you , or that you are even upon the face of the earth . If ever you do return , if ever you receive this , be kind to my poor Noll for my sake . Make him your own ,  - -  he 'll love you ,  - -  and make him such a man , before God , as you know I would have him . " If he has disappeared , look him up , search for him , and cherish the boy as my precious legacy . And , dear Dick , look well to yourself . A man needs much when he lies where I am lying . We ought to have been more to each other these past years , not living with a great gulf , as it were , atween us . This and the thought of my boy is all that weighs upon me now . " And , dear Dick , till we meet again , farewell , farewell . O. TRAFFORD . " A sudden mist came across the reader 's eyes , a sudden throb to his heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother ! he who had astonished all his friends by studying for a minister , and who , with all the fervor of youth , had devoted every talent and energy to the sacred cause . How he had loved him once ! How proud and happy he had been at his success ! And here were words , his last thoughts on earth , breathed from the very depths of his heart , and thrilling with love for himself and this boy . They stirred the man 's heart as it had not been stirred before since that dreary afternoon when all the joy and sunshine fled out of his heart and left it so cold and bitter . He had not realized before that Brother Noll had really ended his pilgrimage , and passed out of the earth , which , to himself , was such a weary abiding-place . Now , with the last whispers of that dear heart before him , the whole bitter sense of his loss came upon him , and he covered his face , sighing heavily . Back came the remembrance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shining meadows where they strayed together ; with visions of careless , joyful hours , when they sailed and fished and hunted the woods for purple grapes and glossy nuts ; with visions of those calmer days when they grew up to manhood together ,  - -  Noll always bright and brave and loving , and a check upon his own wilder spirits . Now he was gone ; and all the years to come could never again bring joy so deep and love so everlasting . Yet , true and dear to the last , he had breathed his life out in one sweet message to himself , confiding his love and this boy to him as a precious legacy . Trafford almost groaned when he thought of his loss . Oh , what a cruel thing was Death ! A fierce , pitiless robber , seeking for the loveliest and brightest , it had lain in wait , all his life long , despoiling him of whatever he set his heart upon , he thought , and leaving him wrecked and desolate . He had thought that no death or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart aching as wretchedly as ever . Was there no place in the wide , wide earth where such wretchedness could not pursue ? He had hoped to find it in this wild and barren Rock ; yet here sorrow had crept in , bitter and poignant as in the busy city . Trafford rose from his chair , put away the message from out of his sight , and sat down at his organ to still the pain in his heart with the charm of its music . Noll had had his supper , and was sitting , sad and solitary , by Hagar 's fire in the kitchen . He would wait a little , he thought , before going back to the library , that Uncle Richard might have time to read his letter . He wondered what its contents could be , and wished and hoped that papa had written some message there for himself . Would Uncle Richard tell him if there were ? he wondered . Then his thoughts went back over the sea to Hastings , and there came up such pictures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his school friends flocked before him so vividly ,  - -  Ned Thorn 's in particular ,  - -  that he could look about him only through tears that he strove in vain to banish . Hagar had gone out with the candle , so the kitchen was quite dusk , save where the fire flared scarlet light on the wall and ceiling . Suddenly , in this silence , there stole in a heavy throbbing , like the beating of a great , muffled heart , and with a slow and solemn movement , rolled and swept in long chains of sound through the house , till , at last , a clear , sweet , flutelike warble broke in and ran up and down , seeming to wind in and out with the heavy undertone . Hagar came in just then with her flaming candle , and began to rattle about among her pots and kettles . " What is that ? " Noll asked , quickly , as the strains kept stealing in above the clatter which the old negress made . It had startled him at first , coming so suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which seemed to fill the house . " Bress ye , honey ! " said the black old figure , stooping over the cooking utensils on the stone hearth , " do n't ye know ? Dat 's Mas'r Dick at his organ . He sits dar mos ' times at ebenin ' , an ' ' pears like I ken jes ' tell his feelin 's by de music he makes . Sometimes I ken hear it jes ' as sad as nuffin ye ken think ob , an ' sometimes it 's singin ' as ef ' t was ' live and ' joicin . ' It dun make ye homesick ? " queried Hagar , dropping her dishcloth and looking up into the boy 's face . " No , " Noll answered , with a sigh , " ' tis n't the music . It will all be gone in the morning , I guess , " and tried to look his cheeriest . " You 's tired out , chile , " said Hagar , with ready sympathy ; " better go to bed . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' side o ' Mas'r Dick 's . Bes ' room in de whole house ! " The music had ceased , and Noll left his seat and went groping his way along the dark , echoing hall , through the dimly-lighted dining-room to the library-door . Entering , he found his uncle still seated before the organ , but with his head bent forward upon the music-rack , and apparently lost in deep thought , for he did not look up till Noll stood beside him . Trafford made a faint attempt to smile , and asked ,  --  " Could Hagar find you anything fit to eat ? We ca n't live here as at Hastings . The sea brings us our food . " Noll said something about not being hungry , and presently Trafford asked , with the stem and gloomy look upon his face ,  --  " Did you know that Brother Noll , your father , did a very unwise thing when he put you into my hands ? " Noll started at the strangeness of the question , and the bright color came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong ? " he asked , quickly . " Yes , so far as your good is concerned . I can be no companion for you . You would have got more good anywhere else than here . " " Do n't say that , Uncle Richard ! " Noll pleaded . " Why not ? " Trafford queried , not unkindly ; " it is the truth . " " Papa said that you -- you --  " There was such a choking in Noll 's throat that he could get no further , and stopped , looking very much distressed . Trafford took the boy 's hand in his own . " My boy , " he said , huskily , calling him by that title for the first time , " I 'm but a poor wreck at best . I can teach you no good , and God knows I would n't be the means of putting a shadow of evil in your heart . Your father says , ' Make him such a man , before God , as you know I would have him . ' He asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't rule myself . " Noll said not a word . Uncle Richard was getting to be more of a mystery to him than Culm Rock had been . " And , " continued Trafford , " we will leave the matter thus : you shall be at liberty , after the first month , to go or stay , as you like . If you go , it shall be to stay away forever ; if you stay , it shall be at your own risk . Do you understand ? " " Yes , Uncle Richard . " Trafford saw the boy 's lips quiver again , and turned quickly away ; the face was so much like his dead brother 's . Noll came to him pretty soon , said " Good-night , " and went away . Hagar guided the boy up to his room , bidding him good-night with many assurances that " ' tw'u 'd be pleasanter to-morrow , ' nough sight ! " and left him to himself . The stars shone brightly over the sea . Noll could not read his Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mamma was locked in the trunk away round the shore at Culm ; but he prayed with all the stronger longing for the Saviour 's pity and help ; and then from his bed by one of the great windows , lay listening to the moaning of the tide below , which seemed the saddest , lonesomest sound he had ever heard . And his heart ached too . CHAPTER VI . CULM SIGHTS . When Noll awoke the next morning , the sun was shining brightly in . It was not until after some long minutes of yawning and rubbing his eyes , that he comprehended where he was ; then , with some chills of disappointment , he remembered , and bounded up to look out the window . The sea lay rippling , cool and fresh below . Here and there faint trails of mist floated and hovered over the waves , but the breeze was fast tearing and blowing them away . With a feeling of delight , he saw on the far horizon-line the white film of shadowy sails . It showed that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pleasant to think of them as bound for far-off Hastings . Then he remembered Skipper Ben and the " White Gull , " and wondered when he would return ; and then Mr. Gray 's note had not been written , he recollected . " Well , " thought Noll , " I 'll find time for it to-day , I guess . I wonder if my trunks will come this morning ? and -- When am I to begin my studies , and who am I to recite to ? " This last thought had not entered his head before . There was evidently not a school of any kind upon Culm Rock , and of course Uncle Richard was the only person capable of teaching him anything . " I wonder if he will offer to teach me ? " Noll thought in perplexity , " or shall I have to ask him ? I ca n't do that ! he 's so cold and stern ; and besides , I do n't believe he would like the trouble . I wonder if I am to grow up like those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busily enough of a dozen troublesome matters which had already sprung up to puzzle him , and with these in his head , went down-stairs . He found the dining-room at last , after getting into three or four empty , unoccupied rooms , and there found Hagar putting the last dishes upon the breakfast-table . " You 's lookin ' brighter , honey , " said she , gleefully . " Did n't dis yer ole woman tell ye so ? Ki ! I knowed how ' tw'u 'd be las ' night . " " It does seem pleasanter , " Noll admitted ; " and where 's Uncle Richard ? " " Mas'r Dick ? He 's in de libr'y ; goin ' to call him dis minnit . Breakfas ' dun waitin ' for ye both , honey ; an ' , bress de Lord ! how much ye looks like yer father dis mornin ' ! " and Hagar caressed the boy 's hair with her skinny old hands , muttering , as she gazed affectionately in his face , " You 's de bery picter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trafford thought as he answered the old housekeeper 's call and entered the dining-room where his nephew was waiting with a cheery " Good-morning , Uncle Richard . " The boy 's sunshiny face , somehow , made the great room brighter , Trafford thought , and Hagar bustled about and poured the coffee with a lighter heart than she had had since leaving her people at Hastings . Illustration : " Good morning , Uncle Richard , " Page 92 . " Jes ' what 's been lackin ' de whole time ! " she thought to herself ; " Mas'r Dick wants somethin ' he ken love and talk to . ' Pears like dar 'll be a change in dis yer ole house afore long , de Lord willin ' . " It was such a long time since the old negress had seen a young face , or heard the pleasant accents of a young voice , that she made various pretexts for lingering in the room while the two sat at the table , and though it was for the most part a silent meal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hagar thought . And when the two had left the table and gone to the library , she soliloquized , " Nebber thought I 'd see a day like dis yer , agen ! Wonder what Mas'r Dick t'inks o ' de boy ? Bress de chile ! if mas'r do n't take to him , ' pears like he 'll nebber take to nuffin . Be like habbin ' poor Mas'r Noll 's face afore him de whole time , an ' ef he ken stan ' dat , athought lubbin ' him , I 's ' feard he 's dun got colder'n a stone , de whole ob him . You jes ' wait an ' see , Hagar ! " Noll followed his uncle from the breakfast-table into the library , hoping that he would at once say something about his books or studies , or at least hint what plans he had made concerning himself . It would be a great deal pleasanter , Noll thought , to have Uncle Richard dispose of him , even in a stern , cold way , than to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether he studied or grew up in ignorance . But Trafford had relapsed into one of his gloomy , absent moods , and took up a book as soon as he reached the library , without a look or word for Noll . The boy stood by one of the great windows and looked out on the sea , striving to drown his disappointment by thinking of other matters . When he had tired of this , and found that disappointment was long-lived , and would not be drowned , he loitered by the bookcases , reading the titles , now and then peering into a volume and looking over its top at his uncle , and thinking him a very cold or else a very forgetful man . When he had made the tour of the room several times , and was about to go out in despair , Trafford looked up . " Noll , did you wish to speak to me ? " he asked , abruptly . The question came upon Noll unawares . " Yes , if -- if you were not too -- too busy , " he stammered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my books -- my studies , I mean , Uncle Richard . " " What about them ? " " Why , whether I were to study with you , or by myself , or how ; and whether I am to begin now , or wait a while , " said Noll , wishing that his uncle would look less keenly at him . Trafford leaned his head upon his hand and reflected a little . At last he said ,  --  " You will wait , Noll , till your month is up . There would be no use in beginning studies which , perchance , may end in so short a time . If , at the end of four weeks , you conclude to stay , then we will talk about study . Till then , you will wait . " Noll 's blue eyes said , as plainly as eyes could , " Do n't mention that month again , Uncle Richard ! " but his tongue was silent , and he acquiesced in this decision by a nod of his head . " You can fill up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like . You had best make yourself acquainted with the Rock before you decide to stay here . You will hardly explore it all in one day , I think ; " and with this Trafford turned again to his book . Noll found his hat and went out , determined to keep a brave heart if Uncle Richard was cold and gloomy . If there was no other way , he would make him love him , he thought , though how that was to be done he had , as yet , but a very slight idea . He went through the dining-room , and from thence found his way to the broad front piazza which faced the sea , and where , the previous evening , he had stood so lonely and homesick . Everything looked much cheerier to him now , and he ran down the sand , in front of the house , to the water 's edge , resolved to see the bright side of everything which pertained to gray , barren Culm . There were stranded shells and bright-hued weeds on the wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with delight . " Would n't Ned 's eyes open to see these ! " he thought , " and would n't the dear old fellow like some for his museum ! I 'll gather a whole box full and send them up by the skipper some day . " Thinking of the skipper made Noll remember his trunks , and he wondered if the " White Gull " had continued her voyage farther down the shore . " There 's a whole month to explore and pick up shells in , " he said to himself , " and I 'll take this forenoon to go around to the landing and see the skipper , if he 's there . " With this thought , he started off , hoping to find the " Gull " still lying off the little wharf . The skipper seemed almost like an old friend , already ; and , however rough he might be , he came from Hastings , and this fact alone made the boy long for a sight of his face . So he hastened along the sand , toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he passed . Great boulders , all green and fringed with sea-weed , were strewn everywhere ,  - -  in the yellow sand of the beach , in the line of the tide and waves which whitened themselves to foam , and murmured hoarsely against them . In some places the great mass of the rock came down so near the water 's edge that only a slender path of pebbles was left between it and the waves . In high tide , Noll thought , this narrow way must be quite covered , and he wondered why the sea did not carry it quite away . But in other places the beach was broad and smooth , quite wide enough for many horsemen to ride abreast . This morning the sea was peaceful and calm . Neither did it look so vast and illimitable as on the previous night . The tide was going out , stranding great quantities of glittering weeds and all sorts of curious objects , the sight of which made Noll 's heart glad ; but , without stopping to examine or preserve them , he hastened on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But in this he was disappointed . No sooner had he passed the curve of the shore than he saw that the skipper and his craft were gone . There were his trunks to see to , however ; so he kept on , though at a slower pace , wondering if those dull-looking fishermen could tell him when the " Gull " would return . Not half so fair or comely did the dozen houses look as in the gold of sunset . Such racked , weather-beaten dwellings Noll had never seen before . It was a mystery how they could ever stand in a high gale . Not a solitary vestige of anything green was there to enliven the barrenness . Long lines of seine were stretched upon stakes , and dangled from the sides of boulders upon the shore . In the sand some dirty-faced children were playing , who got up and ran away at his approach . A little farther on he came upon two fishermen dividing a basket of fish . They looked up , stared , and nodded respectfully . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ben , ye mean ? " asked one of the men , suspending his labor to take a more leisurely survey of the questioner . " Yes , Ben Tate , " said Noll . " Afore sunrise , " said the other . " Did ye want the skipper , lad ? " " No , not particularly . When is he going to stop here again ? " " Ben ? Why , he comes Mondays and Thursdays , he does , " said the fisherman ; " ye 'll find him here day after to-morrow , lad ,  - -  early , too , mos ' like . " " Can you tell me where he left my trunks ? " queried Noll . At this question , the men looked perplexed . " Do ye mean boxes like ? " they asked , after a time . Noll was astonished at this lack of knowledge , but managed to explain to the two what he meant . " Ye 'd best go up to Dirk Sharp 's , " said one ; " the skipper leaves much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be like to find ' em there . " " Back o ' the wharf , lad ,  - -  back o ' the wharf Dirk lives , " the other called to Noll , as he walked away . Dirk Sharp 's house was rather smarter than the others ,  - -  at least , it was in better repair ; but the look which Noll caught of its interior , as he stood rapping by the open door , sufficed to destroy any anticipations of industry or thriftiness which he might have formed from the dwelling 's exterior . Dirk was a great broad-shouldered , slouching fellow , with a general air of shiftlessness about him . At Noll 's summons , he came lounging out of an inner room , and , catching sight of the boy , said ,  --  " Lookin ' for yer trunks , lad ? The skipper said ye was to hev ' em las ' night , shore ; but ye see , " pulling up his sleeve , " as how I got a cut what 's hindered , " displaying a long , bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' had ' em , lad , but for that , as the skipper said . But ef ye ken wait till the men get back from their seinin '  - -  Ho ! there be Bob an ' Darby now , " he exclaimed , as he spied the two whom Noll had just passed . " Ahoy there , lads ! here be a job fur ye ! " he cried to the fishermen . The two left their work and came up to Dirk . " Here be two trunks to go ' roun ' to the stone house fur this lad , " said he . " Ef ye 'll shoulder ' em roun ' the shore , yer welcome to what the skipper left fur't . What ye say , lads ? " " We 'll do't fur ye , Dirk , seein ' yer cut , " said the one who was called Darby . " Where be the boxes , man ? " Dirk led them into the inner room , from whence they presently emerged , each with a trunk on his shoulder , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Noll followed slowly after , wondering why they did not use their boat , instead of enduring such back-breaking toil . It struck him that he had never seen such dull , apathetic faces as these Culm people had . Such utter shiftlessness as everything about the cluster of tumble-downs betokened he had never imagined . Perhaps all this dreariness and desolation made itself more keenly felt because the boy was just from the city , which teemed with life and bustle and energy . In its poorest quarter he had never seen such a lack of tidiness as the interior of Dirk Sharp 's house presented . He followed the slowly-plodding trunk-bearers up the yellow sand , wondering if there was such another wretched , desolate , and forlorn place as Culm Rock in the whole wide earth . CHAPTER VII . HOW THE MONTH WAS SPENT . They were a long time in getting to the stone house . Before they passed the curve of the shore , the sun was well up in the sky and beat down with fervid rays upon the sweating , toiling fishermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his room at the top of the stairs , and the men had taken their departure , each with a piece of silver in addition to the skipper 's fee . It seemed to him that there was no bright side to the life over in those wretched Culm huts . If there was , he could not see it . It puzzled and perplexed him to imagine how human beings could live in such ignorance and apathy of all that was transpiring about them ; and the sights which he had seen in the miserable , tumbledown village left a very disagreeable feeling in his heart . Somehow , his hitherto blithe spirits were dampened by this morning 's walk , and he thought the great bare Rock would be a great deal more endurable if the fish-huts and their inmates were only off it . True , it would be much lonelier , but that was far more endurable than the sight of such shiftlessness and ignorance . He wondered if Uncle Richard ever went among them , and whether he really knew what a degraded people they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , it was very strange that he did not try to lift them up , teach them something , or , at least , have a school opened for the children . Papa , he thought , would have done something for them long ago . There would have been a little schoolhouse and a teacher . A new wharf , he was sure , would have taken the place of the rickety old thing ; and by degrees the women would have learned thrift and neatness , and the men energy and industry . To be sure , it seemed a great deal to do for such dull , apathetic people , who seemed not to have a particle of energy and ambition about them ; but papa , he thought , could have done it , and would have done it , had he lived here as long as Uncle Richard . He remembered a little sea-town , where they had lived before dwelling in Hastings , how wretched and dirty and ignorant the fishermen were , and what a great change for the better came over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone , and Uncle Richard ? The man was so much of a mystery to Noll , as yet , that he did not know whether there were any hopes of his setting himself to the task of lifting the Culm people out of their slough of wretchedness ; but he hoped that his uncle would see and realize what needed to be done before another year had worn away . And if he did not ? Why , then they would have to go on in their old way , he thought . He wished that he might do something toward the work ; but , then , how could he ? He had no money , and no means of getting any , and he was not fifteen . Noll put away , or tried to do so , all thoughts of the Culm people and their life , and went to writing the note which Skipper Ben was to carry to Mr. Gray on his return to Hastings . When it was finished , he unlocked his trunk , took a look at the thumbed , worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar covers of his school-books , which brought up a hundred visions of pleasant , happy hours in the great , buzzing schoolroom ,  - -  wondered if he should ever know such joyful moments again , it seemed quite an impossibility , now ,  - -  and took up , one by one , the keepsakes and knick-knacks which his boy friends had given him on his departure . There was the new ball which Sam Scott had given him ,  - -  how Sam did love ball-playing !  - -  and which was now not of the least possible use to him . There was a great bundle of fish-hooks which Archie Phillips had bestowed upon him , more in fun than in earnest , but which Noll had treasured because Archie was his seat-mate . Then there were all sorts of relics and mementos , such as boys set their hearts upon ,  - -  bits of carved wood , favorite drawing pencils , a purple amethyst , which Johnny Moore , whose father had been in India , had given him , and , best of all , there was Ned Thorn 's dear , merry face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Ned 's own hands had placed it the night before his departure . Looking at this face , and gazing upon these mementos of his friends , did not serve to make Noll at all more contented with Culm Rock and the prospect before him , and , being presently made aware of this by the heaviness which began to settle upon his heart , he closed the trunks in great haste , and ran off . The day passed quickly enough , even for Noll , and was only the first of many happy ones spent by the shore and on the rocks . The boy had a taste for treasuring curiosities , and in the wonderful wealth of weed and shell which the sea was continually throwing upon the sand , his love of collecting and preserving was gratified . Every return of the tide was a great sweeping in of the wonders and beauties of the sea to add to his stores . There was always something new and strange to excite his delight and admiration . Then , too , there were long hours spent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to grow familiar to the boy . He climbed to Wind Cliff , and from its top looked down on the Culm houses on the sand , and into the gulls ' nests far below in the crevices of the rock , and enjoyed their wild wheeling and screaming about him as he stood there . From this high look-out he often stood looking upon such sunsets as he had never seen before . High up toward the zenith the sun shot its great banners of flame as it dipped in the sea , and made the vast expanse glow and glitter . In the east the sails flitted along the purple line of the horizon , and down in the dusk shadow of the Rock he could see the grim stone house and the blue thread of smoke from Hagar 's kitchen chimney . Sometimes he made use of Archie Phillips ' gift , and caught fish off the rocks , much to the advantage of the old housekeeper 's dinner-table . One week after another passed , and still there seemed plenty of variety and amusement for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a little cluster of graves , with the rudest of monuments to mark them ,  - -  most of them were rough head-boards in which the sleeper 's name was cut or scratched ,  - -  and this sight of such poor , uncared-for resting-places in the sand made him sad and thoughtful for more than one day . What if he were to die and be buried there , too ? he surmised . The thought chilled him . True , he knew that heaven beyond was just as bright and fair for all that the graves were so forlorn and dreary ; but the thought of lying far from all his friends , on bare and lonely Culm Rock , oppressed him till new sights and adventures had somewhat effaced the remembrance of the sight from his mind . Nearly one day was spent in the pine woods , whose fragrance and sombre light , and the deep hush reigning within , both awed and delighted him . Then there were days of storm and mist which could only be spent in his chamber or in the library . Uncle Richard was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chilled the boy 's heart with his coldness , and sometimes touched it by his prolonged and heavy sadness . Noll found more ways than one to make his affection known , and even when his uncle was stern almost to harshness , found some excuse for his unkindness in his warm heart , thinking that all would come right at last , and Uncle Richard lose his coldness and be as kind and regardful as he could wish . Only once did he lose his temper and rebel , and for this Noll repented heartily as soon as it was done . He went into the library one afternoon and asked permission to go around to Culm and climb up to the gulls ' nests on Wind Cliff . He had explored every nook of the Rock , and this was a pleasure which he had reserved till the last , and , though not quite confident of being successful in an attempt to scale the precipitous cliff , yet he was eager and anxious enough to make the trial . Trafford was in one of his gloomiest moods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break your neck , I suppose , sir , and give me the pleasure of seeing you brought home bruised and bleeding ! No , you shall not go near Wind Cliff ! " The angry color came into Noll 's face in an instant . " I believe it would be a pleasure for you to see me brought home with a broken neck ! " he cried , impetuously ; " and oh , I wish I were back in Hastings , where somebody cared for me ! " And with this Noll hurried out of the library , slamming the door behind him . Trafford heard these words with astonishment ; then , as his nephew 's footsteps died away along the hall , he covered his face and sighed heavily . " Ah , " he thought , " I did it for his good ; yet -- the boy distrusts me . He ca n't know what I would be to him if I could ; how can he ? He thinks me cold and unloving , and -- well , he has reason to . " Hardly had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Noll re-entered . Trafford did not look up , did not hear him , in fact , and presently was startled by a voice saying , brokenly ,  --  " Uncle Richard ! " Then he looked up . Noll stood before him with downcast eyes and a trembling lip . " Well ? " said Trafford , speaking neither with coldness nor yet with kindness . " I -- I -- I did n't mean what I said a few minutes ago , Uncle Richard , " said Noll , chokingly ; " there was not a word of truth in it , and I ought n't to have said such a thing . " A deep silence followed , broken at last by another " Well ? " from Trafford 's lips . " Will you forgive me , Uncle Richard ? I was angry then , and I do n't wish I was back at Hastings , " said Noll , grieved , and fearful lest he had only put a wider gulf between himself and his uncle . Trafford was silent so long that the boy ventured to raise his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was regarding him with eyes that were neither cold nor stern , but almost tender and yearning . " Oh ! do you forgive me ? " Noll cried , taking hope . Trafford laid his hand on his nephew 's fair , curly hair , stroking it gently as he had once before done on the boy 's arrival . " You need not ask that , Noll , " he said . " Go where you will ,  - -  I can trust you . " " But I 'll not go to Wind Cliff ? " said Noll , " and I wish -- you do n't know how much , Uncle Richard !  - -  that I could take back those words . " " There is no need , " said his uncle . " Go where you will . " Noll took his departure , more confident than ever that under Uncle Richard 's coldness and seeming indifference there lurked love and regard for himself , and , true to his word , gave up all idea of ascending the cliff . As for Trafford , though outwardly stern and cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more yearningly after that . The month was drawing near its close , and in spite of himself , he could not regard the approaching day on which Noll 's decision was to be made without some forebodings . Yet , lest the boy should be influenced by perceiving that his uncle wished his presence , Trafford was gloomier and more forbidding than ever , those last days . The boy should be perfectly free to make his choice , he thought ; he would use no influence to change or bias his decision in any manner . " Everything I have set my heart upon has been snatched away by death , " he said to himself ; " Noll shall stay only because it is his choice . Never will I , by look or voice , influence him to share my life and loneliness . If he stays , and I love him as my own , just so surely will death snatch him away . " But that the boy was a great comfort and delight to him he could not but confess to himself . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks , his cheery presence had won upon his heart . He watched him from the window as he walked on the sand below , searching for sea treasures , and could not endure the thought of having the boyish figure gone forever out of his sight . Neither could he think of the loneliness and silence which would settle down upon the old house when the gladsome voice and quick footsteps were gone , without a sigh . Now it was a great pleasure to go out to the tea-table at evening and find Noll , fresh and ruddy from his ramble on the shore and rocks , awaiting him one side the table with his grave and yet merry face . How would it be when he was gone ? It were a great deal better , Trafford thought , that the boy had never come to brighten the old house with sunshine for a brief space , if now he went and left it darker and gloomier than before . And would he go ? He should be left to choose for himself , the uncle thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NOLL 'S DECISION . Noll stayed . The day on which the decision was to be made he came into the library , where Trafford sat , saying , gravely , " Uncle Richard , to-day I was to choose , you know ; and I would rather stay at Culm Rock and be your boy than to go back . May I ? " " May you ? " exclaimed Trafford , on the impulse of the moment , while even his heavy heart was glad . " How can you ask that ? Oh , Noll ! do you know what you are doing ? " " To be sure , Uncle Richard ! I 'm going to stay with you , " replied Noll , without any shadow of regret in his eyes . " Ah , boy , I fear you will rue it , " said his uncle , shaking his head mournfully ; " remember , whatever befalls , that I did not bid you stay , it was at your own risk . " " Why , what do you mean ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is to befall me , Uncle Richard ? " " I know not ,  - -  I know not , " Trafford answered ; " there may be nothing to harm you ; yet death ever snatches all that is dear to me , and I tremble for you , my boy . " Noll looked grave and puzzled still . " I do n't understand , Uncle Richard , " he said . " No ; how can you ? " his uncle said , after a pause . " To you , death is only God 's hand ; to me , it -- oh , Noll , I can not tell you what it is ! I do n't wish to shock you , boy , but I 'm a long way from where your father was when he penned me that calm note ,  - -  lying in the very arms of death at the moment . " Noll was silent . " Yes , " continued Trafford , " for me there is no brightness beyond the depths of the grave . All is dark ,  - -  dark ! and so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been lost to me there ! Ah , my hope was all wrecked long ago ! " Noll looked up quickly , with , " Papa lost to you , to me , Uncle Richard ? Oh , that is not true at all ! Papa lost to us ? " " Not to you , not to you , Noll , thank God ! " Trafford replied ; " but to me , yes ! His faith he left to you ,  - -  I can see , I feel it ; but I have none . " Noll looked up to the sad-eyed , gloomy man , and fathomed the mystery of his sorrow at once . Who would not be forever sad with nothing beyond the grave but blank and darkness in which loved hearts were alway vanishing ? " Oh , Uncle Richard , " said he , " I 'm sorry for you ! " " I do n't deserve it , " Trafford said , with unusual tenderness . " How can you love such a man as myself ? Oh , my boy , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; go where you 'll find some one that can care for you better than I ! " But Noll 's face suddenly grew bright . " I would n't do that , " he said , earnestly ,  --  " never , Uncle Richard ! Papa said I was to live with you and love you , and I will , unless you wish me to go . And if you do not , do n't tell me to leave you again ! " " I will not , Noll , " Trafford said . So it was all settled , at last , and Noll 's heart -- in spite of Uncle Richard 's gloominess -- was light and glad . He would stay and see if the man 's sorrow and wretchedness could not be driven away , he thought ; perhaps -- who could tell ?  - -  he would lose his sternness , and become kind and regardful , and follow in the path which papa had trod . It all seemed very doubtful now , it was true , but such a thing might be , after a time . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I would much rather stay with you , Uncle Richard -- always . And now shall we talk about studies ? " " True , we were to consider that matter , " said his uncle ; " yet I had little hope that you would stay , then . What do you study , Noll ? " " At Hastings I had arithmetic and geography and Latin . Then with papa I studied history , and a little -- a very little , Uncle Richard -- in mineralogy ,  - -  he liked that so , you know . " " And what do you propose to do here ? " asked his uncle . " I would like to do just the same , " said Noll , " and keep up with my class , perhaps . " " He has still some thoughts of returning ? " Trafford wondered ; then said aloud , " Well , it shall be as you like . And when will you commence ? " " At once , if you please , Uncle Richard . I 've had such a long vacation that it will seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're all waiting for me up-stairs . Shall I get them ? " Noll bounded away as his uncle nodded assent , and went up-stairs with a merry whistle . Trafford listened to the quick footsteps and the light-hearted music , and really rejoiced that they were not to flee and leave the old house desolate . It would be a brighter dwelling than it had been till -- till death came , he thought . And if he could not teach the boy as Brother Noll had desired him to do , yet he would see that in the matter of books and study he had every advantage . So , when the boy came down with his arms full of books , he set himself to his task with an earnestness that pleased Noll wonderfully . " Uncle Richard means that I shall progress , " he thought ; " and oh , I do hope I can keep up with Ned and the rest ! " Trafford found his nephew an apt scholar . He had expected that , however , for the boy came of a book-loving race . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , he would sometimes have wearied of his task of hearing the recitations every day ; but as it was , he found a positive pleasure in his capacity as Noll 's instructor , and generally a relief from his gloominess . Noll 's study-hours were at his own discretion ; the recitations came in the afternoon , and after four the boy had the remainder of the day to spend as he liked . Sometimes the shore claimed him , sometimes the rocks . Then there were excursions , in company with old Hagar , to the solitude of the pines , after cones and dry , resinous branches for the kitchen fire , which never seemed to burn well unless the old housekeeper had an abundance of this kindling material . " Nuffin like dem yer pine cones fur winter mornin 's , " Hagar always said ; and many were the visits which she and " Mas'r Noll " paid to the woods , returning with laden baskets . Somehow , after a time , the boy found more delight in these simple pleasures than at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have found no entertainment in a journey into the forest after cones ,  - -  there were other delights in abundance , then ; but now , forced to get all his enjoyment out of the simplest , humblest events , this work of gathering winter fuel grew to be a positive pleasure , after the recitations were over , and the short October days drawing to a close . Then , too , the winter stores were being brought down from Hastings on the " Gull , " and Skipper Ben and his crew came often to the stone house , to break the monotony of days in some little manner . " Yer ' live an ' hearty yet , lad ! " was his greeting as he came around in the " Gull 's " boat with a variety of provisions for winter use , one cloudy afternoon . " Well , I mus ' say I did n't think to find ye so ? Lonesome any ? Goin ' to let me carry ye back to Hastings afore the ' Gull ' stops runnin ' ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to stay , skipper . " " Ye 'll find the weather a tough un , bime-by , " drawled Mr. Snape , as he rolled a flour-barrel up the sand . " Yes , " said the skipper , " winters are mos'ly hard uns down here . An ' what ye goin ' to do when the ' Gull ' stops cruisin ' fur the season , an ' ye ca n't get a word frum the city ? " This was a contingency for which Noll had made no calculation . Not hear a word from Hastings for a whole long winter ? " Well , " he said at last , " that is n't pleasant to think of , but I 'll manage somehow , skipper . And you must bring me a great packet of letters to last till the ' Gull ' commences her trips again . " " Ay , lad , " said the skipper , his eyes twinkling . " What be these ? " drawing a parcel from under his pea-jacket . Noll 's eager " Letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderfully . " Yes , these be letters , " he said , chuckling ; " Jack , here , talks o ' runnin ' a smack down this winter purpose to bring yer mail ! " " ' Tw'u 'd take something bigger'n a smack , " observed Mr. Snape , looking askance to see how Noll grasped the precious parcel . " All yer frien 's said as how I was to bring ye back on the ' Gull , ' " called the skipper after him , as Noll went running across the sand toward the house . " Oh , how I wish -- No ! I ca n't go , skipper ; it 's no use talking , " Noll answered back as he gained the piazza , and there sat down to open his precious missives . Five or six of his boy friends had agreed to surprise him each with a letter , and here they were , together with a kind note from Mr. Gray . What a comfort and pleasure they were ! It was almost like seeing the writers ' faces and talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piazza while he sat there absorbed in their contents , and as he walked along toward the skipper , who stood waiting at the bottom of the steps , noted the boy 's eager , delighted face , and wondered why the lad did not return to his friends , where , it was quite evident , he was much desired and longed for . Why did he stay on this dreary Rock ? What was there here to make the place endurable for a boy of his age and tastes ? He could not see . Those were the last letters which Noll received . The " Gull " made one or two trips after that , but the first of November brought keen , sleety weather , and Skipper Ben came no more ; so that for the long months ahead Culm Rock was to be shut out from the world entirely . The thought of being isolated from all assistance , in case of illness or trouble , oppressed Noll somewhat till he had accustomed himself to the thought , and then a vague dread of loneliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a time . But getting bravely over these , and interested in his studies , he began to find that the November days were not so intolerable , after all . Uncle Richard had surprised him one day by bringing in a writing-table , from one of the unoccupied rooms , and placing it opposite his own chair by one of the tall windows . " For your books , Noll , " he had said ; and from thenceforth the boy 's well-worn school volumes had a place there , and study in the cold chamber was exchanged for the comfortable warmth of the library . It was not an unpleasant schoolroom , by any means , though the high , old window framed nothing but a great stretch of sea and sky ,  - -  both , this chilly month of November , often gray and misty . Instead of the roar and din of the city which sounded about the dearly-remembered room at Hastings , there was the hoarse murmur of the tide on its rocks and pebbles , the wild whirling of the wind and its screaming around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any of them ; yet , in the still afternoons , and the cozy quietness of long evenings when the lamp shed its mild light over the room , and the fire on the hearth shone redly , there was such calm and peace for books and study as Noll found both pleasant and profitable . In these days , you may be sure , the boy 's thoughts were often across the vast gray sea in front of his window , even when he was bending over his problems or translations ; not that he regretted his decision to share Uncle Richard 's life with him , nor that he had any thoughts of fleeing away , but those flitting sails on the far horizon were messengers which alway bore on their white wings thoughts of hope and love and patience to those over the sea . It was not the natural sphere of a boy ,  - -  this monotonous , unvarying round of days , with no companions of his age or tastes ; and , as week after week passed , and Noll was still blithe and apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surmise a reason for it ; though , had he observed closely , it would not have been a great mystery . For Noll there was the unfailing comfort of the little Bible which lay beside the huge old bed up-stairs , and which gave the double comfort of its own blessedness and the remembrance of its preciousness to her who turned its pages to the last ; and there were ever the pitying ears of Jesus ready to hear the story of discouragement and loneliness , when the burden of slow , weary days seemed too heavy to bear . Into Trafford 's life had come more brightness and content than he had known since that dark day when his wife left him and vanished in the darkness which , to his eyes , filled and hovered over the grave . It did not , as yet , seem like a real and lasting joy ; he trembled lest some day it should prove but a dream , a vision , and so vanish . He often laid aside his book and looked up , half expecting to find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was the only inhabitant of the great library ; but there , at the opposite window , sat the pleasant figure of the boy , busy with his books , and as real and tangible as heart could wish . It was a perpetual delight , though he hid all knowledge of it from Noll , to feel that the boy was present , to see him curled up in a great chair by the fire , watching the flames or the depths of rosy coal , of a twilight , and to feel that he was his ,  - -  a precious gift to love and cherish . So the man 's heart began to go out toward the boy ,  - -  tremblingly , warningly at first , then , as he found him true and worthy , with all its might and all the fervor of which it was capable . CHAPTER IX . DIRK 'S TROUBLE . Noll closed his books one afternoon after recitations , saying , " I 'll put on my overcoat , Uncle Richard , and take a run up the shore ,  - -  just for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunder ! I have n't seen them so large since I came to Culm . " " Look out for the tide , " continued his uncle ; " keep away from that narrow strip of sand up the shore , for the waves will cover it in an hour . " Noll promised to be cautious , and ran off after cap and overcoat . Hagar met him as he came down from his room all muffled for the walk , and exclaimed ,  --  " Bress ye , honey ! where ye bound fur now ? Dis yer is a drefful bad time on de shore ! I 's ' feard to hev ye roun ' dar ! " looking at him anxiously . Noll laughed merrily . " Do you think I 'm too small to take care of myself , Hagar ? " he asked ; " I 'm only going for a walk , and to see the waves . I 'll be back for supper with Uncle Richard . " The sky was wild and gray with clouds . A keen , chilly wind swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark , foam-fringed waves rode grandly in upon the beach with a thunderous shock as they flew into spray . Some of the spray mist wet Noll 's face , even as he stood upon the piazza steps . But , warmly clad , and loving the sight of the wild tumult , he started with a light heart for his walk up the shore . As far as he could see , the sea was dark and gloomy , with long curves of foam whitening its surface and gleaming on the crests of its racing waves . At his feet , on the sand , lay great tangles of kelp and flecks of yeasty froth . The air was keen , and frosty enough to film the still pools in the hollows with brittle ice , and where the spray fell upon the rocks , it congealed and cased the old boulders with glittering mail . Not a sail was there in sight , and Noll thought the sea had never looked so vast and lonely as now . Along the horizon the clouds were white-edged , and seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stopped under the shelter of a rock to look behind him , over the path which he had trodden . The stone house looked dark and forbidding , like everything else under this wild gray sky ; but Noll had long ago ceased to consider it as resembling a prison . It was home , now , and so took a fairer , brighter shape in his eyes . Beyond , the pines stood up against the sky , full of sombreness and inky shadow . " How cold and desolate everything is ! " thought Noll ; " but it 's not half so gloomy as it seems , after all . I wish , though , that Ned -- dear fellow !  - -  was here , just to make it lively once in a while . " He walked on , listening to the heavy thunder of waves , and looking upon the troubled waste of sea , till he came to the curve of the shore . Here lay the narrow path of pebbles against which his uncle had warned him . But there seemed no immediate danger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as there was yet an hour before the tide would be in , Noll hurried across , the salt spray flying wildly about him . " I 'll go on a little further , " he thought , " and I shall get home long enough before tea-time , then . " Having gone a little way , however , he chanced to remember that he had not been at Culm village for a month , at least , and longed to take a run down to the little cluster of houses . " How the waves will dash in there ! " he thought ; " and I wonder how those huts stand such a tempest as this ? I 've a good mind to go , anyhow , it 's such a good chance to see the place in a gale . " He wavered and walked hesitatingly about in the sand for a few minutes , and at last decided to go . He ran and walked by turns , the wind blowing his curly locks in his eyes and taking his breath almost away with its fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the waves jarred and thundered heavier on this Culm side than on his own quarter of the Rock ; at any rate , the wind was more powerful , and blew the spray upon him in showers . " I 'll get drenched , if the wind keeps on like this ! " he thought ; " if I were n't so near , I 'd turn back ; but the houses are in sight , already , and I 've got to get acquainted with salt water . I 'll keep on ! " When he drew near the little settlement , he was tired enough with running and battling the wind , and was content to take a slower pace . Never had the fishermen 's huts looked so forlorn and miserable as now . Noll half expected to see them come tumbling and rolling along the sand in every gust of wind which struck them ; yet , with some mysterious attraction to their sandy foundations , they held their own , though some of them creaked and groaned with the strain which was brought to bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little wharf , over which the waves rolled and tumbled furiously , without meeting a soul . The water dashed so high and wildly up the sand that he was obliged to keep well up beside the houses to escape a drenching . He thought he had never looked upon so grand a sight as the sea presented here ,  - -  all its vast waste lashed into great waves that came roaring in like white-maned monsters to dash themselves upon the laud . Standing here , close by Dirk Sharp 's door , Noll suddenly fancied he heard a faint wail within . He was not at all sure , the sea thundered so , and the wind screamed so shrilly about the miserable dwelling ; but presently , in a slight lull of the tempest , he heard the wail -- if wail it was -- again . It sounded like the voice of a child ,  - -  a child suffering illness or pain . " I wonder if Dirk has any little ones ? " thought Noll ; " and what can he do with them , if they are ill ? " Mentally hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one on the desolate Rock stood in need of aid which they could not have , he was about to turn away and retrace his steps homeward , as the sky seemed to shut down grayer and darker than before , and nightfall was approaching . But at that instant the door of the dwelling opened , and out came Dirk , beating his breast and crying aloud , whether with pain or grief Noll was too surprised to notice at first . The man failed to see the lad standing close by his door-step till he had taken several strides up and down the sand , where the wind blew the spray full upon him ,  - -  walking there hatless and coatless . When he did perceive him , he stopped short , exclaiming , almost fiercely ,  --  " What ye here fur , lad ?  - -  what ye here fur ? The Lord knows it 's no place fur the sort ye b'long to ! " " I was looking at the sea , " said Noll ; " and -- and -- what 's the matter , Dirk ? " " Nothin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried Dirk , roughly , beginning to pace up and down the sand again . " Ye ca n't know nothin ' o ' trouble , lad ! How ken ye ? " Noll hardly knew what answer to make to this vehement question , and finally made none at all , but asked ,  --  " Are any of your family ill , Dirk ? " " Ill ? Sick , ye mean ? O Lord ! yes , yes ,  - -  and dyin ' ! " Noll started . Some one ill and dying on this dreary , wretched Rock ! and no doctor to give aid . He did not know how far he might dare to interrogate Dirk in his present half-frenzied condition , but ventured , after a minute or two of silence , to ask ,  --  " Is it one of the children ? " " Yes , my little gal ! " said Dirk , groaning ,  --  " my little gal it is , an ' nothin ' to keep her frum it . O Lord ! seems as ef I sh'u 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lowering sky in despair , and faced about to the sea , letting the cold drops drive into his face . Noll was fain to comfort him , but was at a loss how to offer consolation to such anguish as Dirk 's . " Is n't there some one on the Rock that can help , that knows something about medicine ? " he asked , eagerly . " No , no , lad ! " Dirk cried , " there ai n't a soul this side o ' the sea ken help my little gal ! Ye don ' know nothin ' o ' trouble , lad ! Ye don ' know what ' t is ter feel that yer chile 's dyin ' fur want o ' somethin ' to save it ! O Lord ! seems as ef I c'u 'd swim through this sea to Hastings fur my little gal ! " He rushed down to the boiling surf , and Noll half expected to see him throw himself into the sea ; but he came back , drenched with a great wave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lad , " he exclaimed , " come in ,  - -  come in an ' see what trouble is ! Ye don ' know . How ken ye ? " Noll followed , and Dirk pushed open the door of his dwelling . The air which met the boy as he entered the small , low room was so close and foul that he almost staggered back . The floor was bare , and through a crack under the door the keen wind swept in across it , flaring the fire on the stone hearth and puffing ashes and smoke about . A fishy odor was upon everything . Household utensils were scattered about in front of the hearth , occupying a quarter of the room , and what few chairs and other articles of wooden furniture there were , were fairly black with dirt and smoke . Noll had never before entered a dwelling so filthy , wretched , and miserable as this . " Here , lad , " said Dirk , brokenly ,  --  " here -- be -- the -- little gal , " and pointed to one corner , where , watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay on its little bed . The mother did not take her eyes off the girl , and Noll went forward , with much inward repugnance , to look upon Dirk 's treasure . The child 's cheeks were flushed a bright red , and it lay with drowsy , heavy-lidded eyes , uttering , at intervals , a low wail . Noll shivered , and involuntarily thought of those dreary , desolate graves which he stumbled upon in one of his rambles . Could nothing be done ? Must the child die for lack of a little medicine ? He looked through the little dirt-crusted window upon the tossing sea , and saw what a hopeless barrier it interposed between them and aid . He thought of Uncle Richard , and knew that it was useless to expect aid from that direction ; and then he thought of Hagar ! She was a good nurse , he remembered , and knew -- or claimed to know -- a vast deal about medicine . Perhaps she could help this child ! he thought , with a glad heart , and if she could ! His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housekeeper could not make a journey through the storm and tempest , even had she the necessary skill . " But , " he thought to himself , " I can tell her about the child , it 's got a fever ,  - -  and she can send medicines ; and to-morrow , if it 's pleasant , she can come herself ! " and thinking thus , Noll turned to Dirk , with --  " I can get you some medicines , I think , from our old housekeeper . May I ? Shall I try ? " The fisherman was silent with surprise . He would probably have sooner expected aid from across the raging sea than from this lad . Noll read an answer in his eyes , and hastened to the door , and bounded away without waiting for any more words or explanations . How fast it had grown dark while he was in Dirk 's hut ! The horizon was quite hidden , so was all the wide waste a half-mile from shore ; but with the coming of night the sea had lost none of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noll ran till he was out of breath . Then he walked , thinking that the homeward path was wonderfully long . Then he ran again , feeling almost as if the child 's life depended upon his exertions , and seeming to hear its wail above all the din of wind and waves . Suddenly he plashed to his ankles , and this brought his headlong race to an abrupt termination . What could it mean ? Then he remembered , with a sudden chill , what , in his eagerness and anxiety , he had entirely forgotten ,  - -  the tide was coming in , and was already over the path which Uncle Richard warned him against . He looked back . The beach over which he had come glimmered faintly in the dusk , with its long line of breakers gleaming far up and down . Back there in the darkness , he thought , Dirk 's child was dying for want of medicine . Oh ! what to do ? He looked down at the foam creeping about his ankles , and said to himself ,  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my feet are wet already . I 'll dash through ; ' two n't take but three minutes , and I ca n't wait ! " He sprang on , thinking to clear the short strip , which the tide had covered , with a few bounds . A wave , high and broad , which had been gathering power and volume in all its long , onward course , came sweeping thunderingly in and engulfed him . CHAPTER X. IN THE SEA . Noll 's presence of mind enabled him to clutch the jagged sides of the rock desperately , so that in the wave 's return he was not drawn with it into the sea depths . Stunned , strangled , half blinded , and impelled by a sudden horror of death in the cold , treacherous sea , he took two or three forward steps , fell , then rose and strove to struggle on . But a little hollow in the path let him down into the flood to his waist . The spray flew into his eyes and mouth , and breathless and bewildered he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . He struggled up to air and life at last , with many gasps for breath , and once more clutched at the rocks behind him . It all seemed like the terror of a dream , not real and threatening . Was he to be drowned ? Some sudden thought of the pleasantness of life , of dear friends across this same cruel , ravenous sea , of Uncle Richard and his warning , came to him here . To be drowned in this dark , chill , raging flood ? Oh ! no , no ! Then he saw , out in the gloom and mistiness , the white gleaming of a wave-crest , rising and sinking , but sweeping steadily toward him , and knew that it would dash upon his narrow foothold . Could he survive another ? Then from Noll 's lips came a shrill cry , which rose above the thunder and battering of the sea ; and , whether from terror or whether from the fact that the dear name was so warm and vivid in his heart at that moment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa , papa ! " The cry was answered !  - -  at least , Noll fancied it was , and clung to the jagged edges of rock with a new love of life in his heart , and , with his eyes on the approaching wave , which began to loom up dark and vast , cried out again with all his might . Out of the darkness which hovered over his submerged path beyond , a figure came struggling ,  - -  battling the water and making desperate efforts to run ,  - -  crying ,  --  " Noll , Noll ! where are you ? " " Here ,  - -  Uncle Richard , quick ! " answered the boy , clinging desperately to his only refuge ,  - -  the slippery , icy rocks . The wave came thunderingly in , burst , and hid uncle and nephew from each other . Trafford uttered a groan of despair , and stood , for an instant , like one palsied . Back swept the flood , leaving the sand bare for a minute , and with a shout , the master of the stone house rushed forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away toward the sand and safety . He gained it , and tremblingly laid his burden down . Had he only saved a body from which the life had flown ? " Oh , Noll ! " he cried , brokenly ,  --  " Noll , Noll ! " Only the sea and the wailing of the wind answered him . Hurriedly gathering the boy in his arms , he started for the house , running and stumbling through the sand and over the rocks , fearful lest he should reach its warmth and shelter too late . But before he had gained half the distance between him and the redly-gleaming window , where he knew Hagar was sitting before her fire , Noll stirred in his arms . Trafford stopped , fearing that his excited imagination had deceived him . " Noll , " he cried , " speak to me , speak ! " " Yes -- only -- I'm -- I 'm so cold , " chattered Noll , faintly ; " and -- Uncle Richard -- you -- you 've saved me ! " Trafford could not speak , so great was the load which had suddenly lifted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Noll protested against being carried , and at every step rejoiced within himself . What cared he for the thunder of the sea , the wind 's screaming , and the terror of death which they boded ? His treasure was safe , safe !  - -  torn from the very yawning mouth of the deep , and what were wreck and disaster of others to him ? He came to the little kitchen , presently , the light from its one window toward the shore beaming cheerily upon him , and threw open the door and entered so suddenly that Hagar screamed out with affright . " De good Lord help us now ! " she cried at the sight of the master and his burden . " What 's happened , Mas'r Dick ? " Noll answered , assuringly , " Nothing very serious , Hagar . I 've been in -- the sea . Oh , Uncle Richard ! how did you find me ? " Trafford set his burden down upon the three-legged stool which Hagar had just vacated , saying ,  --  " I was looking for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what if I had failed to hear it ! " " I should have been swept away , " said Noll . Here Hagar recovered her wits sufficiently to give a little howl of lamentation . " Out ob de sea ! out ob de sea ! " she cried ; " de Lord be t'anked fur it ! Dat yer sea am a drefful t'ing , honey ,  - -  allers swallerin ' , swallerin ' , an ' nebber ken get ' nough fur itself , nohow . Hagar 's seen it ; she knows what dat yer sea is , an ' t'ank de Lord , he 's let ye come out of it alive . Mas'r Dick , why do n't ye t'ank Him fur savin ' ob yer boy fur ye ? " " Hush ! " said Trafford , his face growing gloomy ; " find Noll some dry clothes , Hagar . Quick , woman ! " " Yes , in a minnit , Mas'r Dick ; quick 's I ken git dis yer ole candle lit . But ef ye do n't t'ank de Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fore long , Mas'r Dick ; Hagar tells ye so ! dat yer time 'll come ! it 'll come ! " " Hush ! " said Trafford , harshly , " and do as I bade you . " Hagar went out , sighing , " Dat time 'll come , dat time 'll come , bress de Lord ! " Noll looked up from his seat by the fire , where he sat dripping and shivering , and said ,  --  " But are n't you glad I 'm safe , Uncle Richard ?  - -  are n't you thankful ? " Trafford answered this question with a look which made his nephew exclaim ,  --  " I know you are , Uncle Richard ! Then why -- why -- are n't you thankful to God ? " " Do n't , do n't , Noll ! " said his uncle . " Strip off those wet garments and make haste to get warm again . Culm Rock is no place for one to be sick in . Hurry , boy ? " Instead of hurrying , however , Noll suddenly grew very grave and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Uncle Richard ! That tide drove it all out of my head . What can I do ? Dirk Sharp 's little girl is sick -- dying , and I was to bring her some medicine , if Hagar had any ! " " What is Dirk or his to you ? " exclaimed Trafford . " Was that what kept you so late ? Is that how you came to be caught by the tide ? " " Yes , " said Noll , " I --  " His uncle interrupted him with a stern , " Noll , you reckless lad ! What are those Culm people to us ,  - -  to me ? You put your life in peril -- oh , I tremble to think what peril !  - -  for Dirk 's miserable child ? What were you thinking of ? Have you no regard for your life , for my happiness ? " " Why , " said Noll , quickly , " Dirk loves his child as well as you love me , and I thought perhaps Hagar 's medicines could help it , and I did n't know there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Uncle Richard , what will they do now that I ca n't come back ? " " I do n't know , " said Trafford , gloomily ; " they are accustomed to such things , I suppose . Shall I have to command you to take off those wet clothes ? " Noll began to remove his ice-cold garments , but presently said ,  --  " Is there ,  - -  do you think there 'll be any hope of my going back to-night , Uncle Richard ? The child is dreadful sick , you know . " " Going back !  - -  to- night ! Are you crazy , Noll ? " Trafford cried . " No , you will not put foot outside the door this night ! " " But , Un --  " " Hush ! not another word , " said his uncle , sternly . " If you have no regard for your life , I must have for you . Hagar is waiting at the door with your dry clothes . Are you ready for them ? " Noll answered " Yes , " his heart suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen in Dirk 's miserable abode . It seemed to him as if he could hear the sick child 's wail above the war of the storm . Dirk , he thought , would watch and wait for his return , peering through the dirty little window into the gathering gloom and darkness , and , finding that he did not come , would settle back into despair again . Noll put on the dry garments with a heavy heart . He was sure he felt strong enough to return to Culm , and although the sea barred the beach path , yet , with a lantern , he could find a way over the rocks , he thought . But Uncle Richard had utterly refused ; so there was no hope , and the child must suffer on , and Dirk watch in vain . " Oh , " thought Noll , " why was n't I more careful ? Why did n't I think of the tide ? Then nothing would have happened , and I could have gone back ! " Hagar came in , saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen , Mas'r Noll , ' cause it 's warmer fur ye dan in de dinin ' - room . Ye wo n't mind Hagar 's ole kitchen jes ' fur once , honey ? " " No , " said Noll , sadly , " I wo n't mind at all , Hagar , and I 'm not hungry -- much . " Trafford went out to change his own wet clothing . The old housekeeper bustled between her cupboards and a little round table which she had drawn before the fire , casting wistful looks at Noll as he sat gravely gazing in the coals . " Bress de Lord ! bress de Lord fur savin ' ye ! " she ejaculated , fervently , as she bent down over her tea-pot which was spouting odorous jets of steam from its place on the hearth ; " ' pears like dar would n't be nuffin left in dis ole house ef de sea had swallered ye , Mas'r Noll . Do n't ye t'ank de Lord ? " she asked , peering up into the boy 's sober face . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God for saving me ; but oh , Hagar , " said Noll , almost with tears in his eyes , " there 's somebody on this Rock to-night that 's as sad as you or Uncle Richard would have been if the tide had swept me away ! " " Now ! " said Hagar ; " an ' who is dem yer ? " " Dirk Sharp 's little girl is sick with a fever , and I think she 's going to die ,  - -  though of course I ca n't tell ,  - -  and they have n't a drop of medicine . Just think , Hagar ,  - -  dying , and nothing to save ! " Hagar thought , and sighed heavily over her tea-pot . " Don ' know what 's goin ' to ' come o ' them yer Culm folks ! " she said . " And , " continued Noll , " I promised to bring Dirk some medicine ,  - -  I was going to get it of you ; but I got into that fearful tide and was half drowned , and now -- oh , what can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye did n't ' spect to go back in de dark to Culm ? " cried Hagar . " I would -- if Uncle Richard had n't forbidden , " said Noll ; " do you think you have any medicines that can help the child , Hagar ? " " Don ' know , " shaking her turbaned head . " Ef ' t was rheumatiz , or ef ' t was a cut , or ef ' t was one o ' dem yer colds , Hagar 'd ' spect to know ; but ca n't tell nuffin ' bout fevers , nohow . ' Tw'u 'd be jes ' as de Lord 's willin ' ! " " Will you go , or send something in the morning ? " queried Noll . " Ef it 's pleasant , honey , Hagar 'll go wid ye . Yer supper 's waiting fur ye ! " Noll sighed , and did not stir . The misery which he had seen in Dirk 's wretched hut haunted him . Hagar poured out the boy 's cup of tea , waited a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come , yer supper 's cold ' nough , now , honey , " said she , coming up to Noll 's seat . " What ye waitin ' fur ? Oh , chile , ye grows more'n ' more like yer poor father . T'inkin ' ob de mis'ry ober dar ; ai n't ye ? " " Such misery , too ! " said Noll . " Well , dar 's mis'ry eberywhere ! " said Hagar ; " ca n't go nowhere but what ye 'll find it . Yer Uncle Dick has had mis'ry ' nough in his day , but ' tai n't done him no good ' tall . Jes ' froze his heart up harder'n a stone . " " It is n't all stone , " said Noll . " Don ' ye t'ink so ? Well , ' pears like ye 's sent here by de Lord , jes ' to break dat heart ob his all to pieces ! " said Hagar , earnestly . " Sent here to break Uncle Richard 's heart ? " laughed Noll . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here for that purpose ? " " Don ' know , " said the old housekeeper , with a shake of her head ; " but dat 's what I t'ink de Lord sent ye here fur . Dat heart ob his is all frizzed up . ' Spects ' two n't be so allus , chile ,  - -  de Lord helpin ' . " Noll ate his supper , bade Hagar good-night , admonishing her to " be sure and have the medicines ready the first thing ! " and groped his way to the library , where his uncle was sitting at his organ . Trafford stopped playing the instant the door opened , and as Noll drew near , put his arm about him , saying ,  --  " My boy !  - -  mine !  - -  doubly my own since I snatched you from death ! Oh , Noll ! if I had lost you ! " The boy sighed . " Dirk has got to lose his child , " he said , " and oh , Uncle Richard , I should be a great deal happier if I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIRK 'S TREASURE . At the first gray glimmer of the wintry dawn , Noll was awake . He felt stiff and lame after his adventure of the previous evening , and not at all inclined to stir . But a sudden recollection of Dirk and his child , and the aid which he had promised them , came to him almost as soon as he was conscious of the day 's dawning , and he got up and limped to the window to see whether there was any prospect of Hagar 's journey to Culm being realized . The sky was as gray and sombre as yesterday 's had been . All the sea was in a great turmoil , and rolled in a flood of foam upon the shore as far as he could see . Not a sail in sight upon the lonely waste , not a sign of human life anywhere . Now and then a snow-flake fluttered down ; and the wind screamed shrilly about the house-corners , and wailed hoarsely in the casements . " Hagar ca n't go to-day , " thought Noll , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what can be done ? " He trembled for fear Uncle Richard would forbid him to go to Culm again . He felt as if he could never bear to meet Dirk 's eyes after promising him aid and failing to bring it ; and , with this thought oppressing him , and the lonely cry of the sea filling his ears , he dressed himself , and went down to the library with a downcast heart . His uncle sat by a window , looking , with a sad and gloomy face , upon the sea ; and , as his nephew entered , acknowledged his " Good-morning , Uncle Richard , " with only a cold nod . But Noll , resolved to have the matter settled at once , came up to his chair , saying ,  --  " I 've got a great favor to ask of you , Uncle Richard . May I go around to Culm after breakfast ? " Trafford 's face grew gloomier than before . " For what ? " he asked . " To carry something for Dirk 's child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his own pleading blue ones . " Pshaw ! " exclaimed Trafford , impatiently , " what are these miserable fish-folks to you ? I do n't want you to care for them ! " " But , Uncle Richard --  " " Well ? " " Dirk 's child is sick ,  - -  dying , I 'm afraid ! " " So are hundreds in this world . There 's misery everywhere . " " Perhaps I might aid this misery , Uncle Richard , if you 'll let me try . Will you ? " " You will have more than your hands full if you are going to look after these Culm people , " said Trafford , coldly ; " you had better not begin . " Noll 's face grew graver and graver , and he made no reply to his uncle 's last remark . " Well , " said Trafford , after a long silence , " do you wish anything more , Noll ? " The boy turned away , as if hurt by his uncle 's coldness , and walked quickly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back . " Uncle Richard , " said he , tremulously , " papa said I was to do all the good I could in the world , and never pass by any trouble that I might help , and -- and I think he would tell me to go to Dirk 's , if he were here . " Trafford turned about with an impatient word upon his lips , but it was not spoken . It seemed to him as if his dead brother stood before him , as he had known him when they were boys together ,  - -  and that those words were meant for a reproach . He put out his hand and touched Noll 's shoulder , as if to make sure that it was really his nephew and no vision . " Ah ! " said he , with a sigh , " your father looks out at me from your eyes , Noll . Turn them away from me . Go to Culm , if you like , you have my permission . " " Breakfas 's waitin ' fur ye ! " said Hagar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Noll , in some perplexity , " I do n't like to go and have you all the time wishing me at home . " " I can not help that , " said Trafford , as he rose to answer Hagar 's call . " I have given you permission ,  - -  go . " The breakfast was a silent one . After it was over , and the door had closed upon the grim master of the house as he went back to his books , Hagar said ,  --  " Do n't ye let nuffin make ye downhearted , honey ! De Lord 'll help ye , ef yer Uncle Dick wo n't . ' Tai n't de might nor de money dat 'll do eberyting , chile . All ' pends on whether de Lord 's on yer side . Jes ' come in my ole kitchen and see what I 's put up fur ye to carry to dem yer mis'able folks . " Illustration : " Dis yer is brof . " Page 183 . Noll got his overcoat and cap , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Look at dis yer , " said Hagar , taking a basket off the table ; " jes ' as chock full as nuffin ye ken think ob . Dis yer is brof ,  - -  chicken- brof , an ' dat yer bundle is crackers . Dis bottle 's de med'cine , an ' de chile is to hab a teaspoonful ebery half an hour . Ef I could be there , de chile should hab a sweat , sure ; but dis med'cine 'll hev to answer ! Dis yer is a teaspoon an ' a teacup , ' cause ye wo n't find nuffin fit fur to drink nuffin out ob . Hagar knows how dem yer Culm folks lib ! Now , ken ye ' member all dat , honey ? " " Yes , " said Noll , " and I thank you a hundred times , Hagar . I 'd better start at once , without waiting another minute . " The old housekeeper followed him to the door , cautioning , " Keep ' way from dat yer sea , chile ! Do n't yer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' de Lord bress ye an ' bring ye safe back ! " The wind was keen and bitter , and the sea thundered as mightily as on the previous evening . Noll hurried along over the great patches of icy sea-weed and frozen pools of water in the rocks and hollows , and thought , now that he was making such haste , that the way had never seemed quite so long before . He paused for a moment to look upon the scene of last night 's peril , and remember , with a shudder , how the waves battered , and how they pierced and numbed him with their cold . Then he ran along the hard , sandy beach as fast as the wind and his burden would let him . The Culm huts came in sight at last , cheerless and desolate , and with no sign of life or occupancy about them , save the faint smoke which the wind whirled down from the chimneys . Noll began to regard Dirk 's habitation with anxious eyes long before he drew near . He half expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the sand , beating his breast and groaning with despair , perhaps ; but instead , the sands were deserted . Noll came opposite the miserable dwelling , and paused a few seconds before rapping , waiting to hear the sick child 's low wail . He heard only a confused , unintelligible murmur of voices . A woman answered his summons , not the child 's mother , but a neighbor , evidently ,  - -  and stood staring blankly at him . " Can I see Dirk ,  - -  Dirk Sharp ? " Noll asked . At the sound of the boy 's voice , the fisherman himself came to the door . His face was haggard , and looked wan and worn , for all the bronze of wind and weather that was upon it . " Lord bless ye , lad ! " he cried to Noll , " but ye be too late . " " Too late ? " " Yes , " brokenly , " my little gal died las ' night . " Noll was silent with surprise . He was too late ,  - -  too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as soon as he could speak , " I would have come back last night , but I got into the sea , and -- and it was impossible . So I brought what I could this morning . " Dirk looked at the lad and his basket , and choked . At last he said , gratefully , " It be good in ye to care for the like o ' us , lad . We be poor folks fur ye to look at , the Lord knows ! What did ye bring fur my little gal ? " Noll lifted the cover of his basket , and Dirk peered in , exclaiming , " My little gal never seed the like o ' them , lad ! She wur a tender thing , my little gal wur , and mabby ef she 'd had a bit o ' somethin ' better'n the salt fish -- Well , she be beyond meat and drink now , " he said , choking again . Noll knew not whether to turn back , or to stay . Dirk , however , presently said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little gal . She wur as white an ' sof ' - cheeked as yerself . O Lord ! I might ha ' knowed she 'd never come up stout an ' growin ' like the rest , " he groaned as he turned back to lead the way for Noll . In the room where the little one had lain sat three or four old fish-wives ,  - -  wrinkled , weather-beaten old faces they had ,  - -  who were nodding and whispering over their pipes in a solemn kind of way , occasionally addressing a word to the mother , who sat enveloped in the smoke which poured into the room from the ill-constructed fireplace . They regarded Noll with many curious glances as he passed through after Dirk to the apartment where the child was laid , and one old creature followed after them , apparently to ascertain the boy 's errand . It was a bare room where Dirk 's treasure was sleeping , not a thing in it save the two wooden stools and rough board which upheld their still little burden . Pure and white the child lay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and squalor of everything about it ; and something of this contrast seemed to glimmer upon Dirk 's rough perceptions , for he said to Noll ,  --  " Ye would n't think she could be mine , lad ! Ye do n't wonder the little gal could n't come up like the rest o ' the young uns ? " " It wur a fair gal , Lord knows , " said the old fish-wife who had followed them in ; " it war n't black and freckly , never . Sich kinds do n't love this salt water , Dirk Sharp , ye could n't ha ' raised her , man ! " " Oh , my little gal ! " murmured Dirk , smoothing a fleck of golden hair with his great brawny hand . " Ye be fair an ' white , " said the old fish-wife , touching Noll 's cheek with her skinny finger , " an ' what be ye here on the Rock fur ? " " Sh ! ye let the lad alone , mother , " said Dirk ; " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' she be beyond eatin ' an ' drinkin ' . He be a good lad to do it ! " Noll looked upon the little sleeper 's face , and then at the wretched surroundings , and was glad for the child 's sake that sleep and peace had come at last . Yet his heart was heavy as he looked upon his basket and its now useless contents , and he thought , " Oh , if I had only been more careful last night !  -- perhaps -- perhaps Hagar 's medicines could have helped it . " He turned to Dirk , saying , quietly ,  --  " I must go now . I'm -- I 'm so sorry I was too late ! " The fisherman followed Noll out on to the sand , and , as the boy was about to turn away homeward , took both his hands in one of his own great brown ones , saying ,  --  " Ye be kinder to me ' an I ken tell ye , lad . I thought yer kind had no heart fur us folk . Bless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeward walk seemed somewhat brighter to him , even though he left the child dead behind him . Dirk 's gratitude , a small matter though it may have been , gave him a thrill of pleasure . It was pleasant to think that he had one friend among the fish-folk , rough and ignorant though they were . He remembered how , in the little sea-town in which his father had once dwelt , the fishermen came at last to love and respect the kind minister who worked so patiently to raise them out of their slough of ignorance and degradation , and that whenever his father walked among them , they flocked about him to listen to his words and counsel , and watch for his look or smile of approval . " And , " thought Noll , " if Uncle Richard would only do as papa did , what a happy man he would be , and what good he could do for Culm ! " But that time -- if ever it came -- was yet a long , long way off , he thought , and so the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till some one taught them better . The boy walked soberly home , with a great many serious , earnest thoughts in his heart . Somehow , this morning 's sight had made another impression upon his mind beside that of sadness and disappointment . He felt and saw that there was a great work to do . Who was to do it ? Hagar met him at the door , rejoicing that he had returned in safety , but , stopping only to tell her that the child was dead , Noll went on to the library . It was the boy 's intention to open his heart to his uncle , and tell him of all the want and wretchedness there was at Culm , while the impression was so deep and vivid in his mind ; but Trafford sat at the organ and took no notice of his nephew 's presence , and , after a long lingering , Noll gave up the attempt for that day , at least . It was late in the afternoon when he went out for his accustomed walk . Partly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little place of graves in the frozen sand , and there found the funeral party from the fish-huts just gathering about the shallow resting-place which had been scooped for Dirk 's treasure . The huddling crowd of poorly-clad men and women respectfully made way for him , and Dirk looked unutterable thanks for what he considered a great honor . Without a prayer , without a word of consolation , the little one was lowered into the earth amid the wailing of the women , and the shrill and lonely screaming of the fierce and bitter wind . Noll had never seen anything so unutterably dreary , and when all was over , and the mourners had disappeared over the other side of the Rock , he went home , thinking more deeply than ever of the work to be done , and wondering who was to do it . CHAPTER XII . FIRELIGHT TALK . The warmth and quietness of the library made such a bright and pleasant contrast to the dreary scene in the Culm burying-ground that Noll gave a great sigh of pleasure and relief as he entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blaze of a brisk fire on the hearth . He sat down in one of the big arm-chairs which stood either side of the fireplace , and held his numbed hands in the warmth , and looked about him , thinking that the old stone house was a palace in comparison with the other Culm habitations . Uncle Richard sat in his usual seat by the window , with his face toward the darkening sea , and , with the dismal scene which he had just witnessed fresh in his mind , Noll felt a tenderer yearning toward the stern man ,  - -  feeling , somehow , as if they could not be too near and dear to each other on this lonely Rock , where , just now , it seemed as if there was little else than wretchedness . Perhaps it was this feeling which led the boy to leave his seat and stand by his uncle 's chair , and , with one hand on the grim man 's shoulder , to say , " Dirk 's child is dead , Uncle Richard , and they 've just buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried in ! I would rather lie in the sea , it seems to me . " Trafford turned suddenly about at these words , exclaiming , " Hush , hush ! do n't talk about death , boy ! What have you been up to that dreary little heap of graves for ? " " Partly to please Dirk ,  - -  partly because I wished , Uncle Richard . It 's a dismal place ! I 'm glad enough to get back . " " We shall both sleep there soon enough , " said Trafford , who seemed to be in one of his gloomiest moods . " Why go there till we go for the last time ? " Noll 's arm went about his uncle 's neck . " Do n't say such things ! " he said . " Perhaps we 'll not live here always , Uncle Richard ; and , if we do have to be buried up there in the sand , heaven is just as near , after all . " Trafford looked at the boy 's face , ruddy and glowing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Yes , for you , Noll . But for me , no , no ! " " Why , Uncle Richard ? " " Because -- it is all dark ,  - -  dark ! I have nothing , see nothing to hope for beyond . " " Why wo n't you try to hope ? " said Noll , softly . " Hush ! it 's no use . Your Aunt Marguerite bade me follow after her long ago . I did not try . Your father said almost the same , Noll . Yet here I am ,  - -  I have not tried , I see no light , there is no hope for me . " The crackle of the fire and the hoarse voice of the sea had the silence all to themselves for a long time . At last Noll said ,  --  " When papa died , he did not fear at all , Uncle Richard . He said it was only the end of his journey , and that I was to follow on in the same way till I got to him at last . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ! he never said aught else , Noll ,  - -  never ! " " And , " continued the boy , his face growing grave , " papa said I was never to forget God , and never to forget to help any of his creatures if they were in trouble , and , oh ! Uncle Richard , I hope I never shall ! " " Ah ! " said Trafford , thoughtfully , " your father ever had others ' welfare at heart . I remember , when we were lads , how , one day , in coming from the woods with nuts and grapes , we passed a poor creature by the roadside , who seemed fainting with fatigue or hunger . We both laughed at the queer figure at first , and passed by merrily , and went on our way ; but Noll 's face grew graver and graver , I remember , and by and by he would turn about , in spite of me , and go all the long way back to empty his pockets of their pennies and bits of silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heart for every unfortunate , and it was not closed against them as he grew older . " Again the room was silent , while the fire flickered and painted flame-shadows on the wall , and lit up the dusky corners with its red glow . Noll sat on the arm of his uncle 's chair , and watched the quivering shapes , and , in fancy , went back over the sea to Hastings . It was something such a night as this , he remembered , that papa had bidden him farewell ,  - -  lying so calm and patient in the great south chamber , where people were stepping softly about , and speaking in whispers and sighs . And papa 's dear arms had been around him till the last , Noll thought , with his eyes brimming , and seeming yet to feel their gentle pressure ; and , as long as it could whisper , the dear voice had breathed love and solemn counsel and fervent prayer into his ears . Back to the boy came the vivid recollection of all the hushed voice had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the path which led only heavenward , and his heart was so full that he longed to cry out , " Papa , papa ! If I might only see your face in this dreary place ! " Trafford presently said , speaking his thoughts aloud , " It was an evil day that separated us . God only knows what I might have been , had I always lived in the sunshine of his pure , warm heart . Why are you so silent , Noll ? " The boy could not trust himself to speak , and Trafford suddenly saw that there were tears shining in his eyes . Noll felt his uncle 's hand laid upon his head , and the stern voice said , with all the tenderness of which it was capable ,  --  " It 's a hard life for you , Noll . I can see ,  - -  I know it . " " No , no ! " said the boy , quickly , " it 's not that , Uncle Richard ! I was only thinking of -- of papa ,  - -  that was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " I never knew that you mourned before . " " Why , " said Noll , chokingly , " papa told me so much ,  - -  so much that he wished me to do and be ,  - -  and it all came to me just then , as if he were saying it over again . " " What did he wish you to do and be ? " Trafford quietly asked . " He said that -- that I should find Christ 's work to do wherever I might be , and that I must do his work and follow him wherever I should go ; and -- and I 'm a long way from that , Uncle Richard ; though , " Noll added , turning his face away from the shining firelight , " I do try to do it , and not forget him nor his work . " Again Trafford 's hand was laid upon the boy 's head , this time to stroke his curly locks away from his eyes , where the wind had blown them . " Did he tell you aught of me ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever found me , or I you , that I was to be your boy . Papa said you would care for me . " " He believed in me still ! He trusted me ! " said Trafford . " Alas ! he knew not what a father I should make his child . " Noll slipped off the chair arm , saying , " Do n't say that again , Uncle Richard . Papa trusted you ,  - -  so do I. And , if you please , will you go out to supper ? Hagar called a long time ago . Come , Uncle Richard , do n't look so gloomy ! Papa smiled even when -- when he was saying good-by to me . " The instant these words escaped Noll 's lips he half regretted them . He had never before allowed his uncle to know that he thought him sad and gloomy , and he was not quite sure that the careless word would strike agreeably upon his ears . But Trafford only said ,  --  " Yes , Noll , I know . We will go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed after his nephew . The boy did his best to make the meal a cheery one , thinking to himself that this , as much as anything , was a part of the work which papa wished him to do ; and , observing his efforts , Trafford endeavored to keep pace with his nephew 's cheerful talk . Noll did not go back to the library after tea was over , but followed Hagar out to her kitchen as she went thither with her tray of dishes , and sat down in the cozy corner by the fireplace . Somehow , the boy thought , the old housekeeper 's humble kitchen seemed to gather more brightness and cheerfulness into its rough and smoke-tarnished precincts than the great library , with all its comforts and elegancies , ever held . The reason for this he did not seek ; he only knew that it was so , and liked the wooden seat in the chimney-corner accordingly . Hagar came out with her last tray-load from the dining-room , and set it down upon the table with ,  --  " Bress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ye sittin ' dar . ' Pears like I never heard de sea shoutin ' like it is dis yer ebenin ' . Seems as ef all de folks dat de cruel ole monster hab swallered wur jes ' openin' ' the'r moufs and cryin ' ' loud ! Hagar t'anks de Lord dat yer ai n't in de bottom ob it , honey . " The old housekeeper took two or three side glances at the boy 's sober face as she poured the hot water over her dishes , and said at last , " Now don ' ye s'pose Hagar knows what ye 're t'inkin ' ob so hard , chile ? Ki ! she c'u 'd tell ye quicker'n nuffin . You 's t'inkin ' ob dem mis'able Culm folks , you is . " " You are partly right , " said Noll . " It seems to me as if I could n't think of anything else . I try to sometimes , but the sight of their wretched ways keeps coming to me , and it 's no use to try and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done for them ! " " Dat 's yer bressed father all ober ! " said Hagar . " ' Spects ef he was ' live an ' livin ' on dis yer wild'ness , we 'd see somethin ' did fur ' em . But Mas'r Dick -- well , his heart is all frizzed up , jes ' as I telled ye afore . But de Lord 'll open it sometime , honey ,  - -  Hagar 's got faith ' nough to b'lieve dat ! " " Oh ! I hope so , " said Noll ; " but what are the people going to do till then ? " " Ca n't tell ye nuffin ' bout dat , " said Hagar , making a vigorous clatter among her dishes ; " ' spects the day 's comin ' , tho ' , when de Lord gets ready fur't . ' Tai n't till he says , honey . " Noll gravely replenished the fire from the great basket of cones and chips which stood on the hearth , and stood listening , for a little time , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying ,  --  " Do you think I could do anything for them , Hagar ? I 've been thinking this long time about it , and there 's no one to ask but you , for I ca n't quite get courage enough to say anything to Uncle Richard about it ,  - -  he would be angry , I 'm afraid . Do you think I could do anything , Hagar ? " The old housekeeper let go her dishcloth , and turned about to look at Noll , as he stood before the fire . Her eyes surveyed the lad from head to foot , as if it was the first time she had seen him ,  - -  and after a few minutes of silence she slowly said , " What put dat in yer head , chile ? " " I do n't know ; it 's been there this great while . It was the misery over there , I suppose , " said Noll . " Well , well , " said she , turning back to her dishes , " Hagar 's ' stonished , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur dem yer ? Bress de Lord ! He 'll help ye , honey !  - -  he 'll help ye ! An ' ef it wa' n't de Lord dat put it in yer head -- Well , chile , " Hagar added , " de Lord 's eberywhere , an ' ' pears to me like as ef it was his doin ' . What ye t'ink , honey ? " Noll was looking in the rosy bed of coals , and for a few minutes made no reply ; then he said , in answer to Hagar 's question ,  --  " I 'd like to think that , Hagar . I 'd like to have all my thoughts and plans come from him , and I 'd like to do the Lord 's work ; for that 's what I promised ,  - -  that 's what I am trying to do . " Hagar wiped a pile of plates , and laying down her towel , said , reverently ,  --  " Promise , chile ? Did ye promise de Lord , or who ? " After she had asked this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if fearing she had asked about something which she had no right to know . But Noll , with hands clasped over knee , was looking straight into the firelight , and did not appear offended ; and pretty soon he said , slowly and softly , Hagar stopping her clatter to listen ,  --  " Before mamma died -- Did you know mamma , Hagar ? " " Not muchly , chile , " said Hagar ; " yer Uncle Dick 's wife was my lady . " " Well , before mamma died , " continued Noll , " we used to take long walks upon the shore by the town . A great shining shore it was , I remember , and yellow like gold sometimes when the sun shone upon it . " " Like de shore ob de new Jerusalem , " interposed Hagar , gazing abstractedly in her dish-pan . " And there were great cedars and pines drooping down from the rocks , " continued Noll , " and here mamma and I used to walk up and down when papa was busy in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk a little with us before we were through . And one day we waited a long time for him to come out , and at last sat down on a rock , for mamma was not well then , and could not walk long without a rest ; and as she looked across the smooth water , she said , ' And the building of the wall of it was of jasper : and the city was pure gold , like unto clear glass . ' Though I was a good deal smaller than I am now , I knew what she meant , and of what she was thinking , for mamma used to talk about leaving me then ; and I laid my head in her lap and cried a little , and said ,  --  " ' Oh , do n't talk of that , mamma , for what am I going to do ? ' " Noll choked a little here at the remembrance , and Hagar drew a long breath . " Then , " continued Noll , with a quivering voice , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes ran over on to my cheeks , and she said ,  --  " ' Oh , my little Noll , if mamma could feel sure that you were ready to come after her into that city , she would never cry or mourn again ! ' " It seemed as if my heart would break to see her cry and to know that I was not ready , and that I could not stop her tears . I wanted to scream and groan , my heart swelled so . " " Ob course ye did , " said Hagar , with ready sympathy . Noll was silent for a long minute . Somehow , the talk with Uncle Richard in the library had brought back the remembrance of all these past events so brightly and vividly that it was like living them over again . But he had not yet got to the " promise , " and Hagar was waiting patiently . So he continued , with a slight effort , saying ,  --  " Mamma dried her tears very suddenly , for papa came in sight just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried or anxious about her , and though she said nothing more to me about the city to which she was going , I could n't forget her tears , nor that she was sorrowful and unhappy on my account . It made me miserable . I did n't want to walk with her the next day , for fear I should see her tears again ; and I knew I could not bear that . So when it came time to go , I hid away , and she went alone . " " Poor honey ! " said Hagar , reflectively . " But that only made it all worse . I knew that I was all wrong , and that I ought to try and find Jesus , through whom , mamma said , she could only enter into the city . But it seemed as if he had hidden away from me ; and the way was all dark and I was afraid and wretched and miserable . " " Oh , chile , " said Hagar , " de bressed Lord was waitin ' an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minnit ye frowed yerself on his mercy ! " " Yes , " said Noll , " but I was not ready . I held back , and was wicked and wretched ; but it could n't last alway , and one night when I had said my prayer and been tucked in bed by mamma 's poor weak , patient hands , I could delay no longer , and throwing my arms about her neck when she bent down to kiss me , I cried and sobbed , and begged her to help me find Jesus , who reigned over the city , and mamma cried too ,  - -  tears of joy they were , she said ,  - -  and told me that I had not to seek for him as for a great stranger , but that he stood ready to enter in and dwell in my heart the moment I yielded it up to him . " " Dat was de bressed troof ! " said Hagar , with shining eyes ; " an ' what did ye do den , honey ? " " Mamma called papa to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make my heart his own , and help me to always walk in the path that ends at last at the gate of his city . And , " Noll added , turning partly about to Hagar , " I did give up , and -- and I think he forgave me . The dreary load went off my heart , and I promised Jesus then to never forget him nor his work . When mamma did at last go to the city , I promised her the same ; when papa went , I promised him too . That is my promise , " said Noll , a little tremulously . " Do you think I can forget it , Hagar ? Do you think I can help wanting to do what is his work ? " Hagar wiped her eyes . " ' Spects dere 's no need ob answerin ' dat question , " said she , quietly ; " when de Lord 's wid ye , dar ai n't nobody gwine to ' vent yer workin ' good , nohow . " " But I do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could do anything . There 's so much to be done , and I 've nothing to do with . And I 'm afraid that Uncle Richard will forbid me to do anything about it . He does n't want me to go to Culm , he says , and he dislikes the Culm people . " Hagar did not know what consolation to offer for this unfavorable prospect . She could not counsel the boy to disobey his uncle 's commands , neither did she accept the idea of having Noll 's projects defeated for lack of permission to carry them out . " Don ' know , honey , " said she , after a long meditation ; " ca n't tell ye nuffin ' bout dat , nohow . But jes ' go right on wid yer plans , an ' de Lord 'll find a way fur ye . He ken do it ,  - -  he ken do it , chile . " But the question was not settled in Noll 's mind . It was not a thing to be undertaken without much deliberation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his mind . He wished to aid , he longed to be doing something of the work that was to be done , but there did not seem to be the smallest prospect of a commencement . Christmas came and went . The eve was not an unpleasant one to Noll , though he remembered all too well what a blithe evening the last Christmas-eve had been , and could not help thinking yearningly of the dear friends gathered merrily together across the sea , and wonder whether he was missed from the throng , as he sat by the fire all the solitary evening . CHAPTER XIII . THE WINTER 'S WANING . Dirk 's little one was not the only fever-stricken sleeper that was laid to rest in the dreary little burying-ground that winter . The fever , born of want and filth and exposure , lingered among the wretched huts , taking down the strong men and wasting the lives of the little ones , till , after weary lingering , they flickered out . Of course the sick ones had but the poorest of care and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and apathetic , and seemed to have no idea of cleansing their habitations or reforming their way of living . Noll once ventured to hint to Dirk , with whom he was more intimately acquainted than the others , that cleanliness and care might do much toward ridding them of the haunting fever . The fisherman stared blankly at this suggestion , and replied ,  --  " It mought do fur the like o ' ye , lad ; but we be poor folks , an ' I do n't think ' tw'u 'd do the good ye think . The fever be come , an ' it be goin ' to stay till we be all lyin ' up in the sand yender . " So the sickness lingered , meeting no resistance and no attempts to check its progress . It smote heaviest the little ones just toddling about , and who had not enough of strength and endurance in their little bodies to resist the slowly-destroying fever . So Dirk 's treasure did not sleep alone in the sand , for many another father 's was there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , the slow dragging of the weeks ! When the sickness seemed to have spent itself , and hope was beginning to flicker up , back came the destroyer and fell upon some little one whom father and mother had fondly hoped to save , for these Culm people , dull and ignorant though they were , had a strong and passionate love for their children that showed itself most vividly in these days of death ,  - -  and then the people settled into their old apathetic despair and found no light nor comfort for their souls . Was it any wonder that -- with all this misery and death about him , and the sight of it distressing him -- Noll should grow sick at heart ? The gloom of the old stone house and the desolateness of his new home , when compared with the one which he had left , had , at first , been all that his fresh young spirits could bear ; and , having grown to like his new abode in a measure , he found , even then , that it would not do to remember Hastings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these dreary days , the boy began to grow less cheerful and to feel an unconquerable desire to go back to those who loved him and whose homes knew nothing of dreariness or gloom . This longing for friends he kept bravely to himself , because he thought it was a part of his work -- the work which it seemed to him was God's -- to be as brave and cheerful as possible before Uncle Richard , and win him out of his gloom and moroseness . So this yearning and desire for brighter scenes and faces was kept a secret , and Trafford suspected nothing of it . His keen eyes , however , detected that Noll was graver and less talkative than usual , and he began to look about for a reason . Some dim knowledge of the sickness and death in the village had crept in to him through Noll 's and Hagar 's talk , and a sudden fear chilled him lest his nephew , too , was to be stricken down with the lingering fever . What if it should be so ? What if even now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness ? With this thought torturing him , he called to Noll one afternoon from the library window , as the boy was idly walking up and down the frozen sand . After a few minutes of waiting , Noll made his appearance at the library door , looking a little surprised , perhaps , at this unusual summons . Trafford bade him come up to his chair , and Noll obeyed . " Where were you all the forenoon ? " questioned the uncle . " I saw you but once after breakfast . " Noll looked as if he had much rather refrain from answering , but said , after a few seconds of hesitation , " Over at Culm , Uncle Richard . " " At Culm ! " exclaimed Trafford , sternly . " Is n't the fever raging there ? " " Yes , sir . " " And you have been exposing yourself ? Speak , Noll ! " " Why -- yes -- I suppose so , Uncle Richard . I was in the room where Hark Darby 's little boy was sick . " Trafford stamped upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? " he cried . " To carry something that Hagar made for it to drink . There 's no doctor , you know ; and they 're terribly poor , Uncle Richard . Oh ! if you could only --  " " Stop ! I wish to hear naught of those fish-folks , " cried Trafford . " Oh ! you careless lad , what can I do with you ? Are you determined to catch the fever ? Are you bound to be always in danger ? " " No ; but it 's terrible over there , and -- and they 're dying with the sickness , and nothing to make them comfortable ! Oh ! how can I help it , Uncle Richard ? " Trafford looked into the lad 's earnest eyes and sighed . " Would you like to take the fever and be buried with the rest up there in the sand ? " he asked . Noll shivered a little , and answered , " No , I do n't want to die , Uncle Richard . But I think I ought to help them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it 's such a little -- such a very little -- that I can do ! Oh ! Uncle Richard , do n't you think it is terrible to see them so wretched , and no one to help them ? " " I do n't see them ! " said Trafford ; " I should know nothing of it but for you , and I do n't want you to see them or know aught of the misery or the sickness . Do you understand ? " Noll looked at his uncle as if he failed to comprehend . " You do n't mean that I 'm not to go there any more ? " he said . " Yes , since you are not disposed to incline to my wishes , I must command you . You are not to go near --  " This time it was Noll who interrupted . Before Trafford could finish his command , the boy had taken two or three quick steps forward and clasped his arms so quickly and convulsively about the stern man 's neck that he was startled into silence . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cried Noll ; " I could n't mind you if you did ! It would n't be right ,  - -  when they 're all sick and almost starving ,  - -  and I could n't do it , and it is not as papa told me to do ! And --  " Trafford endeavored to release Noll 's hold , but the boy only clung the tighter , exclaiming ,  --  " No , no ! do n't say it , Uncle Richard , for I could n't mind you ! Papa never would wish me to ! And oh , why do n't you help those poor , dying people ? Why do n't you help them , Uncle Richard ? Why do n't you ,  - -  why do n't you ? " Surprised at this unusual vehemence on the part of his nephew , Trafford was silent , hardly knowing whether to be angry or indifferent . That this matter lay very near the boy 's heart , he had no longer any doubt . What could he do with him ? " Noll , " said he after a long silence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The boy hesitated . " In everything else , Uncle Richard , " he answered , with red cheeks and downcast eyes ; " but this -- but this -- oh , how can you ask me to stop ? There is n't any one else to do anything , and it helps a little , and they look for me to come every day ; and if I did not -- oh , Uncle Richard , it would be too cruel ! I ca n't do it ! Do you think papa would be pleased ? " " But you are mine , now , not his , " said Trafford ; with something like displeasure in his tone ; " are n't you aware of it ? " Noll said not a word , but stood with his eyes turned away from his uncle 's , and his cheeks crimsoning , while his breath came quick and fast . " Will you obey me or not ? " Trafford asked , sternly . Noll turned around and met his uncle 's eye . He began to plead . His awe of his uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was astonished at the boy 's earnestness and vehemence . Two or three times he was about to put up his hand to command silence , but Noll redoubled his pleading , and he continued to listen . All the remembrances of the past dreary weeks -- the want , the slow wasting , the flickering out of life , the dismal laying away of the poor body in the sand -- came to Noll as vividly as the reality which he had witnessed , and made him pray for relief with an earnestness and entreaty which ordinarily were not his . " Just think , Uncle Richard , " said he , in conclusion , " papa would have gone to their aid long ago . He bade me do all the good I could , and you wo n't forbid me ?  - -  oh , I know you will not !  - -  and wo n't you help me to do more ,  - -  wo n't you , Uncle Richard ? " Trafford gloomily pushed his nephew away . " Go ! " he said ; " I do not care to see you any more this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , before the quick thought flashed into his mind that he had failed to ask him the question for which he had called him . He might even now be ill , and he was sending him away in anger ! " Noll ! " exclaimed Trafford , " come back . Are you ill , my boy ? " " No , sir . " " Why are you so grave and sober of late ? " " I did n't know that I was , Uncle Richard . " Trafford looked keenly in his nephew 's face , and at last drew him toward himself . What if the fever should get a hold of the boy ? he thought , anxiously . There was no aid , no succor ! " Oh , Noll , " he said , as tenderly as he might , " you can not know what a blow it would be to me to lose you . Wo n't you be careful for my sake ? " " Yes , Uncle Richard ; I do n't think there is much danger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are ill . " A long silence followed . Then Noll asked , softly ,  --  " Do you give me permission to help them all I can , Uncle Richard ? " Trafford drew a great sigh , as if he felt himself to be yielding , perhaps , the boy 's very life , and answered , " Yes . " " And you 'll help me , too ? " said Noll , brightly . " No ! Is n't this enough ? What more would you have ? " " I thought that -- that perhaps you would help a little , too , you can do so much more than I , " said Noll . Trafford shook his head , gloomily . " No , " he said ; " I can give you nothing but money . I have no heart for the work . And now I think of it , you 've had no allowance since you came here , Noll . I had not thought of it before . Brother Noll and I always had spending-money . " " But I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little laugh ; " I could n't spend it if I tried , Uncle Richard ! " " You may find a use for it when the ' Gull ' begins her trips again , " said his uncle ; " at any rate , you shall have an allowance . You will find it on your study table every Monday morning . " Noll thanked his uncle for this kindness , but at the time , was much at a loss what to do with his weekly allowance which every Monday morning brought him . He found a use for it , however , as time will show . After this long talk , Noll felt somewhat lighter-hearted , if for no other reason than because he had received Uncle Richard 's permission to go on with his work of aid . Spring was not far off , and with its coming the fever would most likely flee , and then , he thought , there would be some hope of doing something for the Culm people . And was he not already doing something ? To Noll , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the poor fish-folk , his deeds were great and wonderful . All unconsciously , the boy was accomplishing one of the most difficult portions of the task which he had set for himself ,  - -  the winning of those rough , untaught hearts . Many an uncouth blessing was called down upon the lad 's head as he made his appearance day after day at the doors of the habitations which the fever had entered . His cheery , gladsome presence , the Culm folk thought , was like a ray of sunshine in the gloom of their hovels . It was curious to see how those great brawny men confided in him , and watched to see him coming down the sands of a morning-time , with his basket of delicacies on one arm , balanced by a basket of more substantial food on the other . Not one of the men but what , in their hearts , loved the boy and blessed the day which brought him to Culm Rock . And , quite before he was aware of it , Noll had accomplished one great object , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The snow melted and ran into the sea , the ice in the rock hollows trickled its life away , and warmer winds and sunnier clouds gave token of the spring 's coming ; and Noll grew happier every day and looked gleefully forward to the coming of the " Gull , " and the tidings which she would bring . Often in these days , when returning from his morning round , it seemed to the boy as if his own father 's blessing rested upon his heart , it was so light and glad , and that God 's love was all about him and smiling over the barren Rock and the far , wide sea . CHAPTER XIV . NED THORN . It was on one of the balmiest of spring afternoons that Noll went over to Culm to see a little child who was recovering from the fever . The sickness , apparently , had run its course , and the people were beginning to take heart ; and the men were overhauling their nets and making ready for their summer 's work . There had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found quantities of brilliant sea-weeds and curious shells and pebbles on his walk along the beach , and lingered long to search for treasures and enjoy the bright loveliness of the day . Culm Rock and the great sea had never looked fairer to him than on this afternoon ,  - -  the one lying warm and silent , its great stone ribs purpling under the sun , and the other flecked with curling ripples of snowy foam and emerald light . It was late afternoon when he arrived at the Culm houses , and so long did he linger that the sun was dipping in the waves before he was ready to leave his little patient . He was standing in the door , swinging his basket to and fro , and on the point of taking his departure , when a sudden shout of voices from without turned his attention in that direction . There , slowly riding in over the waves all burnished and aflame with ruddy sunlight , was the " Gull " ! For a few short seconds Noll actually stood still with pleasure and delight , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the wharf , as fast as he could go . The fishermen were already congregating there , and their wives were standing in the doors of their dwellings to gaze upon the welcome sight . The vessel 's white wings slowly brought her round to the little wharf , revealing the skipper 's sturdy person , and Mr. Snape 's long and solemn visage . Noll could hardly wait for the craft to touch the planks , and Skipper Ben spied the lad before the " Gull " came up , with a dull thump and jar , alongside . " Great fishes ! " cried he , extending his hand to aid Noll in clambering aboard , " if here be n't the lad , alive an ' hearty ! Glad ter see ye ,  - -  glad ter see ye ! " shaking the boy 's hand as if he never would have done . " You may believe I 'm glad to see you ! " said Noll ; " I never was so glad to see anything as the old ' Gull ' in my life ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Ben laughed . " I knowed ye hev a hard time o n't , " he said ; " reckoned ye 'd be glad ter see the old skipper once more . An ' , lad , how goes it ? " Mr. Snape came up just here , drawling , " What ye think o ' the winters down ' ere , now , lad ? " " They are long , " said Noll ; " but I 've got through one , somehow . If it were n't for the sickness , and such a long time without letters , I would n't mind . Oh ! skipper , have n't you got a great packet of ' em for me ? " " Been sick down ' ere ; hev ye ? " said Ben , evading Noll 's question . " Well , that 's wuss'n bein ' without letters , eh , lad ? " " But have n't you got a bundle of ' em for me ? " queried Noll . " I ca n't wait , skipper ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " but I did n't bring ye nary letter this time . Don ' know but all yer frien 's hev forgot ye , fur they did n't give a single scrap o ' paper to bring , nor a message , nuther . " Mr. Snape began to grin , seeing how Noll 's face fell , and how all his joy and eagerness had suddenly vanished , and stepping along to the hatchway , made certain mysterious signs and beckonings to something or some one , there . Noll , filled with disappointment , walked away to the stern and looked down into the green depths of water rippling there , and strove to conceal his feelings from the watchful skipper . Up from the hatchway and along the deck came a light step ,  - -  eager , hurrying ,  - -  and before Noll could turn around , two arms had clasped him about and held him fast against the rail , while a voice -- just as full of laughter and merriness as a voice could be -- cried ,  --  " Oh , Noll , Noll Trafford ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here ! Why , you dear old fellow , ai n't I better than letters ? I 've a good mind to never let you look around to pay for not mistrusting that I was here ! Oh , Noll ! " " Well , I be beat ! " said the skipper . " I never seed a lad so dumbfounded afore . What ye goin ' to give me fur bringin ' ye sech a parcel , Master Noll ? " But Noll had only eyes and ears for his friend . " Ned , Ned Thorn ! " he exclaimed , looking at his friend with wide-open eyes , as if he thought he was seeing a vision . " It is really you , only grown a little taller ! " " Of course it is ; who else should it be ? " said Ned , drawing his friend out to one of the skipper 's bales , where they could both sit down . " You 're brown as an old salt , Noll ; but you have n't grown a bit ! Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! I thought you 'd be dying by this time to see some one from Hastings , and when the skipper pointed out the old stone dungeon where you live , I thought likely you were dead already . What a horrid old fortress ' t is ! and were n't you awful homesick ? and are n't you terribly moped up in such quarters ? and , you dear old Noll , how have you managed to live it through , anyhow ? " " Beats everything at questions , that lad does , " observed Mr. Snape to the skipper ; " nigh about pestered me to death , comin ' down . You 'd better charge double ef yer goin ' to carry him home , ' cause it 's two days ' work fur one man ter tend to his talk . I be n't goin ' to do't fur nothin ' . " " They be n't glad to see each other , eh , Jack ? " said Ben ; " wish there was some prospect o ' taking t' other home , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Gull ' ' d founder , " said Mr. Snape . Noll , in the midst of happy talk , suddenly recollected that it was after sundown , and that Uncle Richard and the tea-table would be waiting . " Come , Ned , " he said , gleefully , " I 'd forgotten all about sunset and home till this minute . It 's a good long walk , and we must start . " " I 'm ready , " said Ned , jumping up . " Skipper , where 's my carpet-bag ? I 'm going to stay , Noll , just as long as you 'll keep me ; and now I 'm anxious for a look inside your old dungeon and a peep at that grim old -- that 's what the skipper said he was -- uncle of yours . Do you think he 'll scold because I 've come ? " " Indeed not ! " said Noll ; " and Uncle Richard 's not so very grim , either . We 'll have splendid times in the old house , and now see if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Culm Rock . " They clambered over the " Gull 's " side on to the wharf , and passed through in the little lane which the fishermen made for them , to the smooth and shining sand , and so started for the stone house . Ned Thorn was a boy of Noll 's own age , and much resembled him in appearance , though , of the two , Ned was a trifle the taller . Indeed , as Mr. Snape observed , leaning over the rail and smoking his pipe while he watched the two lads walking briskly homeward ,  --  " They 're as like as two peas , Ben ,  - -  did ye note ?  - -  only one 's more so than t' other . " It seemed to Noll , while on this homeward walk , that nothing was lacking to make home pleasant , now that Ned had come . His friend 's presence did not seem a reality , as yet , and he had to listen a long time to Ned 's merry chatter before he could realize that it was actually Ned Thorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the shore of the glimmering , sounding sea . " What a queer place ! " said Ned , stopping , at the curve of the shore , to look off at the horizon , which seemed to rise higher than their heads , and turning to look at the dark wall of rock behind them ; " and what a lonesome sound the waves make ! I should have died of the blues in three weeks . And what a miserable set those fishermen are ! They all seem to like you , though . Did you see how they made way for us , and touched their caps , some of them ? What a capital place to fish , off those rocks ! I 'm glad I brought hooks and lines , and -- What 's that light ahead ? A lighthouse ? " " No , only Hagar 's kitchen window , " said Noll ; " Hagar 's our black cook , and there 's only three of us in that great house , Ned ! " " I should think you 'd lose each other ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , Uncle Richard 's not much like papa , " said Noll , with sudden graveness ; " but he loves me , and -- and I hope you 'll like him , Ned . " They walked the rest of the way in silence till they came to the piazza steps under the shadow of the great stone house . " It looks just as it did when I saw it first , " said Noll ,  --  " the sea getting dark and shadowy and making that lonesome sound on the pebbles , and oh , how I had to rap and search before I could find my way in ! But come on , Ned . " Noll led his friend along the echoing hall , straight to Uncle Richard 's library , where the lamp had been lighted . " This is Ned Thorn , Uncle Richard , " said he , as they entered , " and he 's come clear from Hastings to see me . " " Ned is very welcome , " said Trafford , who chanced to be in a cheerful mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go out to tea . " Noll ran on before to Hagar 's kitchen , where he burst in , exclaiming ,  --  " Another plate and teacup , Hagar ! Did you know that we have actually got company ? It 's Ned Thorn , a dear friend of mine , and he 's from Hastings , and going to stay -- I do n't know how long . Will you bring them ? Is tea all ready ? " " Bress ye ! " said Hagar , " I 's ' stonished to see ye so ' cited , honey . I 'll bring de dishes in a minnit . " The old housekeeper followed him back to the dining-room , where the new-comer was endeavoring to interest Trafford in the account of the day 's journey , telling it in such a sprightly manner that the grim master was betrayed into more than one smile . " And now , Mr. Trafford , I 'm going to stay here in this dismal old house just as long as you 'll keep me , " said Ned , in conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip-top good times ! I do n't know as there 's a thing we can have fun out of , but if there is n't , we 'll invent something . We can fish ,  - -  there 's one consolation ! Why , Mr. Trafford , what does Noll do with himself , anyhow ? I think he 's grown as sober as -- as -- I do n't know what ! " " Very likely , " said Trafford , with a shadow of gloom on his face ; " this is a sober place . Noll has seen much of which you know nothing , and it has made him graver and more thoughtful , I suppose ; yet --  " " Yet you think he 's all the better for that ? " said Ned , merrily . " Well , so do I ! Papa always says I 'm too much of a rattle-box ; but I ca n't help it . I could n't be sober , like Noll , if I should try ; and you would n't want me to ; would you , old fellow ? " Noll looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretly wondered what Uncle Richard thought of his merry , light-hearted friend . The days which followed were happy ones . Trafford recollected that Noll had had a long winter of study , and granted a vacation to last during Ned Thorn 's stay ; so the two boys were at liberty to fish and ramble and explore rock and sand to their hearts ' content . They gathered basket after basket full of sea flowers and weeds of vivid dye , to be pressed and packed for transportation to Hastings , and such quantities of shells , with an occasional pebble of agate or carnelian , that Ned laughingly declared ,  --  " I 'll have just all the baggage the ' Gull ' can float under , Noll . I 'll have to charter it to convey me and mine ; for the skipper wo n't take me under any other condition , you may be sure . " And these days were merry ones too . Hagar declared , " Dat yer Thorn boy beat eberyt'ing dis ole woman eber seed . ' Peared like ther ' was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yer stairs , an ' laughin ' at de tops ob ther voices . Neber seed nuffn like it , nohow ! But is ye sorry , Hagar ? Ye knows ye is n't ! Ye likes to hear dis yer ole house waked up an ' ' pear as ef ' t was good fur somethin ' ' sides holdin ' mis'ry . " Noll more than once trembled lest Uncle Richard should be displeased at this unusual clamor and mirthfulness , and banish Ned in anger ; but day after day passed , and Trafford made no opposition to the boys ' plans or proceedings , and apparently took quite a fancy to Noll 's friend . " I 'd just like to coax your uncle into playing a game of ball with us , " said Ned , as the two sat on the piazza one evening at twilight ; " do you suppose he would consent ? " " Uncle Richard play ball ! " exclaimed Noll , laughing at the idea . " No ! I would almost as soon expect to see this old stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is the strangest man ! " observed Ned ; " but he loves you ,  - -  I can see that , every day ,  - -  - and perhaps he 'll come out as bright as a dollar , by and by . And -- do you remember ? you was to tell me about that plan to-night . Go in , Noll dear ,  - -  I 'm all attention . " CHAPTER XV . PLANS . Noll looked thoughtfully on the sea a few minutes before he said , " I do n't know what you 'll say , Ned , the plan is so difficult ; but I 've thought of it a long time ,  - -  I believe it 's been in my head every day for the last two months ,  - -  and it seems to me it is possible . Oh ! if it were , I 'd be the happiest boy in the land ! " " Well , now what have you got in your head , I 'd like to know ? " said Ned ; " tell me quickly , for I hate long speeches , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must know I want to help those Culm people , somehow . That's --  " " Yes , " interrupted Ned , " they need ' helping , ' I should think ! They 're the laziest , miserablest set of people I ever saw . Some of ' em need ' helping ' with a good , sound punching ,  - -  'twould stir ' em up a little . " " That 's the object of the plan , and the next thing is how to do it , " continued Noll . " If papa had only lived here a little time , I know it would have been a different place , and I want to make it what he would have made it ; but , though I ca n't do that , I want to do something . " " I 'll warrant you do ! " said Ned , edging nearer his friend . " What do you think Hagar has told me about your work this winter ? You are the funniest fellow , and I do n't see what puts such ideas in your head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I 'll never get to my plan at this rate , " said Noll , laughing a bit . " I do n't believe the people will ever be any cleaner or more industrious till they have better houses to live in , and they 're too poor to buy lumber and make repairs . Now , if I could only accomplish that , I think they 'd soon have some pride in keeping their dwellings nice and neat , and that would keep the fever away , and perhaps -- I almost know -- they 'd soon be a different people ! " " My stars ! " exclaimed Ned , " what 're you thinking of ? Do you really mean that -- that you 're going to repair their huts for them ? " " Yes , that is what I wish to do , and what I 've been planning for , " said Noll , peering through the dusk to see how Ned received the project ; " and do you think I 'll succeed ?  - -  do you think it is possible ? " Ned was silent a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and murmured far up and down the beach-line and died away in a faint whisper before he replied , " Well , I am astonished ! and if any one else had proposed it , I should say they were out of their wits . Now , what are those dirty fishermen to you , Noll ? " " That was not the question , " said Noll . " Do you think I can succeed ? " " I do n't know , ca n't tell , it 's all so sudden . Where will you get the money ? and why do n't your Uncle Richard do the work , instead of you ? " " Uncle Richard ? why , he -- he does n't care for the Culm people , " Noll was obliged to confess ; " but as for the money , I think I can manage that . You see , he gives me more spending-money every week than I used to have in a whole quarter ,  - -  I showed you all my savings the other night , you remember ,  - -  and it has got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more that Mr. Gray gave me when I came away , and with this I 'll make a commencement . The --  " " But what will your uncle say ? Does he know ? " queried Ned . " No , he knows nothing about it . But he gave me permission , a long time ago , to aid the Culm people , and he lets me do as I choose with my money . So does n't my plan seem possible ? " " Yes , if you can tell where lumber and nails and a carpenter are to come from , " said Ned . " Oh ! but those will have to come down from Hastings , on the ' Gull , ' of course . There 's nothing here to do with , " said Noll ; " and I mean to coax Ben Tate to buy the lumber and hire a carpenter for me . You see , I 've got it all planned , and if it will only work ! " " My stars ! " said Ned , " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't wonder these fish-folks all touch their hats to you ,  - -  they can afford to , I think . And , Noll , wo n't you tell me what these people are to you ? I ca n't see , for the life of me ! And why should you spend all your money for them ? " Noll hesitated , not feeling certain that Ned would understand his reason , if he told him , and , looking up at the stars , which had come out in great fleets over the sea , was silent . But Ned got up , came to Noll 's end of the step , and , sitting down beside him , said ,  --  " Now for your reason ! I 'll not be put off at all . Wo n't you tell me ? " " Yes , if you wish very much to know , " said Noll , in a lower tone . " I think everybody has a work to do ,  - -  a work that God gives them ,  - -  and I think this is mine , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do his work , and I mean to do it , if I can . Besides , " he added , softly taking Ned 's hand in his , " it is work that papa would do if he were here , and I know that he , too , would be glad to have me do it . Would n't you be anxious to get about it at once , and without waiting for the Culm people to sink lower , if you thought it was your work and waiting for your hands ? Would n't you , Ned ? " Noll 's friend was suddenly silent . It was hardly such a reason as he had expected to hear , and what to reply he did not know . " Noll always was the funniest fellow ever since I knew him ! " he thought to himself . Noll waited , and tried to look into his friend 's face , and feared that Ned did not comprehend his motives , after all . At last he said , " Do n't you understand ? " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I -- well -- I did n't know what to say , and , somehow , you make me ashamed . It seems too bad for you to waste -- spend , I mean -- your money for those fishermen . " " Oh , no , " said Noll , " I 've no need of it for myself , and if I had , they need it more than I. And , Ned , I want to beg you to help me . Will you ? " " Pshaw ! I 'd be no help at all ! " said Ned ; " I 'm no good at such things . " " But will you try ? " said Noll , eagerly . " Yes , if you wish . But I 'll be sure to bother or make a mess of something ,  - -  see if I do n't ! " At that instant the hall door behind them opened , and Trafford stepped out . So dark had it grown that he failed , at first , to see the two figures on the step ; but when a little stir of Ned 's betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief ,  --  " Ah , here you are , boys ! I feared that -- that you were up the shore , perhaps . Come in , come in . Why do you sit here in the darkness ? " " So I say ! " said Ned , briskly , and not regretting this interruption ; " what are we sitting here in the dark for , Noll ? Let 's go in ! " As they were groping along their darksome way to the library , Ned whispered ,  --  " When are you going to begin your plan , or ' put it in execution , ' as the books say ? " " The skipper will touch here to-morrow ; I 'd like to see him then , " said Noll . " Why not ? " returned Ned . " We can get up early and run over to Culm before breakfast , and coax Ben into doing the business for you . " " We will ! " said Noll , gladly , " and have the work begun at once ; and I knew you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish you were to stay here always . " The boys did not linger long in the library after arriving there , but went up to Noll 's chamber , where his little hoard of money was brought forth and counted . Neither of the lads knew how far it would go toward purchasing lumber , but to them the sum in hand seemed a large one , and they decided , after much deliberation , to place it in Ben 's hands , and trust to his judgment and discretion . " But how is the carpenter to be paid for his labor , if this all goes for lumber ? " queried Ned . " Why , my spending-money is accumulating all the time , " said Noll , " and though that wo n't be enough , I 'll manage to get the rest , somehow . I 'll write to Mr. Gray , or do something that will bring it . " They were both up at the first glimmer of dawn the next morning , and on their way to Culm long before the mist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They ran , and made all possible haste , and were only just in time after all ; for Ben was about to stand out on the day 's journey as they came panting and breathless on to the little wharf . " What be wantin ' now , lads ? " he cried , gruffly ; " we be in a hurry to get off ! " " But you must wait a few minutes , " said Ned , " for we want to come aboard , skipper . We ca n't run a mile for nothing , and before breakfast too . " " S'pose I shall hev ter ! " grumbled Ben , as he gave them each a hand to help them up . Noll brought forth his roll of money , and narrated his errand , disclosing for what object the lumber was to be purchased . Ben sat down and stared blankly at the boy , while Mr. Snape , who had drawn near , looked utterly bewildered . " Let me hear ye say that agen , " said Ben , when his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not hear ye rightly . " Noll repeated his errand , aided by some impatient explanations which Ned threw in for the skipper 's benefit . " Well , " said the " Gull 's " master , as he concluded , " I be beat ! Why , lad , ' tw'u 'd be like throwin ' yer silver into the sea to spend it on them good-fur-nothin ' , shif'less critters . An ' what be the like o ' them to you ? " " Why , " said Ned , coming to Noll 's relief , " he want 's to do them good . Ca n't you see through a ladder , Ben ? And what we want to know is whether you will do the business ? " The skipper was silent for a time . What was passing in his mind , the boys did not suspect , and they feared lest he should refuse . But presently he got up , saying , with gruffness which was assumed to hide a sudden tenderness in the old sailor 's heart ,  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  - -  tho ' I call ye foolish all the same . The ' Gull ' be engaged fur the next run , but the next after that ye shall hev yer boards an ' yer carpenter . " " That will be week after next , " said Ned . " Hurrah for you , Ben ! And I want to engage a passage home for next week . Come , Noll , let 's go back and let the skipper put out , if he 's in such a hurry . A good voyage to you , Ben !  - -  and do n't you forget that I 'm to go next week , now ! " " Ay , ay , " said Ben , " get along with you ! " and over the side went the boys , and , after a little delay , off went the " Gull " with Noll 's precious savings on board . " Wait , " said Noll , as they left the wharf , " there 's Dirk Sharp out there with his boat , ready to put off . Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And Noll ran off across the sand . Ned sat down on the wharf and watched his friend and the fisherman . They were sufficiently near for him to note the expressions upon their faces , and when he saw the blank look of wonder and incredulity that suddenly came over Dirk 's coarse features , he suspected that Noll was disclosing his project . " Oh , but Noll is a queer fellow , " he said to himself . " How can he care for these dirty , dull-witted fellows that ca n't spell their own names , when he is so smart and such a long , long way above them ? " But Noll , he remembered , had answered this question on the previous evening ; yet Ned could hardly comprehend such motives , and so sat puzzling his head over it till his friend came back with a pleased and happy face , to say ,  --  " I 'm ready now . You should have seen Dirk when I told what was going to be done ! The great fellow almost cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid me in a dozen ways , at least , and promised , oh ! so much besides . And it seems as if I 'll be the happiest boy in the world when once things are under way . " " I suppose you will be , " said Ned , with something like a sigh , " and I wish I could stay and see how the huts 'll look after you 've done with them . However , " he added , brightly , " I can come again sometime ,  - -  there 's one consolation . " The fair spring days went on with the speed with which all happy days fly by , and little by little the Culm people began to talk among themselves of the -- to them -- great event which was to take place so soon . Noll overheard one old fish-wife say , " We be n't slick ' nough for new housen ; ther 'll hev to be great scrubbin ' an ' scourin ' that day , eh , Janet ? " to her slatternly daughter-in-law ; and the boy mentally prayed that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was only some one to teach the children , and save them from the utter ignorance which was their parents ' , there would be great hope for Culm , he thought . Ned Thorn went home , and this was the only sad day which Noll knew during the two weeks ' waiting . He could not bid Ned good-by and see the dear , merry face fade away , as the " Gull " departed , without a great choking in his throat and a heaviness of heart that made one day a lonely , homesick one . CHAPTER XVI . THE WORK BEGUN . You may be sure that Noll did not fail to be at Culm village when the " Gull " and its precious freight arrived . The sky had been overcast all day and the sea somewhat rough , so that he was not certain that Ben would set sail from Hastings . But about half-past four in the afternoon the white wings of the skipper 's craft hovered on the horizon , and soon after began to loom into shape and proportion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piazza steps , anxiously surveying the sea and sky . A strong and vigorous breeze bore the " Gull " rapidly before it , and it was soon evident that it would arrive at the wharf before himself , unless he started soon . Recitations were over an hour ago , and he was now at liberty to go where he chose , and accordingly started for Culm at once . He arrived there some time before Ben and his craft , after all , and was forced to sit and wait impatiently . He could see the yellow lumber long enough before the " Gull " was in hailing distance , and knew that Ben had been successful . The skipper came alongside at last , shouting at the top of his voice , " Ahoy , there , men ! Give us a hand at this ' ere lumber , an ' be spry about it , fur there 's a storm brewin ' , an ' I 've got ter be twenty mile down the coast afore it breaks ! " The fishermen drew near at this summons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast , they began to unload the cargo , under the carpenter 's directions . It was carried well up the sand to preserve it from the dash of the sea and the treachery of the tide , and Noll stood looking on with a heart so full of joy and satisfaction that he forgot all about the skipper till a gruff voice cried , " Why do n't ye come aboard , lad ? Here be sumat fur ye that come from the city . It be a mighty thick letter , somehow . Give us yer hand an ' come up , lad ! " Noll got aboard quickly enough after this intelligence , and took the packet which the skipper fished out from under his pea-jacket , saying , " I wonder if it can be from Ned ? " " How ken I tell ? " said Ben , evasively . " Best open it , lad ,  - -  best open it . " Noll quickly had the envelope open , and , holding the packet upside down , there fell out upon the deck a thick little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off into the sea before the boy 's astonished senses returned to him . Ben prevented such a disaster , however , by picking up the roll and placing it in Noll 's hand , with , " It 's worth savin ' , lad , fur ' tai n't every bush that grows sech blossoms , eh ? " " I should think not , " said Noll , still full of amazement , and hurriedly opened his letter to see where this bounty hailed from , while Ben walked off to assist in his craft 's unlading . This is what Noll 's wondering eyes found :  --  " HASTINGS , May 20th . " DEAR NOLL ,  - -  I can imagine just how your eyes are staring by this time ; but you need n't be alarmed , for I came by the money honestly . This is how it was : Papa said I might have a new pony if I would save my spending-money till I got a third of the sum which one would cost , and so , though I did n't hint of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been laying up and laying up , like an old miser ; and last Monday morning I found that I had got the sum , and so papa made up the rest to me . But when I thought of you and those miserable Culm people , and how you were making a fool of yourself ( as Ben T. said ) , I thought I 'd like to -- to -- well , let pony go , and help you a bit . So here 's the whole sum ( if you get it safe ) , and you 're just as welcome as you can be , and do n't you make any fuss about it , for it 's your own , and I can go without spending-money if you can , and am willing to too . And it 's no great denial , either , for the pony 'll come sometime , I 'm quite sure . So do n't you worry any more about how the carpenter is to be paid . Good-by , dear old fellow , " NED THORN . " P.S. -- I was just as dismal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go back to that dreary , dismal , good-for-nothing Culm Rock . The shells , etc. , got here all right . Give my respects to Uncle Richard , and tell him I 'll come down and turn his house topsy-turvy for him again next summer , if he wants me to . Do n't you forget to send a letter back by Ben , now . " Noll finished this characteristic letter with something very like tears in his eyes . " The dear , generous fellow ! " he thought to himself ; " how could he ever bring himself to do it ? for it is a denial , because Ned is so fond of a horse ! And he claimed , all the time , that he never could help at all ! " Ben came stumping along the deck with his gruff , " Well , we hev brought yer lumber an ' yer carpenter , lad ,  - -  both on ' em the best I c'u 'd find . One 's ' bout stacked up on the sand , yender , and t'other 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good at his trade , John Sampson be , an ' he 'll do fair an ' square by ye . John be n't delicate neither , an ' wo n't mind the livin ' he 'll get ' mongst these ' ere good-fur-nothin 's ,  - -  I looked out fur that , ye see . " " I thank you more than I can tell , Ben , " said Noll , taking the skipper 's hand ; " and have you taken your pay for the freight and all the trouble ? " " The freight be paid fur , " said Ben , " an ' the trouble likewise . An ' ef ye hev anythin ' more fur the ' Gull ' ter do , do n't ye be backward , boy , about lettin ' her know't . " The last of the lumber was now being dragged up the sand , and the skipper hurried away , saying ,  --  " Luck ter ye an ' yer undertakin ' , lad ! We be in a desput hurry to get off , fur we 'd stan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Noll wished the skipper a safe run to a better harbor , and went back to the wharf , where the carpenter intercepted him . He was a rough , blunt-spoken man , but was evidently " good at his trade , " as Ben had said , and did not despair of making the Culm huts decent and habitable ; and after a long talk with him , Noll started for home , as the afternoon was fast giving way to a gray and lowery night . His heart was full of gratitude and love to Ned , and he stopped more than once on his homeward walk to read the letter over by the gray glimmer of twilight . At first he was more than half resolved to return the money , and bid his friend to buy the pony , it seemed such a great denial for horse-loving , mirthful Ned to make ,  - -  but as he read the letter again and again , and pondered over its contents , he began to think that his friend had more earnestness and love for kind-doing than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he thought to himself , " because he was so merry and careless all the time . And now he 's sent me this great roll of bills to help those people whom he pretended to hate ! Oh , I wonder if it is best to keep them ? " This question was not decided then . It took more than one day 's thought about the matter before he at last concluded to accept Ned 's bounty , and perhaps he would not have decided thus at all if he had been quite sure that his friend would not be greatly grieved and offended at having the money returned . Meanwhile , the carpenter commenced operations . Dirk 's house was the first to undergo repairs , and Noll took every opportunity to go over to Culm to see how matters were progressing . It was a great delight to him to watch John Sampson at his labor , and note how saw and hammer and plane , guided by his strong and skilful hand , repaired the rents , brought the shackling doors and windows to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume something like straight and even proportions , and righted matters generally . When Dirk 's habitation was thoroughly repaired , it was the wonder and admiration of all the Culm people . " It be like what it was when I was a gal , an ' all the housen was new , " said one old fish-wife , who had tottered in with the others . " Ay , mother , " said Dirk , " an ' it be time we had new habits to go with the new housen , eh ? " Noll had not allowed any good opportunities , wherein he might hint to Dirk that cleanliness and industry should reign in the snug new quarters , to pass without improving them . Dirk , out of regard and gratitude to " the young master , " as he called him , was willing to make the attempt , and strove , in his bungling way , to impress his neighbors with the fact that they were expected to reform their way of living . But it was up-hill work for people who had lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but slowly . Many were the hours , after the recitations were over , that Noll spent over at the little village those warm days , planning with John Sampson about broken doors and shattered beams , which were to be made strong and serviceable , or , sitting on a pile of lumber , watching the carpenter as he put in execution the plans which they had made . The children of the village were generally playing near by , in the sand , with blocks and chips ,  - -  growing up as unlettered and ignorant as their parents . Some of them were great boys and girls ,  - -  almost as tall as Noll himself ,  - -  and had never yet seen the inside of a book . " If Uncle Richard would only hire a teacher , " thought Noll , " and have them grow up with some knowledge in their heads , they 'd never get so low and wretched as their parents . But that never 'll be , I 'm afraid . Oh ! if I were only rich , how quick I 'd change it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune befalling him , and he usually turned away from the cluster of dirty , unkempt children with a hopeless sigh . He said , one day , while sitting on a great heap of shingles beside the carpenter ,  --  " What 's to become of all these children , Mr. Sampson ? Will they be left to grow up like their fathers and mothers ? " " Well , I do n't see much to hinder , " said the carpenter , with a glance at the dirty little ones who were throwing sand over their heads . " Do n't think you 'll ever see many lawyers and ministers out o ' the lot . " " If there could only be a school here , " continued Noll , " what a change it would make ! But there 's no teacher , no schoolroom , no nothing , and no prospect of there ever being anything ! " " Why do n't you teach ' em yourself ? " said Sampson , between the creakings and rasping of his saw . Noll was silent for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the truth , I never had thought of the thing . But how can I ? I do n't have any time till after four o'clock . " The carpenter sawed and planed , and made no reply , being entirely indifferent to the whole matter ; but his chance question had put an idea in Noll 's head which was not out of it for that afternoon , at least . Could he teach those idle , ignorant children ? he wondered . Would they ever sit still long enough to look in a book ? And where could a room for the school be found ? And where was the leisure time to come from ? Noll pondered over these questions many days , and several times came near discarding the plan as impracticable . He knew that he could only have the time after recitations were over for his own , and that , at the most , would be only an hour or two ,  - -  the time between four o'clock and the supper-hour . He was quite sure that he was willing to give this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , and if a room could be found for them to assemble in . A whole week of days went by before he mentioned this plan to any one , and then it was only Dirk to whom he mentioned it . The rough fisherman looked upon reading and writing as some of the wonderful and mysterious arts to which dull and humble people like himself had no right . He looked blank and mystified at Noll 's proposition , and expressed himself thus :  --  " I don ' know , I don ' know , lad ,  - -  we but poor folk anyway . But ye ken do as ye like , an ' ef ye say so , the youngsters shall take ter books an ' sech , an ' ye ken hev a room where ye say , I 'll say fur't . I don ' know , I don ' know , lad ; ye mus ' do as ye think it best , anyway . " CHAPTER XVII . THE WORK PROGRESSING . Studies at home progressed steadily under Uncle Richard 's supervision , meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction in directing his nephew 's tasks than he would have been willing to acknowledge . The boy brought so much brightness and pleasant life into the gloomy stone house that the stern master , as week after week passed by , visibly began to lose something of his grimness and gloominess , and to take something like a faint interest in what was passing around him . And , after a time , he himself began to be sensible of this gradual change which was stealing over his thoughts and actions , and , vexed with himself , strove to check these new emotions , and wrap himself again in the cloak of sadness and melancholy which so long had shielded him from everything bright and cheerful and happy . But he found it hardly an easy task . Noll was almost always blithe and light-hearted , and Trafford found his bright influence a hard one to struggle against . He loved the boy so well that it was almost an impossibility to harden his heart to all his winning ways and pleasant talk , which met him so constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight in , were days of struggle and wavering to his uncle . He could not but acknowledge to himself that he was interested in all the boy 's plans for the future ,  - -  all his youthful anticipations of happiness and success ,  - -  all his present little projects for progress and self-improvement ,  - -  and these matters , trivial though they may have been , gradually drew his thoughts from himself and his sorrow , put them farther and farther away into the dimness and silence of the past , and made the present a more vivid and earnest reality . Was it any wonder that , seeing he could not maintain his gloom and grimness in Noll 's sunshine , and finding it slipping away from him in spite of his endeavors to retain it , he should astonish his nephew by strange fits of moroseness , alternating with the utmost kindness and indulgence ? The boy sometimes fancied that his uncle had grown to utterly dislike him , being so irritable and unjust at times ; then again his heart was light with joy and hope , for he fancied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing his great burden of gloom , and becoming hopeful and unoppressed . But how could he be hopeful for whom there was no hope ?  - -  who refused to trust in God 's promises ? for whom the shadow of the grave was utter darkness and horror , wherein dear faces had vanished -- forever ? One day Noll had begged him to come out for a walk on the beach , thinking he would lead his uncle on and on till they should come out upon Culm village , and in this manner disclose what he had been doing for the dwellings and their inmates . Trafford at first appeared inclined to consent , and followed his nephew out as far as the piazza steps , but here he stopped , and all Noll 's entreaties could not prevail upon him to go further . He sat down , looking dispiritedly across the tranquil sea , all warm and fair with changing lights , and down at his feet at the bit of verdure which Noll had caused to flourish by dint of much seed-sowing and watering , saying , " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go no further . " So Noll was obliged to set off for Culm alone , consoling himself with the thought that next time , perhaps , he should be so successful as to get Uncle Richard a little farther , and next time a little way farther still , till , at last , they might walk together as uncle and nephew should . Would that happy day ever come ? he wondered . At last , after many delays and hindrances , the plan of a school was decided upon . Noll did not begin the undertaking with much confidence of success , or with any great hope of making the Culm children very bright or vigorous scholars ; but it would be something toward supplying the great want , he thought , and who could tell what this little beginning might lead to ? So , about half-past four one misty , lowery afternoon , he found himself in a little room in Dirk 's dwelling , with ten dirty-faced , frowsy-headed children huddled together in one corner , each of them regarding him with wide-open eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for . The only furniture which the " schoolroom " could boast were two rough benches , just from John Sampson 's hands , and a three-legged stool , which Noll appropriated to himself . Of course none of the ten had anything in the shape of books or primers , and here the boy had reason to rejoice that all his old school-books had made the journey with himself to Culm . After getting the wondering assemblage seated in proper order , Noll began by asking , " Who wants to learn to read ? " It seemed as if the sound of his voice had wrought a spell , for each of the ten were as silent as so many mutes . " Who would like to know how to read ? " Noll repeated . Still a long silence , most discouraging to the teacher . At last -- the sound of his voice a most welcome one to Noll -- a little fellow , who sat on the end of one of the benches , ventured to query , " What be ' read ' ? " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain what ' read ' is before they 'll know whether they fancy it , to be sure ! I did n't think of that . " Among his books was a great primer , with painted letters and pictures , and bringing this forth , he gathered the ten around him , and used all his powers of description and story-telling to endeavor to awaken the slumbering interest of these unpromising pupils . It was a weary hour 's work . A few of them betrayed a slight curiosity in regard to the bright colors , which Noll endeavored to stimulate ; but it soon died out , and all looked on and listened with listless attention . They appeared much more inclined to stand with their fingers in their mouths , and gaze steadfastly into Noll 's face , than to put eyes on the book . " If I had the alphabet stamped upon my face , I believe they 'd learn it easily enough ! " he thought to himself , in despair , as , on looking up , he found the whole ten staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the primer during his long explanation . As a last resort , he stepped out upon the sand in front of the door , and there drew a great A. " Now , " said he , " see which of you can make a letter like that . Take a stick and try , every one of you . Look sharp , and make it just like the one I 've made . " Thereupon , there was a great searching for sticks , and when all the little ones had been supplied , there was a great scratching and marking in the sand . To Noll 's great delight , the result was two or three tolerable A 's , which were allowed to stand , and the rest were brushed away . Then a new attempt at making the wonderful symbol ensued , and added another to the successful list , and so the letter-making was kept up till all the pupils had succeeded in making a tolerably faithful representation of the letter . Noll began to take heart . What the children cared nothing for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw on the sand , and soon learned to give the proper pronunciation of the character . The night came on apace , and Noll began to perceive that it was time for him to be on his homeward way . " Remember , " he said to his pupils , who were scratching A 's all about the door , " you 're not to forget this while I 'm gone . To-morrow afternoon I 'll come again , and then I shall want to see you make it over , and you are to have a new letter , besides . Will you all be here ? " " Yes ! yes ! " one after another promised ; and , once more bidding them remember , Noll walked away ,  - -  the children still making the mysterious character along the beach , and keeping it up till darkness came over sea and land . " Only one letter ! " Noll said to himself , as he hurried homeward . " Why , that 's not a tenth of what I meant to do this afternoon ! What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ever learn the whole alphabet ? " The prospect did not seem very encouraging , and he was obliged to confess himself disappointed with the result of the first day 's lesson . " However , one ca n't tell much by the first afternoon , " he thought . " Perhaps they 'll be quicker and brighter when we 're better acquainted . " The next afternoon he arrived at Dirk 's house at the appointed time , and found not ten , but twelve awaiting him , sticks in hand , and all eager for the lesson to commence . Noll could not refrain from laughing at the sight which the sand directly in front of the house presented , covered as it was with A 's of all shapes and sizes . It looked much as if a great bird , with a peculiarly-constructed foot , had been walking there . He did not need to be assured that his pupils had all remembered yesterday 's lesson , and proceeded at once to instruct them in the art of making B. This the young learners of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but appeared to like it none the less on that account , and , after its curves were mastered , were much delighted with this acquisition to their stock of accomplishments . While this second lesson was yet in progress , Dirk and one or two other fishermen came up from their boats , and stopped to look on , with wonder and astonishment written on their countenances . " I don ' know , " said Dirk , shaking his head as he eyed the mystic characters traced before him ; " we be all poor folk , anyhow , an ' this do beat me ! Why , what be this ? " he exclaimed , pointing at a letter staring up at him from the sand at his feet . " That be A ! " said half a dozen voices at once . " An ' what be this ? " said Hark Darby , pointing to a character by his feet . " That be B ! " chorused the voices again . The two fishermen exchanged wondering glances . " That do beat me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with much awe . " Ah , lad , " turning to Noll , " my little gal w'u 'd liked yer teaching , an ' yer B 's an ' A 's , eh ? " and Dirk drew his hand across his eyes . Noll went home much encouraged after this second alphabet lesson . Time and patience would do something for these Culm children , after all , he thought . And could he have the patience and skill which was necessary ? " I 'll try ,  - -  I 'll try hard for it ! " he thought , " and pray Christ to keep me from losing my patience and courage . It 's his work , and he 'll help me to teach them , and by winter there 'll be something accomplished . " And of his help he had great need , for patience and courage were often sorely tried in the days which followed , and it was not always his pupils ' obtuseness which brought the greatest strain to bear upon them . One old fish-wife , the oldest woman in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children as suspicious and ill-omened . " It be a bad day fur us , lads , " she warned , standing on Dirk 's door-step among the fishermen , and looking frowningly upon Noll as he instructed his pupils in the making of U. " It be no good fur yer chile to be ther ' , Hark Darby , learnin ' ye don ' know what ! Yes , lads , I say it be an evil day , and ye 'll find no good cum from it ! I warn ye , I warn ye ! " shaking her skinny forefinger and solemnly nodding her head . Noll 's face flushed at these words , and he half resolved to go home , and leave these Culm children to their parents ' ignorance . " I warn ye ! I --  " The old crone was about to continue her forebodings ; but Dirk interposed with a gruff , " Hush ye , hush ye , Mother Deb ! ye be doin ' the lad wrong . D'ye think he be one to teach our young uns wrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd he be doin ' us a bad turn who 's mendin ' the housen an ' makin ' us comf'table ? I 'd like ye ter show't , mother , ef it be ! " " Ay , " said Hark Darby , " an ' ef he ken do us evil , who ha ' been so good an ' kind in the sickness , we w'u 'd like ye ter show't , Mother Deb ! " The old woman said no more , but went muttering homeward , not all convinced that Noll was not teaching the children some evil , mysterious art . CHAPTER XVIII . THE WORK FINISHED . The days went by ,  - -  busy enough for Noll with lessons and the afternoon lesson at Culm ,  - -  and John Sampson 's labors began to draw to a close . The carpenter had worked steadily and faithfully , and the result was a gratifying one to more than one person . True , the houses were not models of elegance ; that was not needed ; and they did look somewhat patchy , with here and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dwelling , and new doors staring blank and yellow out of the dinginess of their surroundings ; but , if they were not handsome , they were thoroughly repaired and now stood warmer and more comfortable than any of the present generation of Culm people had ever known them . If they could only have a coat of paint or whitewash to make them look fresh and cheerful , what an improvement it would be ! Noll thought . How the sun would gleam upon them with his last ruddy rays as he sank into the sea ! How fair and pleasant they would look from the sea , when the coast first came upon the mariner 's vision ! It would be one bright spot against the black background of the Rock ,  - -  those twelve houses , if only they might have a coat of fresh white paint . But after counting his stock of money , this desire was obliged to remain ungratified ; for there was the carpenter 's bill , which would shortly be due , and must be paid upon the completion of the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Noll thought , with something like a sigh ; " they can wait , after all , for the painting is n't really necessary , though it would improve them wonderfully ! And I 'm thankful enough that I can pay the carpenter . Oh , but I wonder if Ned ever regrets his denial , and longs for the pony ? " Letters came down from Ned Thorn with almost every trip of the " Gull , " but not a word about the pony did they contain , nor the least sentence which Noll could interpret to mean a sigh or regret for the pet which he had given up . If Ned felt any regret , it was all carefully hidden from his friend 's observation , and the missives , which Noll received through the skipper 's kindness , were fairly bubbling over with the briskness and bright spirits of Ned 's light heart . " If they should stop coming , I do n't know how I could manage , " thought Noll ; " I 'm afraid Culm Rock would grow dreadfully lonesome and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you get on with your plan ?  - -  and are the houses ' most finished ? " or , " Have you got those Culm savages almost civilized , you dear old Noll ?  - -  and does Uncle Richard know anything about it yet ? Wo n't he stare ! and what do you suppose he 'll say ? " or , " Oh , now I think of it , how many scholars in Latin have you got down there ? and how do they manage with their Greek ? And are you putting on airs because you 've got to be a pedagogue ? And how much is the tuition a term ?  - -  because , you see , I 've some idea of going away to boarding-school , and yours might suit me , if the charges are n't too high . " And the whole generally concluded with , " P. S. -- I do n't mean a word of all that last I 've written , my dear Noll , and you 're not to think so . How does the money hold out ? Do n't fail to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll try to get a few dollars somehow . And hurry up and answer this letter by return steamer ( what should we do if the old ' Gull ' went to the bottom ? ) , and so good-night , " etc. , etc . Perhaps Noll expected a great deal too much of the Culm people when he looked to see them give up their filthy and slovenly habits at once , after getting fairly settled again in their whole and comfortable abodes . If he really expected to see this , he was disappointed . People do not follow a habit for the best part of a lifetime , to give it up suddenly and at once , even when gratitude and a sense of their short-coming are both urging them to do so . So he was obliged to content himself with some few faint evidences of thrift , and a desire to do better , on the part of those whom he had befriended , and wait patiently for the rest . Dirk 's household improved somewhat . Dirk was the most intelligent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much better and pleasanter to live cleanly and neatly than to pattern his household arrangements after the beasts of the field . He was , moreover , strongly actuated to reform his way of living by his deep , strong sense of gratitude to Noll , which led him to endeavor to accomplish whatever the boy suggested . It gave the stalwart fisherman something like a feeling of shame to see the lad -- bright , fresh , and ruddy -- enter his dirty and smoke-begrimed hovel and hardly be able to find himself a seat among the litter of old nets , broken chairs , household utensils , and all conceivable kinds of rubbish which strewed the floors and filled the corners . " It be a shame , " Dirk said to his wife , after Noll had gone , one day , " that the lad hev ter stan ' up , an ' be n't able ter find a seat , nohow . I tell ye it be a shame , woman ! " " Ye might mend the chairs a bit , man ! " retorted Mrs. Sharp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seat then . " Dirk was sulky for a while after this , but saw that there could be nothing to sit upon so long as the chairs were for the most part legless , and at last got energy enough to mend them after a rude fashion . Then another place was found for the old nets besides the two corners by the fireplace , and when these had been removed , Mrs. Sharp took her broom and -- well , it was not exactly sweeping , for the woman had not much idea of what a good housekeeper would call sweeping , but it was a feeble attempt at cleanliness , and she really thought she had made a great exertion , and was certainly proud of the achievement . Dirk chanced to be at home when Noll came again , and the flash of surprise and pleasure which swept over the boy 's face as he entered and noted the change which had taken place since his last call pleased Dirk amazingly . " Here be a seat fur ye , lad , " he said , not without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rough three-legged block and placed it for his visitor . A faint stir of worthy ambition having slightly roused Dirk and his wife , they were hardly contented to allow matters to remain as they were . Mrs. Sharp once more took her broom , and used it with rather better effect . Dirk made an onslaught upon the rubbish which had been collecting in their kitchen and about the doorsteps for years , and which no one had had the energy to remove , and threw many a basketful into the sea . The neighbors , meanwhile , were not entirely insensible to the fact that Dirk 's house began to present -- both within and without -- a much more cleanly and respectable appearance than their own . They stopped at the door to look in and say , " La , ye be slickin ' up finely , Dirk ! " or , " Ye be gittin ' fine ways , lately , man . An ' what be all this fur ? " " Why , " Dirk would answer , " I be ' shamed of livin ' like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wishin ' us to hev cleaner housen an ' slicker , an ' I be willin ' to do't ef he wish , now ! He be a good lad to mend our housen so finely , and w'u 'd ye think I be n't willin ' to do his wish ? " Noll was greatly encouraged at these signs of improvement , and mentally rejoiced , hoping to see this new ambition spread till the whole twelve houses were reclaimed from their present filth and wretchedness . The carpenter 's work came to an end at last , his labor all plain and visible to every eye in patched walls , roofs , mended doors and windows , and the general look of repair about the whole line of what were once but the poorest of shelters . Sampson 's task had been a hard and bothersome one ,  --  " Could n't ha ' got another man to teched it , " the skipper said ,  - -  and Noll expected , as he walked around to Culm one afternoon with his roll of bills to pay the carpenter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more than Ned 's generous bounty and his own amount of spending-money , saved since the lumber was purchased , could meet . He found Sampson packing up his tools ,  - -  he was to leave on the " Gull " the next morning , with the bill all ready , added up and written out on a bit of smooth shingle . It proved to be five dollars less than the sum which Noll held in his hand . " I swun ! " said Sampson , roughly , as he counted over the bills which the boy placed in his hands , " I told the skipper , comin ' down , that you was a born fool to be layin ' out your money in this style . Now , I 've been thinkin ' o n't over all the while I 've been hammerin ' and sawin ' , and I ca n't make out , to save my neck , how you 're goin ' to get any return from this ' ere investment . ' Tai n't payin ' property , I should judge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach . " Of course I do n't expect to get any money back from it , " said Noll , laughing a little at the idea . " It was to help these fish-folk and to try and make them more comfortable that I did it . " Sampson put the roll of bills away in his capacious purse , remarking , " Well , you 're a queer un . I did the job right well , though , if I do say it , and I ha' n't charged very steep for it , neither . Could n't do it , somehow !  - -  went too much against the grain . And -- well , ca n't you shake hands over it ? You 're a tip-top paymaster , and if you want anything done , I 'll come and do it , if I 'm in China -- there ! Do n't you lay out another cent on this settlement , though ,  - -  'tai n't worth it . " Noll did not promise to take this advice , and started homeward , Sampson calling after him , " Good-by , good-by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ere investment ! " So the work was done , and a glad and happy letter went over the sea to Hastings , telling Ned Thorn that the labor was accomplished , and the houses all as whole and comfortable as when new , and that the people were actually beginning to show a little thrift and ambition ; and saying , among other things , " I send you back five dollars that were left ,  - -  so you can begin to save your money again for that pony . And , oh ! Ned , I do n't think you can know how much good that money did ! Perhaps you never will know ( it must seem to you almost like throwing it away , because you are where you can not see any result from it ) , and I felt , at first , as if you ought not to make the denial ; but , somehow , I 'm very glad , now , and I shall always feel sure that if you do make fun and pretend to laugh at a plan , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift , ' as you say . And , oh ! Ned , I believe I 'm one of the happiest boys in the world ! and I 'm sure Uncle Richard has changed a great deal since last spring , when you were here , for he 's got over being cross and gloomy , and actually asked me yesterday where I spent so much of my time . I 'm going , if I can , to persuade him to take a walk with me , one of these afternoons , and so bring him around to the new houses . Would n't you like to be here to see us then ? As for my school , it flourishes a little . There are still twelve scholars , and all but four have got through with their sand letters , and are at work at their ' a-b , ab , ' and ' b-a , ba . ' They 'll get into spelling-books , sometime . Now , I 'll end this long letter with telling you once more that you ca n't know how much good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Good-night , " NOLL TRAFFORD . " Noll did not lose sight for a moment of his plan to persuade Uncle Richard to take a walk with him . It filled his thoughts all the pleasant days that followed after Mr. Sampson 's departure , and several times he hinted very broadly to his uncle that it was " a splendid afternoon for a walk ! the beach is hard as a floor , and the tide out . " But Trafford was oblivious to all hints , and at last , on one warm , balmy , cloudless afternoon , Noll thought , " It is now , or never ! I 'll ask him at once . " And straightway he started for the library , where he knew his uncle sat reading . CHAPTER XIX . A HAPPY WALK . Trafford looked up from his books as his nephew entered , and greeted him with a smile . Noll thought this welcome portended good , and remembered , with a grateful thrill in his heart , that Uncle Richard had fallen into the habit of greeting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chair , and without waiting for his courage to cool , laid a hand on the reader 's arm , saying ,  --  " Uncle Richard , I 've come to ask a great favor of you . Do you think you 'll grant it ? Ca n't you guess what it is ? " Trafford did not reply at once , but sat looking steadfastly into his nephew 's face , his eyes wearing the dreamy , far-away look which lingered in them much of late , and it was not until Noll had repeated his question that he replied , musingly ,  --  " I 'm sure I can not think . Perhaps you wish more pocket-money , or --  " " Oh , no ! " answered the boy , quickly , " it 's nothing like that , Uncle Richard ! It's -- it's -- oh , it 's will you take a walk ? " Trafford 's forehead began to wrinkle and slowly gather the shade of gloom which seemed always hovering about him , even in his most cheerful moments ; but before it had time to cover the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refusal , Noll 's hand was endeavoring to smooth away the wrinkles , and he was saying ,  --  " There , do n't say ' No , '  - -  do n't , Uncle Richard ! I wo n't ask you to go again if you are not pleased with this walk , but this time -- just this once -- do say ' Yes , ' uncle ! There ca n't be a pleasanter afternoon in the whole year than this , and I 've walked alone , always till now . Why , Uncle Richard , you wo n't say ' No ' this time ? " Trafford hesitated , a refusal trembling on his lips , which he did not quite wish to utter . The boy had walked alone , he remembered , and it was a very simple request to grant ; and if it was going to be such a pleasure and gratification to Noll , why not yield , and for once put aside his own preferences and inclinations ? It is not an easy matter for a man who has lived only for himself and his own pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the happiness and comfort of another ; but , with an effort , Trafford put his books away , and rose from his chair , saying ,  --  " This once , Noll ,  - -  this once . One walk with me will suffice you , I think . When shall we start ? " " Now ,  - -  at once , Uncle Richard ! " said Noll , joyfully ; " it 's two o'clock already , and the tide a long , long way out . Do n't let 's wait a minute longer . " Trafford smiled a little at his nephew 's eagerness , and taking his hat , followed the boy to the piazza . It was a great change from the half-gloom of the library , and the chilliness of the long , dark halls , to the bright , sunny piazza , where the light fell so warm and broadly , and from whence the blue and shining sea stretched far and wide and vast . Noll felt sure that Uncle Richard must notice it and rejoice , even though it might be secretly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to hinder the sunbeams from finding the earth and working wondrous charms on land and rock and sea . They stood for a few minutes there , one of them , at least , enjoying the wide view very much , then Noll said ,  --  " We 'll go up the shore , if you 'd as lief , Uncle Richard . It 's much pleasanter that way , I think . " " Very well , " said Trafford , with an indifference which was not encouraging , and they passed down the steps on to the sand . It was a silent and uncomfortable walk for the first few rods , Trafford walking with his head bowed upon his breast and looking only at the yellow sand upon which he trod . He seemed to have no eyes for the calm and gentle peace which had descended upon that afternoon , robbing the sea of its terror and making it enchanting and lovely , and weaving a mystic charm about the bare , bald Rock basking warm and purple under the sun . Even the waves murmured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they rippled in and out among the rocks and along the sand . Fortunately for their pleasure , Noll picked up a curious pebble before they had gone a great way . It was not an agate , nor was it like the rounded pebbles of porphyry which the tide washed up , and puzzling over this , and asking Uncle Richard , at last , to explain its nature , somehow broke the heavy silence which had been between them , and questions and pleasant talk came naturally enough after this . Trafford lost his gloom and reserve , and followed after his nephew , chatting and explaining strange matters of rock and sea , and stopping now and then to pull over great bunches of freshly-stranded kelp to help Noll search for rare shells or bits of scarlet or purple weed which were hidden and entangled there . How brightly shone the sun ! What peace and calm hovered over land and sea ! He was just beginning to be conscious of the joy and loveliness which the afternoon held . It was no wonder , he thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant earth , and found delight in all the hours which flitted by . But for himself , alas ! all this brightness was clouded over by the ever-present , ever-shadowing darkness of the future . It might have been different if -- if -- But with a sigh Trafford put away these thoughts , and followed on . They lingered around the rocks in their path , black with fringes of dry sea-weed , and talked of gneiss and sienite , granite and trap ; they stopped at the curve in the shore , and sat down to watch the white flitting of sails on the far horizon-line , and somehow , the sight of them led to a long talk about Hastings and Noll 's papa , and happy memories of other days . Trafford was in a softened mood as they rose up from their seat on a great fragment which had fallen from the cliff above , and Noll said ,  --  " Come , Uncle Richard , let 's keep on toward Culm . It 's so pleasant , and night is a long way off yet . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have turned about and retraced his steps , but Noll had started on , and Trafford followed , thinking , " It is n't often the boy has company in his rambles . I can humor him for once . " Slowly enough they approached the Culm houses , loitering along the moist , shining sand , over which the waves had rolled and rippled but a few hours before , and marking their devious path with straying footprints . Noll 's heart began to beat somewhat faster as they neared the fishermen 's houses , and he kept a keen watch upon his uncle 's face in order to detect the first look of surprise and astonishment that should come across it when he perceived how the huts had been improved . But Trafford 's eyes were turned toward the sea , thoughtfully and gravely , and they drew very near the village without the discovery being made . They came upon Dirk , Hark Darby , and two or three other fishermen , spreading their nets in the sun , all of whom touched their hats and nodded respectfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious eyes and half-averted faces . The sight of these men brought Trafford 's eyes and thoughts back to Culm and the present . He turned to Noll , saying , with a little smile ,  --  " Some of your sworn friends ? " " Yes , they 're my friends , Uncle Richard , " said Noll , expecting every moment to see Trafford raise his eyes to the houses , which they were passing , " and they do me a great many favors too . " " In what way ? " Trafford was about to ask ; but just then he looked up and about him , and the words died on his lips . Noll paused , waiting in suspense for what was to come next . His uncle stood still , and looked for a full minute upon Dirk 's house , then cast his eyes up and down the line of dwellings , while a look of wonder and amazement came over his face . He turned about , and looked at Noll , who could not , for the life of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks and over his forehead , and then he looked at the houses again . A sudden suspicion came into Trafford 's mind , and turning his keen eyes upon Noll , he exclaimed ,  --  " Can you explain this ? " The nephew hesitated , looked down in some embarrassment , then gathering sudden courage , looked up and answered , brightly , " Yes , Uncle Richard , I know all about it . " It was all plain to Trafford then . For a moment his own eyes faltered and refused to meet Noll 's , and he showed some signs of emotion . But his voice and tone were as calm as ever when he said , a few minutes after ,  --  " You did this ? How can I believe it ? What had you to do with ? And why was I not consulted , if this was your work ? " " Oh , Uncle Richard ! " said Noll , quickly , " do n't be vexed with me . You gave me permission to help these Culm people . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again looked at the line of comfortable , well-repaired houses . There were deeper thoughts and emotions in his heart at that moment than Noll could know or guess . The long silence was so uncomfortable that the boy was fain to break it , with , " I 've one more thing to show you , Uncle Richard . It 's not much ,  - -  only just a beginning ,  - -  but I 'd like you to see and know about it . " Trafford followed , without a word , and Noll led the way to the little schoolroom , with its two benches and three-legged stool and pile of well-thumbed primers and spelling-books . " It 's not much , " said Noll , apologetically , " but it 's a beginning , and they all know their letters , and some can spell a little . " Trafford evinced no surprise , much to Noll 's wonder , and merely asked , " Where do you find the time ? " " After recitations , " replied the nephew ; and that was all that was said about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little wharf , and Noll lingered in the doorway of his schoolroom , thinking that he had never seen Uncle Richard act more strangely . Was he offended at what he had done and was doing for the Culm people ? he wondered . He looked out and saw that his uncle had turned his face away , and was looking off upon the sea with the same dreamy , thoughtful look which he had noticed in his eyes of late . Noll would have given a great deal could he have known his thoughts at that moment . To human eyes this grave and thoughtful man , who sat on the wharf , was not a whit less the stern and gloomy creature that he had been an hour before . Yet , all hidden from others ' gaze , and almost from his own consciousness , a sudden sense of regret and of a great short-coming in himself had welled up through the crust of his hardened heart . His heart had been deeply stirred , and now it smote him . His thoughts took some such shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent calmness upon the changing , shadowy lights of the sea :  --  " This boy has done more in this short summer for his fellow-men and for his God than I have done in my whole forty years of life ! Oh , what a life mine has been !  - -  all a wreck , a failure , a miserable waste ! And he ? Why , in this short summer-time , and on this barren Rock , he has made his very life a blessing to every one upon it . I suppose those dirty , ignorant fishermen bless the day that brought him here . And I ? O Heaven ! what a failure , what a failure ! I 've done the world no good , it 's no better for my having lived in it , it would miss me no more than one of these useless pebbles which I cast into the sea . And this boy -- my boy -- always at work to make others rejoice that he was born into the world ! " For all the calmness and repose that was on his face , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliverance ? Might not these long wasted years yet be paid for by deeds of mercy and charity ? But where was there a deliverer ? and who could tell how many years of good deeds and charity could pay for forty years of wasted ones ? CHAPTER XX . NEW THOUGHTS AND NEW PLANS . Noll , sitting in the doorway , was presently aroused from a little reverie into which he had fallen by hearing a voice call , " Noll , my boy , come here . " He obeyed the call , and started for the little wharf , half expecting that Uncle Richard was about to reprove him for what he had done . Trafford gazed in his nephew 's face for a short space , and then , smothering what his heart longed to cry out , and what he had intended to say to the boy , he sighed only , " We will start homeward , if you are ready . " Noll was sure that his uncle had kept back something which it was in his heart to say , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall figure along the homeward path . The sun was getting well down into the west . The fair clearness of the sky was broken by a soft , mellow haze which began to steal across it , yet the afternoon was no less beautiful , and along the horizon there were long and lovely trails of misty color ,  - -  faint , delicate flushes of amber and purple ,  - -  which gave an added charm to the day 's declining . Not a word did uncle and nephew speak till , as they rounded the curve of the shore , and the stone house came in sight , Trafford asked , abruptly , " Noll , where did your pocket-money go ? " The boy explained the whole matter , with an account of Ned Thorn 's bounty and help , at the last , and then they paced along the sand in silence , as before . Noll managed to get many looks at his uncle 's face , and seeing that it wore no stern nor forbidding aspect , ventured to ask ,  --  " Are you offended with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nephew 's hand as he replied , " Not in the least , Noll . " His voice was strangely kind and tender , and Noll exclaimed , looking up joyfully and brightly , " I 'm very glad , Uncle Richard ! and do you know your voice sounded like papa 's just now ? " They walked hand in hand along the shore ,  - -  Noll , at least , very happy ,  - -  and looking afar at the sea through glad and hopeful eyes . He mentally prayed that Uncle Richard 's gloom and sternness might never return , and that he might always be in his present softened and subdued mood . They came to the stone house at last , and , as they reached the steps , Noll took one long look at his uncle 's face , thinking to himself that not soon again should he see it so gentle and tender , for the gloom of the library would soon shadow it , and make it once more stern and forbidding . But , just as if he felt something of this himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in , and at last sat down . Noll inwardly rejoiced , and seated himself on the bit of green which he had caused to grow , by much watering and nourishing , close beside the piazza . That little breadth of grass , with its deep verdure , was a wonderfully pleasant thing for the eyes to rest upon in this waste of rock and sand . Trafford looked down at it and at the boy sitting there , his curly locks blown all about his face by the warm wind ,  - -  and thought to himself , that , wherever the lad went , brightness and pleasantness sprang up about him , even though the soil was naught but sand and barrenness . His heart was full of reproachful cries . " What this boy has done ,  - -  and I ! " was a thought continually haunting him . And he did not try to put it away ; but , as he sat there , went back over all the months of the lad 's stay , remembering what he had done to brighten the old stone house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and motives with his own ,  - -  sparing himself not at all in the condemnation which his own heart was ready to pronounce . " What this boy has done ,  - -  and I ! I ? Nothing , nothing ! The earth will never miss me , for I have had no part in its life , and have cared naught for its joys or its sorrows ; and beyond -- where this boy 's heaven lies -- there will be no place for me , because I have not sought it , and have cared only for my own peace . So I have no part nor place in the world or out of it . " A more vivid sense of this truth came to Trafford here , and he sighed long and heavily , thinking of what might have been . He saw and felt what a great matter it was to have a heart wherein God 's love dwelt so steadfastly that eye nor ear could ever be closed against the wants of his creatures , and the work of his that lay waiting for the doing . And it was another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no warmth of his love ever thrilled it with pity or compassion ,  - -  ever drew it with tender , gentle guidance toward himself ,  - -  ever stirred it with longings for his love and his blessing and upholding . It was no wonder , he thought , that for one heart the earth was joyous and beautiful , while for the other it was but a gloomy , unhappy waste ; for over the pure , warm heart 's earth God reigned , and his sunshine lighted it , and his flowers blossomed by the wayside , and they who lived in the land were his own , and their needs the needs of his children . All doing was but doing for God , while in a cold , frozen heart his work is not remembered , and the sunshine is but gloom , because it does not come from him , and the flowers are not his , and the poor soul mourns and sorrows , wrapped up in its own darkness and chilliness , and fails to find the earth bright or beautiful . With such thoughts as these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sun set , and shadows began to steal over the sea , gradually and softly wrapping its farther distances in hazy indistinctness . Hagar 's voice , from the kitchen-door , where she was calling her chickens to their supper , floated around to his ears and awoke him from his long and sorrowful reverie . He started up , surprised to see how fast the light had flitted from sky and earth . Noll still sat on the bit of grass , busy over a heap of shells and pebbles , which he had gathered during his afternoon walk . Trafford looked at him a few minutes in silence , and finally asked ,  --  " What plans have you made for winter about your school , my boy ? " A sudden look of surprise flitted over the boy 's face ere he answered , " I have n't made any , Uncle Richard . I ca n't , you see , because the days will be so short that I 'm afraid there 'll not be time after my recitations . And there 's no stove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything comfortable . But I 'm going to try , though , " he added , hopefully . Trafford was silent and thoughtful for a long time . At last he said , " What would you say if I forbade you to continue your school through the winter ? " " I do n't think you 'll say that , Uncle Richard , " said Noll , not very confidently , however . " I should be very sorry to give it up now . " " Even if I thought it best ? " Noll could not deny but that he should . " They 're just beginning to learn , " he said , " and it would be too bad for them to lose all they have gained . Do n't you really think so , too , Uncle Richard ? " Illustration : Culm Rock . Trafford made no reply to this question , but , when he spoke again , said , " Not even if another teacher filled your place , Noll ? " The boy 's tongue was silent with wonder and astonishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " Why -- why -- what did you say , Uncle Richard ? " " I asked you , " said Trafford , " whether you would be willing to give up the school if another teacher took your place ? " The warm , eager color rushed into Noll 's face , and he cried , " Do you mean that -- that -- a teacher might take my place , Uncle Richard ? Do you really mean it ? Were you in earnest , and shall I answer ? " " To be sure , " said his uncle , gravely enough . " Oh , Uncle Richard ! " cried Noll , " I knew the time would come some day ! I knew it ! I knew it ! And will you hire a teacher for those Culm children ? Was that what you meant ? " " I do not know that they need two , " said Trafford . " Yes , I 'll give up the school this minute ! " said Noll , remembering that he had not answered his uncle 's question ; " I 'm willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , but it seems too good to be true ! And are you really going to hire some one to take my place ? " " I have hardly thought yet ; you must not press questions upon me too fast . I do not know my own mind . " Hagar heard their voices , and came around the piazza corner to say , " Tea hab been waitin ' fur ye dis yer whole hour , Mas'r Dick , an ' ' tai n't growin ' better , nohow . Will ye hab it wait any longer ? " " No , we 're coming , shortly , " said Trafford , and presently they went in to tea , for which Noll had not the least appetite , in spite of his long walk , it being quite driven away by the question which his uncle had put to him ,  - -  and he spent most of the meal-time in taking keen and watchful looks at Uncle Richard 's face , to see when it began to cloud over with gloom and grow stern and moody again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make its appearance , and from the supper-table they went to the library , where Hagar had lit the lamp , Noll feeling wonderfully happy and quite sure that this was the eve of a brighter day for Uncle Richard and the Culm people . Contrary to his usual habit , Trafford did not take up his books on reaching the library , but sat looking thoughtfully at Noll , and at last , as if speaking his thoughts aloud , he said ,  --  " If a new teacher comes , a new schoolroom will have to follow , as a matter of consequence ; and those two rough benches which I saw over at Culm are hardly the best style of school furniture . And how is it about books ? " " There are none but primers and leaves from old spelling-books , " said Noll , sitting very still and quiet with delight at hearing Uncle Richard ask such questions . It all seemed like a dream , and not at all a matter of reality . What could have come across the man 's feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiries after a short silence , and little by little drew from his nephew the whole story of the school 's commencement , and what drawbacks the lack of a good room , with seats and desks and the necessary books , were , till he had made himself acquainted with all the needs of the school . He talked with Noll about the Culm people , and listened to the boy 's hopeful and enthusiastic account of their slight improvement , with something that was very like interest . But the school seemed to interest him most . He proposed that a teacher be sent for to take charge of the school during the winter , and that the best room which could be found among the houses be fitted up as a schoolroom , and as nicely and warmly as possible . The teacher and the furniture would have to come from Hastings , and most likely a carpenter would be needed . Noll thought of John Sampson at once . So the evening passed away in planning and discussion , and when Noll went to bed , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening were but phases of a happy dream , which morning light would banish as unreal . His thankfulness for this token of dawn , after the long , black , weary night of gloom through which he had struggled , could not find words enough in which to praise God for this promise of brighter days . He prayed that it might not be fleeting , and that morning might not show this gleam of brightness to be only imaginary . But the morrow came , and proved yesterday 's events to be real and true , and Uncle Richard still without his stern and gloomy face , and ready to perfect the plans which they had discussed the previous evening . One day after another passed , till Noll began to be certain that Uncle Richard 's gloom and moroseness had departed from him forever . The boy wondered and surmised , but could not account for this sudden disappearance of the shadow . What had wrought the change so suddenly ? Would it last alway ? True , Uncle Richard was not cheerful yet , and he seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; but from his face the grimness and gloominess were gone , and Noll was sure that there must be some little change in his heart , else he would not care for the welfare of these Culm children . A week or two elapsed before this new plan was put in operation , or rather before anything was done toward carrying it out . The skipper was hardly the person to intrust with the care of finding a teacher and looking up school-books , and for a time they were in doubt and perplexity . Then Noll proposed -- what he had long been wishing -- to go to Hastings himself , and find such a teacher as was needed , procure the suitable books and furniture , and bring John Sampson back with him . It would require but a week 's absence , and in that time all the business could be done , and some happy days be spent with Ned Thorn and old friends . Trafford hesitated a long time . Who could tell what peril the boy might be in while crossing the sea ? How could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charmed circle of old friends and associations , would he not dislike to return to gray and barren Culm Rock ? But Noll went . CHAPTER XXI . IN PERIL OF THE SEA . The day had dawned clear and brilliant , but as the afternoon waned , a gray curtain of ragged cloud slowly rose and hid the sun , and brought an early nightfall . The wind was strong , and the sea -- calm and silvery but a few hours before -- began to toss and thunder heavily . Hagar came from the pine woods with a great basket of cones , just as the early dusk began to settle over the windy sea and to wrap the forest in heavy shadow , and as the old woman crossed the narrow bar of sand which connected Culm Rock with the main-land , the wind swept over in such strong gusts , and with such blinding sheets of spray , that her safety was more than once endangered . But she reached the firm , unyielding Rock , with no worse misfortune than a drenching befalling her , and made her way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ejaculations of delight and thankfulness . The first sound which greeted her ears on entering was the long-drawn , solemn voice of the organ . " Wonder what Mas'r Dick 's got on his heart dis yer night ? " she muttered , bustling about to prepare supper ; " ' tai n't sech music as dat yer organ make lately . ' Pears like somethin ' was de matter , anyhow . " She prepared supper in the dining-room , muttering to herself about the lonesomeness and silence of the house since " Mas'r Noll dun gone off ; " and when the solitary meal was in readiness , put her head in at the library-door and called her master to tea . When she had got back to her kitchen , and was standing in the open door , her grizzled head thrust out into the gathering gloom and tempest to watch the progress of the storm , she noticed that the music did not cease , but kept on in its slow and solemn measure , rising and falling and stealing plaintively in . " Something 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about and shutting the door ; " dat ai n't de kind of music dat Mas'r Dick 's made lately . ' Pears like he 's ' stressed ' bout somethin ' ! But , Hagar , ye ca n't do nuffin but jes ' trust de Lord , nohow . Ye 'd better get yer own supper , ef yer Mas'r Dick do n't tech his . " She ate her supper and washed the dishes , and gave the little kitchen a stroke or two with her broom , and yet the music from the library came stealing in as sad-voiced and heavy as ever . " ' Pears as if he 'd never eat his supper , " Hagar grumbled ; " de chile ca n't live on music , allers , nohow . Reckon he 'll nebber hab much sperits till he eats more . But jes ' stop yer talkin ' , chile , ye ca n't do nuffin ' but trust de Lord . " By and by the wandering notes ceased , and in the deep silence there came up the hoarse and awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind over the chimney , and filled the house with their echoes . Hagar heaped wood on the fire , drew her little low chair nearer the light and gladsome blaze , shivering and muttering as she did so . She had a great dread of cold and darkness , and the deep hush , broken by the clamor of the sea , made her afraid . " De Lord 's about , " said she , drawing her old woollen shawl close around her ; " de Lord 's on de sea , an ' ' pears like nobody need be feared when he holds it in his hand like as I holds dis yer silber ob Mas'r Noll 's dat he lost under de rug in de dinin ' - room , " looking down at the shining coin which she had picked up that morning , and wondering where the boy was at that moment . " ' Pears as ef de sunshine had been hid de whole time sence he went off to de city , " she muttered , gazing in the coals . " Wonder ef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman wo n't be tickled ' nuff to see him when de day comes ? Ki ! Hagar , ye knows ye will . " The roar of the sea and the cry of the wind came in again , more lonesome , sadder than ever . The old negress shivered , peered about her into the dark corners of the kitchen , and crooned to herself ,  - -  a wild , monotonous air , set to words which came to her lips for the occasion :  --  " Oh , Hagar , do n't ye know De Lord 's on de sea ? He rides on de waves , And de wind is in his hand ,  --  De Lord keeps dem all ! What ye feared of , Hagar ? Kase , do n't ye know de Lord 's in it ? ' Pears like ye done forget dat de whole time -- Now ! " and she broke into her rhymeless chant again . It was only a way she had got of setting her thoughts to music , drawing the words out very slowly , and weaving to and fro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she kept on with her thoughts , peering over her shoulder at the flickering shadows which the fire cast on the wall behind her , shivering with awe at the clamor without , and chanting , waveringly ,  --  " Oh , Hagar , do n't ye know De Lord 's on de sea ? De wind blows , an ' de sky is dark , An ' de sea cries like a little chile , An ' de boats will be blowed away ; But de Lord is good , an ' mornin ' will come , An ' , oh , Hagar , sing hallelujah ! Fur de Lord is in it all ! " Here she stopped her chanting , and began to sing " Hallelujah ! " softly , ceasing her swaying , to look into the coals . The fire burned down to rosy embers , in which little blue-tongued flames darted up fitfully ,  - -  anon lighting up the room brilliantly , then dying away and leaving it almost in darkness ,  - -  while Hagar 's crooning died away to a whisper . A little gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fast flitting . The roar of the sea became thunder , the wind grew tempestuous . By and by the rain began to fall , sounding strangely soft and still , when compared with the din of wind and waves . " God bress us ! " said Hagar , " dis yer is an awful night . Keep de boats off de Rock , Lord , and pity de sailors in dis yer awful storm ! " The old woman knew how the sea must look now ,  - -  yeasty , horrible , its white wave-caps shining through the darkness and hurrying to topple over and thunder against the rocks . To her , as she sat crouched before the fire , it seemed to howl and scream and mourn hoarsely , like some great voice rending the night with lamentation . " Call on de Lord , Hagar , " she muttered frequently ; " ca n't nuffin else help ye now ! " Sometimes she fell to chanting her thoughts ,  - -  the sound of her own voice was pleasant to her in the loneliness ,  - -  and she piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enjoy their brisk crackle . " Might as well hab a candle , " she said , after a time . " Git yer knittin ' , chile , an ' ' pear as ef ye did n't distrus ' de Lord . What ef de wind is blowin ' ? what ef de sea is a-screamin ' ? Do n't ye know whose wind and whose sea ' t is ? " She got up to grope for a candle on the shelf over the fireplace . " Hagar ! " exclaimed a voice at the farther end of the kitchen ,  - -  a voice so full of compressed fear and anxiety that the old negress tumbled back in her chair with affright ,  --  " Hagar ! are you here ? " demanded the voice . " Bress ye ! yes , I 's here , Mas'r Dick ! " she answered , catching sight of his white face by the dining-room door . " I 's here , but ye spoke so suddent ! Jes ' wait , an ' I 'll hab a candle in a minnit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long blowing of coals and burning of splinters , began to burn dimly . Hagar set it on the table , and looked up at her master with a start of alarm , his face was so white and anxious . " Hagar , " said he , huskily , " Noll was to start from Hastings this morning ! " The old negress stood looking at him a full minute ,  - -  a fearful , lonesome minute in which the rain beat against the panes , and the awful voice of the sea filled the room ,  - -  then she sank down by the fire with a low cry . " Lord bress us all ! " she wailed , as she looked up , " fur he 'll nebber get here , Mas'r Dick ! " Trafford looked at her silently . Oh , that awful voice without !  - -  the thunder , the tremble of the earth , the screaming of the wind ! At last ,  --  " Is ye certain sure , Mas'r Dick ? D'ye know he started ? Did he say ? " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any doubt that he started , I would give all my possessions this very moment ! " " ' Tai n't de money nor de lands dat 'll do now ! " moaned Hagar , beginning to sway back and forth ; " it 's only de Lord ! De Lord 's on de sea to-night , an ' ' tai n't fur man to say ! Oh , Mas'r Dick ! t'ink o ' dat bressed boy in dese waves an ' dis wind ! " " Hush ! " said the master , imperatively , " I will not think of it ! It ca n't be ! Noll ? Oh , Hagar , I believe I 'm going mad ! " He turned away from the old negress and opened the door . The tempest swept in , overturning the candle and flaring up the fire , and bearing the rain , in one long gust , across the little kitchen , even into Hagar 's face . Trafford stood there , regardless of wind and rain , looking out upon the sea . The mighty tumult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's utter weakness and helplessness . The foamy expanse gleamed whitely through the night ,  - -  awful with the terror of death ,  - -  and its deafening roar smote upon his ears , and in the slightest lull , the rain-drops fell with a soft , dull patter . Noll in it all ?  - -  in this fearful , yawning sea ,  - -  in this wild tumult of wind and rain ,  - -  in the vast waste of waves which the thick darkness shrouded , and where death was riding ? " God help me ! " he cried in sudden frenzy ,  --  " God help me ! " He looked up at the thick , black depths of sky with a groan of agony when he remembered his utter powerlessness . But what right had he to look to Heaven for aid ?  - -  he who knew not God , nor sought him , nor desired his love ? The bitterness of this thought made him groan and beat his breast . Would He -- whom all his life long he had refused and rejected -- hear his cries ? Hagar 's voice came to him here through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be closed . He closed it behind him , and stepped out into the darkness . It was already past the hour for the " Gull " to arrive , he remembered , and then a sudden thought flashed through his brain that beacons ought to be kindled to guide the skipper , if he were not already beyond the need of earthly guides and beacons . And close upon this thought came a remembrance of the Culm fishermen ,  - -  stout , skilful sailors , all of them ,  - -  and a great hope filled his heart that in them he might find aid in his extremity . And without waiting for a second thought , he started through the inky darkness and the tempest for Culm village . He ran till he was breathless . He climbed and groped his way over and along the slippery rocks , the awful voice of the sea filling his ears and goading him on . CHAPTER XXII . WEARY WATCHING . The evening wore on . They were all on the beach ,  - -  Trafford and the Culm fishermen ,  - -  and now a beacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night seem even more black and intense . They had piled their heap of driftwood somewhat in the shelter of a great rock , and around it the men were huddled , muttering and whispering to each other , and casting sober glances at Trafford , who stood apart from them in the shadow . Not a word had he spoken since the fire was kindled , but , grim and silent as a statue , had stood there , with his eyes looking upon the gleaming sea , and the rain beating in his face . He had worked desperately while gathering driftwood . " The master be crazed , like , " Dirk had whispered to the men as they came in with armfuls of fuel . " D'ye see his eyes ? D'ye see the way he be runnin ' up an ' down , poor man ? " " Ay , an ' his lad be where many o ' your'n an ' mine ha ' been , eh , Dirk ? " said Hark Harby . " Mabby he ken tell what ' t is ter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur it , eh ? " " Sh ! " said Dirk ; " the sea be n't able ter get sech a lad as his every day . If he be lost , ' t is a losin ' fur more'n he , yender . " This was before the beacon was kindled . Now they huddled in a gloomy circle about the hissing , sputtering fire , some crouching close to the rock to save themselves from the rain , and the others drawing their heads down into their wide-collared jackets , that bade defiance to the wet . The wind whirled and raved , and the sea thundered on . The fire cast a little pathway of light through the darkness , down to the sea 's edge , and they could see its waves all beaten to foam as white as milk , flecking the sand in great patches . It was an awful waiting . By and by Hagar came down along the sand in a great hood-cloak that gave her a most weird and witchlike appearance . The fishermen looked at her with startled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkness into the full glare of the firelight . The old negress passed on to where Trafford was standing . " I 's here , Mas'r Dick , " she said , touching his arm , as if fain to assure him of her presence and sympathy . He did not repel her , but said , with much of kindness in his tone , " This is no place for you , Hagar . " " De Lord 's here , " said Hagar , quietly , " an ' I 's gwine ter stay . I is n't feared , Mas'r Dick . " Trafford looked in her wrinkled , time-worn old face yearningly . This black , ignorant old woman had something within her heart that gave her a peace and serenity in this fearful hour that he envied . He felt the truth of this as he had never felt it before . She was stayed and upheld by some invisible hand . Somehow , in her humble life , this old negress had found some great truth which all his own study and research had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a seat of boards on an old spar which lay on the sand , under the shelter of the rock by the fire . " T'ank ye , Mas'r Dick , " said Hagar , tremulously , as she sat down . This unusual kindness touched her . It was like his old-time thoughtfulness and gentleness , when he was her own blithe , merry schoolboy , she thought . The rain began to fall less heavily . Only now and then a great drop fell with a hiss and sputter into the fire ; but the wind grew fiercer as the evening waned , and the thunder and pounding of the sea was deafening . The spray dashed higher and higher , quite up to the backs of the men who huddled about the fire , and its fine mist sifted even into Hagar 's face and grizzled locks . " ' Tai n't nuffin tu what dat bressed boy is suff'rin ' , " she sighed , wiping the cold drops off her cheeks ; " ' pears as ef dis ole heart ' ud split'n two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de chile !  - -  bress him ,  - -  bress him !  - -  dat 's all Hagar ken say . " It was a weary watching . As the war of the sea grew louder and the wind fiercer , the Culm fishermen gathered into a yet closer group , and looked with awed and sober faces in the fire . For all that these men followed the sea , and it was almost a native element to them , they seemed to have a great dread and awe of it . Trafford yet stood apart from them with his eyes looking into the dense night , and Hagar , all muffled in her great cloak , swayed slowly to and fro with her face hidden . Oh , the suspense and agony of those minutes !  - -  the weary watching and waiting for -- what ? It came at last . In the short space of silence between the bursting of two great waves , there rose a cry from out the great waste of darkness beyond their little length and breadth of light . Trafford started and sprang forward . The men around the fire were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout , and looked in one another 's faces and -- waited . But the cry was not repeated . Then Dirk said ,  --  " It wur the skipper , sure . O Lord , men ! but I be feared the ' Gull ' be on the rocks , yender . " The sweat stood in drops on his forehead , and he slowly clinched and unclinched his great brawny hands . Trafford heard his words , and a sudden faintness like death smote him . But it passed away , and in sudden frenzy and despair he rushed up to Dirk , exclaiming ,  --  " How do you know , man ? How can you tell ? There was only a cry ! " Before Dirk could answer , there rose , clear and distinct , that one solitary voice from out the darkness ,  - -  a fearful , appealing cry for aid from some human heart out there in the awful presence of death . And that thrilling cry was all . It never came again . Trafford beat his breast with agony . Then he turned upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cried , furiously , " when they are perishing out there ? My boy is there !  - -  my boy that 's done so much for you and yours ! Will you let him drown without lifting a hand to save him ? " " It be no use to try , " said the men , pointing to the surf ; " boat 's ud crack like a gull 's shell out there . " " But try ,  - -  only try ! " shouted Trafford , in an agonized tone . " If money will tempt you , you shall have all of mine ! You shall have more than ever your eyes saw before ! I will make you all rich !  - -  only try ,  - -  only try ! " " We 'd try soon enough for the young master 's sake , an ' ye might keep yer gold , " said Dirk ; " but it wud be no use , an ' only losin ' of life . The lad be beyont our help or yer gold , either . " " ' Tai n't de money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moaned Hagar ; " it 's only de Lord ! " " But think of it , you ungrateful wretches ! " cried Trafford , frantically ,  --  " the lad has done more for you and yours than you can ever repay ! He went across the sea this time to do you good , and it 's for your sakes that he 's out in the peril yonder ! Will you let him drown without even an attempt to save him ? Will you ? " Dirk shook his head . " It be no use , " he said , " but we ken try . I be not one to hev it said that I be unthankful . Here , lads , give us a hand ! Ef I 'll be riskin ' my life fur any one , ' t is fur the lad yender . " They dragged a boat down to the curling line of foam , and watching for a favorable opportunity , launched it . Trafford sprang in with them , and they pushed into the darkness . It seemed hardly three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great wave came riding in and threw the boat and its load upon the sand . Dirk sprang up and seized Trafford before the returning flood had engulfed him . He pointed to the rent ribs of the boat , saying , as he shook himself ,  --  " It be as I told ye . Yer lad be beyont yer gold or yer help . " They made no more attempts . Trafford gave up the idea of a rescue , and paced up and down the sand in the very face of the surf that drenched him at every tumble . Utterly helpless ! The cold , cruel sea mocked his despair and frenzy . It was great and mighty , and even now was swallowing his treasure , he thought , which lay almost within his power to save . So near !  - -  and yet death between ! The thought made him half wild with despair and horror . Yet there was no help ,  - -  nowhere to turn for aid or succor , not the faintest hope of saving the boy 's life . The sea must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , desperate figure that rushed up and down the sand as if it sought to burst through the sea and save its treasure , and whispered gloomily among themselves . Suddenly the man wheeled about and came up to the fire , crying , fiercely ,  --  " Hagar , you have a God ! I can not find him . Pray to him ,  - -  pray to him ! Quick , woman !  - -  pray to him before it 's too late ! " " Lord help ye , Mas'r Dick ! " said Hagar , " I 's jes ' prayin ' fur de dear chile ebery minnit ! Do n't ye know it ? But de Lord 's out thar ! "  - -  pointing with her skinny finger to the depths of darkness which shrouded the sea , with such vehemence as to startle the fishermen ; " he 's wid dat boy , and thar ca n't nuffin kill his soul . It 's only goin ' to glory quicker'n de rest ob us . Do n't ye know it , Mas'r Dick ? ca n't ye feel it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as de Lord 's got ye in his arms , holdin ' ye up ? as he 's got dat boy ob your'n . Oh , Mas'r Dick ! jes ' humble yerself ' fore de Lord , right off . What 's de use ob stribin ' to fight him ?  - -  what 's de use ? ' Tai n't no use ! ye knows it dis minnit ! ye knows it all ober ! Call on de Lord yerself , Mas'r Dick !  - -  call on de Lord ' fore it 's too late ! " " I can not , I can not ! " groaned Trafford , dropping down on the sand by his old nurse ; " I do n't know him , and he will not hear me . Oh , my boy , my boy ! " He gave up then . Hagar knew by the way he sank back upon the sand , all the wildness and fierceness gone out of his face , and the crushed , broken-hearted manner in which his head drooped , that he had given up the boy . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often done when he was a youth , and stroked it tenderly , saying , as her tears dropped ,  --  " Poor chile , poor honey ! Hagar 's sorry fur ye . It 's a dreadful t'ing not ter know de Lord ; ai n't it , chile ? Ca n't do nuffin widout him , somehow . But Hagar hopes ye 'll find him ; she hopes ye 'll find him dis berry night . ' Pears like he ai n't fur off dis awful night ; an ' , O Lord Jesus ! "  - -  folding her hands reverently , and looking toward the sea as if she saw her Redeemer walking there ,  --  " come an ' bress dis poor broken heart dat ca n't find ye . It 's jes ' waitin ' fur de bressin ' , an ' ' pears like ' t would faint ter def ef ye did n't come . Come , Lord , come . " The night wore slowly on . The " Gull " began to break in pieces and float ashore . The fishermen had enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea hurled up . As yet , none of the " Gull 's " more precious freight of life had made its way through the sea to the shore . Dirk was watching keenly for it . A half-dozen draggled , fearful women had stolen down from their houses , and were standing by the fire , whispering and talking in undertones , with many glances of pity at the figure lying prone on the sand with its head in the old black woman 's lap . " Alack ! " said Dirk , with a great sigh , " it wur a fine lad . I never knowed kinder nor better . Ye ken all say that , women , an ' this be the sorriest night I ever knowed , ' cept when my little gal died . He wur good to my little gal , the lad wur , an ' he giv ' me a bit o ' flower to put on the sand where she be sleepin ' , an ' it growed an ' growed an ' blossomed , an ' the blossom wur like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , an ' many 's the night after fishin ' I 've gone up ter the buryin ' - place ter look at it . An ' now the lad himself be gone , " said Dirk , wiping his eyes and snuffling . " Ay , it be a heavy night ! " moaned the women , wiping their eyes with the corners of their aprons . A great heap of bales and boxes and bits of the " Gull 's " timbers was accumulating on the sand by the fire . The women sat down on them , keeping up their low talk and whispers , and watching the two silent figures the other side of the fire . The man moved not a muscle . The old negress bent over him , stroking his forehead and whispering and crooning . Only once he had said , chokingly , " My Noll !  - -  all that was left to me , " and now lay passive and unheeding , overwhelmed and crushed by the sense of his loss and the consciousness that the sea had quenched the brave , bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long , weary night gave way to a gray and gloomy dawn . The tempest had not abated , and the sea thundered as furiously as ever . The wet and shivering women had gone back to their houses and their little ones ; and as the cold , steely light of the coming day began to whiten in the east , Hagar made her way back to her kitchen , where she kindled a fire to warm her numb limbs . Never more , she thought ,  - -  rocking to and fro before the pleasant blaze ,  - -  could the old house be bright or cheerful . The sea had quenched its life and its joy , and never again would the merry voice echo in the great rooms , or the quick , eager steps sound along the hall and in at her kitchen-door . " O good , bressed Lord ! " moaned she , " bress yer poor chil'en dat 's lef ' behind ! ' Pears like dey was jes ' ready ter fall down an ' faint ter def ef ye did n't hold ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' vent her from ' strustin ' ye ! Bress us , Lord , fur we ai n't nuffin dis yer time . Ye 's all we hab ter hold on ter . " Meanwhile , Trafford and the fishermen lingered on the shore , waiting for the sea to give up its dead . The east grew whiter , and light broke dimly over the waste of waves , and faintly showed them where the " Gull " had struck . There was not much left of the little craft ,  - -  only a few timbers and the taper point of a mast , wedged in between some outlying rocks , which the sea thundered over . It was a dreary sight ,  - -  the vast , immeasurable waste lashed into foam , and dimly discerned through the gray gleaming of the dawn , with the bit of wreck swaying in the wares , where those lives had gone out in the awful thunder and darkness ; but Trafford gazed upon it with a calm face . Groans and lamentation could not express the agony which rent his heart , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm , white face that awed Dirk whenever he looked upon it . " It be a heavier stroke for the master an ' we ken tell , lads , " he said to his comrades , as they kept keen lookout for the poor bodies which the sea still kept . " Ay , there be a heart within him like the rest of us , " said one of the fishermen , looking at Trafford as he kept his watchful vigil ; " an ' he be only losin ' what we hev lost afore . " " But the lad wur not like ours , " said Dirk , pityingly , " an ' it wur a finer lad an ' ever I see afore . " So they talked as they watched and waited , and the light grew , and somewhere behind the lowering banks of clouds in the east the sun had risen , and all the land and sea lay cold and warmthless and forlorn . Trafford relinquished not his keen search for a moment , fearful lest the waves should cast his lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could grasp it . The dear face might be bruised and battered by the cruel , remorseless sea , and the eyes could never beam upon him with any light of love or recognition , he thought ; yet find it and look upon it he must , even though the sight agonized him . So he watched and waited , with his tearless eyes roaming along the line of foam . An hour fled . The sea relented , and gave up one poor form into the fishermen 's hands . Trafford walked calmly out to where the men were bending over it with pale , awed faces , and saw that it was not Noll . He shivered , looking at the skipper 's stalwart figure , and wondered whether , if the sailor but had the power of speech , he might not tell him something of his boy ,  - -  whether he met death 's dark face calmly and fearlessly , and whether he sent a message to those whom he saw on the shore and could not call to . This thought gave him fresh anguish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message ,  - -  oh , what would he not give to hear it ? But , if that were really the case , it had died with those to whom it was intrusted . The sea would never whisper it ,  - -  the dead could not . He went back to his lonely pacing . Another long , long hour passed . The bit of wreck that was jammed between the rocks went to pieces and came ashore . Ben 's mate came with it , but no Noll . The men began to straggle homeward , weary and worn with the night 's vigil , till only Dirk and Hark Darby were left to keep the stricken master of the stone house company . Oh , such a weary waiting it was !  - -  the ceaseless pouring of the waves upon the sand filling their ears with clamor , and the fearful tide bringing them not the treasure which they sought . Would the sea never give it up ? Was the dear form caught and held by the entangling arms of some purple weed in the sea depths ? or was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rocks ? " Oh , cruel , cruel sea ! " he cried to himself , " to rob me of my boy , and refuse to give back the poor boon of his body . " It never came . The morning wore on to noon , the noon to night , and still the lonely watcher paced up and down . Toward night the tempest abated , and the turmoil of the sea subsided somewhat . The gray clouds broke and let through a slant mist of yellow sunshine as the sun departed , and the storm was over . Its work was done ; and as the clouds fled in ragged squadrons , the calm , untroubled stars shone out over the sea , and mocked , with their deep , unutterable peace , the aching , wretched heart of him who still kept up his lonely pacing . Trafford 's eyes suddenly caught sight of their silvery glitter , and he stopped , looking up at them , while the sudden thought flashed through his mind , " Is my boy up there ? beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusted in ? " The thought held him silent and motionless . It had not entered his heart before . He had been searching for the lad upon this dreary , sea-beaten shore , without a thought of anything beyond . Was he really standing upon a heavenly shore , where no waves beat nor tempest raved , and , perhaps , looking down upon his own lonely vigil ? There was something in this thought which brought a great calm upon his heart . True , the boy was no less dead nor separated from him ; the merry voice was no less hushed to him for all his life and journeying , and the echo of his footsteps might never float down from heavenly paths to gladden his ears ; yet , though he realized this , there was a wonderful peace and joy in thinking of the lad as happy and joyous in a sphere where nothing would ever blight his happiness ; where he had found those who bore him a great love and had been long waiting for his coming . Trafford sat down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward at the stars . Pure and unwavering their gentle eyes looked down at him . And then peaceful as an angel 's whisper , came the remembered words of one who was an angel too : " Oh , Richard ! do n't fail -- do n't fail to find Him and cling to Him , and come up ,  - -  come up too . " Why , oh , why , of all times , did this gentle breathing come to him here ? It seemed to Trafford as if his wife 's lips had whispered it close to his ear , and he bowed his head upon his breast , while his breath came quick and fast , and bitter tears of grief stood in his eyes . Had God taken his treasures , one after another , and placed them in that heaven which they all looked forward to , that his own wayward , straying heart might be drawn thither ? Was this last loss meant to be the great affliction which , through love , should turn his heart toward God and his kingdom ? He could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It seemed to him as if that angel whisper had driven the great burden of despair and agony out of his heart by its gentle breathing , and left it broken and sorrowful , yet not without peace and hope . He looked up at the stars and thought of Noll , and wept . They were not tears of agony , and he did not rave and groan . A slow step came along the sand , turning hither and thither , as if in quest of some one . It drew near Trafford , at last , and a tremulous old voice said ,  --  " Is dis ye , Mas'r Dick ? Hagar 's glad ' nough ter find ye , anyhow . ' Pears like she could n't stay up ter de house , nohow ,  - -  'twas so lonesome . " " Yes , I know , Hagar , " said the man , without raising his head . The twilight was so thick that the old negress could not see the speaker 's face , but a certain tremble and softness of his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' de Lord , Mas'r Dick ? " she asked , quickly . " I know not what I have found , " Trafford answered , while his tears fell ; " but if I might find his face , and know that it smiled upon me , I should care for little else . " " Now praise de Lord ! " said Hagar , fervently ; " dat 's more'n ye ever felt afore . Thar 's help fur ye , Mas'r Dick , an ' ' tai n't fur off ! " " Too far for me to find it ! " said Trafford ; " he does not smile upon those who have rejected him . " " Oh , chile ! " said Hagar , in a shocked tone ; " do n't ye know de Lord 's all mercy an ' lubbin ' kin'ness ? Do n't ye know he wo n't ' spise an ' hate ye jes ' as ef he was like a man ? Oh , honey ! Hagar 's feared ter hear ye talk like dat . ' Pears as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eble , good-fur-nuffin man . " Trafford made no reply . A sudden darkness seemed shutting down upon him . It was as if a great golden gleam had fallen out of heaven upon him , warming and softening his heart , and when he turned with tears and joy to look along its pathway heavenward , it vanished and left him groping in confusion and dismay . He got up from off his seat , saying , mournfully ,  --  " The brightness is all gone from me ! I 'm in doubt and fear . Oh , how can I ever find his face ?  - -  and how can he ever smile upon me who have rejected him ? " Hagar sighed heavily as she said , " Ye do n't ' preciate de Lord , chile . Ye talks jes ' as ef he was a man , an ' could feel ' vengeful towards ye ! Do n't s'pose any man could forgive ye , honey , but de bressed Lord is all lub ,  - -  Hagar knows dat , an ' Jesus died jes ' as much fur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look to dat bressed Lord Jesus , an ' ef ye looks hard ' nough , ye 'll find him . Oh , Hagar t'anks de Lord frum de bottom ob her heart fur yer feelin ' so to-night . " " But I have not found him ! He is hidden from me ! " said Trafford . " But ye will ef ye looks long enough ! " said Hagar , cheerfully ; " he 'll come out ob de darkness to ye : bimeby . Bress ye , chile , dis ole woman was lookin ' an ' seekin ' an ' stribin ' in mis'ry till she was ' bout ready to give up in ' spair ; but I foun ' him at las ' , an ' he nebber ' sook Hagar ,  - -  nebber ! " The sea was growing calmer with every hour that passed . But it was rough and thunderous still , and its wave-crests gleamed whitely under the starlight . Trafford at last remembered the lateness of the hour , and said , " Come , Hagar , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The two slowly made their way along the shore up to the dark and deserted stone house . Hagar smothered the sigh that rose up from her heart as the silence and loneliness smote upon it , and led the way around to her kitchen-door . " Poor chile ! ye hab n't had nuffin to eat dis day , " said she , after they were once within her little dominion and she had kindled the fire ; " go into de libr'y , honey , an ' I 'll hab ye sumfin ' purty quick . " But Trafford shook his head , saying , " Not there ! not there , yet ! " and sat down on the bench by the fire . Hagar moved wearily about from the cupboard to the table , saying to herself ,  --  " What ye t'inkin ' ob , Hagar , to tell him dat ? Dar 's all poor Mas'r Noll 's books an ' t'ings lyin ' ' bout eberywhar , an ' how ken de poor chile stan ' it ? De Lord 's han ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Jesus , jes ' come an ' bress de poor chile an ' sabe him ! " CHAPTER XXIV . DAYS OF CALM . He found it at last ,  - -  the peace which comes after a long , weary , despairing struggle . But it was not easily won . It seemed to Trafford as if God had hidden himself in a thick , awful darkness , through which not the faintest ray of light or hope could glimmer upon his heavy , despairing heart . He sought for him as one who , feeling himself in the grasp of Death , would seek for Life . He had long rejected him and put him away ; now , in his hour of anguish and extremity , his face and his peace were hard to find . Never had such utter silence reigned in the stone house since its occupancy as reigned there now . Hagar kept mostly within her own province , and Trafford sat day after day in the dining-room , hardly stirring from thence . He had not entered the library since the night of the shipwreck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Noll 's books and shells and treasures gathered from the sea lay , and where everything hinted of the sunny , joyous life which once had made the great room cheerful . Neither looked within , as if they dreaded to recall the dear and pleasant vision of the curly-haired boy who had lived and studied there . These were the days in which Trafford groped in darkness and despondency . Hagar set the table by his side , and brought him his meals , and carried away the untasted viands , with much sighing and regret , but , nevertheless , with joy in her heart . " ' Pears as ef ' t was a drefful t'ing fur de poor chile ter be suff'rin ' so , " she would sigh to herself as she watched his worn and heavy face on her passages through the room ; " but Hagar 's t'ankful ' nough to see it , ' cause de poor chile 'll find de Lord bimeby . Bress de Lord ! Mas'r Dick 'll find him some time ! " A long and weary week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairer , nor the sea lovelier . No storms lashed it , and the great world of waves glittered calm and untroubled under the sun , with no hint of death or woe in its purple evening lights or its bright morning gleams . Then , after this long seeking , a faint hope began to dawn in Trafford 's heart . He did not dare to give it heed or trust at first ,  - -  he who had been in despair so long ,  - -  and when , at last , he began to put forth feeble , trembling anticipations of the peace and joy which might come when God 's smile and forgiveness shone upon him , this little ray of hope broadened and grew warmer and brighter , and he began to look up out of his depths of anguish . It was long coming , it seemed at times to be utterly unattainable , it was sometimes almost within his heart , and then it fled from him ; but at last it came , and abode with him ,  - -  this peace which a poor , wandering soul feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at rest . He came out into Hagar 's kitchen one sunshiny afternoon , and , in answer to the old negress ' look of wonder and surprise at seeing him there , said , with a grave joy thrilling his words ,  --  " Hagar , I have found him ; and I do not think that his peace will ever leave me , or that my heart will ever forget him . " Hagar got up off the bench where she was sitting , and came slowly forward , saying , brokenly , " Bress de Lord , bress de Lord ! dat 's all Hagar ken say . Oh , chile , ef ye knew how dis ole heart felt ter hear ye say dem words ! ef ye only c'u 'd know ! But ye nebber will till dis ole woman gits such a tongue as de Lord 'll gib her when she gets ter heaben . Den Hagar ken tell ye ! " She followed him to the door , and sat down there in the sunshine , softly blessing him again and again as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to the piazza . Trafford paused here , on the smooth sand by the piazza-steps , and looked out upon the sea . It was like a new sea , and the very earth seemed not as of old , for now God reigned over them , and it was his sunshine which fell so brightly and broadly everywhere , and his smile and the knowledge of his forgiveness which filled his heart with such utter peace and tranquillity . This great joy and calm held him quiet for a little space , and , when he turned about , his eyes fell upon the little breadth of grass waving there by the step . One or two gay , crimson asters nodded in the warm wind , planted there by the same hand that watered and cared for the bit of turf . Trafford sat down by them , stroking the turf 's green blades , and gazing at the warm-hued flowers through tears . " Gone -- gone , " they seemed to whisper as they softly rustled . Somehow these tender , soulless things brought up the boy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same bit of turf only those two short weeks ago with the warm wind blowing his curly locks about his eyes while he looked off upon the sea . Who thought of danger or death then ? Who thought of death lying in wait in that calm , shadowy sea ? Trafford 's tears fell thick and fast upon the green blades , thinking of the lad . Did ever the sea quench a fairer , brighter life ? he wondered ,  - -  a life fuller of rich and generous promise ? Yet , only two short weeks ago ,  - -  short , in reality , but slow and long in passing ,  - -  the boy had sat upon this little breadth of verdure full of life and spirits and happiness . " Ah ! " sighed he , " I knew not a treasure I possessed till it passed from me . Now that I have lost it , I see what a blissful life I might have made for myself and it . God forgive me ! but I was harsh and cruel to the boy . I made his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He sat here for a long time , till once more his face was calm and undisturbed . Sometime , he thought , he might meet the boy face to face , and tell him all that his heart longed to unburden itself of . He rose up , at last , and went slowly in , pausing at the library-door . After a few seconds of indecision , he opened it , and went softly in . The room was cold and chilly from its long unoccupancy ; but through one of the high windows , and along the floor , streamed a broad bar of cheerful sunlight . It fell right across Noll 's study-table and the chair which he was wont to occupy . Trafford moved forward , sat down in the chair , and looked about him with misty eyes . Traces of the boy 's presence everywhere ! The familiar school-books , open to the last lessons which Trafford had heard him recite ; bits of paper , with sums and solutions traced thereon ; copies of the fine and feathery sea-moss , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd pebbles and shells , met his gaze on either hand . He took up a scrap of paper from among the rest , and found something thereon which the boy had written , evidently in an idle moment . Trafford , however , read it not without emotion . It merely said :  --  " Wednes. , Aug. 24.  - -  This is a long , gray , rainy day , and I have not stirred out of the house . I am at this moment ( or ought to be ) studying my Latin lesson . Uncle Richard has not spoken a word to me since breakfast . I wish I knew what made him look so grim and sober to-day , and I do wish he would speak to me . When the fog lifted just now , I fancied I saw a ship on the horizon , bound for Hastings , I suppose . Oh , but I --  " Here the slight record was broken off . Perhaps the boy had gone back to his Latin , or perhaps the passing ship had taken his thoughts along with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trafford read and reread the little bit of paper , and folded it carefully , and put it away with the precious letter which the boy 's father had written on his dying-bed . Then he began to gather up Noll 's books , thinking to put them out of his sight , but stopped before he had taken the third in his hand . Why hide them ? Why shut them up in darkness , as if some evil , dreaded memory were connected with the sight of them ? Had not everything about the boy and his life been bright and pleasant to think of ? He put the books back in their places , saying to himself , " They shall stay where they are . Hagar shall not move them , and I will have them before my eyes alway , just as his dear hands left them ? Why should I try to hide aught that his blessed memory lingers around ? " So he left everything just as Noll 's hands had placed them last , and rose up from his chair , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he had sat and pored over great volumes day after day , and watched the boy at his studies . The portrait on the wall looked down at him with its soft and tender eyes , and he thought , " Now I may look at it without its reproaching me ; for , dear heart , I have begun to ' come up . ' I have turned my eyes toward thy abode , and , God helping me , I may some day hear thy own sweet voice . And though I may never see the boy 's face , and rejoice to look upon it as I do upon thine , yet his pure memory lingers about everything that he loved and touched , and his face can never be removed from my heart . " Calm and peaceful days passed , and the third week after the shipwreck went by , and life in the stone house began to move on as it was wont to do . Once more the red light from the library-window streamed out into the night , but there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to guide . Not a sail had been seen near the Rock , and its inhabitants had been shut out from the rest of mankind for three long weeks . That which at first was only an inconvenience grew to be a serious matter at last . The Culm folk , never very provident , exhausted their supply of flour and meal , and had only fish to eat ; and fish , with a little salt , was not an extensive nor varied bill of fare . In some way or another , Hagar discovered that the people had exhausted all their stores , and through her it came to Trafford 's ears . " Nuffin but fish ter live on , an ' not de greatest plenty o ' dat , " Hagar had said , standing beside Trafford 's chair in the library . The man started , as a sudden remembrance of forgotten duties came into his mind . He had neglected to look after those Culm people ,  - -  he had forgotten about Noll 's school and its pupils . But it should be so no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy loved and desired to complete , he would take up and carry out . It should be a pleasure and delight . He would gather up the broken , half-completed plans , and make it the work of his life to perfect them as Noll would have done . Now the inmates of the stone house were not well supplied with provisions , as the winter stores had not been laid in . There was no telling when another ship would touch at Culm , but , in all probability , it would be soon . The skipper must have friends somewhere , who would be searching for his whereabouts . Trafford divided his supplies with the fishermen , trusting that ere long some sail would appear , bound for the Rock , or within signalling distance of it . He walked often by the sea , looking toward Hastings , and trying in vain to discern some sail bound hitherward . He walked over to Culm village , and lingered about the little room where Noll 's school had been , and resolved that the plan of a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithful teacher , should be carried out if ever communication was opened between the Rock and Hastings . And if no teacher could be got for the winter , he would teach the children himself . He wondered whether there were any chairs or benches left from the cargo of the " Gull , " remembering that Noll was to bring school-furniture from Hastings with him ; but , though he searched long and keenly among the timbers and refuse which the sea had thrown up , he could not find so much as a bit of varnished wood that looked as if it might have belonged to a desk or chair . At this he wondered , but thought , " The poor boy was unsuccessful , or else the sea refuses to give up aught that was his , as well as himself . " And still he watched and waited for a sail , thinking that if none came soon , a way must be devised for getting to Hastings . CHAPTER XXV . OUT OF THE SEA . The fourth week after the shipwreck dragged slowly away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None came . The lack of good food was getting to be a serious matter for both Culm folk and the inmates of the stone house . Trafford 's stores were well-nigh exhausted , and the last day of that long fourth week was spent in company with Dirk Sharp and some of his comrades , devising plans by which they might communicate with Hastings . The master of the stone house walked homeward after his conference with the fishermen , and paused in the gathering dusk on the spot where he had stood that fearful night when the " Gull " and her crew were on the rocks in the awful roar and thunder of the tempest . How silent and peaceful it all lay now ,  - -  the sea purpling in its calm and shadowy depths , its waves faintly murmuring on the pebbles , and , overhead , the arch of silvery sky bending down to the far horizon , full of the tender lights of the after-glow ! Only one month since that fearful night , yet how far in the dim past the event seemed ! What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How full and real every minute of those four weeks had been ! And , as he stood there , such strong and tender memories of the lad he had lost came back to him that he turned away with a throbbing heart , and walked homeward along the sand with a bowed head , and so failed to see the white gleaming of a sail which rose out of the sea and stood toward the Rock . The lingering daylight touched it with a rosy flush as the rising night-breeze bore it steadily onward ; but Trafford saw it not , and went up the piazza-steps , and into the stone house , without turning his eyes seaward . He ate his scanty supper , which Hagar -- poor heart ! had placed upon the table with a wonderful display of dishes , as if to make up for the lack of food by a board spread with cups and plates enough for a feast , and then took his way to the silent library . He sat down at his organ , and from its long-silent pipes drew soft and tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . The tears came into Hagar 's eyes as she listened to it . " ' Pears as ef de angels was singin ' , " she said , wiping her cheeks . " Hagar wonders ef de Lord 'll gib her a voice like dat when she gets ter glory . " It died away at last in gentle , tremulous whispers , and Trafford walked to the window and looked out . Twilight had settled so thickly that the sea was quite hidden , save a faint glimmer of ripples along the sand . Deep quiet reigned over land and sea , and nowhere with such undisputed sway as in the stone house . Trafford lit his study-lamp and sat down , with no desire , however , to read or study . Hardly had he seated himself , when , with startling suddenness , a shrill scream broke upon the deep quiet . It was Hagar 's voice , and the cry came from her kitchen ; and before Trafford had recovered from his surprise , there was a little sound of commotion in her distant province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then along the silent hall came a sound -- the rush of eager feet -- that drove every trace of color from Trafford 's face , as well it might , and made his heart beat so loud and wildly that he pressed his hands over it to stay its tumultuous beating . He started up , gazing with wide-open eyes at the library-door , while at every echo of those coming footsteps , he started and trembled , and grew faint with anticipation . The door burst open , and there stood -- Noll Trafford ! Illustration : " It 's I , Uncle Richard " Page 421 . One moment the boy paused , perhaps frightened by the white face of the man who sat gazing motionlessly at him , then he bounded forward , crying , " It 's I , Uncle Richard ! your own Noll ! " Trafford 's arms did not clasp the boy about ; his tongue refused to articulate ; his heart could not take in this great , overwhelming joy . But Noll 's arms were about his neck , the boy 's warm breath was upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper , " It 's I ,  - -  I , Uncle Richard ! no one else ! " Then the man began to sigh , just as if he were awakening from a long and troubled dream , and presently he put out his hand and touched the boy 's cheeks , as if to assure himself that it was not all a vision , and then he said , chokingly , " My boy ,  - -  mine ! O God ! I do n't deserve this . " His arms clasped the lad in one long , fervent embrace . He bent his head over the curly locks , and wept for joy , stroking the lad 's shoulders and pressing his hands the while , as if he were not yet sure that the boy was a reality . He looked upon him as one from the dead . Had the sea given him up ?  - -  had that terrible tempest spared him in its wild fury ? Why had the boy lingered so long ? Where had he been sojourning all these long weeks ? But too happy in the consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was before him , to care for aught further at present , he sat silently holding the boy 's hands , while his heart gave grateful thanks to God . " Poor Uncle Richard ! " said the boy , at last . Trafford 's lips moved , and with an effort he said , " No , no , not poor ! I 'm rich , rich !  - -  so rich ! O God , help me ! I ca n't believe my own happiness . " " But it 's really I , Uncle Richard ! " said Noll , assuringly ; " you 've felt my hands , my face , my shoulders , and are n't they alive and warm ? " " Yes , it is really you , thank God ! " said Trafford , drawing a long breath , while he gazed upon the merry face that he never more expected to see on earth . " Yes , and oh , Uncle Richard , you ca n't know how I longed to see you , to tell you that I was alive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't think you 'd think me dead . I did n't think that till we got to Culm , and Dirk and all the rest trembled , and were actually going to run away from me ! " " Then you have not been harmed ? " said Trafford : " but oh , my boy , where were you on that awful night ? " " Safe and sound , with Ned Thorn , at Hastings , Uncle Richard , and not even dreaming of danger or shipwreck . You see , the furniture was not ready , and I had n't found a teacher , and so I stayed . Ned and I went down to the wharf the night before the ' Gull ' was to sail , and carried a letter to the skipper to give to you , telling you why I could n't come ; but poor Ben never got here alive , and the letter was lost with him , I suppose . Oh , Uncle Richard , if I had started , if the furniture had been ready --  " " Thank God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he watched over you , he stayed your coming , and now he has brought you out of the sea , as it were , to me . Oh , Noll ! " The boy looked up eagerly . " Have -- have you found the Lord Jesus , Uncle Richard ? " he asked . Trafford 's hands rested tenderly on the boy 's head . " Yes , " he said , with a great calm and peace in his voice , " I found him through great sorrow and grief . I think God led me through all this suffering that my heart might be softened and turned toward him . And now this Saviour has brought you back to me ! " A deep silence followed , full of unutterable joy . Trafford reverently bent his head , his lips quivering with emotion , and with his nephew 's hands clasped in his , silently thanked God for his goodness , for this great joy which was come into his life , for this precious lad that was dead and now was alive again . It seemed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . At last Noll said , taking up his explanation where he had left it off ,  --  " After we had given the letter to the skipper , I thought no more about it , and Ned and I were busy enough with seeing about the furniture for a day or two , and we did n't notice the storm , or even think of the ' Gull ' being in danger . And Mr. Gray helped me to find a teacher , and we were so busy with plans that the time passed away before I knew it , and when I came to go down on the wharf to engage a passage with Ben , the men said the ' Gull ' had never got back from her last trip , and they were afraid it was lost . Ned did n't believe there had been a shipwreck , neither did Mr. Gray . He said that most likely the skipper had been kept by some business , or perhaps the ' Gull ' had gone farther down the coast than usual . Oh , Uncle Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor that you thought me wrecked with him . " Trafford said , " Those were fearful days for me . Go on , go on , Noll . " " We went down to the wharf every night till another week was gone , and then , we began to be certain that Ben was either wrecked or sick , and I began to be anxious to get some word to you . I thought that perhaps you might be worried about me , though Mr. Gray said that if the ' Gull ' was wrecked anywhere near Culm , you could not help but know I was not on board . We waited and waited till the three weeks were gone , and then some of Ben 's friends began to talk of going in search of him . But it was only till last night that they were ready to go , and we came off before daylight this morning . Oh , the time has seemed so long , Uncle Richard ! but here I am , safe and sound , once more . " Trafford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe his eyes . " And you should have seen Dirk and the rest ! " continued Noll ; " why , he would n't speak to me at first , but was going to run away ; but when he did find that it was really I , he cried like a great child . He said that you thought me dead , you ca n't know how I felt when he said that , Uncle Richard ,  - -  and so Ned and I did n't wait any longer , but ran all the way here . I can think , now , why you looked so white when I came in at the door ! " Trafford stroked the boy 's hair , saying , " I never thought to hear the echoes of your feet again . God knows . Oh , my boy , you can never know what this night has brought to me . He who led you thither only can . But whose name did you mention ? " " Ned 's ; he came down with me , Uncle Richard , for it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because Hagar 's light shone so brightly , and what do you think ? she threw up her hands and screamed at the sight of me . But it did n't take long to make her certain that I was real , and not a vision . And , oh , there 's one thing I 'd forgotten ! The new teacher is at Culm , waiting for Dirk to come over with his trunks . It 's one of papa 's old scholars , Uncle Richard , and his name is Henry Fields . He worked with papa in the old sea-town where we lived , and he 's come down to work here at Culm among our fish-folk . I like him very much , and you ca n't help but like him , too ; and we 've brought a cargo of benches and desks all ready to --  " The library-door began to swing softly open , not so softly , however , but that Noll heard and stopped . " It 's Ned , " he said , looking over his shoulder . " Come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting , his usually merry face sobered by something which he perceived in the faces of his friends before him . A silence fell upon them here . Ned leaned against his friend , looking soberly at Trafford 's rapt face , and wondering where all the man 's grimness and gloominess had gone . And just then a sudden thought came into Noll 's heart , and he said , looking up brightly ,  --  " It 's a year this very night since I came to you , Uncle Richard ! Do n't you remember ? What a long , long time ! " Trafford said , " Yes , I remember . Through all the days since then God has been teaching me , and he has led me on to this ; and , oh ! my boy , the sea may never divide us again , for , though through its dark floods we go down to death , beyond there is light and God and heaven ! " And in his voice there was peace unutterable. * * * * * If this Story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already too long , you may know that a schoolhouse was built at Culm , and that Henry Fields proved a good and faithful teacher ; that a stanch , new " White Gull " was built , and one of Skipper Ben 's sea-loving sons was its captain ; that the Culm children and their parents slowly improved in more ways than one under the constant , unfailing care and effort of Trafford and his nephew ; that the Rock was not always Noll Trafford 's home , but exchanged for a pleasanter one in Hastings , though the old stone house was often brightened by his presence , and never got to be entirely gloomy and deserted again .
