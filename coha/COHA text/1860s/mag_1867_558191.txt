ART . V. -1 . Civil Service of the United States . Report presented by Mn . JENcKES , from the Joint Select Committee of the two Houses of Congress appointed July 19 , 1866 . Doe-. ument of the House of Representatives , 39th Congress , 2d . Session . Report No. 8. 8vo. pp. 114. 2. - Speech of HON. THOMAS A. JENOKES , of Rhode Island , on the Bill to regulate the Civil Service of the United States and to pro *n*te the Efficiency thereof , delivered in the House of Representatives , January 29 , 1867. 8vo. pp. 14 . THE condition of the civil service of the United States is deplorable . Even in the early days of the Republic , although great care was taken to select for office only men of respectable character and qualifications , the need of a system of competitive examination was felt . But no such system was established , and , as far as the holders of office were concerned , a change for the worse took place in proportion to their increasing numbers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strides of our progress . Nothing was done to adapt the civil service to the exigencies of the new times . Everything , on the contrary , combined to encumber its natural complications with abnormal difficulties growing out of partisan animosities . For nearly a generation preceding the abolition of slavery , sympathy with the Southern policy was in many instances the main test of qualification for public offices at home and abroad , so that , when the war broke out , the government had not only to contend with the armed forces of the Southern States , but also with their more subtle , and hence more formidable , forces in the Departments at Washington , and in the legations and consulates in foreign countries . The character of the District of Columbia exercised also an evil influence on the character of the civil service . Receiving its tone from the South , society at Washington possessed no intellectual activity , and afforded no stimulus to exertion . It held Qut no encouragement to cultivated minds , and its moral standard was as low as its intellectual . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The effect of such // a social atmosphere upon those employed in public offices was deplorable ; and although some of the characteristics of the society have now changed , many of its worst features remain unaltered . The very air of New England and New York and the West is big with tacit rebukes against sluggishness ; but there are no such admonishing voices in Washington . A lazy listlessness pervades the very aspect of the thinly populated streets . Hence , the Departments have become in many respects mental dormitories , and , in order to make up at least by the routine and force of discipline for what they lack in intellectual vitality , it has become necessary to establish semischool-house , semi-penitentiary regulations , relative to the discipline of the various offices . Being made to feel that practically he is not an officer of the government , but only a clerk of the chief of his bureau or of the head of his division or department , the employs loses self-respect and ambition , and the more readily , if , as is not unfrequently the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior is inferior to him in culture and gentlemanly manners . hf parts of the public offices thus degenerate into dormitories , other parts of them are nothing but asylums , where the aged and infirm luxuriate , as far as their scanty salary permits , in a kind of official hospital of invalids , constituting a formidable though venerable reserve force of incapacities . Though this is the general character of the departmental forces , it would be obviously unfair to deny that , among the thousands of employ*s , there is a sprinkling of men of genuine ability and of admirable zeal , and that there is a still larger number whose talents could be made better available if they were placed in a more responsible position . Under the present system , the subordinate officer is responsible only to his temporary superior , either to a chief clerk or to the director or head of the respective division or bureau ; and these superior officers are again irresponsible as far as the state is concerned ; they are responsible only to the chief of them all , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is practically irresponsible , so far as the power of appointment and removal is concerned , - no consent of the Senate being required for the appointment of the subordinate officers , and // there being no lawful remedy against arbitrary proceedings but impeachment . The practical effect of all this is to lower the position of the Department clerks into that of private clerks , and to make them as irresponsible to the state as merchants ' or bankers ' or any other class of clerks in private establishments , while the secretaries and many of the heads of bureaus wield an absolute power . Any person who is in the habit of transacting business at the Departments becomes painfully aware of the irresponsibility which virtually pervades the whole service , and which will continue to exist until all the subordinate officers become , as it were , responsible to each other , and become all of them responsible to the state , - as proposed in Mr. Jenckes 's Civil Service Bill . With the adoption of this bill , the shocking anomaly which now vests a formidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few directors of custom-houses would be forever destroyed . These functionaries would have no longer the power to appoint or to remove their subordinate officers . Stripped of these dangerous and improper prerogatives , they would be the better able to devote themselves exclusively to their official duties , without using them , as at present , as a cloak for ulterior personal or party purposes , or for otherwise selfish and unpatriotic designs . The subordinate officers , on the other hand , would begin to breathe more freely from the moment they felt themselves responsible to the state , instead of a mere servant of the state . Ev*ery officer would feel the sense of this responsibility . It would increase his self-respect , by penetrating him with the conviction that he was no longer doomed to be dependent upon the caprices of heads " dressed in a little brief authority , " but that , if he performed his duties well , the state would recognize his services . In the early days of the Republic , public officers were generally selected from well-known families . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also , to a great extent , with subordinate officers . At the present day , all this is changed , owing to various circumstances , and chiefly to the vast extent of country from which public officers are recruited . Indeed , it may be safely asserted that the ignorance of the community regarding the moral and mental qualifications of // the highest officers of the state finds only a parallel in the ignorance of these officers in regard to their subordinates . With the adoption of the principle of competitive examination as a test of qualification , the community will not be any longer ignorant in regard to the competency of public officers ; and though Mr. Jenekes 's bill regards especially only the officers appointed without advice or consent of the Senate , it empowers that body to refer any appointee , whose nomination requires confirmation , to the Examination Commissioners , previous to the vote on his nomination . Few will deny that , if such a principle had been in force for several years past , the country might have been saved from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vice-Presidency of the United States ; for such is the comprehensive character of Mr. Jenekes 's bill , that , although it deals primarily with subordinate officers only , its moral effect will be to give to the principle of qualification an all-pervading popular prestige and sanction , so that the character of candidates will be submitted to the most stringent scrutiny . If such a scrutiny had been applied to Mr. Johnson 's case , it would not have required a profound psychological knowledge to arrive at the conclusion , that a man may rise from the tailor-shop to the alderman 's gown , and from thence to the senatorial ermine and the gubernatorial chair , and yet be morally and intellectually incapable of presiding with dignity , justice , and ability over the destinies of a great nation . As long as there is no test of qualification established as the only lawful principle in official appointments , a large number of persons will always be found willing to accept the smallest salaries ; and the insufficiency of pay can hardly be surprising when those receiving it are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employments . There are , of course , always many persons engaged in government offices who are mere copyists , and whose remuneration is accordingly limited to small salaries . But wherever the occupation implies a certain kind of intellectual responsibility , even the smallest pay is too large when the person employed is incompetent . If , at the present day , the salaries of government officials are deemed in many quarters as sufficient , although // they are evidently out of all proportion to the increased expenses of living , it is only because the recipients are not considered worthy of higher remuneration ; on the other hand , the principle of adequate pay should be fully recognized as soon as a system of qualification secures to the public service competent persons of cultivated intellects . In a country like ours , where many manual laborers command a remuneration of from three to five dollars a day , it can not be expected that men of education and mental capacities will not demand a higher compensation than that granted to merely muscular or mechanical labor . Nor would it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mode of remunerating their public officers . In England , for instance , where wages for manual labor are at starvation figures , a government clerk with two hundred pounds a year fixed salary , and a prospect of gradual increase and eventual pension after retirement from the public service , occupies a privileged position as compared to the masses of his proletarian fellow-countrymen . The same applies more or less to all European countries . But in this country , with its more equal distribution of property , and with the greater prospects which it holds out to an energetic young man , it would be obviously unwise to deter him from seeking employment in the service of the state by an insufficient salary . Under a new system , offering adequate pay to the comp&amp;-tent , and based upon the principle of open , competitive examination , young men of talent and ambition would seek public offices ; and the same amount of intelligence which distinguishes all other avenues of American activity would appear in the civil service . As the service gained in efficiency its cost would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might easily do the work of a ihundred incompe*-tent persons at low salaries . Indeed , it is estimated by a high authority that a saving of millions of dollars might in this manner be effected annually . The immense increase of public offices consequent upon the new branches of administration growing out of the public debt , of an elaborate system of taxation , and of a constant accession of new territories , should be also borne in mind . The legions of officers in the New York Custom-House , in // the Departments at Washington , and in other public offices all over the United States , would seem to make the task of reform as difficult as wa* that of Hercules in cleansing the Augean stables . But formidable as these difficulties seem , we believe they may all be neutralized , if not altogether overcome , by the adoption of the system of competitive examination and qualification tests , such as are proposed in the Civil Service Bill , so auspiciously introduced in the Thirty-ninth and Fortieth Sessions of Congress by the Hon. Thomas A. Jenckes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has evidently bestowed as much care upon this measure as upon his already celebrated Bankruptcy Bill . We have drawn a gloomy , but , as we believe , a truthful , picture of the civil service of the United States . It is fair , however , to state , that the old countries have all suffered more or less from the same evils , though not engaged , as we are , in civilizing a new continent , and in regenerating vast sections of country heretofore demoralized and distracted by the degradalion of labor consequent upon the long prevalence of slavery . Their civil-service systems have only recently emerged from a disgraceful and chaotic condition . Let us look first at England . In 1853 Sir Charles Trevelyan and Sir Stafford Northcote stated in an official Report : " Admission to the civil service is , indeed , sought after ; but it is for the unambitious and the indolent or incapable that it is chiefly desired . " Macaulay , in his celebrated speech in the House of Commons ( June 24 , 1853 ) on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have only to look back to those lamentable and shameful years which followed the first establishment of our power in Bengal . Then , as may be well known if you only look to any poet , satirist , or essayist of those times , you may see in what manner the system of appointments operated . Looking over only yesterday , for another subject , a file of newspapers of 1771 , I was struck by a paragraph stating that Mr. Soand-so , who went out with the Governor-General only three years ago , had just landed with ? 40,000 . But it was not only so . These were the sort of men who took no office , but simply put the GovernorGeneral to a species of ransom ; they laid upon him a sort of tax , - what the Mahrattas call clioret , and the Scotch black-mail , - that is , the sum paid to a thief , in consideration that he went away without // doing harm . There was a tradition in Calcutta , where the story was very circumstantially told and generally believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of recommendation from one of the Ministers during Lord Clive 's second administration . Lord Clive saw that he was not only unfit for , but would positively do harm in , any office , and said , in his peculiar way , Well , chap , how much do you want ? ' Not being accustomed to being spoken to so plainly , the man replied that he only hoped for some situation in which his services might be useful . That is no answer , chap , ' said Lord Clive , how much do you want ? Will one hundred thousand pounds do ? ' The person replied that he should be delighted if by laborious service he could obtain that competence . Lord Clive then wrote out an order for the sum at once , and told the applicant to leave India by the ship he came in , and , once in England again , to *emain there . " Macaulay 's efforts to improve the Indian civil service were eventually crowned with success . The principle of competitive examination was finally adopted , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches of the public service at home . Among the distinguished men by whom the subject was subsequently taken up was John Stuart Mill . We extract the following passage bearing upon this subject from Mr. Mill 's work on Representative Government , the same being cited in Mr. Jenckes 's Report on the Civil Service - " We are triumphantly told that neither Clive nor Wellington could have passed the test which is prescribed for an aspirant to an engineer cadetship ; as if , because Clive and Wellington did not do what was not required of them , they could not have done it if it had been required . If it be only meant to inform us that it is possible to be a great general without these things , so it is without many other things which are very useful to great generals . Alexander the Great had never heard of Vauban 's rules , nor could Julius Cmsar speak French . We are next informed that book-worms , a term which seems to be held applicable to whoever has the smallest tincture of book knowledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habits of gentlemen . This is a very common line of remark with dunces of condition ; but whatever the dunces may think , they have no monopoly of either gentlemanly habits or bodily activity . Wherever these are needed , let them be inquired into and separately provided for , not to the exclusion of mental qualifications , but in addition . Meanwhile , I am credibly informed that in the military academy at Woolwich the competition cadets are as supe-* // nor to those admitted on the old system of nomination in these respects as in all others ; that they learn even their drill more quickly , - as indeed might be expected , for an intelligent person learns all things sooner than a stupid one ; and that in general demeanor they contrast so favorably with their predecessors that the authorities of the institution are impatient for the day to arrive when the last remains of the old leaven shall have disappeared from the place . If this be so , and it is easy to ascertaia whether it is so , it is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ignorance is a better qualification than knowledge for the military , and a fortiori for every other profession ; or that any one good quality , however little apparently connected with liberal education , is at all likely to be promoted by going without it . " Though the first admission to government employment be decided by competitive examination , it would in most cases be impossible that subsequent promotion should be so decided ; and it seems proper that this should take place ( as it usually does at present ) on a mixed system of seniority and selection . Those whose duties are of a routine character should rise by seniority to the highest point to which duties merely of that description can carry them ; while those to whom functions of particular trust , and requiring special capacity , are confided , should be selected from the body , on the discretion of the chief of the office . And this selection will generally be made honestly by him , if the original appointment take place by open competition ; for under that system his establishment wjll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official connection , he would have been a stranger . If among them there be any in whom he or his political friends and supporters take an interest , it will be but occasionally , and only when , to this advantage of connection , is added , as far as the initiatory examination could test it , at least equality of real merit . And , except when there is a very strong motive to job these appointments , there is always a strong one to appoint the fittest person ; being the one who gives to his chief the most useful assistance , saves him most trouble , and helps most to build up that reputation for good management of public business which necessarily and properly redound to the credit of the minister , however much the qualities to which it is immediately owing may be those of his subordinates . " It may , on the whole , be said of England , and of other countries , that the civil service suffers as much from the incompetency of the highest officers as from that of the subordinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement has taken place in the subordinate branches , the secretaries of // legation being subjected to a severe examination . But the heads of the legations themselves , having been secretaries at a period when such stringent tests had not yet been introduced , are in many instances comparatively inferior men , often of elegant manners and social accomplishments , but not proficient in the higher branches of statesmanship and cosmopolitan culture , and thus incapable of grappling with the manifold relations of foreign countries , and unable to give to their own government comprehensive views of the respective countries to which they are accredited . In Prance , the great political and social Revolution of   led to a revolution in the French civil service . The first Napoleon confirmed and established the principle , that all public offices should be filled by the most competent persons . The system of examination has since been improved by Victor Cousin , the eminent philosopher and minister of public instruction in 1840 , under whose auspices Mr. E. Laboulaye , since so well known in this country by his sympathy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civil service in the various states of Germany . Mr. Laboulaye 's Report ( appended to that of the Congressional Committee ) , embodying the result of his careful investigations , has given a new impetus to the further improvement of the French civil service . As far , however , as the highest officers of the state are concerned , they are liable to be changed by the caprice of the Emperor . But these arbitrary changes do not affect the civil service of France . This moves on with the regularity of clock-work and the inflexibility of fate . In a country liable as France was and is to be tossed about by political storms , the civil service may be said to be , next to the courts of law , the only organization which survives all changes , and furnishes an historic link between the past , present , and future generations . The German states , particularly Wiirtemberg and Prussia , are more advanced than any other country in their system of examination . In Russia , all the government officers have grades . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nobility , the fourteenth grade being the lowest in the scale . No one can be appointed to a public office in Russia without furnishing // certificate of college education , and the offices are assigned according to these educational qualifications . Persons without such qualification are not entitled to any grade , but they may fill lower offices , as those of copyists , &amp;c . They may be promoted , however , and there are not a few instances of copyists rising to the highest offices . Russia , however , is far from being purged of the abuses of favoritism , and the public offices swarm with mere parasites . But the principle of the civil service is , at any rate , established upon a sound theory , and the efforts of the present Russian government are strenuously directed to the enforcement of its practice . In Greece , no person is admitted to the public service unless he has graduated at a university . In Italy , Portugal , Spain , Belgium , Holland , Switzerland , as in the German states , qualification tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instance of this it may be mentioned that three of the foreign ministers residing at present at Washington , namely , those of France , Spain , and Portugal , had all held the post of director of their respective foreign departments previous to their nomination as ministers to the United States , and served in all the subordinate capacities of the Foreign Bureau before they attained to their present ambassadorial position . Lord Lyons , formerly English Minister at Washington , has recently attained to the most exalted position in his profession by being appointed ambassador to the Tuileries , after having served from his earliest life in the various subordinate offices of the diplomatic service . In the remote East , - in China and Japan ,  --  the persons employed in the government offices are the most learned men of the empires ; and the perpetuity of the ancient civilization of these remarkable countries may be in part accounted for by the character of their civil-service organization . Even in the mongrel empire of the Sultan of Turkey , a test of qualification is insisted upon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a favorite of the Sultana , and the governorship of a large province upon a hanger-on of the Porte or a partisan of the Grand Vizier ; but smaller offices in Turkey and Egypt are generally bestowed only upon qualified candidates , accomplished Greeks , Armenians , or Levantines , who are as re // markable for their proficiency in languages and their general attainments as the Tnrkish or Egyptian " head " of the department is generally notorious for his ignorance . In fact , there is hardly a civilized country without a system of examination and promotion in the dispensation of its public offices . Ours is probably the only country in the world where it does not exist in the civil service , though it exists in our military and naval service , the stringent discipline and efficiency of which are well known to all Americans . No doubt , the so-called localization of offices and political influences have heretofore impeded reform , nor do we desire to disregard this influence . Illinois , for instance , or Wisconsin , would be justified in complaining if their citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they might be filled exclusively by citizens of Massachusetts or of New Hampshire . The proper theory of the matter is , that all States should have the same right to competition , and that rejection should not take place upon any other ground excepting that of disqualification . Mr. Jenckes strikes the key-note in basing his bill upon the principle of admission open to all . Another argument against the reform of the present chaos is the fear of a permanent bureaucracy , and of the anti-republican tendencies of such permanent institutions . We entertain no such apprehensions . A permanent bureaucracy is only dangerous when it is incompetent and practically irresponsible . We have already shown to what a great degree our service is now practically irresponsible , and we will proceed to show that it is a permanent institution , that we actually now have a permanent bureaucracy . In the absence of a qualification test , it matters very little whether the incumbents of public offices represent the outgoing or the ingoing administration . If Jones , appointed in 1857 , is of the same calibre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1865 , the fact of permanency is not in the least impaired by Jones being superseded by Smith , and by Brown supplanting Smith . Jones , Smith , and Brown , though three different persons ; are , in point of fact , one and the same individuality as far as their unqualified office-holding and their unfitness are concerned . This , indeed , is the worst of all permanent bureaucracies , // when the hydra-headed brood of office-holders has positively one head , as far as qualification is concerned , and that head a dead-head . Unfitness is consequently perpetuated to such an extent that , although Jones is removed , and Smith dies , and Brown resigns , and White is promoted , the permanency of stupidity is more and more consolidated as time passes on and generation succeeds generation . The spectre " Red Tape , " which we all imagined to have been buried amidst the rubbish of antediluvian monarchies , is thus actually haunting the public offices of the Republic . The American citizen , buoyant with capacity , impatient of pedantry , finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferred from the nineteenth century of steam and telegraphs , to " the good old times of King George the Fourth . " Red-tape Jones of 1857 left a tradition of routine behind him , which is cherished by red-tape Brown of 1861 , which is still more enthusiastically adored by red-tape Smith of 1865 , and which becomes the official gospel of red-tape White of 1867 . Our only objection to Mr. Jeuckes 's bill is , that it does not go far enough . The foreign service of the government stands as much in need of reforniation as the subordinate branches of the home civil service . Ministers and consuls might , under proper regulations securing the appointment of the most competent persons , become powerful auxiliaries to the increase of the commerce , industry , science , arts , and general civilization of the Republic . With the revolution wrought in the modes of national intercommunication by steamers , railways , and land and submarine telegraphs , the services of ministers and consuls must be made to subserve very comprehensive aims , if they shall continue to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large amounts for ministers and consuls in every part of the globe , is it not surprising how little information they impart to the American people as regards the social and industrial life of the masses of our fellow-men in foreign lands , - how little official information they furnish concerning the distribution of property , the agricultural and manufacturing activities , the arts and sciences , and educational and philanthropical institutions of the Old World ? Almost every foreign country has its own specialties // in all spheres of human activity , and it would be the duty of competent ministers and consuls to investigate them , and give to their employers and countrymen the benefit of their investigations . The systems of agricultural improvement and irrigation , the co-operative associations , the various processes of manufactures , the respective incomes , wages , and resources of the various classes of the respective populations , afford ample scope for suggestive studies ; and if men of comprehensive culture and varied attainments were to be appointed as ministers and consuls , they would have , it in their power to instruct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches of civilization in which foreign nations excel us , while they could call their attention to those branches in which we excel them . In this manner the foreign service might become the handmaid of humanity and civilization , while at present it is only an imperfect and clumsy travesty of the obsolete diplomacies of bygone ages . Mr. Jenckes 's bill , however , deserves the warmest support , as much for the improvements which it actually proposes to enact by the introduction of open competitive examinations in the subordinate branches of the home civil service , and by the abolition of the system of irresponsibility and patronage , as for the way in which it prepares for the adoption of reforms in the foreign service and in all other administrative branches of the government . The United States have gone through a formidable convulsion , the outbreak of which was fomented to a great extent by wrong men in wrong places ; by faithless and reckless public officers at home and abroad ; by a demoralization of the public service , which was at the same time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointments to public offices to the vilest uses . The moral atmosphere of the land is now gradually clearing up . The destructive era is drawing to a close , and the constructive era is beginning to dawn . We have purged our civilization from the degrading system of slavery . We are now impelled , by all the considerations which are sacred to the lover of his country 's fame , to complete this task by reforming those evils in the public service of the country that grew up to a great // extent under the fatal influence of sham-Democratic and SlaveState supremacy . In a recent debate in the House of Lords on the subject of the English Reform Bill , Earl Spencer referred very pointedly to the unwillingness of able and noble men to accept public service under democratic institutions . The fallacy of this proposition remains to be demonstrated by this Republic , and it can and will be demonstrated . We bring our discussion of this important subject to a close , for the present , by submitting to our readers the bill introduced in Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that it may be so supported by public sentiment as shortly to become a law of the United States .
