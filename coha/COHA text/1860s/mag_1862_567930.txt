ARTICLE VJ. - ADJUTANT STEARNS . Adjutant Stearn8 . Boston : Massachusetts . Sabbath School Society , Depository No. 13 , Cornhill . Tins is the title-page of a volume of 160 pages , written by President Stearns of Amherst College . It is a memorial of his son , a young officer who fell in the battle of Newbern , " inscribed by his father to the gallant and noble commander , Col. William S. Clark : to the resolute and patriotic officers and privates of the 21 st Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers : to the brave citizens and regular soldiers of the great army of the United States ; and to all young men of lofty aims and endeavors everywhere . " It is a beautiful tribute to a beautiful character ; and although prepared by a father 's hand , while his heart was freshly bleeding , and amid the restrictions which a conscious love and grief imposed , it loses nothing from this , but rather gains ; for there is felt to be a reserved power through the whole ; back of every fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , provocative of tears in the reader and when the story is told , and the abrupt conclusion is reached ,  --  abrupt as the rifle shot which opened an exit from the body for the young hero 's spirit ,  --   --  the facts alone are sufficient to make the desired impression , and all that the parental compiler might have said , but could not , is said by comrades and comm anders . We accept this book thankfully in the name of the young men of our country ; it is a reminder to us how much we have lost and also how much we are gaining of hallowed and restorative influences ,  --  redemption earned by sacrifice . It is a bloody flower plucked from the field of battle . Nature scatters some of her rarest products over her dreariest scenes . Delicate and graceful hare-bells , " floxvers of loveliest blue , " bend over the glaciers ; the most beautiful life in nature , " skirt ing the eternal frost . " So the loftiest virtues of humanity // have flourished amid its deepest crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or doubt the future God will unroll before us , whatever be the portents of the hour ,  --  and we are writing in the darkest moments of our civil war ,  --  when , through rank and file of our citizen soldiery , God has sown broadcast seeds of heroism and martyr-like sacrifice ? True , we are a wicked people , more so than we have been wont to think , more so , perhaps , than any of us have been disposed to admit ; profanity has flamed over the land , regiments and camps have spoken the vernacular of hell , as if they were cohorts of Satan 's rebellion , instead of loyal bulwarks of a legitimate government . Fearful as is the admission , and sadly as we make it , yet it is to be thankfully remembered , that God does not count off the evil against the good , and decide the destiny of a country , by the character of the majority . Iad but ten righteous persons been found in Sodom , the whole city had been saved for the ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , abovewho is authorized to say how many of his enemies ?  --  and the prayer of one righteous man shall countervail the cries for vengeance of generations of the wicked . As in the mystery of redemption , " by one man , Jesus Christ , the grace of God and the gift by grace bath abounded unto many ; " so it often is ; God has more favor to one , than disfavor to multitudes ; " where sin abounded , grace did much more abound . " " Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints . " We can not tell how precious , nor how dear to God is the blood of one such servant of His , as young Stearns , and many like him , who for the love of God have given their life for their country . It is the glory of Christian sacrifice , that Christ associates it with his own , not to atone but to accomplish the purposes of his atonement , " filling up that which is behind of the afflictions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , in the strongest and best sense ; he was descended from its founders and first planters ; he numbered among his ancestors Gov . Thomas Dudley and Capt . Edward Johnson ; and of the blood of time now classic John Alden , " three currents flowed in his veins . " If tlmere be anything in hereditary piety , " which dwelt first " not // 75 " in his grandmother , " but in his earlier progenitors in this country ; if there be anything in liberal culture from generation to o'eneration ; all this refinement and capacity was the endowinent of his birth ; for in these respects he was singularly happy , having sprung from a line of ministers , educated in Harvard College , and families whose names were never absent from the lists of members in full communion with our ehnrches . It is pleasant to observe in such a scion of New England so early and strong a development of its great historic traits , the love of knowledge , of freedom , and of God . Of his desire for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common with most boys of his native state , so richly blest by its public schools ; and nothing less could have been expected of him , born in Cambridge , under the shadow of old Harvard , and passing from boyhood into manhood at Amlierst , in the heart of the college , under the roof of its president , his father . The noble enthusiasm of his nature is singularly witnessed by his boyish notes to his father , just before he went to Andover to fit for college . " In regard to my studying , I feel as I never have before ; something within me says , Act ; and , as Sheridan said , It is in me and must come out . ' I feel more and more , every day , the truth of the saying , Knowledge is power . ' I am determined yet to make something or nothing ; ' that is my motto ; and , father , you shall yet hear from me in other ways than as your son . " Speaking of some obstacles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hav n't other folks done so ? and ca n't I do the same ? I will do the same , ca n't or no ca n't . It will be done , and shall be done . Where there 's a will there 's a way . I have the will ; the way will follow . " In his college course lie became enamored of the mathematics and the natural sciences , particularly of chemistry . In this , as in everything , the passionate energy of his nature came out . To an intimate friend he wrote , " I can not explain to you how passionately fond of chemistry I am ; not as a person is fond of music , or as many say they are fond of languages , history , mathematics ; but as a part almost of my very existence . I feel as if I could do anything , bear anything , for its sake . " But beneath this ardent love of // science , there slumbered another passion , and stronger ; it was , the love of country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intelligent devotion to the great principles involved in our institutions . After the fall of Fort Sumter , in the majestic uprising of our people , the young men of our colleges were among the first to feel the impulse ; they crested the wave of excitement which rolled over the land ; Amherst particularly was distinguished , and that terrible Sabbath , which rose gloomily upon the telegraphic spreading of the news , the young men of the college enrolled a company to be employed , if needed , for the defense of Washington , and " at the head of this list of patriotic warriors , was written in his own hand , the name of Frazar A. Stearns . " He did not , however , immediately leave his studies , but when the tidings of the Bull Run defeat and shame arrived , he could no longer be restrained . He felt the stigma as a personal disgrace ; he wished to wipe it off , if need be , by the sacrifice of his own life . A family in the neighborhood recall a visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " we are beaten , we RUN* r , u , n , that spells RUN , do n't it ? Yes , we nux . I wish II had been there ; I would not have run ; I would have stood and died alone . I wish I had . " To his father he said , " We have been beaten , and now there is a call for Frazar A. Stearns . " After counsels against precipitation , and in view of accumulating evidences of a call from God , his father said , " If such are your motives and convictions , go , and God be with you . " The preparations made by the young volunteer were intelligent and earnest , He gave himself to assiduous training in Amherst and Boston in the use of the bayonet and revolver , and in the sword exercise . With a thoughtfulness , also , rare indeed in one of his age , to make himself useful in all ways to the men under his care , he went to his physician , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and diseases of the soldier , his fatigues on the march and his dangers in the camp , as well as the various forms of death or wounds in battle . That this was no sudden impulse , but , as his father judged , " a call from God , " was sufficiently evidenced by this sober discipline , and the more than consistent , the glorious fulfilling of the // promise ! lie was not yet twenty-one , but it is wonderful with what sobriety , forecast , and sacred enthusiasm he entered into the war . When asked how he felt in view of the possibility of what afterwards became a fact , he answered , " I hope , of course , to escape and return ; but III have thought of all this , and if it should be God 's will , I think I am ready . " When young Ellsworth was killed , he said , " It is a glorious death . .1 should have been willing to have stood in his place if I could save the country . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argmnent could be advanced , which he had not considered , that he believed himself adapted to a military life ; that he had courage , self-control , the power to influence and command men , and lie thought to inspire them , at least some of them , with patriotic sentiments , and a sacred enthusiasm ; he believed , moreover , that the country needed educated men , who were moral and religious , officers who would act from principle , who would feel for the privates and take care of them , and work hard to make them soldiers , and Christian soldiers . Was lie not clearly right in this ? and how have subsequent events emphasized the wisdom and justice of the sentiments entertained by this young soldier ? He early gave proof how lofty and how firmly fixed his views of duty were . Accepting a commission as first lientenamit of Company I , in the 21st Regiment Massachusetts Volunteers , he was offered the position of aid-de-camp , by General IReno ,  --  alas ! this gallant and distinguished officer is now , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honorable and attractive as the offer was , young Stearns declined it , resolved to stick by his regiment , for his company actually needed him in it , and he was determined , by fighting for his country , to deserve promotion , before he received it . He wrote : " I have left everything to fight for my country . If , in the course of events , I should prove a good soldier , fit to command men , and an able officer ; and if God in his great niercy should spare my life , my successes would then , of course , be measured , at least , in some degree , by my advancement . A good officer is always known ; and if you will excuse me for saying so , the qualifications of a good officer are , besides courage ,  --  intelligence , energy , good // breeding , and a certain knack and power of commanding men . " The remainder of the story is quickly told . Tie took part ill the Il3nrnside Expedition , and was engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of which he greatly distinguished himself by his gallantry and was wounded , and in the other , he fell , making a difficult and dangerous charge . His own mauly and Christian words describe to us his experience in the first battle : " The bullets whistled all around me ,  --  the cannon shots flew over me ,  --  and yet none hit me until the very last . Then , as if God wished to show me how kind he was to me , I was hit twice , first by a ball which passed within one-fourth of an inch of my spine , made a little furrow in my neck , and passed through my shirt , vest , coat , and overcoat . The other , a buck-shot , entered my cap , passed through and hit me on the right forehead . A stunning sensation , a feeling of faintness , and I sank down on the ground . Then I revived , and crawling a few steps , I found I was all right , though the blood was streaming down my face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something for my country . I never felt my wound until twenty-four hours after the battle , when it caused me some trouble for two or three days ; but it is now quite well . God grant I may see you all , dear ones , again , and that together we may thank Him for preserving you from any harm , and me from the bullet and cannon-shot , and more still from the moral pestilence of camp-life . Pray for me that my faith may be strengthened , that my purposes may all be changed for ribhteousness . " Of his first battle we have given his own account ; of his last we will give the touchingly simple and beautiful one written by a colored boy , who had been a servant in the family of President Stearns , but who then was the servant of the assistant surgeon of the regiment . " The death of my brave young master has prevented me from giving the particulars until the present time . I say that he was brave , because I know it . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , and I came to the determination to do everything in my power to promote his happiness ; but this resolve never did him much good . On the morning of the battle of Roanoke , I met him in the gang-way of the boat ; we shook hands . He says , Charlie , we shall have a hard fight to-day . ' I looked up in his face ; all I saw was a pleasant smile . I turned away thinking he was a brave man . In the battle of Hoanoke he was wounded . I saw him the next day , and asked him how he felt during the engagement . He said , I had no time to feel . ' The morning before the battle of Newbern , we walked out on the guard of the boat . I said , Mr. Frazar , suppose you should be killed ? ' He took my hand and said , Charlie , I shall . ' I could not stand this , and turned to go , but I felt the pressure grow stronger , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My eye fell when I looked at him , and he let me go . I think he had something to say , but he never said it to me When the sad tidings came to me that he was shot , I took lint , bandages , and wine , &amp;c. , and ran to the spot where he was , but all was over . A corporal of Company C. attended him as long as he lived . He was conveyed to a shed adjoining the hospital . It is useless to tell the many attempts I made to restore him to life , but all proved fruitless . I closed his eyes , and pressed that cold hand to my lips . I can say no more ; but I send you this to let you know that his old servant closed his eyes . P. S. I send his testament , that his father gave him , by this mail . " We do not know where can be found a letter , written under like circumstances , that is the equal of this for natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partook of the marked attributes of his natural character , sincerity , decision , ardor . Baptized in his infancy ,  --  a covenant privilege highly valued by his parents , and highly favored by God in the children ,  --  he gave evidence from boyhood of Christian character growing with his growth and strengthening with his strength , and was received to full communion at the age of twelve , after a long probation , and when the risk of denying him seemed greater than of complying with his request . The most salient and instructive feature of his religious experience , was the skepticism into which he fell , and out of which he rose , not only unharmed by his doubts , but possessed of a simpler , humbler , firmer faith . Like many young men , and most , pursuing a liberal course of study , he encountered dark temptations to unbelief , and the very virtues of his nature gave them additional power ; he could not shut his eyes to them , he would not disown them , and so he went into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mists . He groped about in a chaos of ideas , he was intellectually all unstrung , and out of joint , but through the whole it was manifest that he was not bereft of the leadings of God 's spirit ; he was honest and teachable , not loving his doubts and proud of them , but fearing them , and praying to be delivered . " His religious life was like a harp not broken and destroyed , but unstrung and discordant . " To his father lie wrote , " I am very unhappy , and have been for some time . Those old // doubts have been coining up in my mind , and until they are solved I shall be nnhappy . You tell me to rejoice evermore , ' and pray without ceasing . ' I can do neither , for I seem to believe nothing . 0 ! the misery , the agony I endure , you can not imagine ; and sometimes I wish I had died when I thought I believed , rather than live to become ( as I fear I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I could . I know some will call me fickle , changeable , and ridicule me ; but I am coming home to you like the prodigal son , and hope that you , at least , will not reproach me . Meanwhile , ask the Saviour you believe in , if he be true , to convince me . " We believe that this experience will be of great benefit to young men in our literary institutions , who either from the progress of their own studies , or under the influence of bold but undisciplined minds , fall into scepticism , and keep their doubts to themselves , as ashamed of them , or convinced by them . There is no danger greater to a young man , than scepticism thus secretly entertained . The frankness of Stearns , his manly grappling with his doubts by the might of prayer , and his complete victory over them in a serene faith , and a life of heroic self-sacrifice growing out of it , and sustained by it , will help many a youth in like peril to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are natural and unexaggerated ; what we want for the stimulus and guidance of our youth , is not a shining example of seraphic virtue from the start , but lofty endeavor in the midst of temptations " common to man , " and felt to be actual , and the eventual achievement to which Divine Grace conducts by the humble methods of faith and patience . We have reached the limits assigned this Article , and we return to the thought with which we begun , the dignity of selfsacrifice , the compensations of this war , the reenacting of the great mystery of redemption , the head suffering again in his members ! We did not know that we had such elements of character among our people ; the air was so filled with lamentations over our covetousness and corruption , our luxury and materializing tendencies , we feared the very stock of our national life had been infected ; but this civil war has revealed virtues , which , in the darkness of our public crimes // shine like the stars , and make the night of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , by the fact , a fact nniting the providence with the word of God , and atriking into the profoundest mysteries of both , that it is the men who have brought into this war the rarest endowments and the pnrest hearts , who have been the first to feel its bitterness , and sheathe its thunders in their own persons . While it is true " no man liveth and sinneth not , " and none of our people can claim exemption from God 's primitive visitations , but must acknowledge they are tighter than their sins ; still , as respects the causes that have brought on this war , some are comparatively innocent , yet these have not only suffered with the guilty , but have stood in the forefront of the battle , and b&amp;en the first and freest to shed their blood . It is a suggestive fact that this young patriot , who was so ready to fly to arms , and with a presaging calmness to offer up his life , brought to the strife nothing of the bitterness of party-spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , examined tile subject thoughtfully and conscientiously , and in a spirit which , had it been universal , would have rendered the fratricide impossible , counseled a moderation commendable , we will not say in a boy , but a statesman , and with patriotic and Christian magnanimity would have shared the costs of emancipation between North and South . " From early youth , " says Professor Tyler , in his funeral discourse , " he had taken a deep interest in the history and prosperity of his country . And as those perilous times drew near , which foreshadowed the rebellion and the war , his mind dwelt so much upon those perils , that amid the dreamy wanderings of his long sickness in 1859 , he proposed plans , not unworthy of a sound and mature understanding , for the national safety . Especially he urged with great earnestness , that his father should write articles for the most patriotic papers , and to the most judicious men of the country ; not the extreme or the party men , but to the honest , fair-minded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to have the right men sent to Congress , who would take up the slavery question honestly and kindly , and propose that the Go*rernment and the Nation // should offer to bear a reasonable part of the expense of emancipation . " We have not a word now to say about the wisdom of this expedient , or the possibility , even , of averting the history that has ensued ; but we call attention to the spirit of this youthful student , nor can we think , even now , how the patriot and the Christian could have counseled better , and we ask , where breathed there one less deserving the bnllet shock and the agony of death upon the battle-field ? Yet , thus it has pleased God ! By such blood-shedding is our country to be redeemed ; by such fellowship with Christ in suffering is the new life of our countrymen to be generated ; the short life and early death of young Stearns will accomplish all that any human life and death can , by kindling a like spirit in the hearts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " though dead , yet speaking , " though ascended , yet incarnate in the bosoms of the young men , who are to make the future of the American continent what the world needs , and Christ demands !
