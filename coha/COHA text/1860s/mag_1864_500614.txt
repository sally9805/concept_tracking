FEED MY LAMBS ? PART FIRST . hARRY has crept to his little bed shivering with childish dread of the dark . Ungentle hands have placed him there , guardians careless of his comfort and chary of kind words and looks and a coarse-voiced girl has said , as she took the light away , and banged the door behind her : Cry out loud , you little imp , and I 'll send the black bears to catch you . ' So Harry is choking down his sobs , and crying silently , very silently . The chill and melancholy night wind , as it comes moaning through the casement and rustling the light leaves of the tall poplar as they rest against the window panes , and the great round tears as they fall with a dull , heavy drop , drop on his lonely pillow , are the only sounds that break the dismal stillness , excepting now and then , when a great sob , too mighty to be choked down , bursts from the little , overcharged heart . And then Harry fancies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress , the huge black paws of these same bears grasping the tender round shoulder , blue with the cold , while the little boy lies there shivering and shuddering in an agony of apprehension . Darkness above and around him , terrible , black , silent darkness ; darkness which enwraps and enfolds him and takes away his breath , like the heavy , stifling folds of a hideous black mantle ; darkness that the active imagination of the timid child peoples with phantom shapes , grotesque and horrible-forms made unnaturally visible by their own light , that mouth and leer , and stretch out distorted arms to seize him , whose appalling presence fills the room from floor to ceiling , and which eddy and circle around him in horrid demon dances , whirling gradually nearer and nearer , until myriads of hideous faces are thrust close to his own , or grin above him , while he chokes for breath - forms that make the cold sweat stand on his baby forehead , and freeze the blood in his veins , that he watches night after night , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing on end , that make of the desolate nighttime a dread and a horror ! And there is no one to kneel beside his lonely bed and tell the frightened child , sick with dread , that there are no such things as odious black dwarfs , who drag young children off to dark and dismal dungeons by the hair of their head , nor great giants , who grow always bigger as you look at them , and who eat up , at a mouthful , little boys who cry in the dark . No tender mother bends low with all but divine compassion to listen to his little sorrows , or soothe his childish fears  --  to teach him his simple prayers , or tell him sweet stories of a little child like himself before whose lowly cradle wise men bowed as at a shrine , and to do whom reverence shining ones came from a fardistant country . There is no one to pillow his curly head upon a loving bosom , and lull him to sleep with quaint old lullabies . Harry is worse than motherless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other nights preceding , poor Harry , worn out with fright and weariness , is dropping to sleep from sheer exhaustion , closing his swollen eyes . in troubled slumber , when , half unconsciously turning his curly head upon the pillow to find a dry place for the wet cheek to rest against , something bright and shining makes long lines of light in the tears still wet on Harry 's lashes , and wakes him up again . Such a bright , beautiful star it is . One that has been slowly rising , climbing the blue outside , until it reaches a // break in the foliage of the tree before the window , and shines straight into Harry 's eyes . Something of that strange solemnity that fills minds of a maturer growth when gazing on the starry heavens , hushes that baby 's soul into reverence as he looks upon it . The terrible shapes melt away into the gloom , he feels no dread of the dark now , and vaguely and gradually there arises the first dim consciousness of the deep spiritual want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul to see and find the Infinite Father and claim his protection . Fragments of childish hymns , parts of simple prayers , such poor and scattered crumbs of spiritual instruction as he has gleaned here and there somehow , and on which the infant soul has been but meagrely fed , crowd in upon him . Then come wondering thoughts of that great good Being , that strange , unfathomable mystery , whose name is God , Who lives up in the blue somewhere , and yet is everywhere . This problem of Omnipresence he has pondered and pondered over , and reasoned upon , in his childish fashion , but now it dawns with a newer and clearer light on Harry 's mind . God is everywhere . To his awakened spiritual perception this holy , mysterious , and invisible presence seems pervading the sky , the air , the earth , filling and enfolding all things . Night after night , as he had lain there sobbing and crying and thought himself all alone in the darkness , this great good God had been with him all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt it until now ; and , overwhelmed by the mighty thought , powerfully felt , though imperfectly comprehended , awestruck Harry , tremulous with reverence , obedient to some childish fancy that the name of father is not holy and reverent enough for such a Being , folds his tiny bands , earnestly pray-ing : Our Grandfather which art in heaven , stay near poor Harry in the dark , and keep the bears away ! ' Is it faith or fancy , that soft , gentle , summery atmosphere that fills the room , and makes the little , lonely heart thrill as with the pleasant consciousness of a loving presence ? It is real to Harry , with his child 's undoubting faith . Stretching forth his rounded arms , and clasping the dark , impalpable air in a joyous embrace , he nestles closely to the wet pillow as if it were a loving bosom , and falls asleep with a smile upon his lip . A childhood robbed of childish joys and pleasures , the little , insignificant trifles which form its sum of happiness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of little hearts , deprived of the pleasures suited to its state , yet too immature to turn within itself for comfort in its need , its life without and within a dull , joyless , dreary blank-such was poor Harry 's , for a shadow dark and terrible rested on his baby heart and home , a something that darkened and deepened day by day , and grew more and more insupportable as the weary time crept on . What it was , and how long it had rested there before he became conscious of its presence , and whether his miserable home had ever been free from it and ever been a happy one , little Harry never knew . All his brief life it had lain there . Its shadow had crept into the violet eyes with the first faint glimmer of intelligence , and when the new-born soul , mysterious breath of God , first woke from its mystic dreaming , and looked consciously out upon the world into which it had come , its baleful presence crept into that holy sanctuary , and darkened what should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn it in with every breath from the atmosphere of the little world around him ; it rested on all he came in contact with , and gradually and sadly there arose in the mind too immature to comprehend the cause and the nature of this desolating power , yet feeling vaguely day by day its bhighting effects , sorrowful and earnest **25;801;TOOLONG like the fol 664 // lowing , to which there came back no answer to the little , suffering heart : Why his home ( if home it may be called in which the heart finds no resting place ) , the four walls that enclosed the place where he ate and slept , was such a dull , joyless , lonesome spot ? What that dark something was that shadowed its light and took from it all joy and comfort , causing every face within it to wear a melancholy or forbidding aspect ? Why there was no glad smile even on his father 's lips , when he came to seek the sad young creatures that crept silently to his knee and looked wistfully up into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , he was always kind with that sorrowful tenderness which makes sad hearts the sadder ? Why this craving that he feels within him , this halfundefined , insatiable longing for maternal love and sympathy ? What had sealed from the thirsting heart this purest fountain of earthly tenderness ? A mother 's form was present to him day by day , but where was the maternal heart of love which should have beat within that bosom ? Can a mother forget her children ? ' There is a fell and terrible destroyer , which murders peace in hearts and homes , whose very breath is a mildew and a blight , in whose desolating track follow woe , want , and ruin ; a fierce , insatiable appetite , trebly cursed , that makes of life a loathsome degradation , and fills dishonored graves , blighting all that is divine and godlike in human nature , sealing the *ushing fountain of maternal tenderness , and teaching even a mother 's heart forgetfulness. o God ! of what punishment shall thy justice deem those worthy , who , by cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion , shut out the light , and check the rich and limitless expansion of all that is divine in the souls committed to their charge ? Ah ! what did it matter that there were honorable titles affixed to the name so disgraced , that in the home thus blighted were all the luxuries and appliances of wealth , that rare pictures hung against its walls , carpets covered the floors whose velvet surface muffled the footfalls , costly curtains shut out the too garish light , that servants were at command , well paid to take care of the neglected children , paid to care for the house , and all fine things within it , and - paid to keep its secrets ! What did all this matter to the miserable possessor of wealth and namC , the disgraced husband , the heart-broken father ? He could comprehend this woe in all its bearings , could measure the length , the breadth , the depth of the curse that had lighted upon him ? Homes there were whose walls and floors were bare , whose windows were shaded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes , poor in this world 's wealth , but rich in domestic peace and love ; and for the blessed quiet of their lowly hearthstones , he would joyfully have bartered wealth and fame , and all such dross as men call happiness . And Harry saw them too . The little , lonely heart , saddened by a shadow it could not comprehend , from its own gloomy home turned longingly to their homely cheerfulness , as flowers turn to the light . One in particular had attracted his childish notice . It was just across the road ; he could see it from the window of the nursery where he played , and he used to leave his play to watch it . Such glimpses of a happy home had streamed through its opening portals and fallen on the heart of the little solitary watcher like a benison . What hasty peeps he took at its homely brightness as the door opened and closed , and what long , long looks he bestowed upon it , when it stood open for hours together , as it did now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple cottage . Too unpretending for hall or entry , the little parlor opened into the street , and from the window where he stood , Harry could see straight into it . There it was , with its bright pa-665 // pered walls , and gay red carpet , its deep hw window seat looking like a garden , where flowers bloomed and frail exotics stretched forth their delicate leaves to bathe in the sunlight that came streaming in , and cunning little yellow birds , in quaint , tiny cages , sang the long day through . And there-oh , busy fingers ! making neat and bright the little home-heart of love , shedding blessed sunlight around it-there , so busy and blithe , so happy and gay , sat the presiding genius of the place , with a face so bright and good -- just such a face as you would expect to see in such a home ; one that sad and disappointed mortals , meeting in the street , would turn to for a second look , and bless it as it passed ; a face to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little joys and sorrows ; one that would never be disfigured by envy or malice ; never grow black with passion , and oh ! never , never look senseless , idiotic , and drivelling , as another face on which he looked so often did ; but to Harry 's fancy , it was like the sky on a calm summer 's day , always pure and bright , and always the same . It was brighter and happier and better altogether when , in the fresh morning time , the little lady went tripping by on the pavement beneath the window with a small market basket on her arm . Then Harry , clambering to the sill , and leaning out , could see straight into it ; and sometimes it happened that , attracted by that fixed gaze of earnest admiration , that happy face would be turned upward , and break into a beaming smile , as the sunny eyes met the large , blue , mournful orbs looking down upon them . Then there would be a smile on the lip and a song in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Cheering and dear as that face had ever been to him since he had first had the happiness of beholding it , much as he had watched and loved it , it had drawn him with a more potent attraction still and grown doubly dear of late . He had been within the sacred precincts of a true home ; he had breathed that atmosphere of heaven ; he knew how that small , snug , c osey room looked to its inmates now . Yes , he had been there , and his going in chanced in the following manner : This lady , whose cheerful presence was fast becoming a benison to Harry , had , among her other bright possessions , a rosy-cheeked , laughing-eyed , frolicsome mischief ; about Harry 's age , and he had recently come from the country happier , merrier , and fresher than ever , having still , as it were , about him the fragrant breath of the wood-violets , the purity of the unvitiated air , the freedom of the broad , green fields , the fragrant atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so recently in contact . One morning , not long after his coming , the cross girl who put Harry to bed at night , marshalled him and his brother out ( as was her wont in fine weather ) for a dreary promenade , which usually agreeable exercise consisted in the present instance in marching down a dusty stone pavement , by a long , unbroken line of brick buldings , up one street , and down another ( for they always went the same way ) , until they came to a huge , dreary-looking schoolhouse , where they left Charley , and came back more drearily than they went . Well , on this particular morning , Charley had forgotten his slate , and he and the girl returning to search for it left Harry at the gate to await their return . The little urchin , just at that precise moment , spying Harry solus , and impelled by the agreeable prospect of a playfellow , rushed across the street , at the imminent danger of being run over , to scrape acquaintance . Come , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounding up to Harry in all the ardor of a glowing anticipation , eagerly folding one thin hand in both his dimpled ones , and flashing a whole flood of sunlight into the sad young eyes that so timidly met his sunny ones . 666 // Come , and play with me , do ! and we 'll play at horse and build mud houses , and ma 'll give us lots of candy and raisins , and a great big doughnut , ever so big , as big as my hands and your hands , and all , our hands put together . ' I ca n't , ' said Harry , sadly resigning all thought of these rare dainties . Betty 'll scold So ! ' We 'll sit on the bank under the willow at the back of the house , ' pursued the tempter , folding the hand he held still tighter within his own , where she ca n't see us ; and when she comes to take you away , I 'll bite her . ' The youthful pleader had unconsciously used the most potent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green bank under a willow , with such a sunny-faced companion as that , and listen to the birds singing in the branches , and the rustling of the leaves  --  to look up through the green , and see patches of blue sky through breaks in the foliage  --  and then , too , oh , blessed hope ! to see the lady whom he regarded with such enthusiastic and reverent devotion , and to whose love he clung with all the wild tenacity of a desolate heart- to see her smile , and hear her speak  --  to him , perhaps ; all this rose like a glorious vision before Harry , and the possibility of its realization sent the light to his eyes and the color to his face . The contemplated walk in the hot , dusty streets , with the cross Betty ( which tyrannical young female , having brought the children , as it were , under military rule , and being a rigid disciplinarian , seldom failed to punish some fancied dereliction of duty by sundry shakes and pinehes as they went along ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fancy had conjured up , seemed more unendurable than ever . With one quick glance toward the house , to see if that ogre , having in custody that form a little taller and face a little older and sadder than his own , was making her ap pearance , Harry , seized by an irresistible impulse , and still holding fast the chubby hand that had taken his so confidingly , bounded from the pavement , dashed across the road , and both dashed through the garden and into the cosey parlor in a trice , panting like young racehorses . And there , in the brightest spot of the snug , bright room , by that bower of a window , sat the sunny-faced lady whom Harry 's childish imagination had exalted into a superior being . Abashed at having so rudely rushed into that revered presence , Harry stood shyly by the door , trembling with embarrassment , while his more active companion , releasing his hand , bounded across the room , and , clambering up into his mother 's lap and putting his arms around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ear , commenced a whispered explanation . There was something strangely attractive in that mother 's face , as she pushed back the clustering hair , after smilingly listening to the story , and pressed a fervent kiss upon that baby brow- a look which had never been on any face for him , but which he had dreamed of at night , and longed for by day , with a strange , undefined , halfconscious longing . It was as if he had found something he had been blindly searching , something for which the solitary heart had vaguely felt an ever-present need ; and the timid child , forgetting his timidity , his awe of the presence into which he had come-forgetting all but his heart 's great need- - in a burst of pathetic longing , more sorrowful than tears , cried : Give me a kiss , too , just one ! ' He was across the room and in her arms in a moment . Blessings on the true mother 's heart ! it gave not one kiss , but a dozen . Ah ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed close against the breast throbbing with pure maternal sympathy , his own starved heart eagerly drinking from that overflowing fountain , the 667 // word mother rose naturally to his lips t1*en. - Alas for her from whom alone that beating heart , throbbing with a new delight , should have received that revelation ! Alas for the heart thus robbed of its lawful heritage , to whom the highest and holiest of earth 's affection had manifested itself but as a brutish instinct , which , in fits of maudlin tenderness , could fold the little form in a loathsome embrace , and smother the pure breath with drunken kisses ! No other love , however high and pure it may be , can atone to the wronged heart that has been cruelly robbed of this . In this new-found joy all heavy sorrows were forgotten . Pressed close against that sympathetic bosom , he was happy now , happier than he had ever been before ; and when at last she wiped her tears away , and , lifting the hand on which his grateful tears were falling ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tear-wet face to meet her own , that face was so changed by joy that she hardly knew it , and Harry wondered why it was that she laughed and cried together when she looked at it , and kissed him over and over again more times than he could count . Laughing and chatting gayly until she saw her own smiles reflected on the little , sorrowful features , she , with a tender mother 's care , bathed the flushed face , combed out the bright silky hair , smoothed and arranged the rumpled dress , and , taking the small hand , went out to the garden gate to meet the expedition sent in search of Harry . Now this was his red-letter day . Harry was in luck . Therefore it was not one of the many servants of the establishment , or any straggling acquaintance that had joined in the search . Luckily , it was not one of these , or the cross Betty , who first espied Harry and the lady : otherwise he would have been borne away from his friend and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all cries and protestations . It was Harry 's own papa ; and it did not take many words , when the bright-faced lady was the pleader ( backed by that little face , with that strange flush of joy upon it , that spoke more eloquently to the father 's heart than any words could have done ) , to induce that gentleman to allow Harry to remain where he was all day ; likewise to extort a promise that he might come to see the lady whenever and as often as she chose to trouble herself with the care of him : and this being nicely arranged , Harry 's papa went his way and they went theirs . And Harry did that day what is seldom done in this world of disappointment-more than realized his anticipations . He sat on the bank and heard the birds sing ; he played at horse until he was tired ; and though he did not build mud houses , he ate sugar ones , which was , in every respect , a vast improvement on the original design ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose temper was as sunny as his face , never gave him a cross word or look the whole day through . They had supper , when the time came , under the rustling leaves of a huge green tree ; and there were raisins and nuts and candy , cakes grotesquely cut and twisted into every conceivable shape , and every imaginable dainty . All through that memorable day , Harry was the happiest of the happy . Other days succeeded this that were but a thought less bright . A time had come when the rough path seemed smooth to the little pilgrim 's feet , and flowers sprang up by the lonely wayside , and golden sunlight fell through the rifted clouds and crowned the little head with its blessing , and light and warmth crept into the chilled and desolate life , and made existence beautiful : a brief and joyful time , on which was written , as on all bright things of earth , those words of mournfulness unutterable : Passing away ! ' PART 5ECOND . It is that hour of day 's decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // mart is hushed into a lazy hum , when a peaceful , quiet calm breathes through the atmosphcre and settles on the noisy earth , as if all things were hushed into tranquil silence at thought of the coming twilight 's holy hour . The sun 's red , slanting rays fall on the dusty I ) avement in front of that gloomy , stately mansion which Harry calls his home , enter a richly furnished room where the blinds are thrown open and the curtains looped back , and with their fervent glow rest compassionately upon a drooping female figure , upon a bent head bowed in shame , a head still young , whose wealth of rich black tresses passion and remorse have already marked with gray . Sin-stricken , woe-stricken , and remorseful , feeling how inefficient is even her mother 's love , how powerless every earthly consideration to hold her back from ruin ; stretching out palsied hands to Heaven for help ; racked by the fierce fires of repentance , her tortured soul corroded by remorse , she mourns passionately but unavailingly . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every fallen and degraded son of Adam , when the scales are removed from the spiritual eyes , and the sin-stained soul shiveringly beholds the depth to which it has fallen , and shrinks back appalled at the sight ; when the demon has departed for a season , and evil thoughts and evil influences are cast out , and , feeling their power returning with repentance , angels come to minister unto the sorrowing one . Gentle guardians are there , who have watched it all its life through , striven with all the means that lie within the grasp of a spirit 's power to stay it on its downward course and bring the lost soul back . Ah ! Love 's labor lost . ' Ineffectual these oft-repeated efforts may be , ineffectual through all time they doubtless will be ; but who shall say in the land of the undying ' that the work of ministering love shall not continue ? What mau is that , that in an hour like this can look upon his brother , prostrate in spirit , racked with remorse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say anguish like this shall be that soul 's undying portion in the long hereafter ; that God 's justice requires infinite punishment for a finite crime ; that , when freed from its earthly body , the ears of the All-Compassionate shut out that soul 's despairing cry for pardon ? Who shall limit infinite mercy ? Who shall set bounds to Divine compassion , or think that , toiling painfully and slowly up the endless heights of progression , there shall not be a time away onward in the solemn future , hidden in the dim mists of ages yet to come , when that soul shall be cleansed from its pollution , freed from its mourn ing , sin entirely cast out , and God shall be all and in all ? The light breeze , as it sways the loose heavy tresses , wafts to her ear *i strain of distant music . All the drowsy afternoon it has been playing , lost almost entirely at first in the busy hum of the streets and in the long lull of the lazy wind  --  a strain only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear it to her . It has been slowly approaching as the hours creep on , advancing a few steps at a time . Ballads and simple ditties , dances , waltzes , grand old marches ! with that unaccountable attraction for trifles which the mind often experiences in its hours of suffering , mechanically , one after another , she has traced them all . Now the varied tones cease to pervade the atmosphere , and there is a long resting pause . When the music begins again , it is on the pavement , almost beneath the window , and the old musician , perhaps unconsciously wrought upon by the silent influence of the hour , has merged from the gay to the pathetic , and plays only sad little pieces in the minor key . Presently from the multitude of sweet sounds there arises on the air a song lower and sadder than the others  --  a strange , pathetic melody , falling on the ear like a low , plaintive wail , broken by keen throbs of agony : 669 // her whole nature beats in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dreary road which has darkly led her from that time of purity and peace when that song was nightly sung to her ; after so many weary years of sin and suffering , to hear those notes again ! It is but a simple thing which has the power so to move her , a mere nothing ; half dirge , half hymn , familiar to her long-forgotten childhood , once sung by her mother as a cradle song ! With her wretched face buried in her hands , she hears it , and clearly the past rises before her : her childhood in its innocence ; her girlhood in its purity ; her womanhood , her motherhood in its degradation ! All the holier part of what was once herself ; all that was true and noble , womanly and pure , from the deep waters of oblivion to which that damning appetite has consigned them , rise to haunt her now , pale , wan , and spectre-like . Oh ! to sit down , side by side with her former self ; to see herself as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her heart ; to look despairingly up to the height whence she had fallen , so wrecked in moral strength that she had not the power to retrace a single step ! Peace departed , virtue lost , health underinined , affection squandered , ruthlessly murdering the peace of one whose life through all the time of its sad earth-sojourning is linked with hers ; cursing the home she should have blessed and brightened , making of that fair garden , wherein sweet domestic graces should have bloomed and blossomed as the rose , but a desolate and barren waste , knowing that hearts , little hearts , that had drawn their lifebeat from her own , had starved and sickened for the love which is their rightful food ; - with senses bleared and deadened , she had heard them piteously wailing but for a morsel of that bread of life without which even the footsteps of the self-reliant , the strong and brave of heart , faint and falter by the way , and she had cruelly denied them that precious nutriment she had given them life , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life 's duties unfulfilled , life 's high and holy aims trampled under the foot of sensual indulgence , living to blight instead of to bless ! 0 woman , wife , and mother , thy life when lived aright a crucifixion of the flesh , a sublime self-sacrifice-not for thee the pleasures of sense and time , not for thee may peal earth 's songs of triumph ! Fainting oft beneath the burden of the cross , we trace thy way by bloody footprints , suffering as a saint ; - falling from thy estate , how terrible will be thy retribution as a sinner ! Hark ! There is the patter of little feet ascending the staircase , coming down the long upper hall . To the repentant mother 's ears what music so sweet as that I She listens breathlessly . Was it thought of her that had impelled them thither ? Would they approach her room ? Since she had grown more and more repuisive day by day , since those fits of drunken passion had become a thing of fearful frequency , and those little ones had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had come but seldom-never alone ; but they are approaching now , shyly , hesitatingly , as if afraid to come , but still approaching - pausing at the very threshold . The burning tears force their way through the clenched fingers  --  the sound of the little feet has given her power to pray . Though angels fail in the work of redemption , there may yet be power in the little hands to hold her back . She does not rise to open the door , but sits choking down her sobs , and listening to the turning , twisting , shaking of the door knob , to a dozen failures in unskilful attempts to enter , every movement of the little hand sending a strange thrill of mingled pain and pleasure through the overburdened heart . It opens at last , and Harry stands upon the threshold , looking timidly in. 670 // Ah ! no maudlin sorrow , no senseless , idiotic mirth , no disgusting stupor disfigures the face on which he gazes . Its depth of hopeless , despairing tenderness , so eloquently accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightens him by its intensity ; but , in obedience to the motion , he comes forward , half-fearfully proffering the flower he holds in his hand . A flower sent to her by a lady who was so kind , ' he tremblingly explains , one that he loves so dearly ! ' It is the lily , the emblem of purity . She takes it from him , lays it on the table behind her , out of sight , a sullen glow of resentment at the gift mingling with the sorrow of her face as she does so . What mother had fathomed her shameful secret , and dared to send her child to her with a gift like that ? Some one that is fast gaining the place she should have occupied in his heart ! One that is fast winning away from her the love she so much needs to aid her in the desired reformation . She notes how the little face softens and brightens when he speaks of her , and a sharp pang of jealousy shoots through her heart . The fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by kindness , that she has forfeited her child 's respect , and never deserved its love , only increases her resentment and adds poignancy to the pang . She feels the slight form start and shiver with a strange , fearful repulsion as she places it on her lap . Would the strong natural affection nature had implanted there , so cruelly crushed out , now nearly if not quite dead , arise anew to life , and grow stronger than this repulsion ? That is the question to be answered now . Ah ! if there were but a spark remaining , were it only a poor , feeble , smouldering flame , it would have the power , she felt , to light her to higher and better things . With a thrill of pure maternal love , a stranger to her heart , whose holiest impulses , deadened by reckless indulgence , have de generated into instincts , she folds the little form closer to her , in spite of its shuddering , and , looking into the upturned face ( 0 mother , miserably blind ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart so legibly written on every speaking feature . With the sharp arrow of conviction that pierces her soul at the sight , comes a voice appealing to its inmost recesses , a voice speaking those words spoken by the great heart of Divine Compassion , eighteen hundred years ago ; those words of tenderest pleading : Feed my lambs ! ' How had she fed those committed to her charge ? The wan , thin , sorrowful face , the little heart finding no joy in life , grown weary before its time best answer that question . Aided by her aroused spiritual perceptions , she reads now all too truthfully the sad , sad record of the heart-breaking loneliness of the life she has made desolate ; and , pressing the wronged heart close against her own , the keen remorse of her soul bursts forth in a low moan of irrepressible anguish : Oh , my child ! my little , little , little child ! ' Studying the face bent over him as children learn to study the faces of those whom they have reason to fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but sorrow and tenderness in it , he began to fear it less : thankful even for a brief season of kindness , the solitary child laid the pale cheek close against his mother 's , and twined the thin arms about her neck . It was a strange and blissful sensation for that mother to feel them clinging there . In her softened mood it made the tears fall hot and fast , to think how strange it was . What made Harry think of coming to see ma to-day ? ' she said at last , brushing them hurriedly away . A lady gave me that flower , mamma , and told me to bring it to you . ' A pause and a closer pressure-then she questioned nervously : What lady is it , Harry ? Where 671 // does she live ? How came you to know her , darling ? ' Harry hesitated . He noticed the dark shadow that swept across her face at every reference to his new-found friend , and , with a child 's intuitive perception , he saw the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her attention from it to himself , he went back to the beginning , to give her a sort of history of how he came to form the acquaintance . Mamma , ' he said timidly , twining his arms still closer around her neck , and speaking in a slow , hesitating way , as if he feared that this would give her pain also , our house , you know , is a very lonesome place . Oh , so very lonesome ! - just like a day when the sun wo n't shine , and the rain comes dark and slow . Well , ma , it was always bad enough , but when Charley went away to school , and you stayed up here more than ever , and Betty got crosser than ever , you ca n't think h lonesome it was ! Pa used to bring me playthings at first , but I felt so bad I could n't play with them . I felt all the time as if I wanted something , and , ' glancing piteously up into his mother 's face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if I was so hungry here . Well , I used to climb up at the window and watch the people going by , and wonder and wonder what the matter was . ' He waited as if half expecting an answer ; but a stifled sob was the only reply . Looking out the window and seeing other people , I found out after a while that we were different from everybody else . Other mothers who had little boys like me , always took their little boys with thens when they went to walk . All the sunshiny days they went walking up and down-walking up and down ; and the mothers were not cross like Betty , and the little boys were not lonesome like me , but had such red , chubby cheeks , and looked happy most all the time . The first day I found this out , when Betty took me away from the window , and stood me up before the glass to comb my hair , and I looked in and saw what a face I had , I cried and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever their little boys spoke to them , and seemed to love them so much , that I wanted them to love me too ; and I used to throw little things out of the window sometimes , so that they would look up and smile at me . ' Ah ! the young , tender heart , living , as yet , only by the affections , that required such a wealth of love to fill it ! The little outcast heart depending on casual passers by for a stray word or look of comfort , striving to feed itself on such poor , miserable crumbs as these ! It made the mother 's face grow white with anguish to think of that . Well , about just such a time every morning , when Charley had gone to school , andl sat by the window as lonesome as lonesome could be , on the sidewalk under the window there always came a lady who was kinder to me than the other ladies , who always looked up and smiled . Such a beautiful lady , ma , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal more smiling ; you 'd love her if you saw her ; I know you would-you could n't help it . And ma , ' and here Harry 's enthusiasm died out , and his voice took a sadder tone , she 's got a little boy , just about as big as I am , and she always takes him with her when she goes out , just like the other ladies . And  --  and ma - the low voice had a frightened tone in it , as if the little one feared he was venturing too far . Yes , Harry . ' I thought-that-that- ' What , darling ? ' That if you would go out to walk yourself sometimes , and take us with you , Charley and me , that we should n't be so different from everybody else , and it would n't be quite so lonesome here . ' A long pause followed  --  a frightened pause on Harry 's part . Venturing , after a little while , to look into his mother 's face , its sadness , unmixed with // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lady who sent you the flower . She lives in a little white house just across the road . One day , when Betty took inc out for a walk , I ran away and went there ; and I have been there a good many times since . It 's a little house , ma , a very little house . There are no bright pictures or beautiful carpets in it ; but they are never lonesome there . She is as kind to her little boy every day as you are to me now . It 's a long time , ma , since you kissed me and held me on your lap , and acted as if you loved me ! Oh , mamma ! ' He laid the pale cheek , wet with grateful tears , close against her own . Why a' n't you good to me always I I love you now , but I do n't love you always ; I ca n't love you always , ma . That day when you frightened me so , when you pulled my hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the blood ran , I did n't like you for a long time then , you hurt me so . ' The grief of the wretched mother burst forth anew in sobs and tears . Oh , Harry ! oh , my poor , poor child ! iDid ma do that I ' Do n't cry , ma , oh , do n't cry ; I do n't think you meant to do it . There is something that changes you , that makes you cross and strange . And ma  --  the timid voice sank away to a low , frightened whisper , broken and tremulous with tears . Yes , dearest . ' You wo n't be angry , dear mamma ? ' No , love , no . ' He hid his face on her shoulder , sob-bing : It 's something that you drink . They never have it there , in that little house , ' pursued Harry in a voice choked with rushing tears . They never have it anywhere where they are happy . Oh , mamma ! if you 'd only send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you would put it out of sight ; oh , my dear , dear mamma , if you would never look at it , never taste it , never , never drink VOL. v - 45 it any more ! ' In the energy of his supplication he twined the little arms still closer and closer about her neckhis tears fell like rain upon her bosom . That baby face , eloquent with entreaty and wet with tears ! She could not bear to see it . Crimson with shame , she hid her own in her outstretched hands . She never drinks it . I 've watched her ; she drinks coffee sometimes , water sometimes , tea most always . Ma , if you must drink something , why would n't tea do just as well ? ' She folded her arms about the little form , and clasped it to her bosom . Her face was lighted with a high resolve , the heart against which her child 's was pressed was throbbing with a lofty impulse . It would , my darling , it would ; with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy presence , I solemnly promise , if there is any strength in good resolutions , if there is any power of good left within me , if God will not utterly forsake one who has so long forsaken her better nature , never , never , from this time , henceforth and forever , to touch , taste , or look upon the accursed thing . ' That night , at the foot of the tall poplar , the flickering sunlight falling through the leaves on his head , making the brown hair golden where it fell , Harry sat watching the coming of his brother . He had not long to wait ; in a little while the red , slanting rays fell on that other head of darker brown . The well-known form appeared at the gateway , and Harry went bounding down the gravel walk to meet him . Ma wants to see you , ' panted the little brother . She wanted you to come up to her room as soon as ever you got home . She sent me to tell you so . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so flushed and excited , so proud to give it , and the look of joy shining in the pale face was such a stranger to it , that the great brown eyes of the elder brother opened wide in // silent wonder , and the excited Harry had caught him by both hands , and was dragging him by main force toward the house before he had recovered from his astonishment sufficiently to speak . I do n't want to go , ' cried the unwilling Charley , ruefully drawing back . I do n't want to go , Harry . Why does she want to see me ? What makes her want to see me ? I a' n't done nothing to be whipped for ! ' Oh ! it is n't that , ' returned the little fellow eagerly . We a' n't going to be whipped any more , unless we 're real naughty , and then not very hard ; and ma is going to send Betty away , and we a' n't going to be scolded any more ; and she 's going to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other mothers do . Why , ' cried the eager child , all glowing at the delightful prospect , why , Charley , we*re going to be happy now . ' Oh , I do n't believe we are , ' sadly sighed the more experienced Charley , scratching his curls disconsolately , and looking at his brother in a maze of perplexity and doubt . I 've thought we were going to be happy a great many times , but we a' n't been never , and I do n't believe we ever will be . The first thing I remember was being lonesome , and I 've been as lonesome as could be ever since . No , no ; we shall never be happy . Ta' n't no use thinking about being happy , ' and the forlorn child threw himself upon the grass in a hopeless and dejected manner . But they do say , Harry , ' he continued , looking up through the leaves at th' blue vault above him , that there 's a place up yonder somewhere where good people go when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've thought , since I heard about it , that perhaps some people went there without dying . If they do , Harry , and I can only find out the way , I 'd leave this mean old place , and go there straight , this very minute . I 'd like to have you and pa come , Harry ; but ma is always scolding or whipping us for something . I do n't like ma , and I do n't care whether she ever gets there or not . Come to think of it , ' pursued Charley , as a new thought seemed to strike him , I had a good deal rather she would n't come ; for if she did find out the way , and come up there after a while , like as any way she 'd bring a switch with her . ' You should n't talk so about ma , Charley , ' said his meek-eyed brother . She is n't cross always . She has been kind to me to-day , so kind , ' said the little fellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly running down his cheeks , that it makes the tears come to think about it . I was with her a great long while , and she did n't scold or speak cross once . Why , only think , Charley , ' he proceeded , opening his eyes , as if the fact about to be communicated could never be sufficiently wondered at , we were all alone together for ever so long , and she might have got angry and whipped me just as*well as not , and pa would never know anything about it . ' It 's a wonder she did n't , ' scornfully returned his brother ; it would have been such a nice chance . She do n't get such a chance as that every day . There would n't have been any fun in it if she had , though ; for I tell you what it is , ' he continued , looking about on his hands for sundry marks and dents left thereon by the nails of his mother , I tell you what it is , Harry , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . She pounds us more than half the time for just nothing at all , only because she gets mad and likes to do it . To be sure , I get mad myself sometimes , and say ugly words , and ought to be whipped ; but you , you never do anything to be whipped for , and she , ' proceeded the indignant little fellow , with an emphasis of immeasurable scorn on that personal pronoun , she to go to work and pound a little , pale fellow like you ! Why , she ought to be ashamed of herself . I get so mad sometimes when she gets to whipping us , and pa comes to take us away , that // I think if lie would pound her just as hard as she pounds us , and just long enough to let us see how good it feels , I would n't care a bit -- I 'd just like it : but he do n't never ; he only trembles all over and gets very white , sets her down in a chair , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells us stories to stop our crying , and that 's the end of it until next time . ' Poor Harry ! the color had faded from his face , the light from his eyes . That deep shadow of inexpressible mournfulness had again crept into them . Memory of such scenes , as are never garnered up in the breasts of happy childhood , shadowed his face and heart . His short-lived happiness was over . He made no reply to his brother , but sat motionless , gazing at the sky with a searching , yearning , faroff gaze . Looking at the two young faces turned upward , it would have been hard to say which was the saddest . Young as they were , traces of the working of the curse which had blighted their lives , were plainly visible in both . Both were equally pale and thoughtful , both robbed of the brightness and gayety belonging to their years , only varying in expression as they varied in temperament . The look of meek and patient endurance on the face of the younger spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but could never rouse to anger or resentment-of a heart that would break , if must be , but would patiently lie down and die . The scornful defiance flashing ever and anon in the face of the elder brother , the immeasurable bitterness mingling with its sadness , showed a proud and fiery temperament that could be goaded to desperation . But she shall never strike me many times more , ' continued Charley , with suppressed indignation . After a pause , during which , with compressed lip and clouded brow , he had been resentfully dwelling upon the pain and humiliation consequent upon the blows he had received : Never ! never ! for I do n't care if it is wrong , if pa does tell me not to do it , I do n't care if she is my mother ; after I get just a little bigger , when she strikes me , I 'm going to strike back again . ' These vengeful threats exciting no answering comments from his brother , Charley turned to look at him . A strange prophetic chill swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shuddering apprehension . Harry , do n't look that way ; Harry , come back to yourself ! Oh , Harry ! take your eyes from the sky and look at me . You frighten me so ! ' cried Charley , in a voice tremulous with agitation . The consciousness of his surroundings had dawned so slowly on the rapt soul , the patient face had turned toward his brother 's so calmly , he was so meek and quiet , so undemonstrative usually , that he was totally unprepared for the wild burst of passionate weeping with which Harry threw himself upon his neck . Oh ! Charley , Charley , I can not find it , I can not see the land you talk of . I know it must he there , where the sky is clear and the sun is shining ; but I 've been looking , and I ca n't see it anywhere . Oh ! Chancy , where is it ? Where is the place up yonder where they are good and happy ? Show me the way there , show me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' sobbed Harry , coming back to his own hopeless self again ; I want to go somewhere where folks do n't have to be lonesome all the time ; I do n't know what dying is , but if dying will do it , I want dying to take me there . ' He had drawn his brother toward him , wiped his tears away with his own little apron , and soothed him as well as his agitation would permit , striving , amid the tumult of his thoughts , to gather up such meagre scraps of information as he had gleaned upon the subject , and put it into intelligible words , when , from a window almost hidden by the leaves of the tree under which they were sitting , they heard a // voice calling to them , a familiar voice , but with a new tone in it , which quickens their pulse-beat , and makes their hearts throb with a sweet joy . Dimly visible through the foliage , a familiar face is looking down upon them , loving and tender as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the strong instinctive love for her which nature had implanted in their hearts awoke in all its strength . Pride , anger , sorrow , were all alike forgotten . To her loving call there came from eager lips the ready response : Yes , mamma ; we are coming , dear mamma . ' Those who are blessed with golden memories of a happy childhood , perchance but lightly prize Heaven 's brightest , choicest gift . Those who have never felt the hungering and thirsting of a heart deprived of sympathy and kindness , the desolate pining of that state more sorrowful than orphanage , can but feebly , faintly guess how tender tones and soft caresses , loving words and looks , such common blessings as awaken in the happy no thought of gratitude , were treasured up in these lonely licarts as gifts of priceless value , or measure the deep thankfulness which thrilled them as they knelt side by side at their mother 's knee , and said their prayers in the deepening twilight that summer night . They had a table spread before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's room , and , as the light sank into darkness , with an arm thrown around each little form caressingly , and a brown head resting on each shoulder , they sat beside her on the sofa , and listened as she told them , in language suited to their childish comprehension , of the coming joys in store for them , of what a happy home their future home should be , now that she had resolutely parted from the curse that had destroyed their peace , and forever turned her back against it ; - listened as she drew glowing pictures of the walks and rides they would take , of the va ried pleasures they would enjoy together , pleasures it should be her pleasing task to plan . They had nothing to damp their enjoyment , for she had dismissed Betty , and with her own hands undressed and bathed them , and robed them for the night ; and they enjoyed it all , not with the keen zest , the careless hilarity of childhood , but with the subdued and thoughtful gravity seen in beings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sorrows than the joys of life , and who receive happiness , when at rare intervals it comes to them , with a tremulous thankfulness , as if fearful of entertaining so strange a guest ; and when at last it ended , as all happy seasons must , and both tired heads rested on one pillow , Harry whispered to his brother : There is nothing to be sorry for now , Charley . She will never drink that dark stuff any more-I know she never will ; she will never forget the promise she has made . ' Then the drowsy eyes , crc they closed , sought the dim night sky for that star , the brightest in the blue above him , which had revealed itself through his tears , when alone in the darkness he had first learned to pray , and , gazing on it , and on the sky beyond , where a happier home than any earthly one is proffered , murmured to himself ; with a peaceful smile : Oh ! we shall be so happy , so very , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised . Oh , frail and sandy foundation , on which to build bright hopes of earthly happiness ! Only for four brief weeks , one happy month , that solemn promise was faithfully remembered . Of the effort that even this short period of abstinence had cost her , of the burning thirst which tortured her by day and night , the fierce desire that battled with and almost overcame her feeble resolution when the enthusiasm that had at first upheld her died away , of the suffering of those weary // weeks of conflict , only those can tell who , heroes every one , like her , have battled with this fierce spiritual Apoilyon , and who , unlike her , have overcome . Hour by hour the maddening desire of gratification wasted little by little her moral strength . The thirst grew stronger , the will weaker . The thought of the home she had brightened by her self-denial , the heart she had gladdened , the little ones who had drawn their life from hers , whose trust in her was growing stronger day by day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered , and morning dawned and found her faithful , held her back at first ; but gradually this also lost its power . Then that torturing , burning , maddening thirst swept over the doomed soul like a fierce simoom , drying up th' fountains of maternal tenderness , bearing away all sense of duty , all tenderness and sympathy , the blessed hope of heaven itself , in its desolating track . One wretched day , when this thirst was so strong upon her that her priceless soul grew worthless in her eyes , an she would smilingly have bartered it but for a single draught ; one wellremembered , miserable day , when the little faces were raised to hers , and found upon it no trace of motherly affection , only that dark foreboding look , and grew pale with fright when desire had reached that relentless climax which leaves the victim no choice but of madness or gratification , she had fiercely summoned her usual messenger , sent for her usual drink , and sat grimly waiting for it . In vain that trusty messenger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remnant of family honor , the shame of public exposure , boldly setting fear of her aside , earnestly besought her to wrestle with the demon yet a little longer , were it but a single day ; and implored her with tears to remember the little ones on whom this blow would fall so heavily . There was no tone of motherly affection within that raging breast to respond to that appeal . With parched , cracked lips , and burning eyes and bloated face fierce with desire , she had driven her from her presence . Fear lest the lack of this great need would drive her to distraction quite , and some worse evil yet befall them , she had gone her way , weeping as she went . She came back presently . There was enough of that terrible poison in the bottle she brought to make her mistress drunk a score of times . She may get drunk now , dead drunk ; in a little while she may lie upon the floor a senseless , idiotic , disgusting creature . She almost prays it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she angrily calls for , for there is yet a greater evil to be dreaded . The liquor so long untasted , acting upon her naturally high temper , may arouse within her a wild tempest of passion ; in her frenzy she may fall upon those little ones , beat , bruise , maim , murder them perhaps . It is not the first time their lives have been endangered by her violence . To get them from the room without exciting her opposition , so quietly and naturally that it shall hardly attract her observation , is her first care ; hence , under pretence of arranging the window curtain , she says to Charley , who is standing near it : Charley , say yon want some cakes  --  a drink of water-anything that 's down stairs , and follow me out of this room . ' I ca n't go , Maggie , ' returned the child , in the same cautious whisper , glancing toward his mother with his large dark eyes wildly dilated , and his small face bleaehed with fright . Harry wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry shall go , ' energetically repeated the resolute Maggie , putting her head out of the window to say her say . He is not going to stay here to be mauled ! Harry , ' she continued , in the most insinuating tone imaginable , come down stairs with Maggie . There 's a darling . ' // He was leaning out of the window , apparently looking at something in the street below , and did not move as she addressed him . Harry , Harry , ' she called again , in an excited whisper , do you hear me ? quick , child , quick ! ' He turned toward her his face covered with tears . Do n't cry , for heaven 's sake , child ; do n't cry here , ' returned Maggie , with a suppressed groan , or that mother of yours will pounce upon you in spite of me . ' At the mention of that word , what little self-possession he retained gave way , and he sobbed outright . It was a sob so passionate and long suppressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such vehemence , that it shook the little form from head to foot , and sounded through the still room so miserably hopeless , so heart-broken , that it even aroused the stupefied being nodding in her chair , whom he had the misery to call by the name of mother . It awakened within her some vague thought of motherly sympathy ; and , stupidly striving to comprehend what it meant , and idly muttering to her miserable self , she poured out a third glass , held it in her hand as well as she was able , and came tottering forward , swaying to and fro in maudlin efforts to keep her feet . She took up her position directly behind Harry , and looked vacantly out . She was trying to ask what was the matter , with a tongue whose palsied utterance made language incomprehensible , when Harry 's friend , whom he had been watching , and whose figure he had , with love 's delicate discrimination , picked out from a score of similar figures , and known to be hers , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly under the open window , and , startled by that sob and by that drunken voice in answer , looked wonderingly up . Oh , heavens ! she read that fearful secret in one blank , horrified glance . She read it in the despairing hopelessness of the little face turned toward hers-that look so terrible in a face so young . She read it still more clearly in that fiery , bloated , senseless visage looking down upon her with a dull stare , in the swaying form feebly holding the tell-tale glass . She knew now why that delicate child , nursed in the lap of affluence , having all that wealth could purchase , had come so timidly to her lowly dwelling , and earnestly besought her for a single kiss ; what had made the little face sorrowful and wan , and set that seal of suffering upon it . She saw it all , and , under the sudden weight of that astounding revelation , she literally staggered as under the weight of a blow . Looking down through his tear-dimmed eyes at the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took of sympathy or recognition for him-only that blank , amazed , horror-stricken look at that something behind him , a look which embraced every item of the shameful scene , and showed all too clearly how plainly it did so . Then , without a word or glance of kindness , she gathered her veil closely about her pallid visage , and quickly hurried away . Alas for Harry ! he feels that the truth has turned her heart from his , and she has gone forever . The anguish of that thought was too great for suppression , and he stretched forth his hands toward the retreating figure with a forlorn wail of supplication . That look of horror , that low , plaintive , heart-broken cry , like a child forsaken of its mother , had sobered her a little . She had been a proud woman once , and a remnant of the nobler pride which had once uplifted her was still left within her soul . To have eyes from which shone forth the pure , unsullied spirit of womanhood , discover her secret , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rival , whom unseen she hated , womanhood enthroned in excellence ; to see its image in herself fallen and defaced , sunken in degradation ; to know that a few kind and well-bestowed caresses // had won her child 's love from her , that on that strange maternal bosom the little head rested more tranquilly and peacefully than on her own ; to owe her a dot*Ae grudge as discoverer and supplanter-this aroused the smouldering and now perverted pride yet alive within her bosom , and fanned it to a flame . She clinched her hands convulsively , her teeth shut together with a dull , grating sound , the unsteady form swayed to and fro , like a lithe tree shaken in the wind of a coming tempest , and the bloated face , dark with wrath , was terrible to look upon . It was a fearful thing to be alone with that half-drunken creature , and see wave after wave of passion rolling over her tempesttossed soul , lashing it into fury . Maggie felt it to be so now . As a trusty confidant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , had gained an ascendency over her mistress that no other possessed , and wisely exercised this controlling power , she had been with these poor children through many similar scenes , sheltering them under the broad wing of her protection , but she had never beheld the gathering of so dark a storm , never felt the vague , shuddering dread , the chill apprehension which seized on her now . One glance at that terrible being showed her power lost , her protection insufficient , impotent . To stay with them and endeavor to breast the coming storm would be madness-  --  to try to get the children from the room now would be both impolitic and dangerous ; at the least demonstration of the kind that storm would be sure to burst upon them in all its resistless fury , and before its raging power she felt her strength would be utter weakness . She must fly for aid . Perhaps even now some invisible being , conscious of their danger , might be impelling their father to the rescue .. Harry , ' said Maggie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure rocking to and fro in fearful communing with itself , and bending down to whisper a parting injunction as she tied on her bonnet , do n't speak to her , do n't look toward her . Do n't cross her in any way . She 's the devil 's own , now . ' A word , a look , a gesture of entreaty to Charley , placing in dumb show his brother in his charge , and she passed from the room hastily and noiselessly , but not unperceived . As she vanished , an evil smile of triumph at thus being so easily rid of an able antagonist , flashed across the terrible face , giving it almost the look of a demon . In passing out , Maggie has left the door ajar , which perceiving , the wretched woman totters across the room , shuts the door , locks it , throws the key upon the floor , and , tottering back to her seat , again takes a long , deep draught from the glass upon the table . Fixing her fiery eyes full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir 1 ' The tone in which the command is given is cruel , stern , and cold , unsoftened by maternal tenderness , untouched by womanly gentleness , and the bloated face has the same evil look upon it . Harry shrinks back aifrighted . Are you deaf , you adder ? Come here , I say , come here . ' There is a fierceness in the tone now which shows a longer delay will be dangerous ; and so Charley , pale and trembling , comes forth from the corner in which he has been crouching , and taking his smaller brother by the hand , they come forward together . What made you bawl after that woman-that woman in the street ? ' she says , viciously grasping the little shoulder , and giving it a shake . Answer me this minute . Speak , sir , speak ! ' I-I ca n't help loving her , ma , ' falters the poor child deprecatingly , while the blue eyes fill , and the tears fall slowly down his face . There , none of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake . Come up here ; come closer . Here ! 6T9 // Stand back , you , ' pushing Charley from her with a force that makes him stagger .

' He is so faint with fri ' ght that he can hardly find his voice to answer , and the words are almost inarticulate as he falters forth : Sometimes , ma ; sometimes , when you are kind to me . ' You never did ; you know you never did , you little liar , ' shrieks the crazed creature , savagely dealing him a heavy blow which sends him reeling from her . Oh , ma ! Oh , ma ! ' gasps the poor child , crouching down in the extremity of terror as the terrible figure comes flying toward him . Do n't kill me , oh , do n't kill me ; I 'm such a little boy ! ' She pounces upon him like a tigress , lifting the fragile form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor again with all her cruel force . She shakes , she bites him , she rains blows upon the poor , defenceless child , leaving prints of her vicious fingers all over the poor little body wherever she touches the tender skin , marks of her cruel nails on the delicate arms and hands , long , deep scratches from which the blood exudes slowly . One last cruel blow hushes the suppressed cries of pain and terror , the low moans for mercy , and lays the bruised and quivering form senseless at her feet . Then the mad creature , crazed with drink and passion , goes careering up and down the room , snatching from table and bureau the costly trinkets with which they are adorned , and wildly trampling them beneath her feet as she hurries to and fro . She is so terrible to look upon , with that scarlet , bloated face , distorted by passion , and the long , thick hair unbound hanging wildly about it , and that baleful light in her bloodshot eyes , so terrible in the frenzied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has crept to the side of his prostrate brother , and is tenderly holding the unconscious head , has no power to cry or move , but sits half frozen with horror , with his great brown eyes wildly dilated , fixed in a species of fascination upon the strange motions ofb that dreadful figure , and merely in obedience to the instinct of self-preservation endeavors to shield himself and his insensible charge from the heavy blows aimed at them as she comes flying past . A few brief moments pass * this way , moments which to that poor child , alone with that wild being , seem dreadful hours of torturing length . Then the blessed sounds of coming relief fall on his ear , footsteps are approaching , a man 's firm , hurried tread and woman 's lighter but no less rapid step are heard through the hall below , up the staircase-on , on they come , crossing the long upper hall , pausing at the threshold . Then they try the door ; swift , crushing blows are rained upon it , the door is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , pa ! pa !

One hasty glance around the room strewn with franments of costly toys , one look at the maniacal form in the centre with wildly dishevelled hair , and leering , vacant face , then the anguished eyes fall on that for which they are searching , see the outstretched arms of the little figure cowering in a corner half hid by the window curtain , see that other figure lying at its feet , so livid and motionless , so breathless , with the deathly face upturned , and the long brown lashes , still wet with tears , resting on the marble cheeks . 0 God ! too late ! too late !

Not dead ! oh , thauk God ! not dead . ' There is a slight throbbing motion of the heart , a faint , scarcely perceptible pulsation at the wrist . They raise the senseless form from off the floor . Up to his room they bear him ; softly on his little bed they lay him-that little bed from which he is never more to rise . Gentle footsteps glide noiselessly about the room , loving eyes are bent above him , and tears fall upon the upturned face . Long days go and come , fragraiit sunny days , bright with the bloom of summer , each day one less of earth one nearer heaven . The loving watchers know it , and ever and anon there are sounds of smothered weeping there .

Henceforth the beauty and the light of this transitory sphere seem wan and cold , and the fading things of earth grow worthless in the dying eyes , and the tranced soul longs to be gone , yet bides its time with patient sweetness . Patient agiid all his pain , no groan escapes the parched lips , no complaining murmur . Bearing all his sufferings with meek endurance , quiet and very thoughtful he lies upon his little bed , smiling placidly upon those about him-grateful , very grateful for their love and care ; watching with musing eyes the long hours through the changes of the day on the sky as seen from his window-gray dawn melting into morning , morning into mellow day , day , with its varied changes , sinking into night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazes , the home for which he longs , baptizes him with its light beforetime . On the sinless brow the seal of a perfect peace is set , and the air about the child grows holy . A hush falls on the room mysterious and solemn , and they know that whiterobed immortals are treading earthly courts , mingling in earthly company ; for he murmurs in his dreams of radiant faces that bend above him ; and the wan face , as they watch it in its slumbers , grows bright with the look of heaven . A few more hours of earth , a little longer tarrying of the immortal with the mortal part where it has lived and loved , suffered and rejoiced ; a few more moans of pain , and the blue eyes open and look upon the day whose silent light will dawn upon us all . They had not thought the end so near at hand ; and , worn out with grief and watching , the father and his faithful nurses had one by one retired to rest , leaving Charley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch his brother 's fitful slumbers . Since that fatal day , a dread and horror of his mother had seized upon the child . Though surrounded by those he loved , her near approach would cause strong nervous chills , and her kiss or touch would throw him into frightful spasms , from which they could with difficulty recover him ; hence , by the doctor 's orders , she was forbidden the room , and it was only when utter exhaustion had steeped his refined spiritual sense into perfect oblivion of surrounding objects , that she was permitted to enter there and gaze for a little on the wan features of her sleeping child . That day , knowing his time on earth was short , and possessed by a restless and nucontrollable desire to be near him , even though she could not look upon his face , into the room of her dying boy* lie**had stolen like a culprit , and noisulessly shrank into the farthest corner of ' the room , screened from his 681 // observation by the heavy window-curtain and the high head-board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , but she , in terms which would have moved the coldest heart to pity , implored them with tears to allow her to remain ; and they , seeing that the demon had departed from her for a season , and compassionating the forlorn being , had gone away and left her there . She sits motionless in the silent room , her despairing eyes fixed on the serene heaven to which her darling will soon be gone , and from which the stern justice of an accusing conscience tells her she may be forever excluded . And oh ! if this be truth , if in the world beyond there is no hope for sinful souls that have gone astray in this , and this parting is eternal , then , oh then , through the long , dark ages of suffering which may be her future portion , never to look upon her darling more , never more to kiss the sweet lips that have called her mother , never more to look upon him here till the silken lashes droop toward the marble cheek and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in for a last look ere the little face is shut out from mortal gaze forever ! - oh ! the unutterable anguish of that thought , and the remorse which mingles with it ! Not for that last dreadful act , for she never knew that she had killed him . No clear remembrance of that day lives within to curse her memory , but she knows that a strange and unaccountable dread of her has seized upon the child , that she is banished from his d*-ing presence ; and an undefined and vague remembrance , a misty horror , has fallen on her life , rests on her like an incubus , pursues her in a thousand phantom shapes through the long , dark watches of the terror-laden night , and through burdened days of ceaseless suffering . She knows , for they have told her , that when his consciousness returned , his first cry had been for the mother of his heart ; that she had left everything and come to him ; that she had taken her place beside his bed , a dearer place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hands like those chill , magnetic ones could soothe him in his pain , or charm him to his fitful slumbers ; that on no bosom could the throbbing head rest so tranquilly as on her own . What the mother 's heart suffered in that knowledge when her better nature prevailed , only the Being knows Who framed it . The hours of the long day wore heavily on . The sun , that had paused awhile in midheaven , was now sinking slowly toward the west . Yet , unmindful of food or rest , seated in the same corner into which she had shrunk on entering the room , ever and anon rocking herself to and fro , or wringing her hands in silent agony , there sits the wretched mother , hidden watcher by the bedside of her dying boy . The room has been chosen for its retired situation , and is removed from the noise of household occupations ; and the bustle of the crowded street , even in its busiest hours , falls on the ear in a distant hum . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his slumbers , asked to be moved nearer the front of the bed , that they may be very near each other while he sleeps again , and , when that was done , has smiled lovingly upon the little , sorrowful watcher , and , with his wasted hand tightly clasped in his , has fallen into sounder slumbers . In the deathlike stillness which has fallen on the room , she can hear his breathing , and has ventured twice or thrice , while he slept thus , to steal softly to the bedside and look upon his face ; but as at each *uccessive attempt he has seemed almost immediately to feel the dreaded atmosphere , and his slumbers have become broken and uneasy . with a heavy heart she has crept silently back again . Charley has waited until the thin hand of the sick child has relaxed its clasp on his own , then , moved by a loving impulse , noiselessly busies himself in removing a littered mass of 682 // vials , cups , and glasses , which have accumulated on the stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and taxes his childish ingenuity in arranging thereon , in the prettiest possible form , a multitude of toys and trinkets , gifts sent by the servants of the house to his brother , putting the new ones in front , so that his eye may fall on them first when he wakes again . This done , he creeps back to his seat by the bedside , and silently watches his slumbers as before . A ray of sunlight , bright and warm , creeps through the lattice and falls on the veined lids ; the eyes open , and instinctively moving from the too dazzling light , rest placidly on a fragment of blue sky just visible through the half-closed window . With eyes fixed intently on that hazy distance , moment after moment , silent and motionless he lies , and the blue orbs grow lustrous as he gazes with the mystic beauty of eyes whose inner vision rests on unutterable things , and gradually there comes upon the little face the look that never comes on any face but once . Oh , mystic change ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the bedside , face to face with its mysterious presence for the first time , ignorant of its processes , feels a dread , half-defined idea of what it may be , and , with a piteous effort to recall his dying brother back to his old look and seeming , tremulously falters : See all the nice things they 've sent you , Harry , all the pretty toys you 've got ! Here they are , spread out upon the table . Look , brother , look ! ' The eyes are bright and clear , the shadow of death has not yet dimmed their light . They turn slowly , very slowly , and , just glancing at the toystrewn table , rest upon his brother 's face . Oh ! what is that look within them that chills the warm life-current , and makes him cold and shivering in the heat of that summer day , as the sick child feebly says : You may have them all , cdl , Charley ; I sha' n't never want them any more . ' You 've hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young voice in reply , bravely trying to continue the subject . You do n't know how handsome they are . The nicest ones , the very nicest ones Betty bought you ! Poor Betty ! she has done nothing but cry since you ye been sick-cry , and buy you presents . She says when you get well , Harry- ' and here the brave little voice , that has been tremulous and tearladen all along , breaks down entirely , and he puts up his hand to check the tears that are running down his face . There are no tears in those other eyes looking into his ; the mists of death are gathering within them . He can not see the tear-wet face so plainly now , but he feebly strokes the hand that lies against his own , and says , in a weaker voice , pausing now and then for breath : Poor brother , dear brother ! Do n't cry , Charley , do n't cry ! You must tell Betty not to cry . Poor Betty ! I have n't seen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the faint voice , forgetful of its weakness , grows stronger for a moment , and dwells on that name with measureless compassion- poor , poor , poor mamma ! I do n't feel afraid of ma any more , and I want to see her . i no so much want to see her ! Where is ma. , Charley l ' There is a movement in the lower part of the room , and a bent form comes tottering forward , with hair hanging wildly about a haggard , despairing , xvoeworn face . Her hands are outstretched in piteous supplication . Here Jam , ' a voice choked with sobs makes answer . Here 's your poor , miserable , guilty mother , Harry . 0 Harry ! my sins havq barred me out from the heaven you are entering ; say you forgive me before we part forever . Oh ! my darling , it is the last time I shall ever ask it ; give me one kiss before you go ! ' He smiled as only the dying can smile , and stretched out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgives ! ' shrieked the half-demented creature . 0 God ! most merciful ! // Thou hast not quite forsaken me ! ' and with a step forward , and a gesture of embrace , the hapless being falls heavily upon the floor . Raise me up , raise me up , ' pleads the sick child , after partially recovering from the shock the fall had given him ; and , as he gazes upon the prostrate form , the white , haggard , insensible features , an angel 's pity and compassion shine in the dying face . Oh , I ca n't kiss her , Charley . Tell poor mamma I could n't kiss her , ' he faintly moans . Then the fitful strength gives way again , and the tired head droops wearily on his brother 's shoulder . The chilled form creeps closer to a warm embrace . A little while they hold each other thus-these little ones , brothers by the ties of blood , bound nearer to each other than any tie of blood can bind , by the sacred bond of suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its hold , and falls with a dull , lifeless sound back upon the pillow . The little form grows colder , colder yet . He has no power to lay it down , no power to cry for help , but sits holding it , half paralyzed , as he hears them rushing up the stairs , urged wildly on by the dreadful fear that they have come too late . There is a piteous supplication in the large , dilated eyes , a mute prayer for help in the white face he turns upon them as they enter . To the hurried questions which come pouring forth , the bleached , white lips make answer : He got cold , and went to sleep again ; and he has been getting colder ever since . ' Then the father , stooping , looks into the little face lying on Charley 's shoulder , and , staggering back as if a blow had struck him , cries out : Dead ! ' and the friend that Harry had loved so well raises the curly head and lays it back upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes for him , for she knows the little , weary heart is resting now on the great heart of Infinite Love - that he is gone to One who , with outstretched arms , stood ready to receire him- One who said long ago : Suffer little children to come unto Me !
