ABRAHAM LINCOLN 'S PLACE IN HISTORY . To " speak well of the dead , " is a maxim as hoar with age as the Pythagoric symbols . Yes , let us speak well of the dead ; especially of one Judas Iscariot , or Nero , or Tiberius , or Caligula , or Domitian , or Aristodemus . Of course , " speak well of the dead , " whatever the demands of truth and just history may be to the contrary . Such is the senseless maxim of ages , which has been repeated from generation to generation , wth a parrot-like oblivion of its import . Rather let us say , speak justly and truly of the dead and living . That is a better maxim than the other , which has come down to us over the dust and gloom of a hundred generations of stupidity . The one requires us to lie , because a man is dead ; the other commands us to speak the truth , whether of the living or the dead . What a divine command is that ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in undertaking to fix Mr. Lincoln 's place in history . As we are one day to be judged , we seek no unjust judgment of this man . We desire neither to hide his merits , nor to magnify his faults . His account has been rendered to Heaven ; he is no longer amenable to the judgments of earth . But his place in history has yet to be determined . When the smoke and bombast of the scenes through which he passed are all blown away , history will hold him up , in his own bones and fibres , so that the praise of friends or the censure of enemies will little avail . History will weigh him inexorably . The steelyards of time are true . The verdict of history is made up from actual weight of character . Froth and fustian , and bombast , and the lies of partisan favorites , weigh nothing in the balances of history . " We , " said Mr. Lincoln , in one of his messages or proclamations , " can not escape history . " Fearful truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusions of the yesterdays . What is all history but the thoughts and deeds of men , piled up one upon another ? What are civil polities , or the institutions of States , but the passions and whims and solid thoughts of peoples embodied and fixed in government and law ? Civil institutions are outgrowths from the character of peoples , rMher than peoples the production of civil institutions . States grow out of men in a far wider sense than men grow out of States . An intelligent , brave and generous people naturally give birth to free , noble and just institutions and laws . On the contrary , a narrow , bigoted , censorious and intolerant people , as naturally give birth to despotisms and oppressions as the cobra does to broods of poisonous reptiles . The noble and free institutions established by our forefathers were born of the brain and heart of some of the noblest characters of all history of the Washingtons , the Jeffersons , the Henrys , the Lees , // the Madisons , the iRandolphs , whose memory will reflect glory upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If these institutions are overthrown , and a reign of intolerance and oppression takes their place , it will come to pass because of a radical and fatal change in the character of the people . A brave and generous people will not long suffer oppression of any description to survive in their midst . If we could conceive the present population of the United States swept away , and the country instantly repeopled by such a population as that which established our institutions , how long could such a body as our present Congress sit in their seats with heads on their shoulders ? If there were a Patrick Henry , or even an old John Adams , left in our country , with a general public virtue among the people , what would be the sudden fate of such a Rump ? But out of that old population of the United States such a Congress could never come into existence . We can no more conceive of such a Congress springing from an intel*igent and generous people , than we can of a full-blooded negro being born of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present Congress and that of 1787 , is precisely the difference between the character of such men as *Tashington , Jefferson , or Hancock , and L:ncoln , Sumner , or Thaddeus Stevens . The kind of history which Mr. Lincoln and his friends have been making seems designed for an immemorial contrast to that made by the founders of our government . If the names of Washington and Jefferson are connected with the rise of liberty on this Continent , those of Lincoln and Steven3 are identified with its decline . If the former have passed into history as the resistants of the taxation of two or three millions of men without representation and their government without consent , the latter must go down yoked with a scheme to tax and govern six or eight millions without representation or consent . In the steelyards of history the crime of taxing without representation and governing without consent , weighs just as heavily in 1866 as it did . in 1776 . If the names of Lord North and George the Third are made forever odious in American history , by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the consent of the governed , what will be the place of Mr. Lincoln and his supporters in that same history ? Did Mr. Lincoln and his supporters entrench themselves behind the charge of " rebellion ? " So did Lord North and George III . do the same . Did Lincoln and his friends justify the horrors of savage warfare on the general plea of fighting and punishing traitors and rebels ? So did Lord North and the besotted George do the same . Did Lincoln and his Congress proclaim Davis and Lee to be rebels and traitors ? So did North and King George proclaim Washington and Hancock rebels and traitors . Were the whole southern people rebels and traitors in the delirious diction of Mr. Lincoln and his Congress ? So were the whole American people in the insolent language of Lord North and King George . All rebels and traitors ! All people longing for the sacred right of self-government , were ever // 209 rebels and traitors in the eyes of despots and tyrants , who wish to govern them without their consent . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real rebels are the governments which seek to govern the people against their Consent . Eight millions of southern people could no more be guilty of rebellion in 1861 than three millions of Americans could be guilty in 1776 . In both instances it was the blind and bloated idiot of government rebelling against the rights and liberty of the people . And that will be the final verdict of history . When all the froth and rubbish , and idiot slang , and mountains of lies , of the present hour are swept away , by the inexorable hand of time , that solid and eternal truth will stand alone as the real monument which Mr. Lincoln has raised to his own memory . The monument of stone which the negroes of the country propose to raise to him , will crumble sooner than this record of shame shall fade from the pages of history . But it would not be entirely just to regard Mr. Lincoln as the architect of the wrong and ruin which have fallen upon our country . He was not the architect , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a plotter and conspirator , but rather that of a tool of the plots and conspiracies which were hatched by deeper and more malignant minds . He was not naturally so abundant in vice as he was wanting in virtue . He was too jocose a man to be a deep plotter . Too fond of a loud laugh , over jests and stories , to harbor either persistent or consistent revenge . His nature was sandy and unstable . The things he condemned yesterday , he did to-day . Principles which he had held up before him all his life , he threw behind him , even regardless of his solemn oath of office , after he became President . In the first elements of greatness , therefore , he was sadly wanting . He had not that sterling integrity which is the basis of firmness and stability . To say that he had , would be to make him the commonest cheat and falsifier that ever disgraced a public station . We are not disposed to fling such a charge upon him , but to attribute his innumerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the absence of certain elements of character , rather than to an original and settled proclivity to falsehood and deception . He did by persuasion what he had repeatedly declared he had no right to do , and never would do . For instance , let us refer to the following passage in his first inaugural address : " I declare that I have no purpose , directly or indirectly , to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists . I believe I have no lawful right to do so , and I have no inclination to do so . * * * * The right of each State to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively , is essential to the balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depended . " Then , after the defeat at Bulillun , Congress passed the following resolution , which was sigued by Mr. Lincoln as President : . " Resolved , That this war is not waged upon our part with any purpose of overthrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution , and to preserve the Union , with all the dignity , equality , and // rights of the several States unimpaired ; that as soon as these objects are accomplished , the war ought to cease . " Again , Mr. Seward , as Lincoln 's Secretary of State , in his instructions to Mr. Dayton , Minister to France , says : " The condition of slavery in the several States will remain just the same , whether it ( the rebellion ) succeed or fail . There is not even a pretext for the complaint that the disaffected States are to be conquered by the United States , if the revolution fail ; for the rights of the States , and the condition of every human being in them , will remain subject to exactly the same laws and form of administration , whether the revolution shall succeed or whether it shall fail . In the one case the States would be federally connected with the new Confederacy ; in the other , they would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but their Constitutions and laws , customs , habits , and institutions in either case will remain the same . " It is hardly necessary to add to this incontestable statement the further fact that the new President , as well as the citizens through whose suffrage he has come into the administration , has always repudiated all designs whatever and wherever imputed to him and them of disturbing the system of slavery as it is existing under the Constitution and laws . The case , however , would not be fully presented if I were to omit to say that any such effort on his part would be unconstitutional . " Now , after all this , in violation of his own pledges , of his repeatedly declared understanding of his constitutional powers , and of his oath of office , he issued a proclamation " abolishing slavery , " and took other measures for the complete overthrow of the organic laws of a portion of the States . But it is due to him to say that the Emancipation Proclamation was issued against his own convictions . When advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh , that " it would be like the Pope 's bull against the comet . " But the party whose tool he was could not be put off with a laugh . Sumner declared to the President , in the presence of General Shields , that " If the obect of the war is not to make an end of slavery , then there is no object worthy of the great expenditure of life and treasure , and I will go for stopping supplies where we are , and ending the whole matter . " Thus the Abolition keepers of Lincoln were determined and inexorable , and he soon yielded , and issued his " bull against the comet , " as he called it himself . He knew that , constitutionally considered , or regarded in the light of his own repeated declarations , it was of no more significance than the Pope 's bull against the comet . He said so . It was not really his proclamation ; it was Sumner 's . It was issued under a threat that Congress would cut off the supplies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not . Now we see that he weakly yielded to the revolutionary designs of the Mongrels , against his own convictions of right , or he was , through all , the most designing hypocrite and falsifier whom the world ever saw . We do not charge him with that depth of character . He was a laugher or a joker , and when we have said that , we have acquitted him of any depth of plot or purpose . Even when the " Peace Congress " was in Session *fl Washington , it took the utmost vigilance of a Committee of Malignants to keep him from advising measures which would save the country from war . The night after there had been an informal ballot in that Congress which disclosed // the fact that there was , at least , a majority of three against all measures looking to peace , Governor Hicks , of Maryland , in company with a distinguished gentleman from that State , called on the Maryland delegation , and found several of them in tears . When Governor Hicks inquired the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace were lost unless he could persuade Mr. Lincoln to advise his friends to a 1 - ss inexorable temper . This patriotic mission Governor Hicks undertook . He called at once on Mr. Lincoln , and laid the whole case before him , declaring that it was believed that a word from him would control at least twenty votes in the Peace Congress , and thus save our country from the horrors of war . After some reflection , Mr. Lincoln gave the Governor grounds for hope that he would use his influence for this patriotic purpose , and asked him to return in a few hours , when he would give him a definite answer . And before Governor Hicks left the room , Mr. Lincoln sent a young man to find Mr. Horace Greeley , who had a room in the same hotel , for the purpose , as the Governor supposed , of consulting him on the subject . There is little doubt that Mr. Lincoln was personally inclined to advise a conciliatory course , which would insure peace to the country on conditions which would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! when Governor Hicks returned , Mr. Lincoln informed him that he had " made up his mind not to interfere in the matter . " Had Mr. Lincoln been a man of firmness and self-reliance ; in a word , of character , the Abolition conspirators could never have dragged him into the bloody vortex of war . The Union would have been preserved on precisely the same foundations where it was placed by Washington and our forefathers . The South demanded no more , and no just-minded man in the North wished them to take less . " While the southern members of that " Peace Congress " were in tears at the thought of the fratricidal conflict , the Abolitionists of the North were impudent , defiant , and merciless in their unjust demands . They left a brave and honorable people no alternative but to surrender their manhood , or take up arms to defend their sacred rights as best they could . This fact was fully comprehended by Mr. Lincoln ; and , while his first impulses were evidently inclined to peace , he became the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offended the eye of Heaven . He was in the hands of a party whose speakers declared that , " without a little blood-letting , the Union is not worth a curse . " He took counsel of a man who had published to the world that the flag of our country was " a flaunting lie . " Among his advisers were the men who had publicly burned the Constitution of the United States , on the Fourth of July , in Boston . The Senator who , of all others , seemed to influence him most , was one who confessed , in his seat in the Senate chamber , that he took the oath to support the Constitution of the United States " with certain mental reservations . " Another , who was ever welcomed to his presence , publicly boasted , in a lecture in the Smithsonian Institute , that he " had labored nineteen years to take sixteen // States out of this Union . " Such were the men to whom Mr. Lincoln lent his ear . He became " their " tooL The head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guillotine as he pleased , more with the consent of the President than by his direCtion . Many things of an infamous character were done without his knowledge , and afterward were approved by him with an apparent hesitation . Mr. Seward 's " little bell , " that rung hundreds of peaceable and lawabiding citizens into d angeons , and Stanton 's telegraphic dispatches , that dragged innocent people out of their beds at midnight , worked incessantly and remorselessly , and afterwards demanded and received the Presidential sanction . We do not believe that such enormities entered into any portion of Mr. Lincoln 's original plans . Indeed it is doubtful if he ever had any plans . He drifted . All the fair pledges which he made at the start-every one of which were disregarded-were they all only meant for lies and cheats ? No ! they had in them neither reflection nor intelligent purpose . They were simply momentary impulses , as accidental and as little studied as the grim and homely laughter at his own jokes and stories . There was in him a horrible simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a cold and cruel conscience . The mind of the man was painted in his terribly ugly face . It was the face of a satyr rather than of a man . His whole body was shapeless , and distorted with supernatural ugliness . It seemed to be laying about loose ; and in that it was only a too faithful index of his mind . He was never , at any period of his life , a leader , but was always an instrument . He had never worked himself into any prominence , not even into a respectable notoriety , before his nomination for the Presidency . The sole ground of his availability for that nomination was , that he was unknown . Looking to the man 's history , or rather to his sad lack of history , and looking to the man himself , it will puzzle the historian to account for the part he played in one of the wildest dramas of all human ages . What other people ever exercised a passion for an adventurer so forbidding in external appearance , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads , and seemed to obey him with entire self-abnegation ? History will record the startling fact that under his administration more than ten thousand peaceable civilians were incarcerated in bastiles , without any form whatever of law , and that , too , in a country whose Constitution declares that " No person shall be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ! " What other people , on the face of the globe , ever submitted to such tyranny ? Did Rome , at ils most enslaved period ? No . But the tyrants of Rome had something in them by which the historian can account for their ascendancy over the people . Tiberius possessed high and imposing qualities . He had distinguished himself by brilliant deeds in arms , and by do - quence in the forum . Caligula was a C*esar , and the only surviving son of that Germanicus whose images were adored by the Roman people , and he was the foster-child of those victorious legions who won glory // 213 even beyond the Rhine . Claudius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed some of the most magnificent public works in the capital of the world . Nero was the last offshoot of the great family of the Catsars , and he had in his youth attracted all hearts by his munificence , and by the fascinating beauty of his person . And , in later days , iRienzi *ud Masaniello possessed qualities suited to the genius of the Italians . Beaufort had gifts to carry with him the vile populace of Paris . As a mob orator , he was without a rival in his country . Mirabean had genius which appealed to the passions of the middle ranks . Danton had intellect , and a terrible eloquence , wherewith to fanaticise the rabble . Robespierre had letters , and a reputation won in the defense of popular rights . But what had Abraham Lincoln , the head of the terrible revolution in America ? Nothing ! Without culture , without refinement , without a single qualification which ever sustained tyrants in their place before , he wielded a despotism over the American people such as was never put upon a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morehead called upon him on the gravest State affairs , he sat in the middle of his parlor , with one shoe off , playing with his toes , while conversing with one of the most refined and scrupulous gentlemen in our country . He was what the French call un homme maussade . On the battle-field , where the fresh blood of thousands of his countrymen was soaking the ground , he called for the singing of a ribald song . The gravest matters of State were invariably illustrated by him with vulgar anecdotes and gibes . When he was a member of Congress , he treated the country , in a debate of the most solemn nature , to such words as these : " By the way , Mr. Speaker , did you know that I am a military hero ? Yes , sir , in the days of the Black Hawk war , I fought , bled , and came away . If General Cass went before me in picking whortleberries , I guess I surpassed him in charges upon the wild onions . " Mr. Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cook , which is probably the explanation of his reference to his charges upon " the wild onions . " But what a man to fill the place he did ! What a nut for historians to crack , to get at the meat of him ! But the meat must not be sought in the man himself , but rather in the men whose instrument he was . He neither gave birth to , nor guided the political storm on which he rode . What was done in his name had no connection with any genius within him . He once said to a friend : " Sir , I am not sure but that , of all men , I have the least influence with my own administration . " He was himself the birth and the slave of a revolution which he had no hand in producing . In this respect Mr. Lincoln was like Robespierre ; for Robespierre was not the author of the revolution in which he bore so red a hand . That revolution was bagan before his day . It sprung from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , and represented the opinions of the Contract Social of Jean Jacques Rousseau , and the deism of the Savoyard Vicar 's Confession of Faith . Robespierre was driven by the breath of this mighty , this terrible faction , to commit the excesses which // made his name a horror in all the world . While this faction was cutting the throat of France in his name , they deified him as another Cato , and called him a second Aristides . It was really praise of themselves , and a cunning device to render their own terrible principles popular , by glorifying their instrument . What a likeness in all this to the career of Abraham Lincoln ! The terrible insurrection against law and civilization of which he was made the head , began long before his appearance upon the stage . It was commenced by those Constitution burners who , twenty-five years before , denounced the llJnion as a " covenant with death , " and the Government as " an agreement with hell . " While using him to strike down the Constitution , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held him up as the saviour of his country . But in all such laudation , the sole purpose was to render popular the principles of the negro revolution . The praise of Lincoln was only meant for praise of the principles of such men as Garrison , Phillips , and Sumner . Every word of praise bestowed upon Mr. Lincoln was , when sifted to the bottom , simply praise of these men and their principles . Mr. Lincoln was , in his official career , only the embodiment of the souls of Garrison and Sumner , and Wade , and Thaddeus Stevens . Whatever the place of these characters may be in history , Mr. Lincoln 's name will be with them-not as a fellow-plotter , but as their tool . If it can be proved that at sundry times he uttered a hundred things : n opposition to the principles of these conspirators , his acts at last were all brought to square with ' their designs . We give as an instance his remarks to the Hon. Mr. Mallory , made in the presence of Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as I have anything to do with it , is carried on on the idea that there is a Union sentiment in those States , which , set free from the control now held over it by the presence of the Confederate or rebel power , will be sufficient to replace those States in the Union . If I am mistaken in this , if there is no such sentiment there , if the people of those States are determined with unanimity , or with a feeling approaching unanimity , that their States shall not be members of this Confederacy , it is beyond the power of the people of the other States to force them to remain in the Union ; and , " said he , " in that contingency-in the contingency that there is not that sentiment there-THIS WAR IS NOT ONLY AN ERROR , IT IS A CRIME . " Upon the very heel of this avowal , Mr. Lincoln had indubitable proofs that the whole southern people , with hardly a single honorable exception , were profoundly and sincerely in earnest in their desire for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal more unanimous than the people of this country were when our fathers struck for separation from the Government of England . Search through the annals of all historic time , and nowhere can be found an instance in which a people were more sincere and more united in any purpose than the southern people were in this wish for separation . By his own avowal , therefore , his further prosecution of the war was " not only an error , but a crime . " Such were the materials of his conscience , that he found it easier to commit " a crime " than to resist the pressure of his masters . He knew that what he was doing was " a crime ! " His own // words will stand as everlasting proof of that . And he must take his place in history , as none the less a criminal , because he was the tool rather than the plotter of the wrong . We have shown that on the 4th of March , 1861 , he proclaimed that he had " no lawful right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . " In July of the same year he signed the Congressional resolution , that " the war is waged to preserve the rights and equality of the States unimpaired . " In his Inaugural Address he affirmed that " the endurance of our political fabric depends upon the right of each State to control its domestic institutions . " By " endurance , " he meant continuance . He knew that the government established by our fathers could not last , except upon this basis of State supremacy , or sovereignty , over all its domestic institutions . He said so ; but how quickly did he obey the mandates of his seditious party , and prosecute relentless war upon that very principle , in the absence of which he declared our " political fabric can not endure . " His proclamation , soon afterwards , was a simple declaration that he would use the army and the navy to prevent the " endurance of our political fabric . " In July of 1864 , he published a proclamation declaring that he would listen to no terms of peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the States , of that principle which in 1861 he declared indispensable to the " endurance of our political fabric . " Those contradictions are proofs that Abraham Lincoln , as an individual , speaking of his own ideas of what was right and proper , and Abraham Lincoln as the tool of a revolutionary faction , were two very different persons . We have below arranged the language of Lincoln , as himself , and Lincoln , as the tool of a party , in a way to present a picture of these different modes of his character : THE WORDS OF MR . LIN . COLN , AS DICTATED BY HIS OWN IDEAS OF RIGHT . " I have no purpose , directly or Indirectly , to interfere with the irish . tution of slavery where it exists . I believe I have no laWful right to do so , and have no intentiori to do sQ . " - ( Mr . Lincoln 's Inaugural , March 4 , 1861 .

" - ( Proclamation , July 13 , 1864. // Now we see that the premises in Mr. Lincoln 's own mind , at all times , were , that he had not , under any circumstance , the least jurisdiction over the domestic affairs of the States , or over " slavery .

" He was not , therefore , in any just sense , the President of a people , but he was merely the tool of a party . He not only grossly and impiously perjured his oath of office , but he forswore himself , arrayed himself against himself , was false to his own judgment , and to his own conscience , such as he had , to make himself the slave of his party . To serve his party , he inaugurated a civil war , when it could have been avoided , on the precise basis of the Union as it was established by our fathers . To serve his party , he violated nearly every article of the Constitution . To serve his party , he disregarded the common law of nations . To serve his party , he suspended the immemorially sacred writ of Habeas Corpus . To serve his party , he made the military superior to the civil authorities . To serve his party , he banished American citizens from their country-not , as he confessed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may probably do . " To serve his party , he incarcerated honorable men in loathsome dungeons , not only for an expression of opinion , but for suspected " sympathies . " To serve his party , he suppressed newspapers , and permitted Democratic printing offices to be mobbed and pillaged . To serve his party , he conducted a war violative of all the laws of civilization . If it is asked how a man could commit such acts , especially in violation of all his own avowed ideas of right and law , we can only say , look into that face of his , and see if there is shining there the remotest line of character , which can sustain the weight of conscience . You see a man who was the slave of a terrible party . And you see precisely the kind of man who was fitted by nature to be the slave of such a party .
