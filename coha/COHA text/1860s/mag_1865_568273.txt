ARTICLE VII. - THE FOREIGN DELEGATIONS TO THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF CONGREGATIONAL CHURCHES . THE crisis in our public affairs , which justified the assembling of a representative body from the Congregational Churches of the United States at Boston , also gave a peculiar significance to the correspondence from evangelical churches , in foreign lands , through their deputies . While the great design and action of this Council related to the extension of the Kingdom of Christ by the churches which had approved the meeting and elected delegates , it was impossible not to review the attitude of those Christian communities , in foreign lands , towards this republic during the sorrows , and burdens , and perils of our civil strife , who acknowledge the communion of these churches , and desire to be recognized in their fellowship . The Congregational Union of Canada , the North Staf. fordshire Congregational Union , the Glainorganshire Association of Wales , the Congregational Union of England and Wales , and the Union of the Evangelical Churches of France , were represented by delegates ; who , after the presentation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit as honorary members , and were welcomed in a brief and felicitous address by the Moderator . The delegates responded through Rev. Drs . Yaughan , Raleigh , and Massie , of England ; and Rev. Dr. Wilkes , of Montreal ; and Rev. Theodore Monod , of Paris ; and Rev. Mr. Thomas , of Wales ; whereupon a committee of five was appointed to prepare a suitable reply to their salutations . That committee brought in a report which was adopted by the Council with great unanimity , and will be published in their minutes . This report acknowledged the courtesy of the brethren from the British provinces ; and expressed a suitable appreciation of their kind wishes and fraternal greetings . It also testified to the fidelity of the Protestant Churches in France // to the cause of civil and religious liberty , as involved in our recent conflict , which had been evinced abundantly by their words of encouragement , and by their earnest prayers . The report alluded , with thankfulness , to the sturdy adherence of the people and churches of Wales to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while we were battling for these interests , under manifold disadvantages . The document then alluded to the fact that the public sentiment of England and Scotland had been notoriously adverse to the cause of the republic , and mentioned the agreement of all parties and of their organs , in open hostility to us and sympathy with the rebellion . Their apologies were reviewed , while the noble exception was mentioned , " of the operatives in the maunfactories and workshops of England , who felt from the first that the conflict was one involving the rights of labor , and who had stood up unmoved by any influences in the day of their calamity and ours " The concluding sentences of the report adverted to the position of the Congregational Churches of England who were represented , and their substance is thus summed up : " Thorn the Congregational Churches of England we had expected an unequivocal and constant declaration . Was not ours the same old cause of the puritan against the cavalier ? While we most cordially welcome the brethren who bring congratulations to us from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel deeply and sorrowfully the actual position of English Congregationalists . While among these brethren there are some whom it would be invidious to name , because we could not name all who , from first to last , have most constantly , devotedly , and eloquently defended our cause , we would frankly acknowledge that we most bitterly perceive that the majority of the Congregationalists of England have not desired the su*cess of our armies , and that the dominant influence of the Congregational Union of England has been against us . The committee desire to express no unkind remembrance of injury to us , but would accept the testimony of these brethren with us as the best proof of a desire to maintam // hereafter relations between us and them of an inseparable faith and union . " This part of the report elicited a very free and able discussion , in which the English were assailed for the aid and comfort which they furnished the rebels , and their excuses were also presented . iDr . Vaughan made a defense of the Congregational Union of England and Wales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground that no question is allowed to be discussed relative to which there is a strong division of opinion among themselves ; and also that they were not likely to have had their attention drawn to matters three thousand miles away , concluding , " You will see that we had some reason for hesitating to risk our Union , for the sake of giving expression to our opinion what the result of the war ought to be . " Dr. Vaughan then proceeded to a personal explanation , declaring that , at the outset , he believed the conquest of the South to be impracticable ; and also , that even if practicable , it would be at an expense of sufibring that would render even the extinction of slavery unjustifiable at such a cost . And after some private allusions , concluded : " From what I have seen , from what has been brought before my mind , during not merely the last year , but the whole of this struggle , I have certainly received , with regard to your affairs , light , I had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have vanquished , were the homes of a society that was so corrupt that there was no other way of effectually dealing with it besides that you have taken . And I do thank God , and congratulate you , on the triumph of your Northern armies over that portion of your country . " IRev . IT . W. Beecher , whose experience abroad entitled him to be heard , surpassed himself in a speech of Christian magnanimity and charity , eloquently vindicating the loyal people of the United States for their love of order and respect for law ; and closing with a challenge of the foreign brethren to Christian rivalry , in the conflict against Satan , for the recovery of the world to Jesus Christ . We purpose to examine candidly the plea in behalf of the Congregational Union of England and Wales made by their // representative ; and to show the justice of the report in its statements and sentiments . This Union consists of delegates from the Congregational Churches , and of personal members , who hold offices in the churches , colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An annual meeting is held in London or some other principal city or town , consisting of pastors and delegates from the churches , with the personal members of the Union . A preliminary meeting is convened , consisting of the members of the Union exclusively , which prepares the business and nominates the officers and committee of the body for the next year . Such an arrangement naturally places the power of excluding matters into the hands of a comparatively few ; and practically , we believe , commits the direction to the committee of the Union , and especially to their Secretaries . We , on this side of the Atlantic , have had experience in the operation of such a system , through the management of several benevolent societies , and of their anniversary meetings , and are therefore not disposed to hold the constituency responsible for the opinions which they were permitted to utter in the annual assembly . IDr . Vaughan maintains that it was only in accordance with usage " not to allow any question relative to which there is a strong division of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be decided in our Union . " We have not sufficient familiarity with the proceedings of that body to pass judgment on this course , and certainly accept Dr. Vaughan 's statement , although we were under the impression that some years since a very grave and serious discussion and division occurred on the question of American slavery , which may perhaps have induced the custom , whose application to our country created such unfavorable opinions as to the position of that body in relation to the rights of man and the maintenance of justice , and even the exercise of Christian fellowship . Waiving this , however , we are unable to harmonize the repeated and deliberate action of that body in regard to our national affairs , and especially the treatment of delegates from our churches , with the objects of the Union as expressed in their // constitution , where it was not possible to produce any division among themselves . Of the seven objects mentioned in this constitution , the following are the third and fifth : " 3 . To establish fraternal correspondence with Congregational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " 5 . To obtain accurate statistical information relative to the Congregational churches throughout the kingdom and the world at large . " What harm could have happened if the Union , during the war , had received the delegates from the Congregational churches of the limited States according to their former practice and listened to statements in respect to the situation of our affairs and the issues involved in the struggle ? Is it the rule of that body not to obtain any information on matters concerning which they differ ? Is that the liberty of English Congregationalism ? Was it quite in accordance with their own constitution when they refused President Sturtevant a hearing unless he pledged himself beforehand not to allude to our civil struggle ? Was it exactly in the spirit " of establishing fraternal correspondence with Congregational churches throughout the world , " when they declined to invite lRev . Henry Ward Beecher to take a seat in their assembly ? When , last winter , the Secretary refused five minutes to a well accredited agent , for the purpose of stating the condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of British fairness , or of British Christianity ? Even after the conflict ended , and the terrible crime of President Lincoln 's assassination shocked the civilized world , when Courts and Senates were sending letters of sympathy , and uttering their eulogies on the deceased ; was it quite becoming the Congregational Union of England and Wales , to prepare a set of formal resolutions that had no praise to bestow on the good IRuler who had fallen a martyr in the cause of liberty , but merely contained a censure of the murder as of any other atrocity ? This question was answered in the Assembly itself , by Drs . Halley and Newman Hall , when they told the mover of those resolutions their judgment of such an omis // sion ; while the grave Parliament honored the memory of the statesman who had been foully assaulted , and even the Lombard street merchants , wiping the gold dust from their eyes , extolled the moral and intellectual character of the extraordinary man who had perished a victim to a brutal slaveocracy . The resounding cheers which responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union that they had mistaken the sentiment of the body , and that the division on this great struggle was more among themselves than among those whose action they repressed . Was it strange that in view of these facts , the Council at Boston should adopt the report of their committee , especially when among the English delegates deputed , one as Secretary of the Union had persistently opposed the loyal spirit of this country , and another had published continually the harshest comments not merely on our civil relations , but on our Christian character ; and when but one had been a friend to the North through the struggle ; while the most eminent , courageous , and able of our advocates , such men as Massie , and Newman Hall , and Halley , were omitted from the deputation altogether ? We understand the difficulties under which these brethren have labored ; but they appear to have willfully refused to open their eyes that they might see the truth ; and to have stopped their ears , lest they should be converted . Accepting frankly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and believing all he affirms of his altered opinions , we think that he does not quite appreciate the suddenness of the transformation , nor exactly recall what he has written against his brethren in this republic . While , as he said , doubting the result of this conflict , and adjudging it unjustifiable , even though resulting in the abolition of slavery , we have never , either in private or public , learned that he regarded , or regards , the preservation of our free government desirable . As Editor of the British Quarterly Review , he wrote in the " Epilogue on Affairs , " April , 1862 : " Another three months have passed , and the American struggle is still in process , and if the suppression of the institution of the South ' is to be the condi // July , tion of a settlement , we are as far from a settlement as ever . It is sad that it should so be ; but in the circumstances of our Transatlantic kinsmen , if the toleration of slavery has been a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In July of the same year , we have this comment from the same pen , on our trials and sacrifices , when the best blood of our churches was being poured out in behalf of our common humanity : " The United States have not only been known as Christian States , but their Christianity has been largely of the Puritan type . Recent events , however , have shown that other elements have found their home and place of rule among the American people . . . . The vine was a goodly vine when planted there , but the soil about it has changed greatly , since that day . " Such , at least , are our unwelcome impressions . Most earnestly for the sake of liberty , humanity , and religion , do we long to see an end of this war in which the very language spoken should suffice to suspend hostilities , by reminding the combatants of their common stock and brotherhood . . . . Let them not sup . pose that the civilized world is bestowing any admiration on their achievements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To all rightminded men , it is a spectacle which is simply painful . " These views were uttered in the second summer of the struggle ; but we have searched in vain for evidence of that gradual emancipation from this mistake , which the address of the Delegate to the National Council at Boston induced us to expect . Thus he discourses on the state of affairs in this country more than a year later , October , 1863 : " Popular principles and the good name of Puritanism have suffered injuries during the last two years , which the next half century will hardly suffice to retrieve . It is with deep sorrow that we thus write . The hoarded miseries for humanity with which the Northern States of America are charged , will be felt in their time . " Did not this solemn accusation against the religion and virtue of our suffering people , demand something beyond the mere acknowledgment of limited information , in one whose position enabled him to ascertain more exactly than any other man in England , the facts as they were ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Chattanooga , had somewhat opened the eyes of the editor to the probable results of the conflict , but we do not after another year , discern that // improvement in judgment which he declares . This is his recorded opinion , January , 1864 : " In America , the war scale is in favor of the North , and we are summoned to rejoice . No doubt the resolve to perpetuate and diffuse slavery has been the great motive of war on the part of the Confederates , and it is as little doubtful that the preservation of the Union , and not the extinction of slavery , has been the grand motive of the Federals . The motive of the Confederates is a deadly sin , and the frown of heaven seems to rest on it ; the motive of the Federals is natural , but acted upon , in the face of such costs , it has become monstrous . We can not wish success to either side . To free some millions of blacks at the cost of making corpses or slaves of a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes of religion or of humanity . " When General Grant had driven the stubborn foe back to Richmond , and laid his iron hand on the very throat of the rebellion ; when Sherman had seized Atlanta ; this editor bad only condemnation for Northern freemen battling for a lawful liberty . October , 1864 : " Slavery has ceased to be the great difficulty , even with the slave power . The issue is narrowed to a single point . Independence is the one word , comprehending everything to the South . Submission is the one word , comprehending everything to the North ; a submission , however , which means the future rule of a vanquished minority , by a conque*riug majority . Wise men must be as alien from the spirit of the invaders in this struggle , as from the slave element of the invaded . " Sherman marched through Georgia to the astonishment of Europe , and our friends in England , taking heart , pointed to the atrocities of the rebels in their treatment of prisoners , in their attempt to burn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the triumph of the Republic ; yet Dr. Vaughan , from his watch-tower of observation , had even last January only a sharp rebuke for those who sympathized in our behalf ; a denial that slavery ought to be removed at such a cost , or that the Union should be restored in this method , and a bitter denunciation of us as neither lovers of liberty nor true servants of Jesus Christ . These are the words , January , 1865 : Perplexed indeed we are to find the men who preach peace at any price in Europe , preaching up war at any cost in America . We covet the solution of this mystery , but it does not come . It is said to be to put down slavery-that hell upon earth-admitted  --  but where is your warrant for putting down one hell , by perpetrating another no less horrible ? If to cut down the last white man on the // soil of the Confederates , be the price of restoring the Union , restored we are told it shall be . These are not words proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " * * " Popular liberty and Puritan Christianity have gone back many degrees in public estimation , within the last three years . " We submit whether such assertions from a delegate to a Council of the Puritan Churches thus accused , did not deserve to be noticed , and whether something more than the apology of erroneous information would not have been becoming ? Was not the mistake of so intelligent and influential a man , in such a position for obtaining knowledge , and who claims to understand English Congregationalists better than any one beside , something more than an accidental error , even a sin against the House of God , the Church of the elect , whom he thus assailed ? We say it not in any unkindness , but because we can not , and should not forget that these harsh and unjust condemnations have enhanced the terrors of this struggle , and the sacrifice of most precious lives ; and , while we forgive , we demand a recognition of the grievous fault . The war ended , and then what congratulation came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ righteousness had triumphed , and the Puritan principles been maintained after so abundant sacrifices ? In April , 1865 , he says : " America-what of America ? The captive Samson , blind , laboring at the mill , has been avenged . The long connivance of the North at his hard lot has brought its retribution , and the deeper guilt of the South is bringing its heavier penalty . Even a passion for independence , it seems , must be a failure , when the freedom claimed , is a freedom to be used at the cost of freedom elsewhere . " That is all ! Carlyle said at the beginning , " It is a dirty chimney , let it burn itself out . " Dr. Vaughan , at the close , calls upon Englishmen to congratulate themselves that the United States have suffered so much in the travail of deliverance . These Englishmen , agreeing in nothing else , coincide in cool indifference to the pangs and burdens of the terrible fight , by which we on this continent have preserved for humanity , the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect for Dr. Vaughan , we can apply his language before the Council to himself : " I have never said a word that could be painful to you , that // was not connected with much more pain in my own mind , than it was likely to bring to you . " Yet his position in the Congregational Union of England and Wales , and his being chosen as a delegate to the National Council of the Congregational Churches of the United States , constitute him a representative of the class in England , from whom we had a right to expect sympathy ; and if he failed egregiously in comprehending the merits of the quarrel , we can not be surprised that the majority of those , who had far less opportunity of informing themselves , and far less reason to wish well to our cause , should have been hostile to our success . Indeed , the sentiment of these English Congregationalists , was expressed in a remark to one of our ministers two years ago : " Sir , to be frank , we have long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be broken , and are glad that the South has taken you in hand instead of ourselves . " The keen and prophetic reply is fulfilled to-day : " My friend , when we have finished this war , you will be happier than you are now , that the South undertook the job instead of yourselves . " Educated Englishmen are still , with their dogged obstinacy , cherishing the mistake , that the loyal citizens of the United States are infatuated with a thirst for carnage , and , like a maddened bull , are raging for another victim . They will not believe that we are not eager to find a pretext for a trial of strength with their nation , and the idea may be sustained by a secret conscioi*sness , that the occasion could be easily discovered . They do not understand the reverence for law , and the love of peace , which has dispersed our citizen soldiery so gladly to their homes , as waves sink when the gale has passed . They will not improve the golden opportunity , unless they imitate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion at the calm statement of their rulers , in the case of the Trent , and say frankly , " We have erred , we have wronged you unintentionally , and we will cheerfully make reparation . " That acknowledgment would hush feuds , and vitally unite the two nations in a friendship more binding than treaties . We do not anticipate such frankness , but when // our government insists on reparation , the matter will be submitted to an umpire , and while we shall yield to the decision if contrary to our interests , Great Britain must also promptly fulfill the obligation required . Retaining our attachment for England and our love for British Christianity , we do not occupy the same relation which we held four years ago . Dr. Raleigh uttered a historical truth of deep significance in his opening address to the Council , when he said , " If you have found in England less help or sympathy than you might have expected , the fact has taught the North self-reliance , and has shown the world your resources and power . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it has , a war in which we should win social , intellectual , and religious deliverance from the Old World , and especially from our mother country . The Jacob , who had been accounted only an industrious herdsman and shrewd trader , has become Israel during this terrible wrestle and night watch , and now the elder must serve the younger . There is no arrogance in claiming for ourselves the leadership of the world in the defense of those grand principles which are the noblest endowments of society , and which are the only permanent sources of true progress for humanity . The sympathy and comfort which we anticipated from those allied to us in language and in a heroic past , would have shortened the conflict and have saved , many sacrifices , but might have lost us this crowning gift of a true liberty , under righteous law , guided by wisdom and guarded by invincible power . Yet , though it soften our indignation , this does not lessen the fault of our brethren abroad , to whom we can address the language of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil against me , but God meant it unto good , as it is this day . " While the facts sustain the address of the Council in its discriminating rebukes , the report also breathes a Christian charity in its grateful recognitions and its generous forgiveness . Although the bearing of the Congregational Union of England and Wales has been inimical to the Congregational churches of the United States , the Welsh have stood up our fast friends , and even among English Congregationalists many // have advocated our cause when it required a courage that has scarcely been excelled on the battle-fields of the IRepublic . We hold these brethren in hearty and honored affection , and esteem them for their work 's sake . We are ready to coöperate with those who have misrepresented us , if satisfied that they sincerely desire such an allince , and have resolved to avoid in the future the arrogant judgments which first indiscriminately condemned Northern Christians for complicity with slavery and then slandered them for an honest effort to remove the curse from their country . The preservation of a kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of their Christian efforts for the salvation of the world , depend largely upon the relation of the churches represented in the National Council at Boston and those represented by the delegates from abroad . All who love the Kingdom of the iRedeemer will pray that they may see eye to eye and labor together in unity and piety under the leadership of our ascended Lord . The report of the committee made no allusion to a matter which was introduced by young Mr. Monod , diffidently under the urgent pressure of foreign opinion , and which deserves a calm and frank answer . lie represented the wish of our friends in Europe , that there should be no capital punishment inflicted for the crime of rebellion , fearing the encouragement it would afford despots , and closed his appeal with this sentence : " On the other hand , if , under such provocations as you have suffered , and such sacrifices as you have undergone , you should still deem it compatible with the present dignity and with the future safety of the nation- ( I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence pronounced upon men guilty of treason , such an exhibition of clemency would be looked upon as highly honorable to democracy , and as an example for all governments . " We can not , at the close of this Article , enter upon any discussion of the justice and expediency of punishing the conspirators against our republic with the severest penalty . We can only remind these brethren that treason against a nation is a graver crime than treason against a king , and that this offense , // in our republic , was the sum of all villainy , involving not only perjury , but a war in behalf of cruelty , and tyranny , and anarchy ; and that to permit this sin to go unscathed , would be to invite its repetition . We can not appreciate the relief which clemency would afford the Liberals in Europe . We hold that no revolution against an established government is justifiable , unless there be a reasonable prospect of success , and also a cause for which a man should be willing to suffer martyrdom . Our forefathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives , and were ready to meet the doom , and die ignominiously , if they failed ; and we should be the last to encourage abortive insurrections , which would never be undertaken if the leaders did not deem themselves exempted from punishment . Qivil government is too sacred to be lightly assailed , and those who attempt its violent overthrow must be able to justify their course by the intolerable wrongs which they suffer , by their probability of success , and by their self-forgetful devotion to justice and freedom ; and then , if they perish , history will revere their heroism , and the admiration of the world will embalm their memory . We cheerfully and confidently leave to the future the decision whether the conspirators against the republic , to extend slavery , whose atrocities were only the natural and necessary methods of prosecuting the rebellion , deserved the gravest punishment , not solely for their cruelties , their starvation of defenseless prisoners , their assassinations and arsons , but for hat crime which is blacker than all , comprehending and compelling all the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
