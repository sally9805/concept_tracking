txt ART . V. - Hours with the Evangelists . By I. NIcHoLS , D. D. In two volumes . Vol . I. Boston : Crosby , Nichols , &amp; Co. 1859. 8vo. pp. 405 . THE history of this volume has a peculiar and touching interest ; An aged clergyman , after a successful ministry extending through nearly half a century over one parish , being compelled by ill-health to resign his charge and seek a different place of residence , devotes the evening twilight of his life to the preparation of an elaborate work on the Gospels , which should be at once a record of his own faith and hope , and an affectionate message to the people whom he had so long served , designed to impart to them something of the joy and strength of his own religious convictions . It was not a task to be carelessly or hurriedly finished , but life and vigor were vouchsafed to him for its completion . The last page was written ; every chapter had been revised and pondered over with the minute and loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin ; and then , before the work could be published , the prayer of Simeon was fulfilled . The old servant was called home to the presence of the Master whom he had faithfully served while on earth , and the parting message to his former congregation comes to them as a voice from beyond the grave . The volume is modestly entitled " Hours with th' Evangelists " ; but it is the fruit of loving companionship with them for months and years ; it is the ripened and winnowed product // of a lifetime . Its materials were evidently accumulated during the long course of his ministry . The opinions are those which he had preached and defended , the arguments and illustrations are those which he had thought out and expressed , in the long interval which elapsed between the beginning of his theological studies and his withdrawal from the pulpit . The task of his retirement and old age was only to select them and put them in order , to give the finishing touches to the husbanded labors of nearly sixty years . Whatever may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a history , - and we shall show that they are great , - the reader 's highest interest in it must be personal . It is not merely a summary of one branch of the Christian Evidences ; it is also personal testimony , founded on long experience , to the authenticity and value of the narratives of our Saviour 's life . And the testimony is entitled to full credit ; it has the truthfulness of the voice of a dying man . When it was uttered , there was no earthly consideration , no personal bia* , to cause it to diverge one hair 's breadth from the writer 's heart-felt convictions . It was not trammelled by professional requirements or responsibilities ; the author had left the pulpit never to enter it again . No compulsion of authorship was upon him ; a kind Providence had made his circumstances easy , and his social position was one of entire independence . He might have died and made no sign . If his fifty years ' study of the Gospels , accompanied with his large experience of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of others , had created any misgivings in his mind , he might have kept them to himself , or even have published them to the world ; and the world , respecting his spotless life and ingenuous character , would still have called him an honest man , probably an acute and able one . But he was not content to keep silence , and the only record which he could bear was to the truthfulness of the books that he had studied , and which had furnished all the guiding principles of his life . This elaborate work expresses both his earnest convictions , and the grounds upon which they rested . We have said that this work treats of but one branch of what are technically called the Evidences of Christianity . // The first volume , which is all that is yet published , relates almost exclusively to the authenticity of the record and the credibility of the facts narrated by the Evangelists . The test applied consists in the internal marks of truthfulness , the argument being founded chiefly upon the undesigned coincidences of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the harmony of the whole account with what might be expected from our previous knowledge of human nature , and from the course of this world 's events as directed by an all-wise and all-merciful Providence . What may be called the external evidence , or the historical proof of the genuineness of the Gospels , is put aside as sufficiently discussed in other works , and as not coining within the scope of the writer 's plan . Consequently his book may be regarded as a companion to the study of the Gospels in themselves , being founded altogether upon a consideration of their contents . Now it is in relation to precisely this portion of the proofs of Christianity , that the considerations and arguments , the personal testimony and experience , recorded in this volume , are most needed and most acceptable . The Gospels contain both a system of doctrines and a record of facts . These , it is true , mutually depend upon and support each other . The facts obtain their full significance only in the light of the doctrines which accompany them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as they are the peculiar products of a revelation , - that is , so far as they were specially revealed to man because his unaided intellect could not , or did not , attain to them , - can be corroborated only by the facts , and have no authority or validity , often no meaning , without them . He who accepts the facts must accept the doctrines along with them , whether these doctrines are susceptible of any other proof or not ; he who rejects the facts must renounce all revealed doctrine also , and Christianity can be to him only a meagre compend of vague and barren speculations , - a repetition of the endless doubts , the perpetually recurring affirma - J*. ions and denials , of the human intellect when engaged upon a task that transcends its powers . We insist upon this point , because the tendency of speculation at the present day , whether avowedly philosophical or pro-34* // fessedly theological in purport , is to give the name of Christianity to a s*ries of abstract propositions respecting the duties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only which are self-evident , or shine by their own light , and studiously avoiding or rejecting those which rest upon the authority of revelation . We have come to be suspicious of that much-abused phrase , " the spirit of Christianity , " which is so often applied in reprobation or defence of certain practices or opinions , without any express reference to the recorded declarations of the Saviour or his Apostles . Thus vaguely used , it means nothing more than the general opinion of him who utters it , that the doctrine or policy which he advocates either is , or ought to be , directly countenanced by the revealed word of God . Such an application of the phrase is both unfair and inconsistent on the part of him who makes it , as it is an attempt to claim the authority of Christianity when it happens to be in his favor , by one who would openly repudiate such authority if it were cited against him , or merely set up as a rule for his faith or conduct . The spirit of Christianity thus understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form or outline , it is recognized only when specially evoked to perform a service , and is rejected as an unreal phantom when it comes unasked with a message or a warning from on high . The best that can be said of such abuse of language is , that it is an indirect homage to the truth and value of the Christian revelation , made even by those who do not recognize its claims to obedience . The great danger for the Christianity of most men proceeds from ignorance rather than unbelief . They have no idea of their religion , except as a system of doctrines more or less complete , which might have been proclaimed as truths of pure reason , even if they had never been embodied in life and conduct . Some may have studied the Scriptures , but they have done so with chief reference to theological disputes , to extract from them a creed or the refutation of a heresy . Their studies , at the best , can lead only to the formation of a scheme of spiritual philosophy , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a teacher sent from heaven . It is one thing to say , that the whole body // 399 of Christian doctrine is right and excellent ; and it is practically a very different thing to say , that everything which we conceive at the moment to be right and excellent must , for that very reason , form a portion of the Christian doctrine . We have no right to construct our own theory of right conduct ostensibly upon Christian foundations , when we have not in fact given up our cherished opinions , convictions , or prejudices - call them what we may - on a single point , in obedience to the direct commands of the Gospel . In one sense , the teachings of our Saviour and his Apostles are not complete ; they do not contain , and were evidently not intended to contain , a digested system of ethics , or an answer to every question which religious curiosity may raise , or a solution of every problem in casuistry . But they are almost invariably definite and precise . It is not easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Mount , however difficult it may be to conform to it in our daily practice , or to carry it about with us as a monitor in every season of temptation . After all , the difficulty , or the hardship , if we will call it so , lies in the requisition of submission and obedience . Poor human nature is stiff-necked and presumptuous ; it would gladly find out the right way for itself ; it wants no guide , no prompter , - above all , no master . It is easy to yield our assent to abstract truths , which are either intuitively discerned , or are supported by demonstrative evidence ; or rather , since belief in such cases does not depend on our own will , we must assent , whether we will or no . But it is not so easy to accept a definite and precise rule of conduct , which offends our pride , rebukes our indolence , or even startles our reason , - to accept it , we repeat , merely on the authority of one who claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is divinely commissioned from heaven for that very purpose . So , too , some Christian virtues , according to our understanding of them , are not hard to practise . It is easy to indulge in glowing but vague aspirations , to revel in philanthropic dreams , to resist oppression , especially when it troubles us , and to rebuke iniquity in high places , when the rebuke gratifies our own censoriousness , or envy , or spite . // It is not difficult even to yield the cheek to the smiter , when there is a good opportunity to take credit with ourselves and with the world for showing a martyr 's resolution and a martyr 's fortitude . But it is difficult - it is even humiliating - to accept upon authority truths which are above our reason , or are too large for the intellect fully to apprehend . It is hard to practise this very form of humility , or to love our enemies , or not to judge others , or to be patient under suffering and bereavement , remembering that " Blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though we have not seen it , that a man rose from the dead , and afterward ascended to heaven . No wonder that men strive to escape from the evidence that such practices and such beliefs are explicitly and authoritatively enjoined , and that the facts on record bear out the injunction so clearly and fully as to leave upon ourselves the whole guilt of refusing to hear and to obey . The truth of Christianity , then , is a question of fact , and the whole of Christianity is a religion of facts . These facts answer a double purpose ; they lend precision and definiteness to our faith , and they furnish the evidence of that faith . If they are tine , our religion contains , not merely a series of abstract propositions , but a collection of definite and concrete truths , full of meaning and vital in importance . If they are true , Christianity is " an historical religion " ; we fear not to use the phrase , though to many ears it is an unwelcome one . Christianity not only has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of nature was interrupted ; the usual succession of cause and effect was suspended ; there was a special and immediate interposition of Infinite power and wisdom in the course of human affairs , made for the very purpose of breaking , as with a thunderbolt , the sleep of the world in indolence and sin , and teaching men the way of salvation , because they could not find that way for themselves . The nativity of Christ was supernatural ; his being was superhuman ; he came to e*tabhish a kingdom , which was not , and is not , of this world ; he announced his mission , not merely as a divine teacher , but as a divine ruler and judge . His works were supernatural ; at his command , the deaf heard , the lame walked , the blind received their sight , the // winds and waves were hushed , and the dead rose . He was put to death , but death could not hold him . He rose from the dead on the third day , and before he ascended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be with them " always , even unto the end of the world . " Whatever may be thought of the credibility of these assertions , there is no mistaking their character and purport . They are embodied in the Gospel narrative , they constitute that narrative , and if they are not true , that narrative is a fable from beginning to end . They are facts , historical incidents , occurrences having a definite position in time and space ; and the question respecting their authenticity is an historical question , - as much so as that which relates to the life and death of Julius Caesar . As such , moreover , it must be decided exclusively by historical evidence , including under this designation , however , the internal marks of truth or falsity in the narrative itself . He who , on such a point as this , talks about intuitive conviction , the belief of the heart , or the natural and inborn assent of human reason to truths which are congenial with it , uses words without meaning , and thereby betrays either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hearers . But our religion contains also an aggregate rather than a system of doctrines , - of abstract truths and didactic precepts , which vitally affect the heart and life ; and these , it is urged , are not historical , but must have their own peculiar evidence . Very true ; but these doctrines become Christian doctrines to him only who accepts them on the authority of Christianity , - that is , on account of the fact that they were distinctly taught by our Saviour and his Apostles . If accepted on any other ground , they are no more Christian than Pagan ; they are no more to be referred to Jesus Christ , than to Socrates or Plato . They are not , in fact , religious doctrines at all , but propositions in philosophy , - of a spiritual philosophy perhaps , yet one which is altogether human in its origin , its evidence , and its tendency . The derivation of the word religion shows its power to religate or to bind anew , through the additional authority which every doctrine obtains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the teaching of the Infinite One . // Thus , prayer may be , as some have taught , an intuitive act , or one to which we are instinctively prompted by a sense of our own feebleness and dependence , even if we know not any Being to whom it should be addressed ; but it does not become a Christian prayer , if it be not an act performed from a sense of obedience , or because Christ taught us to pray . " If Christ be not risen , then is our preaching vain , and your faith is also vain . Yea , and we are found false witnesses of God . " Our whole faith depends on this fact , this miracle , the resurrection of Christ . If this fact be not true , Christianity is a mere human invention , and the sooner it is stripped of all claims to a Divine origin , and thereby of all pre-eminence and authority , the better . We rejoice , therefore , that the argument in Dr. Nichols 's book , together with the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uphold the truthfulness of the narrative of our Saviour 's life , and thereby to confirm the authority of his religion . It is the evidence of one who submitted his own life to that authority , who studied reverently the dictates of the religion which he defends , and is therefore entitled to speak from experience of its practical effects . Those only who knew the late Dr. Nichols personally can fully understand why we urge this point so strongly , - that the substance *f his book derives important confirmation from the character and life of its author . The sermon lies before us which was preached at his funeral by one who had known him long and well , both in his ministerial relations and in private society ; and a brief extract from it may illustrate our meaning . " His style has often reminded me of St. Paul 's , in its union of cogent logic and fervent devotion , in its power of vitalizing argument by appeal to the heart and conscience , in its aiming with the same stroke at the intellect and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main subject is not departed from , but is opened out in new and unexpected hearings and relations , and from which the return is made with more than redoubled force of conviction to the leading head of discourse . " All who knew him must have remarked in his preaching , and equally in his conversation , the union - in our times too seldom witnessed - of bold thought and lowly reverence ; of free speculation and // childlike docility ; of the independence which could call no man master , and implicit trust in the infallibility of the Teacher from heaven ; of the commanding intellect which made all within its influence his pupils , and the simple open-hearted receptivity with which he loved to sit at the feet of Jesus . In his mind , and his treatment of truth in every department , all science and learning , like the wise men from the East , brought gifts and paid tribute to the child of Bethlehem ; while revelation shed light from the throne of God on all else that could be known or reasoned upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , struck the key-note of hopeful speculation , opcned the path of successful research , and was the source and sum of all wisdom . It was thus that he saw and preached Christ in all , and all in Christ . " The traits which I have named as belonging to his sermons were no less manifest in his social intercourse , in which he preached at least as eloquently and powerfully as from the pulpit . His sacred commission from his divine Master was never forgotten , or , I would rather say , never thought of so naturally and with so modest grace sat the priestly robes upon him ; but they were never laid aside . No man could have been less willing to assume aught on the score of his profession ; but the characteristics of the Christian minister were ingrained , and constituted his personality : he could not but preach Christ . In the ordinary flow of his conversation , how often have we seen his countenance illumined with a light not of earth , eye and brow radiant with the glory of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us who listened it was as if an angel spake ! " Of his devotional services in public and private , we who have heard them can never lose the memory . The topics of these prayers had a wider scope than I have ever known beside , and in themselves might often have seemed more appropriate to a sermon than to a direct address to the Deity . But it was always evident , that , in his own heart , they were subjects of fervent supplication , thanksgiving , and adoration . There was no material , however wide of the ordinary themes of social prayer , which did not in his mind spontaneously assume the sanctity of an altar-gift . " The style of Dr. Nichols 's work is eminently clear , terse , and strong ; and these qualities of it seem to emanate from his character and habits of thought . He was too conscientious ever to give expression to any sentiment or opinion which he had not previously matured with the utmost care ; and then the natural simplicity of his mind led him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with all the earnestness // of profound conviction . From the general Introduction to the book , which occupies the first seventy-five pages of it , and is devoted to a cursory view of the truths and evidences of Natural Religion , of the Jewish Scriptures , and of the preparation for Christianity , we extract two brief passages as specimens of his manner both of thought and utterance . " The gospel is a religion of facts . It deals in declarations , promises , commands . It treats its blessings and its laws simply as facts , recommends them as facts , and leaves them as facts . It enters into no metaphysical proof of any one of them . It takes it for granted that its principles arc deeply seated in the human breast , and that the eye that will not see its light needs not to be illumined , but to be couched . Nature presents itself to us in a similar light . In the relation in which we stand to Universal Providence , of the finite to the Infinite , we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements of that Providence . To submit and conform to facts is the great law of our being . " Now , of all facts , I know of none more certain than religious facts . OC some of these , I feel , without a shadow of misgiving , that they are true , and I ask no more assurance in regard to them than I already possess . I know that I am endowed with a moral nature . I am sure I have a sense of right and wrong . I am conscious of a religious sentiment . I can not but regard the universe around me as manifesting the agency of an Intelligent First Cause . I am impressed , beyond any seeming possibility of doubt , by the general reality of the gospel history ; and all the sceptical objections to particular parts , I ever meet with , never shake my conviction in this regard . And yet clouds of mystery invest all these facts . Still , no such obscurity rests on any one of them , as essentially to impair my conviction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will let fact have its proper weight , and mystery its proper weight , each according to its own particular nature . Now , in each of these instances I have named , the fact requires action on our part , and the mystery does not . It is mysterious , that the inborn religious sentiment should be liable to so much perversion ; but this mystery demands no action ; it only remains a shadow upon the sentiment itself . It is a mystery , that the belief in one God , infinitely wise and good , is embarrassed by so much apparent evil in the universe ; but this , again , requires no action . The miracle , which forms so large a part of the gospel history , has some inscrutable characteristics ; still , it is an inscrutableness which calls for no action . But the religious sentiment , on the contrary , is essentially active in its demands . So is the manifestation // of a Supreme Intelligence , the Author and Ruler of all , as we behold it in the order and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority and holy principles of Christianity . " But is not this an anomalous and strange condition of things ? " It is the common condition of all things in me and about me . It is a fact that I must eat to live ; - it is a mystery how food enables me to live . It is a fact that I have a mind prompting me to study , to labor , and to perform many other acts ; - but what a mystery is mind ! Let each , I repeat , have its appropriate influence : the uneradicable fact , that will keep its hold upon my mind , and master every scruple , let me do all I can to prevent it ; and the mystery , that will cling to that fact , notwithstanding . Let tree and parasite grow together . Let facts , which demand action , produce action . Let mysteries , which bang their shadows about my mental vision , remain as shadows upon my mental vnion . Let me take everything as it is , in this wonderful existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with so much simplicity and force , is one that is familiar to every accurate thinker , though perpetually lost sight of by sceptical minds on the one hand , and by rash theorists on the other . It may be enunciated as a general principle in practical logic , - We are never entitled to affirm that the thing is not so , merely because we can not tell how it is . The wisest philosopher , the greatest naturalist , can not tell how a blade of grass grows ; but we are not , therefore , to jump to the conclusion that it does not grow . I may not be able to explain how the will is free ; - that is , how the volition should be determinate , when there is no power in the motive , or in anything else , by which I am determined to will one thing rather than another . But it would be absurd , on account of this inability , to reject the direct and unmistakable testimony of consciousness , that the will is free , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is now attracting so much attention on account of the learned and ingenious application of it by Dr. Mansel to the limits of religious thought , is but another application of the same principle . This philosophy maintains , that on all subjects of pure metaphysics , including of course some of the higher doctrines of theology , we must believe what is inconceivable , or impossible to thought ; for on all such matters we are placed in a dilemma between two contradictory propositions , // one of which , because they are contradictory , must be true , while both are inconceivable . The inference is inevitable , that in such a case the inconceivableness of a proposition affords no presumption whatever that it is not true . If we thrust out of the field of belief everything which we can not understand , we may as well fold our hands and sit down in hopeless ignorance ; for we can not take a step even in practical life , except by violating our own principles . The next extract from the Introduction will illustrate the practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his style . " But the Scripture as a Light is perhaps hardly so important as the Scripture as a Power , - or what it has done in teaching things before unknown , or with which men were but imperfectly acquainted , as what it is always doing in strengthening a sense of those fundamental principles of piety and virtue which are received by all . The subjects on which the most able interpreters of the sacred volume have displayed their ingenuity and learning are but shadows , for the most part , compared with those eternal verities which commend themselves to every man 's conscience in the sight of God . Yet while these require no critical exposition , they do stand in need of some holy enthronement , some exterior consecration , to insure them their most effectual enforcement on the great mass of mankind , - in other words , a Bible . " Few persons think absolutely for themselves , on any subject . A perfectly individual opinion is rare . To most people it is the great sayer that makes the great saying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom ; but his name has done much to give it the estimation it enjoys . When the Jews were filled with admiration of the instructions of Christ , because he taught them , as they said , as one having authority , and not as the scribes , ' they had been listening to one of his simplest and most practical discourses , - the Sermon on the Mount ; but it was associated in their minds with his reputation , his miracles , as well as with the mysterious force of utterance it naturally derived from his own consciousness of his divine mission . " Reverence , therefore , is a vast moral power . Enlighten it as much as possible ; - this will be one of its best safeguards from perversion , and one of the most effectual means to secure for it a permanent place in the mind . Enlighten it , I say . For I could wish no child of mine to be the slave of a blind and passive reverence . The sublime sentiment of religious veneration I would have associated in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove all things , and hold fast // 407 that which is good . Let him see every just distinction between the human and the Divine , - between what is of doubtful and what is of certain authority . " - pp. 71 73 . The Introduction to the work is followed by two chapters on the General Coincidences and on the Characteristics of the Gospels . Under the former head , the author lays especial stress upon the point , that Christianity was communicated to the world in an historical form . " We might have had a doctrinal New Testament , without any narrative at all . As it is , we have four different narratives , each distiriguished by the characteristics of artless sincerity , and where the feeling of reality , excited by one incident after another , becomes insensibly associated with every part , and the faith of the reader is an accumulated impression , resulting from the successive signatures of truth , which leave their unconscious effect upon his mind as he goes along . " The Gospels abound with incidents . The Zend-Avesta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mystical speculations , prayers , and moral sentiments . The Vedas , the holy writings of the Hindoos , are made up of invocations , hymns , maxims , precepts , and explanations of mysteries . The Koran , the Bible of the Mohammedans , is a mass of rhapsodies . But then it had less occasion for incidents than the gospel documents . Incidents are important to miracles , by attaching to them those little harmonies of circumstance which render them more striking , and by which their reality is confirmed ; but Mohammed did not pretend to work miracles . Incidents arc indispensable in all biographies as indications of character . They are the theatres of example , its developmental field . A trait which no language can define , except in round and general terms , they exhibit in its most delicate lines , its nicest and most shadowy touches . But the Mussulman does not profess to hold up his lawgiver as the model of a faultless life . The gospel does so hold up Jesus . It identifies itself with him . It had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the world . A real life must make facts its portrait , and rude historians must make facts their pencil . " - pp. 81 - 83 . This is clearly and admirably stated , and the contrast is then finely illustrated , in point of practical effect , between an artless narrative of incidents , and a series of propositions respecting abstract truths . Because Christianity has been for centuries a theme for discussion by learned theorists and acute disputants , because systems of philosophy , systems of // 408 NICHOLS 'S HOURS WITH THE EVAN*3*ELISTS. ethics , systems of theology , all in their most abstract form , have been founded upon it , we are too apt to lose sight of the fact , that , in its origin and its most characteristic features , it was and is a religion for the multitude , a gospel for the poor and unlearned , a way of salvation for all mankind ; and as such , it necessarily assumed a narrative shape , for in no other form could it have been understood and reduced to practice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract thought , the broad generalizations of philosophy and science are as meaningless and inefficient as propositions in an unknown tongue . Our Saviour himself recognized this principle when he so frequently inculcated the great truths that he came to impart under the form of parables . Those of the Good Samaritan , the Prodigal Son , the Talents , the Sower , the Laborers in the Vineyard , Dives and Lazarus , and many others , have brought Christian verities home to the consciences and lives of millions who would otherwise never have known what Christianity meant . And if this remark is true even of the apologue , wherein the narrative is a mere form , a vehicle of the indwelling truth , how much more evident is it of the actual incidents , the story of our Saviour 's life . Even the miracles are hardly more important as evidences of the divinity of his mission , than as illustrations of his purposes and character . When called for as mere portents or marvels by a sceptical but wondering multitude , they were invariably refused . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obeyed , was never wanting when it was invoked to feed the hungry , to open the eyes of the blind mendicant , to console the widow for the loss of her only son , or to foster the timid faith of one who was already striving to believe . The instinctive craving of the human mind for the definite and particular , even the tangible , is a fact which may mortify the pride of intellect ; but it is one which the moralist and the preacher can not afford to lose sight of , for on it the whole success of their efforts depends . The mind can no more live exclusively in the region of pure ideas , than the body can subsist in a vacuum . IRites , ordinances , institutions , symbols , more or less in amount , more or less definite // 409 and tangible , have been a constituent part of every religion that has obtained anything like general acceptance in any country or age . Bishop Butler remarked long ago , that " the form of religion may indeed be where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself can not be preserved amongst mankind without the form . " Here in great part is the secret of the invincibility of IRomanism , of the peculiar tenacity of its grasp upon uncultivated minds , and even of the large accessions which it has lately received from the English Church . Its rich symbolism , its numerous observances , its sensible representations of the great facts of Christianity , satisfy an imperative want of human nature , and buttress the faith to which they are attached . They may be purified and enlightened , but they can not be taken away without risking the safety of the whole fabric . But it is urged as the peculiar glory of Christianity , that it is a spiritual religion , the essence of which is faith , and its practice love , - faith being " the substance of things hoped for , the evidence of things not seen . " It is , indeed , spiritual in aim and tendency , and such it will become in the millennium . Meanwhile , for frail and erring man , it has established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven , raised up a visible Church , created a ministry or priesthood . Without these concessions to human weakness , if they must be so called , only the continuance of miraculous powers in the Church could have insured its final triumph over Paganism . The next four chapters of Dr. Nichols 's work treat respectively of the Mythical Theory of Strauss , the Harmony of Miracles with Nature , the Uses and the Credibility of Miracles . The treatment of these subjects does not assume to be exhaustive or complete , and it is not connected with any peculiar theory of the nature or purpose of these grand interruptions of the ordinary working of God 's providence . The author dwells more willingly upon the religious than the philosophical aspect of the questions discussed , and the practical , didactic character of his remarks and speculations appears throughout . These chapters , though not deficient in unity , seem to be essays , or a series of practical reflections naturally suggested to a pious mind by the wide contrast between the 35 * // views of the sceptic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confuted by a plain and common-sense view of the admitted facts in the case , without entering into any elaborate exposures of the monstrous hypotheses and assumptions upon which this extravagant speculation rests . The simplicity and ingenuousness of the Evangelists ' style ; the shortness of time between the death of the Saviour and the lowest date which can be assigned to the publication of the Gospels , leaving no sufficient interval for the slow growth of legendary stories ; the striking contrast between the Hebrew anticipations of a Messianic triumph , and the actual ministry of a sorrowing and crucified Christ , affording no incidents on which an excited , thoroughly Jewish imagination could dwell with pleasure ; - these and many other discrepancies between the requisitions of the German hypothesis and the proved realities of history place the former beyond the range or the need of serious confutation . A bald summary of it sufficiently exposes its extravagance and absurdity . The author treads upon more familiar and more pleasing ground when he comes to speak of the harmony of miracles with Nature . Without entering into any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace both the natural and the supernatural to the same source , the immediate action of the Deity , working in each for the same end , the instruction and government of man , Dr. Nichols contents himself with pointing out the lower analogies and harmonies between the ordinary laws of nature and the extraordinary manifestations of infinite power and goodness combined . Ordinary action , he remarks , is not violated when it is crossed by a new power intervening for a new purpose . A man does not suspend the law of gravitation when he lifts a weight . In fact , all human action , considered as originating in free will , - and no other view of it is consistent with the direct testimony of consciousness , - is strictly supernatural ; that is , it is self-caused , without any regular antecedent , so that it refuses to be classified , or reduced to any of the laws which describe the ordinary events of nature . This view has been expounded at length , and with great felicity and eloquence , by IDr . Bushnell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supernatural " ; and the coincidence of opinion and argument made it proper for Dr. Nichols to state , in a note , that this chapter of his book , having been for several years in manuscript , was already in the hands of the printer when Dr. Bushnell 's work was first published . The chapter on the uses of miracles exhibits forcibly , and with much weight and beauty of illustration , their office , not merely as evidences or means of conviction , but as aids to practical religion . They are addressed not only to the intellect , but to the heart . They bring the Deity near to man , evince the immediacy and paternal character of His government , and eliminate the frigid Epicurean conception of a Creator of the universe whose work was finished at the creation , and who has ever since stood aside , unconcerned and self-sufficient in His beatitude , heedless of the petty concerns and feeble cries of an insignificant race - " Proh sancta Deem tranquilla pectora pace , Qua* placidum degunt *evum vitamque serenam ! " The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a religion is that of an overruling Providence ; and this is but another name for a worker of miracles . Under any other doctrine , prayer has no purpose , and worship no meaning . " How far God 's interposing hand is introduced in human affairs , is beyond our knowledge . Its secret modes of interposition may be constant and innumerable . Of those which have been manifest to human observation , the Gospel is the chief . The Paternal Mind here comes conspicuously forth , communicating with our minds in the exercise of mind 's appropriate sovereignty over the organic and the material . " Somcthin* of the same kind , only upon a smaller scale , and not divine , man always needs and always enjoys . He needs constant intercourse with the minds around him ; and here are spiritual sympathies prepared for him , as unfettered , if not as glorious , as those of a special revelation from heaven . As I said , he needs this intercourse . A solitary intellect , surrounded by an unchanging regularity of Mechanical Nature , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the life of mind . " - p . L54 . Order has its uses , its instructive and even monitory effects upon the intellect and conscience . But an absolutely unbroken order through an endless series of years , a cycle of // events forever repeating itself , unalterable both from an inherent necessity and an imperative law of belief which rejects the possibility of change , is one of the most repulsive and appalling doctrines that philosophy ever framed . Who would willingly take up an existence that should be a monotonous and never-ending routine ? God does not so deal with his creatures . Infinite variety , no less than perfect order , is the law of the universe . Among the countless organisms of the animal and vegetable kingdom , no one individual ever exactly repeats another , though the two may have sprung from the same immediate parent . Each is individualized by differences that are patent even to the naked eye . It would be as great a marvel to find two human faces precisely alike , as to find one with a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Argus , with eyes on every side of his head . And , as has been acutely remarked , the differences multiply just as the phenomena come nearer to human life and action . Science can predict with unerring precision all the eclipses of Jupiter 's satellites for a century hence ; but it can not tell which way the wind will blow to-morrow morning , how rich will be the next harvest , or what will be the origin , progress , or issue of a single attack of disease . Human life , taken individually and not in the gross , offers the most capricious and uncertain of all phenomena . Absolute uniformity , then , is not the law of the higher part of creation , and is what we should least expect in the dealings of Providence with man . The conditions of health and disease , of failure or success in life , of the development of character and genius in this or that direction , however we may attempt in the aggregate to reduce them to law through the rude method of averages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The human mind craves the variety with which it finds itself surrounded , is in love with its own idiosyncrasy , and in its own freedom sees mirrored the free and varied action of the author and governor of the moral universe . It looks for miracles , prays for them , and , whatever may be its philosophy in hours of indifference and repose , when under the excitement of a great sorrow or a great hope , believes in them . Every individual birth or death is a miracle , a great break in the continuity of events , to those who are // most nearly concerned with it ; and to them it often preaches louder than any sermon - " But there are always those who are reluctant to believe in anything which is greatly out of the line of every-day experience . So many centuries ago ! In Juda*a ! By Jesus and his Apostles ! However susceptible of proof these Gospel miracles , they observe , it can not be denied that they stand alone , - that they are passing strange . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange events be. * sides miracles . All along in the pathway of history there are chasms deep and startling . It requires a long bridge to reach the isolated greatness of David , homer , Shakespeare , Washington . Some minds are more infrequent than the prodigies of Scripture . " - p. 184 . We might dwell much longer upon a work which is so rich in suggestive remarks and illustrations as the volume before us . But as what remains depends chiefly on a minute examination of the narratives of the Evangelists , and consists in great part of an enumeration of particulars , to which justice could not be done without many and long citations , we must stop here . Apart from the personal interest that is reflected upon it by the character of its author , the book itself invites and will reward diligent perusal . Equally suited to the learned and the unlearned , its contents are as attractive as its exterior ; and this is saying much , for in point of mechanical execution , in sumptuousness of type , paper , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is its superior . We cordially commend it , not merely to professed students of the subject , but as a household book , a family companion to the study of the Gospels , and a noble monument to the character and labors of its author .
