SOME few months ago , a little bubble of interest was made on the surface of London life , by a course of Sunday lectures of a peculiar kind . These lectures were given in a small room in Bouverie street , off Fleet street - Bouverie street , sacred to publishing and newspaper offices  --  and only a very small stream of persons was drawn to the place . There was something very peculiar , however , about the lectures , the lecturer , and the audience , which might well have repaid a stranger in London for the trouble of going there . I doubt whether such a proportion of intellectual faces could have been seen among the congregation of any London church on these Sunday mornings ; and I know one , at least , who attended the lectures , less for the sake of what he heard than because such listeners as the authoress of " Romola " were among the audience . The lecturer was Mr. Richard Congreve , and the subject of his discourses was the creed of Positivism . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrines are to the American public . In London , Mr. Congreve is , in a quiet way , a sort of celebrity or peculiarity . He is the head of the small , compact band of English Positivists . It is understood that he goes as far in the direction of the creed which was the dream of Auguste Cornte 's later years as any sane human creature can well go . I have , however , very little to say here of Mr. Congreve , individually ; and I take his recent course of Sunday lectures only as a convenient starting point from which to begin a few remarks on the political principles , character , and influence of that small , resolute , aggressive body of intellectual , highlyeducated and able men who are beginning to be known in the politics and society of England as the London Positivists . A discourse on the principles of Positivism would be quite out of place here ; but even those who understand the whole subject will , perhaps , allow me , for the benefit of those who do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Positivism , it is known to my readers , is the name given to the philosophy which Auguste Comte , more than any other man , helped to reduce to a system . Regarded as a philosophy of history and human society , its grand and fundamental doctrine merely is that human life evolves itself in obedience to certain fixed laws , of which we could obtain a knowledge if only we applied ourselves to this study as we do to all other studies in practical science , by the patient observation of phenomena . Auguste Comte 's reduction of this philosophical theory to a scientific system is undoubtedly one of the grandest achievements of human intellect . The philosophy did not begin with him or his generation , or , indeed , any generatiot* of which we have authentic record . Whenever there were men capable of thinkng at all , there must have been some whose minds were instinct with this doctrine ; but Comte made it a system at once simple , grand , and fascinating , and he will always remain identified with fts development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comte , in his later years , set to founding a relzgion also  --  a religion which has , perhaps , called down upon its founder and its followers more ridicule , contempt , and discredit than any vagary of human imagination in ouy day . I speak of all this only to explain to my readers that there is some little difficulty in defining what is meant by a Positivist . If we mean merely a believer in the philosophical theory of his-z4 // tory , then Positivists are , indeed , to be named as legion , and their captains are among the greatest intellects of the world to-day . In England , we regard Mr. John Stuart Mill as , in this sense , the greatest Positivist , and undoubtedly he is so regarded here . But Mill utterly rejects and ridicules the fantastic religion which Comte , in his days of declining mental power , sought to graft on his grand philosophy . In his treatise on Comte , Mr. Mill showed no mercy to the Positivist religion , and , indeed , bitterly offended many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is said of Mill may be said of nineteen out of every twenty , at least , of the English followers of Comte . They accept the philosophy as grand , scientific , inexorab'e truth ; they reject the religion with pity or with scorn , as a fantastic and barren chimera . Mr. Congreve is , in London , the leader of the small school who go for taking all or nothing , and to whom Auguste Comte is the prophet of a new and final religion , as well as the teacher of a new philosophy . Now this little school is the nucleus of the body of Englishmen of whom I write . When I speak , therefore , of English Positivists , I do not mean the men who go no farther than John Stuart Mill does . These men are to be found everywhere ; they are of all schools , and all religions . I mean the much smaller body of votaries who go , or feel inclined to go , much farther , and accept Comte 's religious teaching as a law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men who are now identified more or less , in the public mind , with Mr. Congreve and his school , there may be some who do not adopt , or even concern themselves about the religion of Positivism . A community of sentiment on historical and political questions , the habit of meeting together , consulting together , writing for publication together , might naturally bring into the group men who may not go the length of adopting the Comte worship . It is quite possible , therefore , that , in mentioning the names of English Positivists , I may happen to speak of some who have no more to do with that worship than I have . I mean , then , only the group of men , most of whom are young , most of whom are highiy cultured , many of whom are endowed with remarkable ability , who are to be found in a literary and political phalanstery with Mr. Congreve , and of whom the majority are understood to be actual votaries of the religion of Comte . Of course I have nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they adopt the worship of woman I think they do a better thing after all than the increasing and popular class of writers , whose principal business in life is to persuade us that our wives and sisters are all Messalinas in heart and nearly all Messalinas in practice . 1f when they pray , they touch certain cranial bumps at certain passages of the prayer , I do not see that they institute anything worse than the genufiections of the Ritualist or the breast-beating of the Roman Catholics . 1f finally , one is sometimes a little puzzled when he receives a letter from a Positivist friend , and finds it dated " 5th Marcus Aurelius , " or " 12th Auguste Comte , " instead of July or December , as th' case may be , one must remember that there never yet was a young sect which did not delight in puzzling outsiders by a new and peculiar nomenclature . I never heard anything worse charged against the Positivists than that they worship woman , touch their foreheads when they pray , and arrange the calendar according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , the general charge of Atheism ; but as that is made in England against anybody whom all his neighbors do not quite understand , I hardly think it worth discussing in this particular instance . We are all Atheists in England in the estimation of our neighbors , whose political opinicns are different from our own . // The English Positivists , then , are beginning to stand out sharply against the common background of political life . They are a little school ; as distinctly a school for their time and chances as the Girondists were , or the Manchester school , or the Massachusetts Abolitionists , or the Boston Transcendentalists . They are Radical , of cQurse , but their Radicalism has a curious twist in it . On any given question of Radicalism they go as far as any practical politician does ; but then they also go in most cases so very much farther that they often alarm the practical politician oUt of his ordinary composure . They are generally incisive of speech , aggressive of purpose , defiant of political prudery , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of idea . Some three or four years ago the Positivists published a large and ponderous volume of essays on subjects of international policy . Each man who contributed an essay signed his name , and although a general community of idea and principle pervaded the book , it was not understood that everybody who wrote necessarily adopted all the views of his associates . The book , in fact , was constructed on the model of the famous " Essays and Reviews " which had sent such a thrill through the religious world a few years before . The political essays naturally failed to create anything like the sensation which was produced by their theological predecessors ; but they did excite considerable attention , and awoke the echoes . They astonished a good many Liberal politicians of the steady old school , and they set many men thinking . What surprised people at first was the singular combination of literary culture and ultra-Radical opinion . Literary young men in England , of late , are generally to be divided into two classes  --  the smart writers for periodicals , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know no more and care no more about politics than ballet girls do , and the University men , the men of " culture , " who affect Torvism as something fine and distinguished , and profess a patrician horror of democracy and the " mob . " If at the time this volume was published one had taken aside some practical politician in London and said , " Here is a collection of practical essays written by a cluster of young men who all have University degrees after their names-will you read it ? " the answer would certainly have been- " Not I , it 's sure to be some contemptible sham Tory rubbish ; some blood-and-culture'trash ; some schoolboy impertinence about demagoguism and the mob . " Therefore the surprise was not slight to such men when they read the book and found that its central idea , its connecting thread , was a Radicalism which might well be called thorough ; a Radicalism which made Bright look like a steady old Conservative ; invited Mill to push his ideas a little farther ; and poured scorn upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A simple , startling foreign policy was prescribed to England . Its gospel , after all , was but an old one-so old that it had been forgotten in English politics . It was merely-Be just and fear not . Renounce all aggression ; give back the spoils of conquest Give Gibraltar back to the Spaniards who own it ; prepare to cast loose your colonial dependencies ; prepare even to quit your loved India ; ask the Irish people fairly and clearly what they want , and if they desire to be free of your rule , hid them go and be free and Godspeed . All the old traditional policies seemed to these men only obsolete and odious superstitions . They would have England , the State , to stand up and act precisely as an Englishman of honor and conscience would do , and they treated with utter contempt any policy of expediency or any policy whatever that aimed at any end but that of finding out the right thing to do and then doing it at once This seemed to me , studying the school quite as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it would // of course be impossible not to honor the body of writers who proposed to show how it was to be accomplished . But no school lives on one grand idea ; and this school had its chimeras and crotchets-almost its crazes . For example , the leader of the Positivist band took great trouble to argue that Europe ought to form herself into a noble federation of States . to the exclusion of Russia , which was to be regarded as an Oriental , barbarous , unmanageable , intolerable sort of thing , and pushed out of the European system altogether . Then a good many . of the leading minds of the school are imbued with a passionate love for a sort of celestial despotism , an ideal imperialism which the people are first to create and then to obey-which is to teach them , house them , keep them in employment , keep them in health , and leave them nothing to do for themselves , while yet securing to them the most absolute freedom . To some of these men the condition of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual , would seem as distressing and objectionable as that of despotic Paris or even Constantinople . A distinguished member of the school declared that nothing was to him more odious than any manner of voluntaryism , and that he hoped to see State operation introduced into every department of English social organization . The connection of this theory with the principle of Positivism , which would mould all men into a sort of hierarchy , is natural and obvious enough , and there is , to sul ) - port it , a certain reaction now in England against the voluntary principle , in education and in public charities . But , as it is put forward and argued by men of the school I describe , b. may be taken as one of the most remarkable points of departure from the common tendency of thought in England . The Positivists are all , indeed , un-English , in the common use of a phrase which is ceasing of late to be so dreaded a stigma as it once used to be in British politics . They are , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are imbued with a contempt , which they never care to conceal , for the average public opinion of the British Philistine , whether he present himself as a West End tradesman or a West End Peer . The Positivists are almost always to be found in antagonism with this sort of public opinion . They attack the Philistine , and they attack no less readily the dainty scholar and critic who lately gave the Philistine his name , and whose over-refining love of sweetness and light is so terribly offended by the rough and earnest work of Radical politics . Whatever way average opinion tends , the in fluence of the Positivists is sure to tend the other way . There was a time , nearly two years ago , when the average English mi ndwas suddenly seized with a passion of blended hate , fear , and contempt for Fenianism . The thing was first beginning to show itself in a serious light and it had not gone far enough to show what it really was . It looked more formidable than it proved to be , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some mysterious and demoniacal league against property and public security . When I say it seemed , I mean it seemed to the average English mind , to the ordinary swell and the ordinary shopkeeper . Just at this time the Positivists drew up a petition to be presented to the House of Commons , in which they called upon the House to insist that lenity should be shown to all Fenian prisoners , that they should be regarded as men driven into rebellion by a deep sense of injustice , and that measures should be taken to prevent the British troops from committing such excesses in Ireland as had been perpetrated in the suppression of the Indian mutiny , and more lately in Jamaica . Now , if there was anything peculiarly calculated to vex and aggravate the House of Commons // 377 and the English public generally , it was such a view of the business as this . Fenianism had not acquired the solemn and tragic interest which it obtained a few months afterward . It is only just to say that Englishmen in general began to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once it became clear that it had among its followers men who , to quote the language of one of the least sympathetic of London newspapers , " knew how to die . " But , at the time I speak of ; Fenianism was a vague , mystic , accursed thing , which it was proper to regard as utterly detestable and contemptible . Imagine then what the feeling of the English county member must have been when he learned that there were actually in London a set of educated Englishmen , nearly all trained in the universities and nearly all moving in good society , who regarded the Fenians just as he himself regarded rebels against the Emperor of Austria or the Pope of Rome , and who not merely asked that consideration should be shown toward them , but went on to talk of the necessity of protecting them against the brutality of the loyal British soldier ! The petition was signed by all who had a share in its preparation . Such men as Richard Congreve , T. M. Ludlow , Frederick Harrison and Professor Beesly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society by signing the document . The petitioners did not feel quite sure about getting any one of mark to present their al ) l ) eal ; and it is certain that a good many professed Liberals , of advanced opinions and full of sympathy with foreign rebels of any class or character , would have promptly refused to accept the ungenial office . The petitioners , however , applied to one who was not likely to be Influenced by any considerations but those of right and justice , and whom , moreover , no body in the House of Commons would think of trying to put down . They asked Mr. Bright to present their petition , and there was , of course , no hesitation on his part . Mr. Bright not merely presented the petition , hut read it amid the angry and impa* tient murmurs of an amazed and indignant House ; and he declared , in tones of measured and impressive calmness , that he entirely approved of and adopted the sentiments which the petitioners expressed . There was , of course , a storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommending that the petition should not even be received-an extreme and indeed extravagant course in a country where the right of petitition is supposed to be held sacred , and which the good sense even of some Tory members promptly repudiated . Mr. Disraeli did his very best to aggravate the feeling of the House against the petitioners . I ) uring the Indian mutiny he had himself loudly protested against the spirit of vengeance which our press encoura*ed ; asked whether we meant to make Nana Sahib the model for a British officer , and whether Moloch or Christ was our divinity . Yet he now declared that the language of the petition was a libel on the Indian army , and that nothing had ever occurred during the Bengal outbreak to warrant the imputations cast on the humanity of our soldiers . I suppose it is not easy to convey to an American reader a correct idea of the degree of boldness involved in the presentation of this celebrated petition . It really was a very bold thing to do . It was running right in the very teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called respectable in England . It was , however , strictly characteristic of the men who signed it . Most , if not *Jl of them , took a prominent part in the prosecution of Governor Eyre of JamWca , for the lawless execution of George William Gordon and the wholesale and merciless floggings and hangings by which order was made to reign in the island . Most of them , indeed , have a pretty spirit of contradiction of their own , and a pretty gift of sarcasm . I think I hardly remember any man who received , // during an equal length of time , a greater amount of abuse from the press than Professor Beesly drew down on himself not very long ago . It was at the time when the public mind was in its wildest thrill of horror at the really fearful revelations of organized murder in connection with the Sawgrinders ' Union in Sheffield . The whole question of trades ' union organization had been under discussion ; and even before the Sheffield revelations came out , the general voice of English respectability was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclosures of organized murder in connection with one union came out , a sort of panic took possession of the public mind . The first , and not unnatural impulse was to assume that all trades ' unions must be very much the same sort of thing , and that the societies of workmen were little better than organized Thuggism . Now , Professor Beesly , Mr. Frederick Harrison and other signers of the petition for the Fenians , had long been prominent and influential advocates of the trades ' union principle . They had been to the English artisan something like what the Boston Abolitionist was so long to the negro . The trades ' union bodies , who felt ae*rieved at the unjust suspicion which made them a party to hideous crimes they abhorred , began to hold public meetings to repudiate the charge , and record their detestation of the Sheffield outrages . Professor Beesly attended one of these meetings in London . He made a speech , in which he told the working men that he thought enough had been done in the way of disavowing crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that there was no need of their further humiliating themselves ; and that it was rather odd the English Aristocracy had such a horror of murderers among the poorer classes , seeing how very fond they were of men like Eyre , of Jamaica ! In fact , Professor Beesly uplifted his voice very honestly , but rather recklessly and out of time , against the social hypocrisy which is the stain and curse of London society , and which is never so happy as when it can find some chance of denouncing sin or crime among Republicans , or Irishmen , or workin*men . There was nothing Professor Beesly said which had not sense and truth in it ; but it might have been said more discreetly and at a better time ; and it was said with a sarcastic and scornful bitterness which is one of the characteristics of the speaker . For several days the London press literally raged at the professor . " Punch " persevered for a long time in calling him " Professor Beastly ; " a a strong effort was made to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . He was talked of and written of as if he were the advocate and the accomplice of assassins , instead of being , as he is , an honor able gentleman and an enlightened scholar , whose great influence over the working classes had always been exerted in the cause of peaceful progress and good order . It was a common thing , for days and weeks , to see the names of Broadhead and Beesly coupled with ostentatious malignity in the leading columns of London newspapers . I give these random illustrations only to show in what mai*ner the school of writers and thinkers I speak of usually present themselves before the English public . Now Mr. Harrison devotes himself to a pertinacious , powerful series of attacks on Eyre , of Jamaica , at a time when that personage is the hero and pet martyr of English society ; now Professor Beesly horrifies British respectability by pointing out that there are respectable murderers who are quite as bad as Broadhead ; now Mr. John Morley undertakes even to criticise the Oueen ; now Mr. Congreve assails the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assassins ; now the whole band unite in the defence of Fenians . This sort of thing has a startling effect upon the steady public mind of England ; // and it is thus , and not otherwise , that the public mind of England ever comes to hear of these really gifted and honest , but very antagonistic and somewhat crochetty men . Several of them are brilliant and powerful writers . Professor Beesly writes with a keen , caustic , bitter force which has something Parisian in it . I know of no writer in English journalism who more closely resembles in style a certain type of the literary gladiator of French controversy . He has much of Eugene Pelletan in him , and something of Henri Rochefort , blended with a good deal that reminds one of Jules Simon . Frederick Harrison is fast becoming a power in the Radical politics and literature of England . John Morley is a young man of great culture , and who writes with a quite remarkable freshness and force . I could mention many other men of the same school ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each and every one of these is or is not a professed Positivist ) who would be distinguished as scholars and writers in the literature of any country . However they may differ on minor points , however they may differ in ability , in experience , in discretion , they have one peculiarity in common : they are to be found foremost in every liberal and radical cause ; they are always to be found on the side of the weak , and standing up for the oppressed ; they are inveterate enemies of cant ; they hate vulgar idolatry and vulgar idols . Looking back a few years , I can remember that almost , if not quite , every man I have alluded to was a fearless and outspoken advocate of the cause of the North , at a time when it was de rzg*ueur among men of " culture ' * in London to champion the cause of the South . Some of the men I have named were indefatigable workers at that time on the unfashionable side . They wrote pamphlets ; they wrote leading articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters to workingmen and poor men of all kinds ; they hardly came , in any prominent way , before the public , in most of this work . It brought them , probably , no notoriety or recognition whatever on this side of the ocean ; but their work was a power in England . I feel convinced that , in any case , the English workingmen would have gone right on such a question as that which was at issue between North and South . As Mr. Motley truly said in his address to the New York Historical Society , the workers and the thinkers were never misled ; but I am bound to say that the admirable knowledge of the realities of the subject ; the clear , quick , and penetrating judgment , and the patient , unswerving , hope and confidence which were so signally displayed by the London workingmen from first to last of that great struggle , were in no slight degree the result of the teaching and the labor of men like Professor Beesly and Frederick Harrison . If I were to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American reader more readily and completely familiar with the picture which the word calls up in the minds of Londoners , I should do it in the following way : I should exhibit my model Positivist as a man still young for anything like prominence in English public life , but not actually young in years-say thirtyeight or forty . He has had a training at one of the great historical Universities , or at all events at the modern and popular University of London . He is. a barrister , but does not practise much , and has probably a modest competence on which he can live without working for the sake of living , and can indulge his own tastes in literature and politics . He has immense earnestness and great self-conceit . He has an utter contempt for dull men and timid or half-measure men , and he scorns Whigs even more than Tories . He devotes much of his . time generously and patiently to the political and other instruction of working men . He writes in the " Fortnightly Review , " and sometimes in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westminster Review . " He plunges into gallant and fearless controversy with the " Pall Mall Gazette , " and he is not easily worsted , for his pen is sharp and his ink very acrid . Nevertheless , is any great question stirring , with a serious principle or a deep human interest at the heart of it , he is sure to be found on the right side . Where the controversy is of a smaller kind and admits of crotchet , then he is pretty sure to bring out a crotchet of some kind . He is perpetually giving the " Saturday Review " an opportunity to ridicule him and abuse him , and he does not care . He writes pamphlets and goes to immense trouble to get up the facts , and expense to give them to the world , and he never grudges trouble or money , where any cause or even any crotchet is to be served . He is ready to stand up alone , against all the world if needs be , for his opinions or his friends . Benevolent schemes which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself about . I never heard of him on a platform with the Earl of Shaftesbury , and I fancy he has a contempt for all patronage of the poor or projects of an eleemosynary character . He is for giving men their political rights and educating them-if necessary compelling them to be educated ; and he has little faith in any other way of doing good . He has , of course , a high admiration for and faith in Mr. Mill . His nature is not quite reverential-in general he is rather inclined to sit in the chair of the scorner ; but if he reverenced any living man it would be Mill . He admires the manly , noble character of Bright , and his calm , strong eloquence . I do not think he cares much about Gladstone-I rather fancy our Positivist looks upon Gladstone as somewhat weak and unsteady  --  and with him to be weak is indeed to be miserable . Disraeli is to him an object of entire scorn and detestation , for he can endure no one who has not deeply-rooted principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a theory about China ; he gets quite beside himself in his anger over the anonymous leading articles of the London press . He is not an English type of man at all , in the present and conventional sense . He cares not a rush about tradition , and mocks at the wisdom of our ancestors . The bare fact that some custom , or institution , or way of thinking has been sanctioned and hallowed by long generations of usage , is in his eyes rather aj5rirnci fade reason for despising it than otherwise . He is pitilessly intolerant of all superstitions-save his own-that is to say , he is intolerant in words and logic and ridicule , for the wildest superstition would find him its defender , if it once came to be practically oppressed or even threatened . He is " ever a fighter , " like one of Browning 's heroes ; he is the knight-errant , the Quixote of modern English politics . He admires George Eliot in literature , and , I should say , he regards Charles Dickens as a sort of person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do not hear of his going much to the theatre , and it is a doubt to me if he has yet heard of the " Grande Duchesse . " Life with him is a very earnest business , and , although he has a pretty gift of sarcasm , which he uses as a weapon of offence against his enemies , I can not , with any effort of imagination , picture him to myself as in the act of making a joke . A small drawing-room would assuredly hold all the london Positivists who make themselves effective in English politics . Yet I do not hesitate to say that they are becoming-that they have already become  --  a power which no one , calculating on the chances of any coming struggle , can afford to leave out of his consideration . Their public influence thus far has been wholly for good ; and they set up no propaganda that I have ever seen or heard of as regards either philosophy or religion . The course of lectures I have already mentioned was the // nearest approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember , and it created little or no sensation in London . Indeed , little or no publicity was sought for it . I have read lately somewhere that a newspaper , specially devoted to the propagation and vindication of Positivism , is about to be , or has been started in London . I do not know whether this is true or not ; but for any such journal I should anticipate a very small circulation , and an existence only to be maintained by continual subsidy . So quietly have these men hitherto pursued their course , whatever it may he , in religion or religious philosophy , that it was long indeed before any idea got abroad that the cluster of highly-educated , ultra-radical thinkers , who were to be found sharpshooting on the side of every great human principle and every oppressed cause , and who seemed positively to delight in standing up against the vulgar rush of public opinion , were anything more than chance associates , or were bound by any tie more close and firm than that of general political sympathy . Even now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classify them , in a vague sort of way , as " those Positivists , " they make so little parade of any peculiarity of faith that , without precise and personal knowledge , it would be rash to say for certain that this or that member of the group is or is not an actual professor of the Comtist religion . I read a few days ago , in one of the few sensible books written on America by an Englishman , some remarks made about a peculiar view of *urope 's duty to Egypt , which was described as being held by " the Comtists . " I do not know whether the men referred to hold the view ascribed to them or not ; but , assuredly , if they do , the fact has no more direct connection with their Comtism than Bright 's free-trade views have with Bright 's Quakerism . An illustration , however , will serve well enough as an example of the vague and careless sort of way in which doctrines and the men who profess them get mixed up together insolubly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who told the European diplomatist that if he changed his religion at all he would become a Roman Catholic , because he observed that Roman Catholic people always grew the best wine , was not more unreasonable in his logic than many well-informed men when they are striving to connect cause and effect in dealing with the religion of others . I do not myself make any attempt to explain why a follower of Comte 's worship should , at least in England , be always on the side of liberty and equality and human progress . Indeed , if inclined to discuss such a question at all , I should rather be disposed to put it the other way and ask how it happens that men so enlightened and liberal in education and principles should yield a moment 's obedience to the ghostly shadow of Roman Catholic superstition , which Auguste Comte , in the decaying years of his noble intellect , conjured up to form a new religion . But I am quite content to let the question go unanswered-and should be willing , indeed , to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than to direct the attention of American readers to the fact that a new set or sect has arisen to influence English politics , and that their influence and its origin are different from anything which , judging by the history of previous generations , one might naturally have been led to expect . " Culture " in England has , of late years , almost invariably ranked itself on the side of privilege . The Oxford undergraduate shouts himself hoarse in cheering for Disraeli and groaning for Bright . Oxford rejects Gladstone the moment he becomes a Liberal . The vigorous Radicalism of Thorold Rogers costs him his chair as professor of political economy , although no man in England is a more perfect master of some of the more important branches of that science . The // journals which are started for the sake of being read by men of " culture " are sure to throw their influence , nine times out of ten , into the cause of privilege and class ascendency . The " Saturday Review " does this deliberately ; the " Pall Mall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bosom of the universities themselves a band of keen , acute , fearless gladiators , who throw themselves into the van of every great movement which works for democracy , equality and freedom . They invade the press and the platform ; they write in this journal and in that ; they are always writing , always printing ; they are ready for any assailant , however big , they are willing to work with any ally , however small ; they shrink from no logical consequence or practical inconvenience of any argument or opinion ; they take the working man by the hand and talk to him and tell him all they know  --  and it is something worth studying , the fact that their scholarship and his no-scholarship so often come to the same conclusion . They will work with anybody , because they go farther than almost anybody ; and they will allow anybody the full swing of his own crotchet , even though he be not so willing to give them scope enough for theirs . Thus they are commonly associated with Goldwin Smith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imperialism , and who sees in Mirabeau only a " Voltairean debauchee ; " with Tom Hughes , who is a sturdy member of the Church of England , and does not , I fancy , care three straws about the policy of ideas ; with Bright , whose somewhat Puritanical mind draws back with a kind of dread from anything that savors of free-thinking ; with Auberon Herbert , the mild young aristocrat , converted from Toryism by pure sentimentalism and philanthropy ; with Connolly , the eloquent Irish plasterer , whose vigorous stump oratory aroused the warm admiration of Louis Blanc . It would be impossible that such a knot of men , so gifted and so fearless , so independent and so unresting , so keen of pen , and so unsparing of logic , should be without a clear and marked influence on the politics of England . It is quite a curious phenomenon that such a group of men should be found in close and constant co-operation with the English artisan , his trades ' union organizations , and his political cause . Frederick Harrison represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquire into the whole operation of the trades ' unions . Professor Beesly writes continually in the " Beehive , " the newspaper which is the organ of George Potter and the trades ' societies . I can not see how the cause of Democracy can fail to derive strength and help from this sort of alliance , and I therefore welcome the influence upon English politics of the little group of Positivist penmen , believing that it will have a deeper reach than most people now imagine , and that where it operates effectively at all , it will be for good .
