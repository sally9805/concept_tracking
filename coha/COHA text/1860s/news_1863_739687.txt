txt We are glad to see some indication of de'ided progress on the part of the British Government toward an honest observance of its neutrality obligations in respect to rebel ) rivateering . A year ago last February , the Florida was launched , pierced for six guns lad provided with magazines , was manned with a crew of Englishmen with hardly an exception , took onboard a cargo of one hunlied and seventy-three tons of arms , and notwithstanding the perfect notoriety that she was : o engage in privateering business , she was ' flowed to sail without the slightest hinlrance ; and all the answer the remonstrances of Mr. ADAMS could elicit from Earl ** was " a polite expression of regret . " Four months afterward the Alaba , na was in like manner launched ; her whole manner of construction and peculiar adaptation to war purposes , as well as the notorilus fact that the whole direction of her buildMg and outfit , and shipping of the crew , were int he hands of the agents of the rebel Government , showed conclusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United states ; the remonstrances of 111r . Aeams in this case only led in about a month to a sham attempt to stop her , when it was too late . Now , after an interval of eight months , the little propeller Alexandra , with no gunports at all , or any of the visible appurtenances of a manof-war , presenting simply the appearance of a schooner-rigged steam-yacht , is no sooner launched than she is seized by order from the Foreign Oliice . No men had been shipped for her , no arms had been taken on board , and not even her engines had been set . So far as we can judge , the evidence against her was not a fiftieth part so palpable as that in either of the other two cases , and yet Earl Russym. hurries his officials , post haste , to put the " broad arrow " on her mast . Now , it is possible that the explanation for this singular difference of action may be found in the fact that the Alexandra is so small that she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We far prefer , however , to believe that it is the earnest of a new policy upon the part of the British Ministry . The liberal and just views just set forth by Earl RUSSELL , in reply to the claim of the owner of the Peterhoff , favor that supposition . Beside , we have the authority of the London News for the statement that the Government has issued instructions to the Liverpool officials in all cases , where there is the slightest suspicion that ships are being built for other than neutral Powers , to present their case at once to the legal authorities . It is difficult to make this harmonious with the contumelious tone of Lord PALMERSYON in the late debate ; but , perhaps , that was simply the last flighty flicker of expiring spite . if this change in British action shall prove real and permanent , there is cause for great rejoicing . We shall hail it not simply or chiefly bemuse it weakens the resources of the rebels . It will undoubtedly do that , yet it would hardly hasten the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle has got to he fought upon the land , alike whether our commerce cont ! nues to be preyed upon or not . The great point gained is not that we are relieved of any danger of rebel triumph ? there has been ne such danger  --  but that it removes the moral certainty of a war with England . Nobody who understands American character , and the influences which give final shape to our public affairs , has doubted that the continuanoc by the English Government of its had faith of fast year would inevitably , sooner or later , occasion war between the two countries . This virtual alliance with the rebels in destroying our commerce , it was certain , would either provoke reprisals upon British commerce while yet we were engaged with the rebellion , or would hereafter be the basis of . vast claims upon England for indemnification , which nothing short of war would adjust . A thorough carrying out of neutral obligations and faithful adherence to international law , from this time on , will cause the past to be ** and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been under the contrary conduct . Were there any di:tposition to seek for motives which may have led to this change of policy , they could be easily found . Lord LYONS himself furnished the ltey in the chasing lines of his memorable dispatch , when he adverted to " the immediate and obvious laterest of Great Britain " as " the point chiefly worthy of consideration . " It would not be uncharitable to assume , that the action of the late Congress empowering the President to is sue letters-of-marque , has had a favorable influence upon Earl RUSSELL 'S comprehension of neutral obligations . So , too , doubtless , has the growing determination of the American people that the disregard of those obligations shalt be atoned for to the full . And so , too , has the increasing resentment of the laboring classes of England that the side with which they sympathize should be so wickedly injured . Moreover , the passage of our Conscription bill , increasing soldiers to any required number , instead of the anticipated depletion of our armies  --  the triumphant success of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the reunited and intensified public sentiment of the North , in place of the internecine strife so confidently expected , and all the accumulating evidences that the National power will certainly overmaster the Confederacy , have , doubtless , had their influence . The English Ministry , at last , there is reason to believe , is really getting to regard the United States as entitled , at least , to be feared . That secured , all is secured .
