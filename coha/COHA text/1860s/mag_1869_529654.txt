txt THE MEAN YANKEES AT HOME . BY A SUMMER VISITOR . I *JH OSE horrible Yanks ! I have seen them in their native haunts . The most dreadful creatures become interesting when , regarding them only as objects of natural history , we creep up near their den , and watch them as they devour their prey , caress their cubs , and gambol in the sun . Perhaps a busy universe , which hits heard already a good deal about the mean , low , cheating , infidel , and entirely odious Yankee , may yet be willing to lean back in its arm-chair for a short time , and learn how he looks to a stranger 's eyes , and how he comports himself amid his own hills and rocks , in that unique organization of his , a New England town . There was published in this maga zine , a year or two since , an article upon Chicago , which chanced to attract the notice of a young gentleman then residing among us , a citizen of the Argentine Republic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so much struck with the exploits of the people of Chicago , that he translated the article into Spanish , and caused it to be published as a pamphlet in his native land , with a Preface calling upon his countrymen to imitate the spirit , energy , forethought , and patriotisin displayed by the men of the prairie metropolis . It was well done of him ; for , indeed , the creators of Chicago have performed , and are performing , the task assigned them in a manner unexampled in the history of the world ; 4 // and the record of what they have done and are doing will for ages be a chapter in our history honorable to this nation and instructive to others . But perhaps one of those quiet towns sleeping among the umbrageous hills of New England is a triumph of man over circumstances and over himself not less remarkable than the more striking and splendid achievements of the Chicagonese . And what is Chicago but a New En*land town in extremely novel circumstances , that was forced to undertake enormous enterprises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high - pressure Boston ? If I could only succeed in revealing to mankind the town of New England ,  - -  its defects as well as its merits , - I should have produced something worth translating into every tongue . It is evident that the Yankee system , with modifications , is destined to prevail over the fairest parts of this continent , if not finally over the best portions of the other . It prevails already in the West as far as San Francisco , the famous Vigilance Committee of which was a veritable town meeting . Wherever the Yankee soldier has tramped the Yankee schoolmarm will teach . Noble and chivalric gentlemen may throw stones at her windows , burn her school-house , drive her from their nei*rhborh but - * ood ; she reappears , she or her cousin , - and the work of Yankeefication proceeds . First Julius C*sar , then Roman civilization , then Christianity . The soldier must always go first , and open the country . In this fortunate instance , the gentle and knowing schoolmarm quickly follows the man of war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the South upon the general plan of New En * land towns . It is *hard for the noble and chivalric gentlemen to hear , but it seems inevitable . The Carolinas may object , and Georgia expel ; Texas may slay , and Louisiana massacre , - it will not avail ; this is the fate in reserve for them . The Yankee schoolmarm is extremely addicted to writing long letters home , which go the round of the village , are carried into the next county , and are sent at last to circulate by mail over all the land . Most graphic and powerful some of her letters are , and New England knows her new conquest in this way . The schoolmarm 's lover has thoughts of settling there , when the land itself is " settled . " Her uncle the capitalist has long had an eye on those rich lands , those unused watercourses , those mines and quarries . She is merely one of the first to tread the path worn by the army shoe stamped U.S. A. A New England town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a town , though it may have a town in it , and two or three villa6es besides . It is a subdivision of a county , or , to use the language of the law-books , it is " an organized portion of the inhabitants of a State , within defined limits of territory , within the same county . " It may consist of only three or four hundred people , or of several thousands . Perhaps two thousand may be an average number , which gives about threQ hundred voters ; and the average circumference of the territory may he about ten miles . Every five years the selectmen are required to " perambulate " the boundaries , to see that the boundary-stones and guide-boards are right ; and this work , I believe , is generally done in one day . The inhabitants* of this area are an association for the performance of certain duties imposed upon them by the State . They are , says the law , a " corporate body , " which is intrusted with powers defined and limited . It can fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a walk , or twenty dollars for declining a town office . It can itself be fined fifty dollars for not having a cattle-pound , five hundred dollars for not electing town officers , a thousand dollars if a person falls through a rotten bridge and loses his life , and three thousand dollars for sending to the legislature more members than it is entitled to . It is responsible - as much so as a railroad company - for any accidents happening // through its fault , and can claim damages for an injury done to itself . It can sue and be sued as thou h it were one man . It can hold , hire , huy , sell , let , lease , or give away real estate . It can tax and be taxed , - both , however , for purposes named in the law , and for no others . For example , it can raise money by taxation to pay for schools , public libraries , the support of the poor , guide-hoards , burial-grounds , bridges , roads , markets , pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , houses destroyed to stop a conflagration , the prosecution and defence of suits . Such of these things as concern other towns , or the county , the State , the United States , or the universe , each town is compelled to provide , - bridges , pounds , roads , and schools , for example . But the towns may or may not vote money for hay-scales or a public library . The schools are a necessity ; the library is merely desirable in a high degree . The cattle-pound protects neighboring towns from devastation ; but it is a question for each town to decide , whether or not it will have a public clock or a soldiers ' monument . The governing power of a New England town is the whole body of voters in town meeting assembled . Speaking generally ( for all the States of New England have not yet quite come up to the standard of the most advanced ) , we may say , that every man , white or black , is a voter , who can read the constitution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not an alien , a lunatic , a pauper , or a convict . The exclusion of paupers is of small consequence , because in most of the towns there are no paupers able to go to the polls , and in many there are no paupers at all . At the time of the first cable celebration , Mr. Cyrus Field , desirous that all the world should rejoice , sent orders to his native village in New England that a banquet should be provided at his e. pense for the paupers of the whole town . The selectmen sent back word that there were no pau pers ; and there are none there now . Your mean Yankee is a stickler for justice ; and it would offend his sense of justice , that a man who had contributed nothing to the fund raised by taxation should have a voice in directing its expenditure . He is beginning to think , too , that it is hardly fair to tax a widow or an independent spinster , and refuse her a vote in town meeting . Here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , and pronounces it unwise to exclude such women as Miss Sedgwick , Mrs. Stowe , Miss Catherine Beecher , and Mrs. Horace Mann , while admitting to the franchise every male citizen who can be trusted alone out of doors , and who can boggle through a paragraph of the Constitution . In some towns , where a few crusty old farmers can always be depended on to defeat a liberal scheme , the votes of the ladies , it is thought , would give a lift to the library and a blow to the grog-shop , and help all the civilizing measures . T.he necessity of women 's assistance becomes more apparent as the towns advance in wealth and refinement ; and the Yankee would long ago have seen this , and sought the aid of the decorative sex , but for a few words in an ancient epistle . The exclusion from the polls of men who can not read works nothing but good. * It is a measure absolutely necessary in the peculiar circumstances of the United States ; and I will venture to predict that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the city of New York , become a prey to the spoiler . This law , however , excludes very few natives of the soil . If , in a New England town , there chances to be a native who can not read and write , he is re " No person shall have the right to vote , or be eligible to office under the Constitution of this Coinmonwesith , wisoshall not be able to read the Constitution in the Englisls language , and write his name vided , however , that the provisions ofehis amendment shall not apply to any person prevented by a physical disability from complying with its requisitions , nor to any person who now has the right to vote , nor to any persons who shall be sixty years of age or upwards at the time this amendment shall take effect . " Con , sli/ui ion of llZassecieasetts. 1869.1 63 // 64 garded as a curiosity , and is pointed out to strangers as one of the objects of interest in the place . There is one such man near Stockbridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer as the only native of New En* land in all that region who could neither read nor write . The people appeared to be rather proud of him than otherwise , as though he had given no slight proof of an ingenious mind in having escaped so many boy-traps and man-traps , baited with spelling-books , as they have in New England . The reading law merely keeps away from the polls the grossly ignorant among the foreign population , who , being unable to read , are dependent upon other men s eves and minds for their political information , and who can be driven in herds to the polls by the party having the least scruples . Major De Forest , in one of his valuable and entertaining articles on the " Man and Brother , " has intimated an opinion that the black man will never associate in this country on equal terms with the white man . Never is a long time , and we can not even see into the next century ; but I should say that the condition of the colored people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not more than twelve or fifteen thousand negroes in Massachusetts ; but they are so unequally distributed that you may occasionally find a considerable number of them in one town . They stand before the law equal to the white man ; their children sit in the public schools side by side with his ; they are treated with consideration and respect ; they have the same opportunities to acquire property as the white man ; they go with him to the ballot-box , and vote on the same terms and conditions , - nevertheless , their social position is precisely the same in New England as it is in North Carolina . They usually live in a cluster of cottages in the outskirts of the village ; the men are laborers or waiters , and the women take in washing or go out to service . They live in peace and abundance , but January , they are no nearer social equality with the whites now than they were thirty years ago . They seldom get on so far as to own a farm , seldom learn a trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the free high schools - one of which nearly every town in New England supports , or helps support - a colored youth is rarely found . In and near Stockbridge , for example , there is a colored population of two hundred , and they have been settled there for many years ; but no colored boy or girl has ever applied for admission to the high school , though it is free to all . But the negro is an indispensable and delicious ingredient in the too serious and austere population of New England . They appear to be the only people there who ever abc0zdon themselves to innocent merriment . What a joyous scene is one of the negro balls so frequently given in some of the New England villages ! In the morning , the stranger notices upon the lordly , widespreading elm that shades the postoffice a neatly written paper , notifying the public that an " entertainment " is to be given that evening for the " benefit " of some afflicted person , - perhaps a woman whose husband a ruthless constable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy a good time are respectfully invited to attend , - admission , twenty-five cents , " for which a substantial supper of pork and beans and new cider is furnished . Soon after eight in the evening the village resounds with the voice of a colored Stentor , who calls out the figures of the quadrille , and all the world is thus notified that the " entertainment " has begun . The scene within the ball-room might make some persons hesitate to decide which destiny were the more desirable in New England , - to be born white or black . The participants seem so unconsciously and entirely happy ! An ancient uncle , white-haired and very lame , stands near the entrance , seizes the newcomers with both hands , and gives them a roaring and joyous welcome ; and there is a one-legged man with a crutch , and // 1869 . The IlLea ; z Yankees at Home . four mothers with infants in their arms , who go through a quadrille with the best of them . The mothers , however , when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a passing friend to hold . The hand , which consists of two male fiddlers and a woman who plays the accordion , is seated upon a platform at one end of the long room , and *playswith eyes upcast , ecstatic , andkeeps a heel apiece going heavily upon the boards . The room itself seems to he quivering . There is no walking through a quadrille here ; hut each performer , besides doing his prescribed steps , cuts as many supplementary capers as he can execute in the intervals . A dance begins , it is true , with some slight show of moderation ; hut as it proceeds the dancers throw themselves into it with a vigor and animation that increase every moment , until the quadrille ends in a glorious riot and delirium of dance and fun . No Mussulman would ask these people why they did not require their servants to do their dancing for ( hem . On the contrary , that famous pacha , catching their most contagious merriment , would have sprung upon the fioor , and dashed his three tails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the smallest violation of decorum ; all was as innocent as it was enjoyable . As the room was lined with white spectators , perhaps we shall some day learn the trick of cheap , innocent , and hearty enjoyment . One thing was very noticeable , and would certainly be noticed by any one familiar with the South ,  --  the purity of blood exhibited in the faces of the company . Among the one hundred and fifty dancers , there were perhaps ten who were not quite black ; and this was an ancient settlement of colored people , dating back beyond the recollection of the present inhabitants . The only fault with which their white neighbors charge them is , that one or two in a hundred has not yet got the old plantation steal out of their blood . A person interested in the health question would observe the roundness and all but universal vig orous health of these children of the tropics , which is another proof that human nature in America does not dwindle necessarily . " In town meeting assembled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters of this small and convenient republic meet to elect town officers , consider proposed improvements , and vote taxes . The town meeting is a parliament , of which every voter is an equal member , and the authority of which is final so long as its acts are legal . It is a public meeting clothed with power . I will here respectfully invite the attention of the Argentine Republic , France , Italy , Austria , Russia , and all countries supposed to be groaning under the yoke of the oppressor , and hoping one day to throw off that yoke , to the following truth , now for the first time given to the world : - THAT PEOPLE IS FIT FOR FREEDOM WHICH CAN HOLD A PROPER PUBLIC MEETING . To us how easy ! to a great part of the rest of mankind how impossible ! Before a community reaches the stage of development which admits of the public meeting , there must exist in it considerable ability and knowledge , and there must be a certain prevalence . f what may he styled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must respect themselves , but respect one another also , and , along with a proper confidence in their own opinions , have a genuine tolerance for those of their neighbors . With an ability to convince others , there must be in the people the possibility of being convinced , as well as of frankly submitting to a decision the most adverse to that for which they had striven . A strong , keen , and constant sense of justice must be tempered , by a spirit of accommodation , an aversion to standing upon trifles , and a disposition to welcome a reasonable compromise . There must be in many of the people a true public spirit , and in some a very great and deep love of the public welfare , and a capacity for taking a prodigious amount // of trouble for a public object . The desire to shine , so natural to immature persons and races , must have been by many outgrown , or , at least , exalted into a noble ambition to be of service , and thus to win the approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three individuals might render profitable debate impossible ; nor less harmful is that other manifestation of morbid self-love which we call bashfulness . The horrible Yanks , with all their faults , do actually possess the qualities requisite for holding a public meeting in a higher degree than any other people . They have governed themselves by public meeting for two hundred years or more . It seems now instinctive in them , when a thing is to be done or considered by a body of men , to put it to the vote and be governed by the decision of the majority . The most curious illustration of this fact that has been recorded is the one related by Mrs. John Adams in one of her letters of 1774 to her husband . The men of Braintree and neighboring towns , alarmed lest the British general should seize their store of powder , assembled on a certain Sunday evening to the number of two hundred , marched to the powder-house , took out the powder , conveyed it to a place of safety , and secreted it . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him some still more odious documents aimed at the liberty of the Commonwealth . This man they took with them , and , when the powder was disposed of , they turned their attention to him and his documents . Readers familiar with the period do not need to be reminded that these men , marching so silently and seriously on that Sunday evening , were profoundly moved and excited . All New England , indeed , was thrilling and palpitating with mingled resolve and apprehension . Nevertheless , instinct , or ancient habit , was stronger than passion , even at such a crisis , in these two hundred Yankee men , and therefore they resolved themselves into a public meeting . Upon the hostile January , . warrants being produced and exhibited , it was put to the vote whether they should be burnt or preserved . The majority voting for burning them , the two hundred gathered in a circle round the lantern , and looked on in silence while the offensive papers were consumed . That done , - and no doubt there were blazing eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers , - " they called a vote whether ' they shouldhuzza ; but , it being Sunday evening , it*assed in the negative . " The reader who comprehends the entire significance of that evening 's performance knows New England . If I were a painter , I would try and paint the scene at the moment the blazing papers flashed light into the blazing eyes . If I were a king , I should think several times before going to war with people of that kind . After a practice of two centuries , the Yankees would be able to hold a very good town meeting without assistance , and yet everything relating to it is prescribed and regulated by statute . The people must be notified in just such a way ; the business to be done must be expressed in the summons ; and nothing can be voted upon or discussed unless it has been thus expressed . In case the selectmen of a town should unreasonably refuse to call a town meeting , any ten voters can apply to a justice of the peace , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almost . every conceivable , abuse or unfairness has been anticipated and guarded against by the legislature , and yet the town meeting is absolutely unfettered in doing right . It may also do wrong ' if it chooses , provided it does wrong in the right way , and tle wrong is of such a nature as to harm nobody but itself . And I will here observe , that , if any one would know how deeply rooted in the heart of man is the love of justice , and would inspect the most complete system of fair play mankind possesses , let him buy , keep , and habitually read the volume containing the Constitution and Revised Statutes of Massachusetts . Most of the standard law books are Tue Meaze Yazikees at Home . // interesting and edifying , but this one is the most instructive and affecting of them all . It shows , in a striking manner , how much better the heart of man is than his head ; for the community which wrought out this beautiful system of justice and humanity believed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total depravity Delightful inconsistency ! Would that all the head 's mistakes could be so gloriously refuted by the other , organ ! The principal town meeting of the year generally occurs in the spring , when the town officers are elected by ballot . The town officers are : Three , five , seven , or nine selectmen , who are the chief officers , and take care of things in general ; a town clerk ; three or more truant officers ; three or more assessors ; three or more overseers of the poor ; a town treasurer ; one or more surveyors of highways ; a constable ; one or more collectors of taxes ; a pound-keeper ; two or more fenceviewers ; one or more surveyors of lumber ; one or more measurers of wood and bark ; a sealer of weights and measures ; a gauger of liquid measures ; a superintendent of hay-scales . Here is a chance for office-seekers ! But , unfortunately , the emoluments attached to these offices are as small as the duties are light ; and it has been found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected , under penalty of a fine of twenty dollars , - a sum much larger than the usual amount of the fees . But then no man can be made to serve two years in succession . These officers being elected , the town parliament proceeds to consider proposed improvements and appropriations ; and you may frequently hear in the town hall excellent debating , very much in the quiet and rather homely manner of the British House of Commons , when country members get on their legs to discuss country matters . There is usually a total abstinence from all flights of oratory , for every man who speaks or votes has a personal and pecuniary interest in the question under debate . He who advocates a stone bridge in place of the rickety old wooden one knows that he will have to pay his share of the expense ; and he who opposes it knows that he will have to cross the rickety structure , and will have to pay his part of a thousand-dollar fine when it lets a pedler through to destruction . In the list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " truant officers . " They must be explained . There is one thing upon which these mean Yankees are entirely and unanimously resolved , and it is this : That no child , of whatever race , color , or capacity , shall grow up among them in ignorance . In the oldest of their records we find the existence of the schoolhouse taken for granted . When there was no church in a town , no courthouse , no town-hall , there was always a school-house , which served for all public purposes ; and ever since that early day the school system has been extending and improving . Very pleasant it is of a summer day to ride past the little lone school-houses , and peep in at the open door , and see the schoolmarm surrounded with her little flock of little children , whose elder brothers are in the fields ; nor less pleasant is it to mark in every village the free high school , where the pupils who have outgrown the common school continue their studies , if they desire it , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily hour for base-ball besides . Indeed , it is an excellent thing to be a child in this land of the Yankees . If you are a good boy or girl you have these common and high schools for your instruction ; if you are a bad boy , they send you off to a reformatory school to be made better , or to a ship school to be changed into a good sailor ; and if you are a bad girl , there is a girls ' industrial school for you , where you will be taught good morals and the sewingmachine . And they do not leave the bad boys and girls to go on in their evil ways until they are developed into criminals . The towns in Massachusetts are now authorized to appoint the truant officers before mentioned , whose duty it is to take care that every child // between the ages of six and sixteen shall avail itself either of public or private means of education . No miserly parent , no hard master , no careless guardian , can now defraud a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easy for him to go on instructing himself all his life . By way of showing how much in earnest the Yankees are in this matter , I will insert upon this page certain " bylaws concerning truants and absentees , " which I had the pleasure of reading last summer on a handbill displayed in the post-office of a small village in New England . It seems to me that these by-laws may convey a valuable hint to the Argentine and other republics . The following selection may be sufficient for our purpose - " 2 . Any child between the ages of six and sixteen , who while a member of any school , shall absent himself or herself from school without the consent of his or her teacher , parent , or guardian , shall be deemed a truant . " ( Penalty , a fine of twenty dollars , or a term not exceeding two years in a reform school. ) " 3 . Any child between the ages of six and fifteen , who shall not attend some public school or suitable institution of instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which shall be consecutive in the summer term , and six of which shall be consecutive in the *vinter term , shall be deemed an absentee. *4 . ABSENTEES OF THE SECOND CLASS . - Children between the ages of seven and sixteen years of age , wandering in the streets or loitering in stores , shops , or public places , having no lawful occupation or business , and growing up in ignorance , are hereby placed under supervision of the truant officers , so far as the law provides . The first offence shall be reported to parent , guardian , or master of said child by a truant officer , and , in case of the failure to secure said child the requisite amount of schooling or instruction elsevhere , he shall be fined twenty dollars ; for the second offence of the same person , the child shall be sent to the alms-January , house or to the State Reform School , or the nautical branch of the same , or State Industrial School for girls , for a period agreeable to the statutes , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide . " " 6 . It shall be the duty of every truant officer to inquire diligently concerning all persons , between the ages aforesaid , who seem to be idle or vagrant , or who , whether employed or unemployed , appear to he growing up in ignorance , and to enter a complaint against any one found unlawfully absent from school , or violating any of these by-laws. " 7 . It shall be the duty of every truant officer , prior to making any coimplaint before a justice , to notify the truant or absentee child and its parents or guardian of the penalty for the offence . If he can obtain satisfactory pledges of reformation , which pledges shall subsequently be kept , he shall forbear to prosecute . " In one of those country towns of New England , a person likely to be elected a truant officer would have some knowledge of all the inhabitants . Hence it is now almost impossible for the most perverse or neglected child to avoid getting a little schooling . Each town , I should add , pays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reformatory school , provided the parents or guardians can not . The female teachers employed in the common schools receive now from five to eight dollars a week , and the master of a country high school from ei ht hund red to two thousand dollars a year . Twelve hundred dollars is very frequently the salary . Now , in a New England village , an active man who has a saving wife and an ordinary-sized garden , can live decently upon the salary last named , send a son to college , and give his daughters lessons on the piano . I suppose that in New England there is a less unequal division of property than in any other region of a civilized country . I chanced to be in a country bank there last July , about the time when the coupons due on the first of Tue . Llica ; I Yankees at . Houze. // 1869. that month had been mostly paid , and the money for each individual had been done up in a neatly folded small package . The village was small , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenbacks belonged to the farmers , mechanics , and manufacturers of the neighborhood . I think there must have been half a peck of them , - perhaps a hundred packages . There are country towns in New England where nearlya every respectable house has some United States bonds in it , and the Savings Bank will wield a capital of half a million dollars besides . Reason : diversified industry . These Yankees , finding themselves planted upon a soil not too productive , were compelled at a very early period to become good political economists ; and while the fathers scratched the hard surface of the soil for a few bushels of corn , the sons rigged small schooners , and fished off the coast for cod . By and by they got on so far as to build ships , in which they sailed to the coast of Guinea , brought thence a load of slaves and a few quills of gold-dust , sold the slaves to the West-Indians for molasses , brought the molasses home , dis- tilled it into rum , took the rum to Guinea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England for manufactured goods , and made the rest into watch-chains and gold beads . Thus Newport was enriched ; thus was founded in Rhode Island the manufacture of jewelry and silver-ware which has attained such marvellous proportions . This infernal commerce is now regarded by the people of New England as wise and honest Catholics regard the Inquisition and the Massacre of St. Bartholomew ; that is , they wonder how their forefathers could have been guilty of it , and attribute it chiefly to the general barharism of the age . But the diversified industry remains , and it has enriched New England . Those streams which wind about the wooded hills and mountains of this region , useless as they are for navigation , shallow , winding , rocky , and rapid , frequently have such a descent that there can be a factory village every mile or two of their course for many successive miles . Travellers by such railroads as the Housatonic know this to their sorrow ; for these villages are so frequent along the banks of the Housatonic . River , that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every mile and a half . Among the glorious , wood-crowned bills of Berkshire I have passed in an afternoon ride the following manufactories : an iron-smelting furnace ; two very extensive manufactories of the finest writingpaper , the linen rags for which are brought from the shores of the Mediterranean ; a large woollen mill ; a small factory of folding-chairs and campstools ; a manufactory of something in cotton ; a mill for grinding poplar wood into material for paper ; and some others , at a little distance from the road , the nature of which could not be discerned . All these may be seen in a ride of ten miles along the Housatonic , and all are kept in motion by that little bustling stream . So much of this diversified industry as is legitimate ( i.e. unforced by a stimulating tariff ) is beneficial ; the rest is excessive and hurtful . It is excellent for the farmer to have a market near his barn , but it is bad for him to have to pay such a price for labor as neutralizes that advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree that I have known a family try for four months to get a servant-girl in vain ; and the few girls in a village that will go out to service are often the refuse of creation , and rule their unhappy mistresses with a rod of iron . The factories , too , are attracting to some parts of New England Irish and German emigrants much faster than they can be assimilated . I read in a religious Report : " The mountain regions of Massachusetts are continually drained of a large part of their most enterprising population ; the furnaces buy up the farms for the sake of their wood , and , having skinned them , ' - in the expressive language of the region , - sell them out at low prices to // 70 foreigners , who- are thus , in a number of places , coming into possession of hundreds of these mountain acres . This transfer of population , while apparently beneficial both to those who go and those who come , throws new burdens on the churches , and adds new embarrassments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Considerable numbers of the Canadian French are now coming into Berkshire , turning its forests into fuel for the mills and founderies. ' * This is partly owing to the tariff stimulation of the factories , and tends to show that stimulation is no better for the body politic than for the corporeal system of man . The truth remains , however , that diversified industry is one of the chief secrets of a country 's prosperity and progress . The most desperate and deplorable poverty now to be seen on earth  --  so I am assured by an intelligent and universal traveller - is in some of the sugar and coffee districts of Cuba , where Nature has lavished upon the land her richest gifts . There is room there for the planter , the slave , and the importer of manufactures ; all others cringe to the plantation lord , as toadies , beggars , or white trash . It is curious to see how the emigrants , who arrive in the country at the rate of a thousand a *lay , distribute themselves over the laNd , and settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New England swarm with Irish people and Germans ; but no Yankee sends for them . They come . If they do well , they induce their relations and friends to join them ; if work is scarce , if the factory closes , they either scatter among the farmers to subsist , and wait for the reopening , or a band of them moves off to Iowa , Wisconsin , or Minnesota . In the back country , employers will make considerable sacrifices to avoid closing their works during the long , snow-bound winter , partly from benevolent feeling , partly from their unwillingness to create a destitution which it will fall to them to relieve . Here , as elsewhere , it is only about one third of the workmen who save their money and improve their position in the world ; another third about hold their own , or can get credit in dull seasons sufficient to carry them over to the next period of superabundance ; another third live in such a way that , if work ceases this week , they must go hungry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the factories in odd , out-ofthe-way nooks of New England are of such afitiquity thab men who went into them as boys are now gray-headed foremen or partners . Upon the whole , I must confess that some of the factory villages , with their rews of shabby cottages close together , their tall factory buildings hui*ming with machinery , and all the refuse of manufacture lying about , do not leave an agreeable impression upon the mind of the visitor . But whatever in them is merely unpleasing to the eye admits of easy and inexpensive remedy . The time was when very few men would be farmers in New England who could help it , and farming there is still far from being an attractive or popular occupation . The dearness of labor compels most of the proprietors of the soil to work with their hands from the rising of the sun to the going down of the same ; and , so long as this is the case , the more capable of our idle species will extol the noble occupation of the farmer , and avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is beginning to detain the superior sons of farmers from the city , and now and then lures from the city a volunteer who brings to the soil a highly trained and sure intelligence . The railroads go everywhere , and enable the farmers of the most northern town of Vermont to send to New York ( three hundred and fifty miles distant ) commodities as bulky as hay and as perishable as blackberries . Along the lines of those quiet country railroads to points two hundred miles distant from New York or Boston a milk-train nightly passes , gathering up from every station its quota of cans of milk for the next morning 's supply of those cities . They January , // have a way now of " curing " milk , which , without injuring it , causes it to keep longer , and prevnts the cream from rising . A farmer among the hills of Berkshire , who cures his milk by this process , has sent to New York ( one hundred and fifty miles off ) , every night for the last eighteen months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost one can by the milk spoiling . For the information of milk consumers , I will here communicate the fact , that the milk which costs us in New York the " war price " of ten cents a quart yields the Yankee farmer only four cents . The strangest thing of all is , that it can not he brought to our doors for much less than ten cents . Another thing incredible ( but true ) is , that the Yankee farmer does not water the ilk , nor even put into each can the " lump of ice to keep it , " of which we hear in convivial hours . Special farming appears to be more remunerative than general agriculture , and is one of the causes of the growing attractiveness of the business . The factories , wherein the milk of a hundred farms is made into cheese or butter , are an unspeakable relief to farmers ' wives . Labor-saving machinery is doing wonders for the farming interest , and will do more . The high prices of produce during the last seven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and put away in their owners ' money - boxes a fe*v United States bonds . In a word , although few honest men will ever find it an easy thing to live , and every one of the legitirhate occupations makes large demands of those who exercise them successfully , it may now be said of farming in New England , that it invites , and will sufficiently reward , intelligent labor . The difficulty is the first five years . After that , if you manage well , you may have as much money as is necessary , and work no harder than is becoming . Probably there is now no business in which a little sound sense and e*tra judicious expenditure yield results so certain , so lasting , so desirable as this of farming . It seems strange that the mean Yankees should have taken so much trouble as they have to make their homes and villages pleasant to the eye . If the New-Yorker wishes to find a delightful village in which to spend the summer , he has only to go up in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is blowing toward the east , and , when the balloon is over New England , let himself gently descend into a field , and make for the nearest collection of houses . He will be almost certain to have reached a pleasant place ; but if not , there will be sure to be one a very few miles distant . I have been in New England towns of four or five thousand inhabitants , in which I could not discover by diligent search one squalid house , one untidy fence , one decidedly disagreeable object . They make their very woodsheds ornamental , and pile the wood in them so evenly that the sawed ends of the sticks make a wall smooth , clean , and compact , pleasing to behold . A frequenter of New England could tell when he had reached that strange land by the wood-piles . Almost everything you see or handle there is a mechanical curiosity , for the Yankees take infinite trouble to invent tioublesaving implements and apparatus . They have most curious and novel hinges , locks , latches , padlocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing pleases them better than to be the first to have a new and startling invention , such as a frontdoor key that weighs half an ounce ( a pretty little thing of polished steel , fit for the vest pocket , and yet capable of turning a huge lock ) , or a stove that puts on its own coal , or a gate that opens as the horseman approaches and closes when he has passed through , or a flat-iron that keeps itself hot , or a gas-burner so contrived that the gas lights by being merely " turned on . " A genuine Yankee delights to expound such things to the stray New-Yorker , and , in his eagerness , does not mark the impenetrable blank of his guest 's countenance as he strives to look as 7 ' // though he understood them . A Yankee establishment , including house , fences , gates , *barn , stable , wood-shed , chickenyard , pig-sty , and tool-box , is a museum of ingenuities , all of which will " work , " and all of which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older villages have grown exceedingly lovely . A long , wide street , not straight , - 0 no , not straight , - nor violently crooked either , but gently curving as a country road usually does , which sets off to the best advantage the grand old elms lining the street on *both sides , and affords many a glimpse of the pretty houses nestling under them , - such is the usual village of New England . Few white fences , few white houses , but almost all that man has made is of a hue to harmonize with the prevailing colors of nature . The pillared edifices of fifty years ago , and the elaborate picket fences , have nearly disappeared , and all is becoming villa-like , neat , subdued , elegant . The width of the street gives room for two wide strips of grass , which beautifully relieve the heavy , dark masses of foliage on each side ; and these masses are further relieved by the lawns , the flowers , and the flowering shrubs that surround every house . Sometimes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lights up the grass so that it looks like sheets of emerald , and touches with glory every object , and brings into clear view the distant , pleasing bend of the road , transmuting its very dust into gold , - sometimes , I say , about 7 A. M. , in one of these older villages of New England , when the jaded citizen steps out upon the path , and looks up and down the street , the view is such as to melt his heart and haunt him in his softer moments ever after . The scene is at once so peaceful and so brilliant , and its beauty has not been too dearly purchased . It is not one man 's ostentation or one class 's privilege which has created this enchanting scene ; it is not a gorgeous castle , and an exclusive park , with a squalid village near by . This loveliness is the result of a sense of the becoming which pervades the community , and which the whole community has indulged . The cost in money is trifling indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I happened to fall upon an entry which showed that the town had paid for planting those mighty elms in its public square twenty - five cents each There are many men in the United States who would count it a rare piece of good luck to be able to buy one of them for twenty thousand dollars , - cash on delivery in good condition . Of late years there has been a revival of interest in the matter of vil*. lage decoration in New England . This movement originated in the mind of a public-spirited lady of Stockbridge , Mrs. J. Z. Goodrich , who , in 1853 , was chiefly instrumental in forming the famous Laurel Hill Association of that place , since imitated in other towns . The objects of these associations , as expressed in their constitutions , are " to improve and ornament the streets and public grounds by planting and . cultivating trees , cleaning , trimming , and repairing the sidewalks , and doing such other acts as shall tend to beautify and improve such streets and grounds . " Every person over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three years , or who plants and protects one tree under the direction of the executive committee , is a member of the association . Any one may become a life-member by paying ten dollars a year for three years , or twenty-five dollars at one time . To interest the children in the matter , *vio might otherwise injure the young trees , or tread carelessly on the edges of the paths , all persons under fourteen are admitted members by paying twenty-five cents a year for three years , or " by doing an equivalent amount of work annually for three years , under the direction of the executive committee . " This executive committee , who , of course , do all the work of the association , consists of the president , the four vice-presidents , the treasurer , the secretary , and fifteen others , " part of whom shall be ladies . " The // committee meets once a month , determines what shall he done , at what expense , and under whose supervision . The result is , that the village is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road is cut at proper times , the paths are trimmed and kept free from weeds , the public ground is improved and beautified , the cemetery is duly cared for , the happiness of every civilized being in the place is increased , and the value of all the village property is enhanced . Once a year the association meets to elect officers , to hear what has been done , how much spent , and what else is needed and desired . Sometimes this annual meeting is held in midsummer out of doors in the public park , and the ladies seize the opportunity to make it a kind of village festival . Speaking of these associations reminds me of another of the many ways in which the Yankees in their native towns display their meanness . Ever since New England was settled , the inhabitants have had dinned in their ears , two or three times a week , such sentiments as that it is more blessed to give than to receive , that strength is bestowed upon the strong that they may help the weak , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , the very Constitution of Massachusetts contains an Article upon the encouragement of literature , which , it says , ought to be encouraged . for the following reasons : " To countenance and inculcate the principles of humanity and general benevolence , public and private charity , industry and frugality , honesty and punctuality in dealings , sincerity , good-humor , and social affections and generous sentiments among the people . " Hence we can hardly find a town in New England , of any considerable age or wealth , which has not been the recipient of a gift or gifts from one or more of its inhabitants . There is little Stockbridge , among the hills of Berkshire , where the lynx and the otter are still caught , and from which the bear has not been long gone . The village contains but fifty or sixty houses , and the whole town has only a population of about nineteen hundred and fifty ; but the following is an imperfe9t catalogue of the gifts which it has received . First , its remarkably beautiful public ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the town from the family known to the whole country by the talents of one of its members , the late Miss Catherine Sedgwick . Upon this fine park the public high school has been built , behind which the ground rises into a rocky and almost precipitous hill , densely covered with wood affording a capital playground to the boys , and a most agreeable retreat to all the people . Near by is a solid stone structure , the public library building , given to the town by Mr. J. Z. Goodrich . Another native of Stockbridge , Mr. Jackson , had previously had the meanness to start a public library by the gift of two thousand dollars ' worth of books , to which other residents had added many valuable volumes ; whereupon Mr. Goodrich builds this solid and spacious edifice to contain the books , and to afford a pleasant reading-room for the people in the afternoons , when many of them can spend an hour or two over the papers and magazines . That done , the town took fire , - in town meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the increase of the library , and the compensation of the young lady who serves as librarian ( from 2 to 5 P. M. , five days a week ) . Then President Hopkins , of Williams College , hearing what was going on in his native place , **ive to the library an unusually interesting collection of minerals . Other contributions of pictures and books have followed fast ; until really the library of little Stockbridge is only inferior to such ancient establishments as that of Newport , which also has grown to its present importance chiefly by gifts and bequests . In Stockbridge , too , there is a very elegant fountain , the marble figures of which , executed in Milan , were presented by a well1869. 73 // known New-Yorker , John H. Gourlie , who has a cottage near it . The town , however , excavated and built the fountain , the water of which comes from mountain springs some miles away . Incredible as it may seem , this ridiculous little village has had the insolence to tap a mountain , and bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! Another gift is a carved marble drinking-fountain , temporarily placed at the side of the library building . Finally , there is a handsome monument of brown stone , erected , at a cost of two thousand dollars , to the immortal and dear memory of the men of Stockbridge who fell in the war . This was built by general subscription . The propensity to make presents to the public is so general and so strong in New England , that it requires checking and warning rather than stimulating . In the course of time , when the progress of civilization shall have still further loosened the general clutch upon money , and the man who has the mania for needless accumulation will be generally recognized as a madman , it will probably become necessary to further regulate this matter of public gifts and bequests by law . No man has a right to saddle posterity with a hurtful burden . There is not a man in a million wise and far-seeino enough to b give away a million dollars without doinb more harm than good . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and privilege of giving something to the public , and town meetings will be called to consider whether a proffered sum of money will be , upon the whole , and in the long run , a benelit or an injury . There are colle*&amp; , * New England the efficiency of wbcn would be doubled if the trustees could disregard those conditions of gifts and bequ-ests which frustrate the giver 's benevolent intentions . To a New-Yorker who finds himself for the first time in New England , it is a great disappointment that he can find no Yankees about . In the ridiculous comedy of The American Cousin , the audience is given to understand that Asa Trenchard , the Yankee hero of the play , is a native of Brattleboro ' , Vermont . A visi'tor to that delightful town is as likely to find an Asa Trenchard there as he would be to meet a Tony Lumpkin at a dinner-party in Windsor Castle . Brattleboro ' , forsooth ! it would be difficult to discover on earth a village less capable of producing such a preposterous ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of continental Europe , such as the Revue des Dewy Mo ; zdes , the numbers of which circulate from house to house . They have a Shakespeare Club , which assembles on winter evenings to read and converse upon the plays of that poet , each member of the club taking a part . They form other winter clubs to study a language in common under the same teacher . They have an endowed library , for which , no doubt , some liberal soul or souls will provide a building erelong . They have also some vigorous ball clubs and an engine company ; but I defy Tom Taylor to discover among them any creature ever so remotely resembling Mr. Trenc hard , Salem Scudder , or any of the other stage Yankees . The stage Yankee is gone from the earth . There are no " Yankees " in New England outside of the theatre . Indeed , we may say of the whole of the Northern States , that rusticity in all its forms is disappearing , and everything , as well as everybody , is getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can not get far beyond the meerschaum pipe , white kids , lessons on the piano , and the Atlantic Monthly . A melancholy feature of village life w England is the great number of intelligent , refined , and gifted ladies who have no career nor rational expectation of one . A large proportion of the young men leave their native towns at an age when marriage can not be thought of ; they repair to a city , or plunge into the all-absorbing West , and are seen no more , until , perhaps , at fifty-five , their fortunes made , their families grown up , they come back to spend the evening of their days near 74 // their childhood 's home . Consider , for example , the case of the well-known Field family , and you will see why there are so many old maids in New England . There were six vigorous , ambitious boys of them , sons of a Puritan clergyman , whose doctrine and whose salary were both of the old school . When this fine old bulwark of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assisted them into a profession , what more could he or Berkshire do for them ? They must needs adopt Napoleon 's tactics , and " scatter to subsist . " One , indeed , stayed at home , where he was long a leading lawyer of Western Massachusetts , and represented it in the State senate . Another became a New York merchant , and forced a reluctant world to re-lay the Atlantic cable . Another tried for fame and fortune at the New York bar , and won a superfluity of both . Another distinguished himself as a naval officer . Another emerged to the public view as editor of a leading religious newspaper . Another made his way to a seat on the bench of the Supreme Court of the United States . These able men have had a career in the world , as thousands of other New England lads have had , and are having . But what of the " girls they leave behind them " ? Some , it is true , go forth , and make a career ; but many seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as best they can with German lessons , gardening , fairs , ecclesiastical needle-work , and going out to tea ; willing to do any suitable work , but unwilling to deprive of it work-women who must have it . It is easy enough to find villages in New England where there are twenty admirable girls under thirty years of age , and not one marriageable young man . A precious relief it is to these when the long June days bring at length , after the slow winter and tardy , tedious spring , the first summer visitors , with their huge trunks piled high on the village coach . Not for the new fashions ' sake ,  --  0 dear , no ! There is not a device nor passing whim of fashion which these Yankee girls do not know as soon as it is known in the Fifth Avenue . No city damsel need expect to astonish them with her novelties from Paris . Such of the Yankee girls as have been so unfortunate as to catch the clothes mania , now raging in most Christian countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them make their own dresses , and trim their own bonnets , but they do it in the most recent and killing manner . The gay summer birds that come to these sweet nooks of New England are welcome for many reasons : they fill the churches , patronize the fairs , enliven the street , and join the tea-parties ; but they can not tell the Yankee girls anything they do not know already , unless it is what Tost*e really does , my dear , in La Grande Duchesse . A curious thing about New England is the variety of eccentric characters to be found there . In almost every town there is a farmer or mechanic who has addicted himself to some kind of knowledge very remote from his occupation . Here you will find a shoemaker , in a little shop ( which he locks when he goes to dinner or to the post-office , much to the inconvenience of customers ) , who has attained celebrity as a botanist . In another village there may he a wheelwright who would sell his best coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a farmer , , who is a pretty good geologist , and is forever pecking away at his innocent rocks . Again , you will find a machinist who is enamored of " large-paper ' ? copies of standard works , and rejoic4s in the possession of rarities irAliterature which he can not read . I kn*v an excellent steel-plate engraver , who , besides being a universal critic , is particularly convinced that the entire railroad system of the world is wrong , - ties , rails , driving-wheels , axles , oilboxes , everything , - and employs his leisure in inventing better devices . Then there are people who have odd schemes of benevolence , such as that of the Massachusetts farmer who went to Palestine to teach the Orientals the 1869. 75 // true system of agriculture , and was two years in finding out that they would n't learn it . There are morose men and families who neither visit nor are visited ; and there is , occasionally , a downright miser , of the ancient type , such as we read of in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , of an extreme eccentricity of opinion . I think there are in Boston about a dozen as complete , immovable , if not malignant , Tories , as can he found this side of Constantinople , - men who plume themselves upon hating everything that makes the glory of their age and country . And , speaking ofBoston , - solid , sensible Boston , - what other city ever accomplished a feat so eccentric as the production of those twin incongruities , George Francis Train and the Count Johannes ? In matters more serious there is an occasional eccentricity still more marked . So , at least , it is said by those who look deeper than the smiling summer surface of New England . In the religious Report * quoted above I read a startling passage to this effect : " Our purely American communities , that have had a *natural growth , are ( with an exception soon to be named ) religious and church-going communities . " That exception , says the Report further on , is where " some form of religious error " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has prevailed . In some such places there is an obstinate indifference to worship and to religious truth , and even to religious questions in general . In others , a mental indisposition of peculiarly mischievous character substitutes for this indifference an acrid izostility . This epidemic - which in some localities has become endemic - is characterized by a general habit of opposition , - a habit , not of eclecticism or of criticism , but of attack and denunciation ; not of broad survey and genial correction , but of perverse misconception and invective . " In sev * First Report of the Massachusettsl State Committee on Home vangelization . Presented to the General Conference of Congregational Clergymeni September 53 , s566. eral communities , continues the Report , " the results begin to appear in a retrogression towards the g5aganism of the later enq5ire , - a virulent hatred of Christianity , an assertion of the sufficiency of philosophy and the uselessness of religion , a contempt for worship and the Lord 's Day , and a doubt of immortality . " This is eccentric indeed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity of observing ; for in the villages which he frequents the entire population on Sunday morning seems to come forth in its excellent Sunday clothes , and gently wind its way to the churches , - much to the discomfort of a city pagan , whom this apparent unanimity leaves to a silent , reproachful solitude . I think the most " acrid " of the pagans of " the later empire , " who should witness , from a convenient point , the long lines of well-dressed people strolling churchward on Sunday in a green New England village , all gardens and loveliness , would be compelled to confess ( to himself ) that this weekly grooming of the whole people , this peaceful assembling , this silent , decorous sitting together for an hour or two , these friendly greetings at the church doors , and the chatty stroll home with neighbors , is rather a good thing than otherwise , and certainly very much better that staying at home in the same old clothes , doing the same old work , and being " acrid . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they should hasten to establish a Sunday gathering , and so get rid of their acridity ; for there are but two evils in the world , and one of them is illhumor . But how changed is New England religion from the time when Jonathan Edwards made mad the guilty and appalled the free in Northampton and Stockbridge a hundred and twenty years ago ! Strange being ! Wonderful creed ! There was a certain Sunday morning in Northampton , in 1737 , when the gallery of the church gave way in consequence of the heaving of // the ground in spring . The account which Edwards gives of this event is a most curious study of character , of history , and of mania . He gives , first of all , a careful , exact explanation of what he would have called the " natural causes " of the catastrophe , - showing how the ends of the supporting timbers were drawn out of their sockets by the bulging of the wall . Then he describes the event : " The gallery , in falling , seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that those who were upon it were thrown together in heaps before the front door . But the whole was so sudden , that many of those who fell knew nothing what it was , at the time , that had befallen them . Others in the congregation thought it had been an amazing clap of thunder . The falling gallery seemed to be broken all to pieces before it got down ; so that some who fell with it , as well as those who were under , were buried in the ruins , and were found pressed under heavy loads of timber , and could do nothing to help themselves . " But no one was killed , and only one seriously hurt . Why was this ? Mr. Edwards answers : " It seems unreasonable to ascribe it to anything else but the care of Providence in disposing the motions of every piece of timber , and the precise place of safety where every one should sit and fall , when none were in any capacity to . care for their own preservation . " Hence he continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day to be spent in the solemn worship of God , to humble ourselves under such a rebuke of God upon us , in time of public service in his house , by so dangerous and surprising an accident ; and to praise his name for so wonderful , and as it were miraculous , a preservation . " The stranger who now visits the church belonging to the society of which Jonathan Edwards was the minister finds himself introduced into a spacious and elegant edifice , with all the modern improvements in upholstery and cabinet work . The scene is bright and cheerful . A fine organ , well played , soothes and exalts the mind , and a highly trained quartette discourses beautiful music . If the gallery should break down some Sunday morning , the occupants would not have far to fall , and the church would bring an action against the builder . The sermon , of course , is not such as the acrid pagans of the later empire approve ; but it is better than a man can be reasonably expected to produce who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity of whose position is , not to offend the people that pay him . In these transition times it is hard to be a clergyman in New England ; for whether the clergyman advances faster than the people , or the people get ahead of the clergyman , the result is equally distressing to the weaker party . Perhaps there is not a more agonizing situation on earth than that of the clergyman of a modern fastidious church , who , having a sickly wife , six children , and no head for business , has incurred the hideous calamity of knowing too much . . If ever we have in America a great fictitious literature. , much of the agony of the same will be of that internal and spiritual nature here referred to . The time was when there was an intimate connection between these town governments and the church , - the established church of New England , - and when all other beliefs and rites were forbidden . Once a man could be lawfully taxed against his will for the support of the Congregational minister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , from its first settlement to the present hour , has always given that sole certain evidence of spiritual life which is afforded by " growth in grace . " The essential difference between a xvise and a foolish person , between a superior and an inferior community , is , that one learns and the other does not . The Mathers and Edwardses of a former generation are succeeded by the Channings , Beechers , Parkers , Motleys , and Emersons of this ; and these , in their turn , will be followed by men equal to the task of // 78 carrying rn and organizi*zg the regeneration which has been so worthily begun . The old restraints and privileges have long ago been abolished , and perfect religious and irreligious freedom prevails . A family can now take a ride on Sunday afternoon , or receive visitors on Sunday evening , without exciting consternation or calling out the constable . In almost every village all the principal sects are represented , and there is usually the utmost possible friendliness between them . At the Congregational church you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the president of the railroad , the president of the bank , the master of the high school , the employing manufacturers , the old doctor , the rich farmers , the large store-keeper , and the colored man who thinks he waited on General Washington in the Revolutionary War . But , in some towns , the Unitarians have a share of these great men , as well as a good number of the polite people who are sometimes described in New England as " liteyary. * ' In most villages there may now be found a pretty little box of an Episcopal church , half hidden in foliage , which in summer , during the reign of the summer visitors , is filled to overflowing with the gayest costumes ; though in winter , they say , the attendance dwindles to a company which is as small in number as it is fervent in zeal . There is , also , usually a Methodist church , and frequently a Baptist , which have their proportion of adherents . Each of these denominations maintains a vigorous Sun day school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorer children many a picture - book , doll , cake , and picnic which they would not otherwise have . Perfect freedom , I have just said , prevails in religious matters in New England ; but this has not lon , , been the case . Some of the elderly people in the elderly towns found it hard to tolerate the building of Catholic churches in their midst , and consequently Catholics occasionally found it difficult to buy ground for the purpose . No one had any lots to sell , or a preposterous price was asked ; the true reason being , that the wink had been passed among the land-owners , and an understanding come to that the priest was not to have any land . I am acquainted with a large town in Vermont where these tactics were successful for some years , in spite of the disorderly Sundays in the Irish quarter , which were a weekly argument in favor of the priest 's coming . At length , by stratagem , the requisite lots were obtained ; and then the Catholics , being put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenge by building a twenty-thousanddollar church of brick instead of a three-thousand-dollar one of wood , as first proposed . Not content with this fell vengeance , they carried their animosity so far as to behave ever after with the strictest propriety on Sundays . The stranger is surprised to find in small sequestered villages , renowned perhaps in the annals of Puritanism , Catholic churches of good size , with thick walls of handsome and well-cut stone , nearly as white as marble , and surrounded by lawns and shrubbery , not very ill kept . The explanation of the mystery sometimes is , that in these remote villages among the mountains there are human minds all alive to the stir and impulse of the time , to whom the men , the books , the ideas , the aspirations , the dismay , and the despair of the age are more real and familiar than to us who live in distracting cities ; and some of these yearning , imaginative souls have listened in their seclusion to the rending cry of Lacordaire in Notre Dame , to Hyacinthe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereditary fold , and fly , shivering , to the ancient ark . Hence the Catholic churches are sometimes more costly than they naturally would be , and we find in them a crowded congregation of Irish laborers and their families , and one solitary native of ancient name and wealth , who contributed a large part of the building fund . Along the northern border , where many of the // 79 laboring class are French , there are a few rather ancient Catholic churches ; in some of which the sermon is in French one Sunday and in English . the next , and French coRfessions alternate with English on Saturdays . It were much to be desired that some religion had power enough on the frontier to put an end to the petty smuggling that goes on there continually , corrupting the poor man who perpetrates the offence , and the summer visitor who instigates or rewards it . I think the Catholic bishops must reserve a few wild priests for the remoter country congregations , where there is little chance for proselyting . I witnessed a Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very heart of New England , which was a chapter of Charles O'Malley come to life , - a 1*it of old Ireland transferred bodily to the New World . Toward nine o'clock on Sunday morning , the hour appointed for the semi-monthly mass , the people gathered about the gate under the trees , while the ruddy and robust priest stood at the church door , accosting those who entered with a loud heartiness that made every word he uttered audible to the people standing without and to the people kneeling within . He was a jovial and sympathetic soul , who could ( and did ) laugh with the merry and grieve with the sad ; but it was evident that laughter came far more natural to him than crying . When he had concluded , at 9.15 , a boisterous and most jovial conversation with Mrs. O'Flynn at the door , every word of which was heard by every member of the waiting congregation , he entered the church , and proceeded to the altar , before which he knelt , holding his straw hat in his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtained alcove at the side , where his priestly robes were hanging . Without taking the trouble to let the curtains fall , he took off his coat , in view of the whole assembly , and put on part of his ecclesiastical garments , unassisted by his only acolyte , - a little boy in the usual costume , who stood by . He then went again to the altar , and arranged the various objects for the coming ceremonial ; after which he stepped aside and completed the robing , - not even going into the alcove , but standing outside , and reaching in for the different articles . He might have spared the congregation the pain of seeing his struggles to tie his strings behind him ; but no ; he chose to perform the whole without help and without disguise . When all was ready , he said the mass with perfect propriety , and with unusual manifestations of feeling . But the sermon , if sermon it could be called , was absolutely comic , and much of it was intended to be so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the altar ; and in the first part of his discourse the gratified pastor read a list of the contributors , with comments , in something like the style following - " Mrs. McDowd , $ 13.50 ; and very well done , too , consideriffg they had nothing but cake upon their table , - no , not so much as an apple . John Haggerty , $ 2.70 ; and indade he s only a boy , a mere lad , - and a good boy he is . Mrs. O'Sullivan , $37.98 ; yes , and $27.42 before . Ab ! but that was doing well , - that was wonderful , considering what she had to contend with . Mrs. O'Donahue , $ 7.90 ; and every cent of it got by selling a ten-cent picture . Very well done of you , Mrs. O'Donahue ! Peter O'Brien , $ 12.00 ; good for you , Peter , and I thank you in my own name and in the name of the congregation Total , $ 489.57 . Nearly five hundred dollars ! It 's really astonishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( this he said with a wink and a grin that excited general laughter ) , - " and how much of it do you think your priest will kape for himself ? Not much , I 'm thinking . No indeed . Why should I kape it ? What do I want with it ? I have enough to eat , drink , and wear , and what more does a priest want ? I have no ambition for money , - not I ; and you know it well . You know that the whole of this money will be spent upon the altar of God ; and we shall spend it with the greatest economy . // Not Brussels carpet , of course . That would cost four or five dollars a yard . Good ingrain will do well enoubh for us at present , and last long enough too ; for ca n't it be turned ? You know it can . Twenty years from now , when we are all dead and gone , they 11 be turning and turning and turning it , and holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder who laid down this ould carpet ! ' In all my life , I never saw such an altar as this in a church of this size " ( turning to the altar , and surveying it with an indescribably funny attempt to look contemptuous ) , - " so mane , so very inane ! I tell you , if I had been here when this altar was made , I d have wheeled the man out of church pretty quick . " ( These last words were accompanied with the appropriate gesture , expressive of taking the delinquent carpenter by the back of the neck , and propelling hi** thereby down the aisle . ) " But what shall I say of those who have given nothing to this fair ? Ah ! I tell you , when the decorations are all done , and you come here to mass on Sunday mornings , and see God 's house and the sanctuary where he dwells all adorned as it should be with the gifts of the faithful , and when you think that you gave not one cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there s a blush in you . " After proceeding in this tone for twenty minutes , during which he laughed heartily himself , and made the people lau*h outright , , he changed to another topic , which he handled in a style well adapted to accomplish the object intended . He said he had heard that some of the " hotel girls " had been swearing and quarrelling a good deal that summer . " Ah , " he continued , " I was sorry to hear it ! The idea of ladies swearing ! How wrong , how me an , how*contemptible , how nasty , how unchristian ! Do n't you suppose that the ladies and gentlemen at the hotel have heard how many Protestants are coming into the bosom of the Catholic Church ? Do n't you suppose they *watch you ? They know you re Catholics , and do n't you suppose they 11 be judging of Catholics by you 2 And , besides , who would marry a swearing lady ? Tell me that ! The most abandoned blackguard that walks the streets would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he knows very well that she d be a bad mother . If I were a young man , and heard my true love swear , do you think I d marry her ? Hey ? do you think I would ? By no manes ! And I wish to God I had spoken about this before ; for now the season is almost over , and many of the Protestant people have gone home , and very likely are talking about it now in New York and Boston . You know what they 11 say . They 11 say , If that s the way Catholic ladies behave , you do n't catch me turning Catholic . ' " At the conclusion of his discourse he took up the collection himself : , saying , as he left each pew , " Thank you " in a strong , hearty tone of voice ; and if any one took a little extra trouble to reach over , or put into the box something more than the usual copper coin , he bowed , and said , " I thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He was a strange mixture of the father and the ecclesiastic , of the good fellow and the gentleman . In Tipperary , in the Colleen Bawn , in Charles Lever , we are not surprised to find him ; but who would have expected to make his acquaintance in a secluded valley of New England , and to discover that he has the largest congregation in the neighborhood ? And 0 how much better is such a priest than one of the howlingdervish description ! So much for life in a New England town ; for I have left myself no room to speak of the unequalled efficiency of the Yankee town system in time of war . No despot has ever invented a mode of bringing out " the last man and the last dollar " half so simple , cheap , prompt , and certain as this . As soon as a call for troops is flashed over the wires , the officers of each town can ascertain exactly how many men they have to produce ; and they know where the men are , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to an offer . They know what the families of the soldiers require , and those soldiers have an assurance that their families will not suffer in their absence . It was this town system that saved the country in the late war . Universal liberty may be a dream . Henry Clay 's pleasing fancy of a continent of closely allied Republics settling all differences and difficulties by an occasional Congress on the Isthmus of Darien , wherein the honorable giant from Patagonia would join in harmonious debate with the honorable dwarf from Greenland , may never be realized . But if universal liberty is not a dream , if the whole habitable earth is ever to be occupied by educated , dignified , and virtuous beings , it is probable that those beings will arrange themselves in self-governing communities , similar in magnitude , similar in institutions and laws , to a New England town . It is strange that such people as Yankees are said to be , struggling for life in the wilderness against savage man and savage nature , should have hit upon methods which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
