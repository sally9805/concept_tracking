Holland , J. G. ( Josiah Gilbert ) , 1819-1881 : HYMN . WRITTEN FOR THE OCCASION BY J. G. HOLLAND . from Hymn ( 1861 ) Thou saintly shade , with brow serene ! Come to thy friends as Jesus came , And breathe upon us , though unseen , The peace of God in His dear name . This garden , planted by thy care , Bears precious fruits and flowers divine ; But not a memory more fair , And not a name more pure than thine . The shaft we plant above the tomb That holds for us thy precious dust , Takes life from love , and bursts in bloom With the sweet records of the just . These aisles of turf , these roofs of trees , This spire and shrine our church shall be ; These brooks shall burden every breeze With bells that call us all to thee . Here , then , O God ! to Thee we bend To beg thy blessing , and adore ! Fit us to sleep beside our friend , And wake with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
