ART . IT . - THE MENTAL FACULTIES OF BRUTES . THE vigorous efforts now making in some of our principal cities to prevent unnecessary cruelty to animals doubtless proceed from a strong benevolent impnlse , the basis of which is not very clearly defined in the minds of those who experience it . These special friends and protectors of the brute creation ask no warrant for their proceedings beyond the instinctive sympathy of the mass of men with sufferings which they feel are closely allied to their own . But the ground on which they stand would be much firmer , and the dignity and value of their efforts likely to meet with a more speedy recognition , if it were fairly shown that " the brutes that perish " are our poor relations , ' ' not only by virtue of possessing mere animal sensibilities in common with mankind , but from being endowed with all the essential faculties of the human race . We therefore judge the present time not unfavorable for a brief consideration of these two leading questions , often , though seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mental powers possessed by man ? " and " Do any animals possess mental powers denied to the human race ? " Other men are so like us in external aspect , and their actions so closely resemble ours , that , even if we were not endowed with the gifts of speech and hearing , we should doubtless infer that they were possessed of minds like our own . Spoken language is only an aid , and not an essential means of intercommunication between members of the human family . It is but a second system of chiefly artificial signs , addressed to the sense of hearing , and supplementing the alphabet of Nature , which is for the most part dumb , and related only to the sense of sight . We understand the deaf and dumb man , and he us , though very often imperfectly . But , for that matter , who thoroughly understands any one else ? or who can communicate to another the exact phase and the perfect fulness of his thoughts and hopes and affections ? The principle that like effects are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all our knowledge of the characters of other men . We judge Shakespeare and the // idiot by the same inflexible law . Believing in the essential unity of the human race , whatever faculties we find common to all the men whom we have ever known we consider fundamental , and embrace such accounts as we can give of them in our attempted definitions , or rather descriptions , of the human mind . Just so must it be with our efforts to fathom the consciousness of the animal creation . It is only in so far as brutes are in reality " our poor relations , " possessed of the same mental faculties with us , that we can have any adequate conception of their inner life . We interpret their actions as we do those of our fellow-men . We even find it convenient at times to characterize human traits by their qualities . One man is as cross as a bear * ; another as sly as a fox , ' ' or " as cunning as a weasel . " Even " He who spake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words than these with which to address his twelve disciples : " Behold , I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves : be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves . " Literature is full of such similes , and we need not go beyond this fact for proof of at least a partial community of nature between the minds of men and brutes . Like qualities point to a like subject , and , whether this is material or immaterial , the principle remains the same . Altogether unphilosophical , then , are those theories which , while acknowledging a close resemblance between very many of the actions of men and of brutes , yet ascribe these similar acts to dissimilar causes . Descartes could not , or would not , see any essential difference between an animal and a watch ; because , forsooth , if animals had souls , would they not be immortal like men ? and his human pride could not brook that degree of equality . We will not stop now to inquire whether immortality is a necessary attribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We only wish to protest against that false mode of philosophizing which hesitates to accept legitimate conclusions when they seem likely to lead to unwelcome inferences . Descartes , however , in spite of his philosophy , could not help sometimes speaking of the manifestations of brute intelligence in precisely the same language as other men , though protesting in the same breath that they were purely physical phenomena , dependent on the structure of the bodily // organs . Though himself no materialist , he committed the same error with the materialists , in ascribing to matter functions of which it is not capable . Sir Isaac Newton erred in a somewhat different direction . Although his language is rather obscure , he appears to have thought that animals had no minds of their own , like men , but that the Deity immediately caused or directed all their actions , without any intelligence on their part . This made God more immanently present in the brute creation than in the human race , and certainly would have justified the philosopher in sacredly protecting , if not worshipping , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancients , but animals of every kind . There were not wanting other more superficial thinkers to echo the doctrine , much older , however , than Newton , and disclaimed by him when stated in this form , that " God is the soul of brutes . " Addison , in the " Spectator , " declares that " instinct can not be accounted for by any properties in matter , and at the same time it works after so odd a manner that one can not think it the faculty of an intellectual being , "  --  and that , for his part , he looks " upon it as upon the principle of gravitation in bodies , which is not to be explained by any known qualities inherent in the bodies themselves , nor from any laws of mechanism , but , according to the best notions of the greatest philosophers , is an immediate impression from the first Mover , and the divine knowledge acting in the creatures . " Even Pope took up the refrain , singing thus - " And reason raise o'er instinct as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in that t is man . " One is at a loss to see what is gained by such a theory as this , since by it brutes are made less manlike only to become more godlike , and are thrown out of our own family only to be adopted into a nobler one . Perhaps , however , if we are well rid of them , that is all that is necessary . But , seriously , one can not help wondering that such a mind as Newton 's did not perceive that this hypothesis lacked two most essential elements , - necessity and consistency . The existence of created mind was just as adequate to the explanation of the phenomena // Tue M*e'ntal Faculties of Brutes . of animal as of human intelligence ; and there was no reason for supposing that the Creator had departed from His usual mode of acting mediately , and not immediately , upon organized matter . It is a true principle of philosophy as well as of the drama , that divine aid is not to be needlessly invoked in the solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what , upon this theory , shall we say of those cases in which animal instinct ( and Newton seems to make all actions of brutes instinctive ) goes astray , as it were , and apparently fails of its end ? Wlieii the ape of which Blumenbach tells us picked out the painted pictures of beetles from a book of natural history , and ate them down as though they were the living animals , is it consistent with our conceptions of the Deity to suppose that this was His immediate act ? And when the sheep eats the poisonous laurel and dies , is it an infinite or a finite intelligence that errs ? These theories of Descartes and Newton have not met with very general acceptance , especially that of the former ,  --  which , by the way , can be traced back substantially to some of the ancient philosophers . The anonymous author of " A Moral Essay upon the Soul of Man , " published in the year 1700 , seems to hold to the two theories in conjunction , without being conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to those Ends for which he hath created them , by secret Springs which he hath plac 'd in them , which are diversly determin 'd , according to Accidents , to make a thousand sorts of different Movements , according to their different Business and Occasion , " and that it is not " by any Sentiments of Duty that Dogs love and follow their Masters , any otherwise than by Instinct , or by the necessary effect of the Jlechaniclc Disposition of the Springs which serve to move them , " he repeatedly uses language which implies the direction and control of these brute mechanisms by the Creator . In one thing , however , he is perfectly consistent throughout , and that is in denying to brutes the least particle of real sensation , or perception , or intelligence of any kind . He stoutly protests against giving them the least chance to prove their spiritual relationship to us , lest they should take advantage of it to claim some portion of our inheritance . According to his // philosophy , it is not safe to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of satisfaction , when his master holds up before him a piece of meat : for satisfaction is an attribute of mind ; and if a dog may experience this emotion , where is there any necessary limit to his possible emotions ? Neither can the dog really know that it is meat which his master is offering him , or that his master is offering him anything at all , or in fact that he has any master , or that there is any such thing as a man or a dog : for to know is to have a mind ; and who shall fix the possible limits of mental development ? No ! All that happens is merely something like this , if we will accept the teachings of our philosopher . From the fatty portions of the meat which the master holds up before his dog certain subtile odors are wafted by currents of air or fall by the mere force of gravitation about the head of the canine mechanism . Such of these oleaginous particles as come in contact with the anterior surface of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of lustre . Other particles passing through the nostrils into the mouth so soften and relax the muscles which close the jaws that the mouth falls open . As Nature abhors a vacuum , the oily atoms pass 6n towards the empty stomach , on their way causing rapid vibrations in the vocal chords , which send forth a sudden bark . In consequence of their acquired velocity , and the vis a tergo received from other particles pressing upon them , they do not stop until they reach the roots of the tail , and here , their whole force being concentrated upon the mainspring of this intricate organism , the whole tail rapidly wags . When the master drops the meat into the animal 's mouth , all this atomic influence of course ceases , the mouth suddenly closes , and the former equilibrium is everywhere restored . When everything can be so easily and naturally explained on mechanical and physiological principles , why be so nuphilosophical as to go beyond these ? The following passage from this writer will show that we have not been indulging in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maxim of Physick and good Sense , That we must never place in Nature an useless Principle , and without an Effect to which it is necessary . It would , for Example , be ridiculous to be willing to put a Soul endu 'd with a true knowb // edge , either into a Clock or a Windmill to make them go , since all their Movements may be made without any such Principle of Knowledge to direct or determine their Movements . And without doubt it is no less ridiculous , to put into Animals a Principle of Knowledge and true Sentiment like unto ours , and a true Light to instruct them , if there be no need of such a Principle to make them do everything which they do : Now so it is , that there doth not anything appear in Beasts that is a necessary and inseparable Effect of such a Knowledge , of such a Sentiment , of such a Principle ; since there is nothing that Beasts do , which may not be easily explain 'd mechanically , as we say , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Principle of Knowledge in Them . " But , with all his vagaries , this anonymous writer is much to be praised for his persistent defence of the principle , that one real act of intelligence is as good as a millioh for proving the existence of a rational animal soul . We must not take leave of Newton 's theory without mentioning , that , in our own time and country , no less distinguished a writer than the author of the Lowell lectures on " Metaphysical and Ethical Science " has looked upon it with considerable favor . After a lengthy consideration of the phenomena of instinct , ( and he is inclined to allow to brutes no acts indicating intelligence , excepting such as are instinctive , ) he says , in a concluding note : " I hardly need observe how much the phenomena considered in this chapter tend to confirm the doctrine of immediate divine agency . " As he denies to man the possession of any instincts , properly so called , he is to be ranked among those who hold to a difference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brutes . However , like most of those who hold to this view , he is far from being consistent in his language , and it is only by disregarding minor discrepancies and looking at the whole scope of his argument that his true position can be learned . For instance , while he declares that almost all , and probably all , the intelligent actions of animals are purely instinctive , and that , " as we affirm confidently that mind is not material , so we may find sure reason to believe that it is radically different from instiuct , " he yet does not hesitate to speak of " the brute mind , " // and of the " mental constitution , " " mental endowments , " and " mental nature " of brutes . At the very outset he proposes ( to use his own words ) " to examine the only case within the sphere of human observation where intellectual are not combined with moral qualities , and where , consequently , enjoyment for the time must be regarded as the sole end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , to the mental constitution of brutes . " Is not this a distinct , though it may be an unintentional , acknowledgment that brutes do possess both intellectual and sensitive faculties , neither of which can be predicated of anything but mind ? And can that be legitimate philosophizing which entirely throws out of account one very striking class of phenomena , which can not be readily referred to the workings of instinct ? Yet our author says : " I say nothing of the feats which animals may be trained by man to accomplish , because these may all be traced to the blind and unconscious faculty of imitation or mimicry , and to the continued association of reward or punishment with certain actions . " Now there may be some fortuitous resemblance or coincidence of action without any conscious design , and this is sometimes called imitation ; but it is not the kind of imitation of which he is speaking , for it can in no sense be termed a faculty . He is evidently referring to imitative acts in which we can observe the relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the primary action suggests and furnishes the motive for the secondary imitative act . Such imitation involves consciousness in the imitating animal , and to speak of the " unconscious faculty of imitation " is to join together ideas which the very laws of mind have put asunder . And just so it is with regard to " the continued association of reward or punishment with certain actions " : this clearly involves both consciousness and the association of ideas , and even much more than this , as we shall presently see . The theories which have been considered are the only ones of any importance which assume an entire contrariety of nature between animal and human souls . It would be interesting to examine the speculations of those philosophers who allow to brutes a limited degree of intelligence outside of or in connection with the operations of instinct ; but this is not essential to our present purpose . The theory of French , that // the bodies of beasts are the abodes of spirits , both good and evil , deserves a passing mention , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific men even nowadays are sometimes subject . The general statements which we have made with regard to the similarity of the actions of men and brutes , and the inferences which are to be drawn from this similarity , need to be supported by a more complete induction of facts , before they can be made available for the solution of the questions proposed at the outset of our inquiry . The necessary completeness can be attained only by going through with the fundamental faculties of the human mind in some systematic order , and determining with regard to each whether its equivalent is to be found in the brute mind . Brougham attempted this method in his " Dialogues on Instinct " ; but in consequence of the imperfection of his philosophy , his reasoning is often far from being satisfactory . It is true , there is not even now absolute uniformity of opinion as to which are the fundamental faculties of the human mind , - a fact which may , of course , introduce some uncertainty into our results , but only such a degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculties alone have been spoken of as being the objects of our present consideration ; because , if these are identical in men and brutes , any differences which may exist in the power of combining simple mental acts will only go to prove a difference of development , and not of nature . There is no action of the human mind which is not an act either of knowledge , feeling , or will . There is but a single faculty of willing , while our acts of knowledge and feeling are the product of several special and distinct faculties . In many of our complex mental operations , and even in some of those which appear to be the simplest , all the faculties of knowledge , the power of the will , and some one or more of the feelings , are brought into action . In the following instance of brute intelligence we shall find , upon careful consideration , that the case is precisely the same . The story will be given substantially in the words of the journal from which it is taken . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were recently engaged in destroying a great number of rats , when one // of them escaped and ran to the spot allotted to the elephant . Seeing no other refuge , in the twinkling of an eye the rat snugly ensconced himself in the trunk of the elephant , very much to the elephant 's dissatisfaction . He stamped his foot and twisted his trunk around like the sail of a windmill , and then stood suddenly still , apparently reflecting on what it was best to do . Presently he ran to the water-trough where he was accustomed to drink , plunged in his trunk and filled it , and then raising it dashed out the rat in a torrent like that which issues from the hose of a fire-engine . When the rat struck the ground , the elephant seized him and made him undergo the immersion and projection four times . The fourth time the rat fell dead . The elephant , with a quiet , but majestic air , crushed it under his foot , and then went round to the spectators to make his usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , and indicated by , the actions of the elephant in this contest , we will begin with the knowing or cognitive faculties . In the first place , he could not have become aware of the presence of the rat in his proboscis , except through an act of perception , - that faculty which gives to the mind its knowledge of external things . But perception involves self-consciousness : for the mind can not become aware of the existence of something besides itself , without perceiving a difference between that something and itself ; and the perception of differences presupposes a knowledge of the things which differ . Thus the elephant must have been conscious of his own existence at the same time that he was conscious of the present relation of some external object to his senses . He must have had , for aught we can see , as clear an idea of the me and the not-me as belongs to most men . This is not asserting that the elephant is a philosopher , but only that he possesses the essential groundwork of intelligence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other faculties than those of perception and selfconsciousness . In distinguishing itself , the percipient subject , from the perceived object , the mind compares the two , and affirms that they are not the same . We have here comparison and judgment , the prime elements of all reasoning . However // complicated any train of thought , it is capable of being resolved into a succession of simple acts of comparison and judgment . It is this fact which leads so many to deny to brutes the possession of these two allied faculties . The course of reasoning adopted is something like the following . One of the faculties of the human mind is the faculty of relations , or the power of comparing and judging . To the exercise of this power are to be ascribed all the grandest achievements of the human intellect , such as the discovery of the law of gravitation , and the evolution of the fundamental principles of ethical and metaphysical science . No animal has ever accomplished such results , and therefore the brute creation does not possess this faculty . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are to test the existence of any faculty by specific instead of generic results . Since all reasoning , even the most abstruse , is made up of simple acts of comparison and judgment , the last link in the chain of thought which yields to us a most profound generalization does not differ , as a mental act , from the simplest thought of the most ignorant man . There is no single step in any , even the most complex , deductive or inductive process , which involves any power different in kind from that by which the most stupid savage of the wilds of Africa guides the practical actions of his daily life . All the discoveries of Newton and La Place , all the demonstrations of Euclid , all the splendid results of modern science , have for their component elem*uts propositions as simple as the school-boy 's " two and two make four . " Not results , then , but processes , are the test of identity with regard to faculties of the mind . To deny this would lead us into extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faculty implies the possibility of the highest attainments in the direction of that faculty , and that , if a pig can reason , there is nothing to hinder his becoming a Newton . But what if there should be something to hinder , nevertheless , which our poor reason can not discover ? If our own intellects were infinite , if we did not at every step strike our bewildered heads against the prison-bars which limit the possibilities of human thought , we might have some reason for believing in the infinite possibilities of brutes . // As it is , we should do better to accept the simple fact , that the reason of brutes is actually much more limited in the range of its operation than our own , than utterly to deny them reason through fear of making them our equals . To cite a specific instance of this fallacy against which we have been contending , take the case of Coleridge , who would not allow that a brute animal could have the conception " black is not white , " because this would constitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of all human intellectual possibilities . It is not easy to conceive how this philosopher would have explained the apparent perception by animals of the distinction between day and night , to say nothing of other less general distinctions pertaining to color . When the cock , at the rising of the moon in the middle of the night , crows as lustily as at daybreak , what have these two seasons in common which could produce the awakening , except the transition from darkness to light ? Vision , in fact , is impossible without some discrimination of colors , or at least of light and shade ; so that either the higher animals know black from white , or else their eyes were given them in mere mockery , and they are by some mysterious contrivance made to act precisely as they would do , if they were not blind . If , however , Coleridge only means to say that animals can not reflect upon the abstract notions of blackness and whiteness , and determine that they do not agree , he not only affirms that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were true , would be nothing to the purpose for , as we have already shown , it is not necessary , in order to prove the existence of the reasoning faculty in any given case , to demonstrate the presence of all the effects which have been seen in other cases . Abstraction is not an independent faculty of the mind , but only the reasoning power applied to certain ideas to the exclusion of others , and brutes might be without it and yet be reasoning beings . But , in point of fact , it is easy to show that brutes have this power . Just as it is only by a process of abstraction and generalization that we are able to classify the manifold objects of Nature , without which classification we should be bewildered because of their multiplicity and diversity , so we must conceive it to be with the animal kingdom . One object which we // see for the first time we know to be a man , another a rock , and another a tree , because we have previously learned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same thing as saying that we have formed abstract ideas corresponding to the words man , rock , tree . There would seem to be no question but that , by virtue of these same powers of abstraction and generalization , the dog knows that a man whom he meets for the first time is a man , and not a dog or a fox . One of the English Quarterly Reviews tells the story of a dog which , having been taught to beg for food by sitting upright , was in the habit of assuming that posture whenever he wanted a favor of any kind , for instance , the opening of a door . This animal evidently must have conceived the notion that there was some relation between the longing for food and other desires ; and the conception of a class of desires is a pure generalization. - But it is time we were examining still further the story of the elephant and the rat , in search of other fundamental faculties . The action of the elephant in going to the trough for water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory and imao'ination . It is of no consequence to our present inquiry 0 whether the former faculty should be divided into two , memory proper and reminiscence , or whether there is nothing which can properly be called memory apart from reminiscence : if the observed phenomena are identical in kind in man and brute , the question of simplicity need not be raised . Now the elephant would not have gone to the trough as he did , had he not remembered that water was kept there ; and when by an act of memory the idea of water had been recalled to his consciousness , the faculty of imagination , or the representative faculty , must have come into exercise in order to keep this idea before the mind and enable it to determine the subsequent actions of the animal . One of the two great schools of philosophy at the present day would excuse us from searching for any manifestations of what is sometimes called the regulative faculty , by which is meant the power of the mind to evolve from itself , without the aid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles , or intuitive truths ; but our sympathies being // with that school which acknowledges the existence of such truths , we can not excnse ourselves from reckoning the intnitive faculty among those which are fundamental . In order , however , to meet the requirements of the intuitional philosophy , it is not necessary to show that brntes equal ns in the extent of their intnitive knowledge , but only that they have some knowledge of this kind , indicating the possession of the corresponding faculty . To demand anything more than this would be to repeat the fallacy already exposed , of looking for coextensive results instead of identical powers . The case we are examining furnishes us with several phenomena which , if the elephant were a man , would be considered conclusive evidence of the possession of intuitive knowledge . The idea of the necessary relation of case and effect is accepted by philosophers of the intuitional school as a first principle or self-evident truth . Of course the great majority of men never state this principle to themselves in any set form of words ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every hour of his life . When the elephant perceived a certain unusual sensation in his proboscis , he evidently attributed it at once to the presence of some foreign object , the removal of which would relieve him from the unpleasant sensation . The effect was promptly assigned to a cause , and means were deliberately adopted to secure its removal . What clearer evidence could a man give of a practical recognition of the relation of cause and effect ? But first principles , according to some , are of two kinds , namely , necessary and contingent truths . We have been considering a specimen of the former : we have ready at hand one of the latter . A practical belief in the uniformity of the operations of Nature is the only principle on which we can account for the action of the elephant in adopting the means which he did for getting rid of the rat . What water has done water will do , was his simple intuitive logic , - the same logic which leads us to believe that the sun will rise to-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have now completed the list of the fundamental cognitive faculties , and found none of them wanting in our representative animal . That we must also credit him with the possession of the faculty of will seems inevitable ; for no hu // 50 Tue Mental Faculties of Brutes . man being ever gave clearer evidence of a deliberate purpose to free himself from unpleasant circumstances than did this elephant . To say that his acts were entirely involuntary and automatic is a use of terms that robs them of all meaning . Unlike the other faculties , the sensibilities are not found combined in action to any great extent . Their several phenomena are called forth by such different circumstances , and the characteristics of some of them are so completely contradictory to those of others , that the presence of one sensation or emotion often virtually necessitates the absence of almost every other . All that our narrative warrants us in affirming with regard to the feelings experienced by the elephant and the rat is this , - that the sentiments or internal feelings in active exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resentment , accompanied in both cases by desire and hope , - and that the external sensations , so called , of hearing , sight , and feeling , were doubtless experienced by both . We now leave this case , and cite common experience , as well as other special cases , in order to determine the presence or absence in brutes of other feelings than those just mentioned . No one will deny that the remaining external senses , those of smell and taste , are possessed by many animals . Even if we enlarge the list beyond the customary five , and allow special senses of heat and cold , wet and dry , hunger and thirst , weariness , nausea , shuddering , etc. , there is not one among them all which any man of observation would deny to the higher classes of brutes , and some of them seem to be possessed by animals even of the very lowest rank . In searching for manifestations of the sentiments , or internal feelings , we perhaps can not do better than to follow the order adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind , taking up first what he calls the simple emotions , secondly the affections , and thirdly the desires . We hardly need to cite special instances in order to show that many animals manifest that general state of mind known as cheerfulness , and also its opposite . Brutes not having , except to a very limited extent , the use of a vocal language intelligible to man , and possessing but little power of facial expression , the presence of this feeling , as of many others , often escapes the attention of a careless observer . // Closely connected with this feeling is sorrow for the loss of friends , which many animals manifest in a striking degree . Examples of this emotion in domestic animals will readily occur to every one . Forbes , in his " Oriental Memoirs , " tells us that a friend of his having shot a female monkey and carried off the body , forty of the animals soon surrounded his tent , and , making a great noise , gave evidence of an inclination to attack him . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who appeared to be the leader : he stood his ground , chattering furiously . As the man did not fire , the monkey at last came to the door of the tent and began a lamentable moaning , and by the most expressive gestures seemed to beg for the dead body . When it was given him , he took it sorrowfully in his arms and bore it away to his companions . Whether brutes sympathize with the happiness and sorrow of others might at first sight seem doubtful ; but facts like the following compel us to decide the question in the affirmative . The story is taken by Brougham from an apparently trustworthy French authority . " A swallow had slipped its foot into the noose of a cord attached to a spout in the Coll6ge des Quatre Nations at Paris , and by endeavoring to escape had drawn the knot tight . Its strength being exhausted in vain attempts to fly , it uttered piteous cries , which assembled a vast flock of other swallows They seemed to crowd and consult together for a little while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and struck at it with his beak as he flew past ; and others following in quick succession did the same , striking at the same part , till , after continuing this combined operation for half an hour , they succeeded in severing the cord and freeing their companion . They all continued flocking and hovering till night ; only , instead of the tumult and agitation in which they had been at their first assembling , they were chattering as if without any anxiety at all , but conscious of having succeeded . " The emotion of satisfaction at success , and the opposite emotion of dejection at failure , as well as that self-satisfied feeling which we call pride or self-esteem , are often exhibited in the actions of domestic animals : it is not necessary to specify instances . // Although we should hesitate to affirm that there are many animals which have a sense of the ludicrous , yet it can hardly be denied to the ape and monkey tribes , or to parrots . Surprise , curiosity , and the enjoyment of the new , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same feeling , are noticeable in all the higher animals . Dogs meeting for the first time especially exhibit this emotion . That birds apparently delight in the brilliant plumage of their mates is an indication that they are capable of enjoying beauty . The fact that brutes do not seem to manifest any appreciation of the sublime can not be considered as due to any radical defect in their natures , so long as the philosophers make no fundamental distinction between the sublime and the beautiful . Closely connected with the enjoyment of the beautiful is the enjoyment of the good , which , with reference to our own actions , we speak of as the approving voice of conscience . Philosophers have generally denied to brutes the manifestation of this emotion , and it must be acknowledged that those actions of domestic animals which often seem to involve a consciousness of merit or demerit may generally , perhaps always , be referred to the stimulus of hope and the love of approbation , or of fear and the dread of disapprobation . Both this and the preceding topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the consideration that the enjoyment of the beautiful and the good presupposes a conception of their nature , and if these intuitive conceptions are wanting , ( and as they are merely facts , and not faculties , their absence does not imply the lack of any fundamental power , ) then of course the corresponding emotions must be wanting . In failing to possess a knowledge and appreciation of the beautiful and the good , ( supposing this to be the fact , ) brutes lack somewhat of our mental furniture , but not , on that account , any elementary power . They may be free agents , even if they are not free moral agents , and in this simple distinction consists the chief glory of man . Add to the brutes no new faculty , but merely the idea of right and wrong , and you make them capable of virtue and vice . The benevolent affections of love of kindred , friends , bene // factors , and home , as well as the malevolent feeling of resentment , and its modifications , envy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in widely different degrees , yet must all be ranked among the faculties common to men and brutes . Those desires which arise from the physical constitution of man are too evidently shared by other animals to need anything more than this passing mention . If happiness may be defined as satisfaction with one 's present condition , then the desire of happiness is the longing for some absent condition which , if present , would produce satisfaction . The efforts which brutes put forth to secure their own welfare , as well as other ends , often seem to be stimulated by this desire . The practically limited range of the discursive faculty in animals , already spoken of , may be considered as affording a sufficient reason why we see in them so few manifestations of a desire of knowledge . Within certain narrow limits , however , all the higher animals give evidence of the possession of this desire , in the eagerness with which they seek for those objects which are related either to their daily wants or to some special demand of their natures . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge which men may acquire ; nevertheless it comes through the same faculties . It is also to be noticed , that , while men often desire knowledge for its own sake , with brutes this seldom , if ever , seems to be the case . That many animals are fond of power , and have a desire for superiority , is acknowledged even by most of those who claim a wide distinction between the faculties of men and those of brutes . The same may be said of the desire of possession , the desire of society , the desire of esteem , and the feelings of hope and fear ; it is therefore unnecessary to cite special instances of these . The last two have been already exemplified in the case of the rat and the elephant . We have now gone through with the commonly acknowledged faculties of the human mind ; and if in the course of our inqniry we have made no unreasonable assumptions , the reply to the first of the two questions propounded at the outset must be // evident , namely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutes is one of degree only , and not of kind , and that all the faculties of the human mind have their parallels in the brute creation . This , of course , does not exclude great mental differences in different races of animals ; in fact , the most limited observation shows that between the highest and the lowest animals there must be a far greater distance in point of intelligence than between the higher animals and man . Moreover , our examination has not proved that any one animal possesses all the faculties belonging to man , but only that brutes , taken as a whole , lack none of the elementary powers with which the human race is endowed . Our second question , " Do any animals possess mental powers denied to the human race ? " must , from lack of space , be treated much more summarily . Instinct is supposed by some to be a faculty peculiar to brutes . Without rehearsing the many different and even contradictory definitions which have been given of the word , we will venture to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in this single statement , that instinctive actions are those which are not based either upon instruction or experience . It is to be noticed that the term instinct , as commonly used , includes the outward manifestation as well as the mental act , and even points more particularly to the former . But evidently the only question to be considered in the present connection is this : " What is the iuward cause of the outward phenomenon ? " And here , as in our preceding inquiry , we must insist upon the application of the philosophical principle , that no new faculty is to be assumed , unless it shall be absolutely necessary in order to explain the facts . Those automatic physical acts which are produced by reflex nervous action , having a purely physical origin , may at once be left out of the account , although they are sometimes spoken of as instinctive . Those spasmodic motions of the body which are produced by sudden or unforeseen contact with objects which are sharp , or hot , or cold , are specimens of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood , etc. , being carried on without any mental effort , are not , in the strict sense of the term , instinctive . The definition // which we have given ought , for purposes of mental science , to be so restricted as to cover only such acts as call into play some mental force . Leaving out of account , then , the two classes of acts just referred to , we may say , in the first place , that the physical element of instinctive acts must be immediately under the control of the will . Whatever the mental impulse may be , it can control the body only through the medium of the power of volition , acting upon the nerves of voluntary motion , unless we accept the exploded theory of Descartes or Newton . The beaver wills to build his dam , or he would not build it ; he wills to fell with his teeth each particular tree , and to perform every other individual act which goes to make up the building of the dam , or else no muscle would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of instinct , then , are not involuntary , as is frequently asserted , but have every appearance of being excited by the will . This , of course , also brings them within the domain of consciousness . This consciousness , however , does not necessarily extend beyond the present act , so that the animal may be ignorant of the ultimate end to be subserved by his work . But there must be some impulse to move the will , and that an impulse acting with great uniformity , since regularity of operation is a striking feature of instinct . Our definition excludes all motives derived from instruction and experience ; so that the intuitive faculty is the only one with which we are already acquainted which can possibly furnish the necessary stimulus , and this faculty seems adequate to the task . There is a striking similarity , if no closer connection , between instinct and genius ; for the latter , too , works from the fresh impulse of Nature , instead of following the beaten track of experience . Everybody believes that the true poet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration distinguishes greatness from mediocrity . Doubtless it would be a strange thing , if a man were born with a plan of the Parthenon or an image of the llhodian Colossus in his brain ; but are we quite sure that these triumphs of genius do not after all partake , in some sort , of inspiration ? lilt may be suggested , then , that special forms of instinct are to animals what special forms of genius are to men , only that the former are more limited in their range // and mode of action . The genius of Michael Angelo was not limited to the production of one masterpiece ; but the bee never departs from the one pattern shown to her by the great Architect . In its lower forms instinct differs little from what in men we call tact , except that the former is generally limited to some one kind of work , and that , too , specially related to the preservation of the animal or the perpetuation of the species . Although the bee is a perfect house-builder from the beginning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toil makes himself master of that skill and knowledge which the experience of decades of centuries has gathered , yet this proves no superiority of intellect on the part of the brute , even in that direction in which he seems especially to excel . The animal knows only the rule , man the law . The animal is but a journeyman , working after a plan prepared by another ; man is a master-builder , second only to Him who guides the work of the brute . That man has only in these last centuries found out the wonderful mathematical laws which are embodied in the structure of the honeycomb , while the first bee that buzzed about the flowers of Eden built as skilfully as his descendants of the ten thousandth generation , is an indication , not of the superiority of the insect , but of his hopeless and irremediable degradation to the rank of a mere plodder , and of the infinite capacities of the teachable human soul . But in no other way than this could creatures of a day be so well constituted either for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the bee had been obliged to leai*n by experience how to build her cell and elaborate honey and wax , her race would have become extinct with the first generation . The conclusion of the whole matter seems to us to be this : that the Creator has given to every animal , as a compensation for its limited endowment in other respects , a certain kind and amount of innate potential knowledge , adapted to the purposes for which the animal was created , and that this knowledge rises into consciousness at such times and so often as is necessary for the execution of these purposes . We do not conceive that animals are moved like blind machines by this force of instinct , but that an impulse , conscious , though irresistible , arising from the depths of their own natures , urges // them on to the accomplishment of their destiny . When other mental powers coexist with this , ( and in most , if not all animals , this must be the case , ) they blend with it , forming as perfect a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tact , insight , intuition , genius*-these are the terms by which we designate our human instincts ; and through these , no less than through our faculties of reason , we are connected with " our poor relations .
