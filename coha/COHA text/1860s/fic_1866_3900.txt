Many years ago , before railroads were thought of , a company of Connecticut farmers , who had heard marvellous stories of the richness of the land in the West , sold their farms , packed up their goods , bade adieu to their friends , and with their families started for Ohio . After weeks of travel over dusty roads , they came to a beautiful valley , watered by a winding river . The hills around were fair and sunny . There were groves of oaks , and maples , and lindens . The air was fragrant with honeysuckle and jasmine . There was plenty of game . The swift-footed deer browsed the tender grass upon the hills . Squirrels chattered in the trees and the ringdoves cooed in the depths of the forest . The place was so fertile and fair , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , and called it New Hope . They built a mill upon the river . They laid out a wide , level street , and a public square , erected a school-house , and then a church . One of their number opened a store . Other settlers came , and , as the years passed by , the village rang with the shouts of children pouring from the school-house for a frolic upon the square . Glorious times they had beneath the oaks and maples . One of the jolliest of the boys was Paul Parker , only son of Widow Parker , who lived in a little old house , shaded by a great maple , on the outskirts of the village . Her husband died when Paul was in his cradle . Paul 's grandfather was still living . The people called him " Old Pensioner Parker , " for he fought at Bunker Hill , and received a pension from government . He was hale and hearty , though more than eighty years of age . The pension was the main support of the family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chickens , and , by selling milk and eggs , which Paul carried to their customers , they brought the years round without running in debt . Paul 's pantaloons had a patch on each knee , but he laughed just as loud and whistled just as cheerily for all that . In summer he went barefoot . He did not have to turn out at every mud-puddle , and he could plash into the mill-pond and give the frogs a crack over the head without stopping to take off stockings and shoes . Paul did not often have a dinner of roast beef , but he had an abundance of bean porridge , brown bread , and milk . " Bean porridge is wholesome food , Paul , " said his grandfather . " When I was a boy we used to say ,  --  ' Bean porridge hot , Bean porridge cold ,  --  Bean porridge best Nine days old . ' The wood-choppers in winter used to freeze it into cakes and carry it into the woods . Many a time I have made a good dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered what took place in his early years , but he lost his reckoning many times a day upon what was going on in the town . He loved to tell stories , and Paul was a willing listener . Pleasant winter-evenings they had in the old kitchen , the hickory logs blazing on the hearth , the tea-kettle singing through its nose , the clock ticking soberly , the old Pensioner smoking his pipe in the arm-chair , Paul 's mother knitting ,  --  Bruno by Paul 's side , wagging his tail and watching Muff in the opposite corner rolling her great round yellow eyes . Bruno was always ready to give Muff battle whenever Paul tipped him the wink to pitch in . The Pensioner 's stories were of his boyhood ,  --  how he joined the army , and fought the battles of the Revolution . Thus his story ran . " I was only a little bigger than you are , Paul , " he said , " when the red-coats began the war at Lexington . I lived in old Connecticut then ; that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting-house bell rung , and the people blew their dinner-horns , till the whole town was alarmed . I ran up to the meeting-house and found the militia forming . The men had their guns and powder-horns . The women were at work melting their pewter porringers into bullets . I was n't o 'd enough to train , but I could fire a gun and bring down a squirrel from the top of a tree . I wanted to go and help drive the red-coats into the ocean . I asked mother if I might . I was afraid that she did n't want me to go . ' Why , Paul , ' says she , ' you have n't any clothes . ' ' Mother , ' says I , ' I can shoot a red-coat just as well as any of the men can . ' Says she , ' Do you want to go , Paul ? ' ' Yes , mother . ' ' Then you shall go ; I 'll fix you out , ' she said . As I had n't any coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head in the bottom , and made holes for my arms in the sides , cut off a pair of her own stocking-legs , and sewed them on for sleeves , and I was rigged . I took the old gun which father carried at Ticonderoga , and the powder-horn , and started . There is the gun and the horn , Paul , hanging up over the fireplace . " The red-coats had got back to Boston , but we cooped them up . Our company was in Colonel Knowlton 's regiment . I carried the flag , which said , Qui transtulit sustinet . I do n't know anything about Latin , but those who do say it means that God who hath transported us hither will sustain us ; and that is true , Paul . He sustained us at Bunker Hill , and we should have held it if our powder had not given out . Our regiment was by a rail-fence on the northeast side of the hill . Stark , with his New Hampshire boys , was by the river . Prescott was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept walking up and down the lines . This is the way it was , Paul . " The Pensioner laid aside his pipe , bent forward , and traced upon the hearth the positions of the troops . " There is the redoubt ; here is the rail-fence ; there is where the red-coats formed their lines . They came up in front of us here . We did n't fire a gun till they got close to us . I 'll show you how the fire ran down the line . " He took down the horn , pulled out the stopper , held his finger over the tip , and made a trail of powder . " There , Paul , that is by the fence . As the red-coats came up , some of us began to be uneasy and wanted to fire ; but Old Put kept saying , ' Do n't fire yet ! Wait till you can see the white of their eyes ! Aim at their belts ! ' " While the Pensioner was saying this , he took the tongs and picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up beautifully , Paul ,  --  the tall grenadiers and light-infantry in their scarlet coats , and the sun shining on their gun-barrels and bayonets . They wer' n't more than ten rods off when a soldier on top of the hill could n't stand it any longer . Pop ! went his gun , and the fire ran down the hill quicker than scat ! just like this ! " He touched the coal to the powder . There was a flash , a puff of smoke rising to the ceiling , and filling the room . " Hooray ! " shouted Paul , springing to his feet . Muff went with a jump upon the bureau in the corner of the room , her tail as big as Paul 's arm , and her back up . Bruno was after her in a twinkling , bouncing about , barking , and looking round to Paul to see if it was all right . " There , grandpa , you have made a great smut on the hearth , " said Mrs. Parker , who kept her house neat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , mother , I thought it would please Paul . " " S-s-s-s-si'c ! " Paul made a hiss which Bruno understood , for he went at Muff more fiercely . It was glorious to see Muff spit fire , and hear her growl low and deep like distant thunder . Paul would not have Muff hurt for anything , but he loved to see Bruno show his teeth at her , for she was gritty when waked up . " Be still , Paul , and let Muff alone , " said Paul 's mother . " Come , Bruno , she ai n't worth minding , " said Paul . " They have got good courage , both of ' em , " said the Pensioner ; " and courage is one half of the battle , and truth and honor is the other half . Paul , I want you to remember that . It will be worth more than a fortune to you . I do n't mean that cats and dogs know much about truth and honor , and I have seen some men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character than Muff and Bruno ; but what I have said , Paul , is true for all that . They who win success in life are those who love truth , and who follow what is noble and good . No matter how brave a man may be , if he has n't these qualities he wo n't succeed . He may get rich , but that wo n't amount to much . Success , Paul , is to have an unblemished character ,  --  to be true to ourselves , to our country , and to God . " He went on with his story , telling how the British troops ran before the fire of the Yankees ,  --  how they re-formed and came on a second time , and were repulsed again ,  --  how General Clinton went over from Boston with reinforcements ,  --  how Charlestown was set on fire ,  --  how the flames leaped from house to house , and curled round the spire of the church ,  --  how the red-coats advanced a third time beneath the great black clouds of smoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they were obliged to retreat ,  --  how General Putnam tried to rally them ,  --  how they escaped across Charlestown Neck , where the cannon-balls from the British floating batteries raked the ranks ! He made it all so plain , that Paul wished he had been there . The story completed , Paul climbed the creaking stairway to his narrow chamber , repeated his evening prayer , and scrambled into bed . " He is a jolly boy , " said the Pensioner to Paul 's mother , as Paul left the room . " I do n't know what will become of him , " she replied , " he is so wild and thoughtless . He leaves the door open , throws his cap into the corner , sets Bruno and Muff to growling , stops to play on his way home from school , sings , whistles , shouts , hurrahs , and tears round like all possessed . " If she could have looked into Paul 's desk at school , she would have found whirligigs , tops , pin-boxes , nails , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a rogue , " said the Pensioner . " You remember how he got on top of the house awhile ago and frightened us out of our wits by shouting ' Fire ! fire ! ' down the chimney ; how we ran out to see about it ; how I asked him ' Where ? ' and says he , ' Down there in the fireplace , grandpa . ' He is a chip of the old block . I used to do just so . But there is one good thing about him , he do n't do mean tricks . He do n't bend up pins and put them in the boys ' seats , or tuck chestnut-burs into the girls ' hoods . I never knew him to tell a lie . He will come out all right . " " I hope so , " said Mrs. Parker . Paul could look through the crevices between the shingles , and the cracks in the walls , and behold the stars gleaming from the unfathomable spaces . He wondered how far they were away . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his soul with longings for he knew not what . He thought over his grandfather 's stories , and the words he had spoken about courage , truth , and honor , till a shingle clattering in the wind took up the refrain , and seemed to say , Truth and honor ,  --  truth and honor ,  --  truth and honor ,  --  so steadily and pleasantly , that while he listened the stars faded from his sight , and he sailed away into dream-land . Paul was twelve years old , stout , hearty , and healthy ,  --  full of life , and brimming over with fun . Once he set the village in a roar . The people permitted their pigs to run at large . The great maple in front of the Pensioner 's house was cool and shady ,  --  a delightful place for the pigs through the hot summer days . Mr. Chrome , the carriage-painter , lived across the road . He painted a great many wagons for the farmers ,  --  the wheels yellow , the bodies blue , green , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul watched him by the hour , and sometimes made up his mind to be a carriage-painter when he became a man . " Mr. Chrome , " said Paul , " do n't you think that those pigs would look better if they were painted ? " " Perhaps so . " " I should like to see how they would look painted as you paint your wagons . " Mr. Chrome laughed at the ludicrous fancy . He loved fun , and was ready to help carry out the freak . " Well , just try your hand on improving nature , " he said . Paul went to work . Knowing that pigs like to have their backs scratched , he had no difficulty in keeping them quiet . To one he gave green legs , blue ears , red rings round its eyes , and a red tail . Another had one red leg , one blue , one yellow , one green , with red and blue stripes and yellow stars on its body . " I will make him a star-spangled pig , " Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yellow ears , and a red body . Bruno watched the proceedings , wagging his tail , looking now at Paul and then at the pigs , ready to help on the fun . " Si'c !  --  si'c !  --  si'c ! " said Paul . Bruno was upon them with a bound . Away they capered , with him at their heels . As soon as they came into the sunshine the spirits of turpentine in the paint was like fire to their flesh . Faster they ran up the street squealing , with Bruno barking behind . Mr. Chrome laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks . All the dogs , great and small , joined Bruno in chase of the strange game . People came out from the stores , windows were thrown up , and all hands  --  men , women , and children  --  ran to see what was the matter , laughing and shouting , while the pigs and dogs ran round the square . " Paul Parker did that , I 'll bet , " said Mr. Leatherby , the shoemaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like him . " An old white horse , belonging to Mr. Smith , also sought the shade of the maple before the Pensioner 's house . Bruno barked at him by the hour , but the old horse would not move for anything short of a club or stone . " I 'll see if I ca n't get rid of him , " said Paul to himself . He went into the barn , found a piece of rope , tied up a little bundle of hay , got a stick five or six feet long , and some old harness-straps . In the evening , when it was so dark that people could not see what he was up to , he caught the old horse , laid the stick between his ears and strapped it to his neck , and tied the hay to the end of the stick , in such a way that it hung a few inches beyond old Whitey 's nose . The old horse took a step ahead to nibble the hay ,  --  another ,  --  another ,  --  another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said Paul . Tramp ,  --  tramp ,  --  tramp . Old Whitey went down the road . Paul heard him go across the bridge by the mill , and up the hill the other side of the brook . " Go it , old fellow ! " he shouted , then listened again . It was a calm night , and he could just hear old Whitey 's feet ,  --  tramp ,  --  tramp ,  --  tramp . The next morning the good people of Fairview , ten miles from New Hope , laughed to see an old white horse , with a bundle of hay a few inches beyond his nose , passing through the place . Mr. Smith , after breakfast , started out to hunt up old Whitey . He often found him under the maple in front of the Pensioner 's house . Paul was swinging on the gate . " Have you seen my horse ? " Mr. Smith asked . " Yes , sir , I saw him going down towards the bridge last evening , " Paul replied , chuckling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inquired . The miller heard a horse go over the bridge . The farmer on the other side heard a horse go up the hill . Mr. Smith looked at the tracks . They were old Whitey 's , who had a broken shoe on his left hind foot . He followed on . " I never knew him to go away before , " he said to himself , as he walked hour after hour , seeing the tracks all the way to Fairview . " Have you seen a white horse about here ? " he asked of one of the villagers . " Yes , sir ; there was one here this morning trying to overtake a bundle of hay , " the man replied , laughing . " There he is now ! " he added . Mr. Smith looked up and saw old Whitey , who had turned about , and was reaching forward to get a nibble of the hay . Mr. Smith felt like being angry , but the old horse was walking so soberly and earnestly that he could n't help laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know . I 'll give him a blessing when I get back . " It was noon before Mr. Smith reached New Hope . Paul and Bruno were sitting beneath the maple . " Where did you find old Whitey ? " Paul asked . " You was the one who did it , you little rascal ! " " Did what ? " " You know what . You have made me walk clear to Fairview . I have a mind to horsewhip you . " Paul laughed to think that the old horse had tramped so far , though he was sorry that Mr. Smith had been obliged to walk that distance . " I did n't mean any harm , Mr. Smith ; but old Whitey has made our dooryard his stamping-place all summer , and I thought I would see if I could get rid of him . " " Well , sir , if you do it again I 'll trounce you ! " said Mr. Smith as he rode away , his anger coming up . " Would n't it be better for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he would n't trouble us , " said Paul , who knew that Mr. Smith had no right to let old Whitey run at large . Paul was not easily frightened when he had right on his side . The people in the stores and at the tavern had a hearty laugh when they heard how old Whitey went to Fairview . Mr. Cipher taught the village school . He was tall , slim , thin-faced , with black eyes deeply set in his head , and a long , hooked nose like an eagle 's bill . He wore a loose swallow-tailed coat with bright brass buttons , and pants which were several inches too short . The Committee employed him , not because he was a superior teacher , but they could get him for twelve dollars a month , while Mr. Rudiment , who had been through college , and who was known to be an excellent instructor , asked sixteen . There was a crowd of roistering boys and rosy-cheeked girls , who made the old school-house hum like a beehive . Very pleasant to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at noon they had leap-frog and tag . Paul was in a class with Philip Funk , Hans Middlekauf , and Michael Murphy . There were other boys and girls of all nationalities . Paul 's ancestors were from Connecticut , while Philip 's father was a Virginian . Hans was born in Germany , and Michael in Ireland . Philip 's father kept a grocery , and sold sugar , molasses , tobacco , and whiskey . He was rich , and Philip wore good clothes and calf-skin boots . Paul could get his lessons very quick whenever he set about them in earnest , but he spent half his time in inventing fly-traps , making whirligigs , or drawing pictures on his slate . He had an accurate eye , and could draw admirably . Philip could get his lessons also if he chose to apply himself , but it was a great deal easier to have some one work out the problems in arithmetic than to do them himself . " Here , Paul , just help me ; that is a good fellow , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ; Cipher has forbid it . Each one must do his own work , " said Paul . " If you will do it , I will give you a handful of raisins , " said Philip , who usually had his pockets full of raisins , candy , or nuts . " It would n't be right . " " Come , just do this one ; Cipher never will know it . " " No ! " Paul said it resolutely . " You are a mean , sneaking fellow , " said Philip . Philip was a year older than Paul . He had sandy hair , white eyelashes , and a freckled face . He carried a watch , and always had money in his pocket . Paul , on the other hand , hardly ever had a cent which he could call his own . His clothes were worn till they were almost past mending . " Rag-tag has got a hole in his trousers , " said Philip to the other boys . Paul 's face flushed . He wanted to knock Phillip 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hard work to clothe him , and felt the insult keenly . He went into the school-house , choked his anger down , and tried to forget all about it by drawing a picture of the master . It was an excellent likeness ,  --  his spindle legs , great feet , short pants , loose coat , sunken eyes , hooked nose , thin face , and long bony fingers . Philip sat behind Paul . Instead of studying his lesson , he was planning how to get Paul into trouble . He saw the picture . Now was his time . He giggled aloud . Mr. Cipher looked up in astonishment . " What are you laughing at , Master Funk ? " " At what Paul is doing . " Paul hustled his slate into his desk . " Let me see what you have here , " said Cipher , walking up to Paul , who spat on his fingers , and ran his hand into the desk , to rub out the drawing ; but he felt that it would be better to meet his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sneak . He laid the slate before the master without a line effaced . " Giving your attention to drawing , are you , Master Paul ? " said Cipher . His eyes flashed . He knit his brows . The blood rushed to his cheeks . There was a popping up of heads all over the school-room to get a sight of the picture . The boys laughed aloud , and there was a tittering among the girls , which made Cipher very angry . " Silence ! " he roared , and stamped upon the floor so savagely that the windows rattled . " Come out here , sir . I 'll give you a drawing-lesson of another sort . " He seized Paul by the collar , and threw him into the space in front of his own desk . " Hold out your hand . " Paul felt that he was about to receive a tremendous thrashing ; but he determined that he would not flinch . He held out his right hand , and received the blow from a heavy ferule . His hand felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot iron . " The other , sir . " Whack ! it fell , a blow which made the flesh purple . There was an Oh ! upon his tongue ; but he set his teeth together , and bit his lips till they bled , and so smothered it . Another blow ,  --  another ,  --  another . They were hard to bear ; but his teeth were set like a vice . There was a twitching of the muscles round his lips ; he was pale . When the blows fell , he held his breath , but did not snivel . " I 'll see if I ca n't bring you to your feeling , you good-for-nothing scapegrace , " said the master , mad with passion , and surprised that Paul made no outcry . He gave another round , bringing the ferule down with great force . Blood began to ooze from the pores . The last blow spattered the drops around the room . Cipher came to his senses . He stopped . " Are you sorry , sir ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't mean any harm . I suppose I ought not to have drawn it in school ; but I did n't do it to make fun . I drew you just as you are , " said Paul ,  --  his voice trembling a little in spite of his efforts to control it . The master could not deny that it was a perfect likeness . He was surprised at Paul 's cleverness at drawing , and for the first time in his life saw that he cut a ridiculous figure wearing that long , loose , swallow-tailed coat , with great , flaming brass buttons , and resolved upon the spot that his next coat should be a frock , and that he would get a longer pair of pants . " You may take your seat , sir ! " he said , puzzled to know whether to punish Paul still more , and compel him to say that he was sorry , or whether to accept the explanations , and apologize for whipping him so severely . Paul sat down . His hands ached terribly ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been whipped before the whole school . All the girls had witnessed his humiliation . There was one among them ,  --  Azalia Adams ,  --  who stood at the head of Paul 's class , the best reader and speller in school . She had ruby lips , and cheeks like roses ; the golden sunlight falling upon her chestnut hair crowned her with glory ; deep , thoughtful , and earnest was the liquid light of her hazel eyes ; she was as lovely and beautiful as the flower whose name she bore . Paul had drawn her picture many times ,  --  sometimes bending over her task , sometimes as she sat , unmindful of the hum of voices around her , looking far away into a dim and distant dream-land . He never wearied of tracing the features of one so fair and good as she . Her laugh was as musical as a mountain-brook ; and in the church on Sunday , when he heard her voice sweetly and melodiously mingling with the choir , he thought of the angels ,  --  of her as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sonny , and tell your marm that you got a licking , " said Philip when school was out . Paul 's face became livid . He would have doubled his fist and given Philip a blow in the face , but his palms were like puff-balls . There was an ugly feeling inside , but just then a pair of bright hazel eyes , almost swimming with tears , looked into his own . " Do n't mind it , Paul ! " said Azalia . The pain was not half so hard to bear after that . He wanted to say , " I thank you , " but did not know how . Till then his lips had hardly quivered , and he had not shed a tear ; now his eyes became moist ; one great drop rolled down his cheek , but he wiped it off with his coat-sleeve , and turned away , for fear that Azalia would think him a baby . On his way home the thought uppermost in his mind was , " What will mother say ? " Why tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself ? But then he remembered that she had said , " Paul , I shall expect you to tell me truthfully all that happens to you at school . " He loved his mother . She was one of the best mothers that ever lived , working for him day and night . How could he abuse such confidence as she had given him ? He would not violate it . He would not be a sneak . His mother and the Pensioner were sitting before the fire as he entered the house . She welcomed him with a smile ,  --  a beautiful smile it was , for she was a noble woman , and Paul was her darling , her pride , the light , joy , and comfort of her life . " Well , Paul , how do you get on at school ? " his grandfather asked . " I got a whipping to-day . " It was spoken boldly and manfully . " What ! My son got a whipping ! " his mother exclaimed . " Yes , mother . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about it . " Paul stood by her side and told the story ,  --  how Philip Funk tried to bribe him , how he called him names ,  --  how , having got his lessons , he made a picture of the master . " Here it is , mother . " He took his slate from his little green bag . The picture had not been effaced . His mother looked at it and laughed , notwithstanding her efforts to keep sober , for it was such a perfect likeness . She had an exquisite sense of the ludicrous , and Paul was like her . She was surprised to find that he could draw so well . " We will talk about the matter after supper , " she said . She had told Paul many times , that , if he was justly punished at school , he must expect a second punishment at home ; but she wanted to think awhile before deciding what to do . She was pleased to know that her boy could not be bribed to do what his conscience told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was manly and truthful . She would rather follow him to the church-yard and lay him in his grave beneath the bending elms , than to have him untruthful or wicked . The evening passed away . Paul sat before the fire , looking steadily into the coals . He was sober and thoughtful , wondering what his mother would say at last . The clock struck nine . It was his bedtime . He went and stood by her side once more . " You are not angry with me , mother , are you ? " " No , my son . I do not think that you deserved so severe a punishment . I am rejoiced to know that you are truthful , and that you despise a mean act . Be always as you have been to-night in telling the truth , and I never shall be angry with you . " He threw his arms around her neck , and gave way to tears , such as Cipher could not extort by his pounding . She gave him a good-night kiss ,  --  so sweet that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . " God bless you , Paul , " said the Pensioner . Paul climbed the creaking stairs , and knelt with an overflowing heart to say his evening prayer . He spoke the words earnestly when he asked God to take care of his mother and grandfather . He was very happy . He looked out through the crevices in the walls , and saw the stars and the moon flooding the landscape with silver light . There was sweet music in the air ,  --  the merry melody of the water murmuring by the mill , the cheerful chirping of the crickets , and the lullaby of the winds , near at hand and far away , putting him in mind of the choirs on earth and the choirs in heaven . " Do n't mind it , Paul ! " were the words they sung , so sweetly and tenderly that for many days they rang in his ears . CHAPTER II . HARD TIMES . How lonesome the days when dear friends leave us to return no more , whom we never shall see again on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love from the far distant land whither they have gone ! It tries our hearts and brings tears to our eyes to lay them in the ground . But shall we never , never see them again ? Yes , when we have taken the same journey , when we have closed our eyes on earth and opened them in heaven . As the months rolled by , the Pensioner 's eyes grew dim . He became weak and feeble . " The Pensioner wo n't stand it long , " the people said . He did not rise one morning when breakfast was ready . " Come , grandpa , " said Paul , opening the bedroom door and calling him ; but there was no reply . He lay as if asleep ; but his brow was cold , and his heart had stopped beating . He had died calmly and peacefully , and was forever at rest . It was a sad day to Paul when he followed the body of his dear old grandfather to the grave ; but when he stood by his coffin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , and saw how peaceful it was and how pleasant the smile which rested upon it , as if he was beholding beautiful scenes ,  --  when Paul remembered how good he was , he could not feel it in his soul to say , " Come back , Grandpa " ; he would be content as it was . But the days were long and dreary , and so were the nights . Many the hours which Paul passed lying awake in his bed , looking through the crevices of the poor old house , and watching the stars and the clouds as they went sailing by . So he was sailing on , and the question would come up , Whither ? He listened to the water falling over the dam by the mill , and to the chirping of the crickets , and the sighing of the wind , and the church-bell tolling the hours : they were sweet , yet mournful and solemn sounds . Tears stood in his eyes and rolled down his cheeks , as he thought that he and his mother were on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the heavenly choirs . But he resolved to be good , to take care of his mother , and be her comfort and joy . Hard times came on . How to live was the great question ; for now that his grandfather was gone , they could have the pension no longer . The neighbors were very kind . Sometimes Mr. Middlekauf , Hans 's father , who had a great farm , left a bag of meal for them when he came into the village . There was little work for Paul to do in the village ; but he kept their own garden in good trim ,  --  the onion-bed clear of weeds , and the potatoes well hilled . Very pleasant it was to work there , where the honey-bees hummed over the beds of sage , and among his mother 's flowers , and where bumble-bees dusted their yellow jackets in the hollyhocks . Swallows also built their nests under the eaves of the house , and made the days pleasant with their merry twittering . The old Pensioner had been a land surveyor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he had run many lines with it through the grand old forest . One day , as Paul was weeding the onions , it occurred to him that he might become a surveyor ; so he went into the house , took the compass from its case , and sat down to study it . He found his grandfather 's surveying-book , and began to study that . Some parts were hard and dry ; but having resolved to master it , he was not the boy to give up a good resolution . It was not long before he found out how to run a line , how to set off angles , and how to ascertain the distance across a river or pond without measuring it . He went into the woods , and stripped great rolls of birch bark from the trees , carried them home , spread them out on the table , and plotted his lines with his dividers and ruler . He could not afford paper . He took great pleasure in making a sketch of the ground around the house , the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the river . The people of New Hope had long been discussing the project of building a new road to Fairview , which would cross the pond above the mill . But there was no surveyor in the region to tell them how long the bridge must be which they would have to build . " We will send up a kite , and thus get a string across the pond , " said one of the citizens . " I can ascertain the distance easier than that , " said Paul . Mr. Pimpleberry , the carpenter , who was to build the bridge , laughed , and looked with contempt upon him , Paul thought , because he was barefoot and had a patch on each knee . " Have you ever measured it , Paul ? " Judge Adams asked . " No , sir ; but I will do so just to let Mr. Pimpleberry see that I can do it . " He ran into the house , brought out the compass , went down to the edge of the pond , drove a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sighted a small oak-tree upon the other side of the pond . It happened that the tree was exactly south from the stake ; then he turned the sights of his compass so that they pointed exactly east and west . Then he took Mr. Pimpleberry 's ten-foot pole , and measured out fifty feet toward the west , and drove another stake . Then he set his compass there , and took another sight at the small oak-tree across the pond . It was not south now , but several degrees east of south . Then he turned his compass so that the sights would point just the same number of degrees to the east of north . " Now , Mr. Pimpleberry , " said Paul , " I want you to stand out there , and hold your ten-foot pole just where I tell you , putting yourself in range with the stake I drove first and the tree across the pond . " Mr. Pimpleberry did as he was desired . " Drive a stake where your pole stands , " said Paul . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one you have just driven to my first stake , and that will be the distance across the pond , " said Paul . " I do n't believe it , " said Mr. Pimpleberry . " Paul is right , " said Judge Adams . " I understand the principle . He has done it correctly . " The Judge was proud of him . Mr. Pimpleberry and Mr. Funk , and several other citizens , were astonished ; for they had no idea that Paul could do anything of the kind . Notwithstanding Paul had given the true distance , he received no thanks from any one ; yet he did n't care for that ; for he had shown Mr. Pimpleberry that he could do it , and that was glory enough . Paul loved fun as well as ever . Rare times he had at school . One windy day , a little boy , when he entered the school-room , left the door open . " Go back and shut the door , " shouted Mr. Cipher , who was very irritable that morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cipher was angry , and spoke to the whole school : " Any one who comes in to-day and does not shut the door will get a flogging . Now remember ! " Being very awkward in his manners , inefficient in government , and shallow-brained and vain , he commanded very little respect from the scholars . " Boys , there is a chance for us to have a jolly time with Cipher , " said Paul at recess . " What is it ? " Hans Middlekauf asked , ready for fun of any sort . The boys gathered round , for they knew that Paul was a capital hand in inventing games . " You remember what Cipher said about leaving the door open . " " Well , what of it ? " Hans Middlekauf asked . " Let every one of us show him that we can obey him . When he raps for us to go in , I want you all to form in line . I 'll lead off , go in and shut the door ; you follow next , Hans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next , Philip ; then Michael , and so on ,  --  every one shutting the door . If you do n't , remember that Cipher has promised to flog you . " The boys saw through the joke , and laughed heartily . " Jingo , that is a good one , Paul . Cipher will be as mad as a March hare . I 'll make the old door rattle , " said Hans . Rap  --  rap  --  rap  --  rap ! went the master 's ruler upon the window . " Fall into line , boys , " said Paul . They obeyed orders as if he were a general . " Now remember , every one of you , to shut the door just as soon as you are in . Do it quick , and take your seats . Do n't laugh , but be as sober as deacons . " There was giggling in the ranks . " Silence ! " said Paul . The boys smoothed their faces . Paul opened the door , stepped in , and shut it in an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! it went , with a jar which made the windows rattle . Philip followed ,  --  slam ! Michael next ,  --  bang ! it went , jarring the house . " Let the door be open , " said Cipher ; but Michael was in his seat ; and  --  bang ! again ,  --  slam !  --  bang !  --  slam !  --  bang ! it went . " Let it be open , I say ! " he roared , but the boys outside did not hear him , and it kept going ,  --  slam !  --  slam !  --  slam !  --  bang !  --  bang !  --  bang !  --  till the fiftieth boy was in . " You started that , sir , " Cipher said , addressing Paul , for he had discovered that Paul Parker loved fun , and was a leading spirit among the boys . " I obeyed your orders , sir , " Paul replied ready to burst into a roar at the success of his experiment . " Did you not tell the boys to slam the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . I told them to remember what you had said , and that , if they did n't shut the door , they would get a flogging . " " That is just what he said , Master , " said Hans Middlekauf , brimming over with fun . Cipher could not dispute it . He saw that they had literally obeyed his orders , and that he had been outwitted . He did not know what to do ; and being weak and inefficient , did nothing . Paul loved hunting and fishing ; on Saturday afternoons he made the woods ring with the crack of his grandfather 's gun , bringing squirrels from the tallest trees , and taking quails upon the wing . He was quick to see , and swift to take aim . He was cool of nerve , and so steady of aim that he rarely missed . It was summer , and he wore no shoes . He walked so lightly that he scarcely rustled a leaf . The partridges did not see him till he was close upon them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  bang !  --  and they went into his bag . One day as he was on his return from the woods , with the gun upon his shoulder , and the powder-horn at his side , he saw a gathering of people in the street . Men , women , and children were out ,  --  the women without bonnets . He wondered what was going on . Some women were wringing their hands ; and all were greatly excited . " O dear , is n't it dreadful ! " " What will become of us ? " " The Lord have mercy upon us ! "  --  were the expressions which he heard . Then they wrung their hands again , and moaned . " What is up ? " he asked of Hans Middlekauf . " Have n't you heard ? " " No , what is it ? " " Why , there is a big black bull-dog , the biggest that ever was , that has run mad . He has bitten ever so many other dogs , and horses , sheep , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and froths at the mouth . He is the savagest critter that ever was , " said Hans in a breath . " Why do n't somebody kill him ? " " They are afraid of him , " said Hans . " I should think they might kill him , " Paul replied . " I reckon you would run as fast as anybody else , if he should show himself round here , " said Hans . " There he is ! Run ! run ! run for your lives ! " was the sudden cry . Paul looked up the street , and saw a very large bull-dog coming upon the trot . Never was there such a scampering . People ran into the nearest houses , pellmell . One man jumped into his wagon , lashed his horse into a run , and went down the street , losing his hat in his flight , while Hans Middlekauf went up a tree . " Run , Paul ! Run ! he 'll bite you ! " cried Mr. Leatherby from the window of his shoe-shop . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half-dozen at once ; but Paul took no notice of them . Those who were nearest him heard the click of his gun-lock . The dog came nearer , growling , and snarling , his mouth wide open , showing his teeth , his eyes glaring , and white froth dripping from his lips . Paul stood alone in the street . There was a sudden silence . It was a scene for a painter ,  --  a barefoot boy in patched clothes , with an old hat on his head , standing calmly before the brute whose bite was death in its most terrible form . One thought had taken possession of Paul 's mind , that he ought to kill the dog . Nearer , nearer , came the dog ; he was not a rod off . Paul had read that no animal can withstand the steady gaze of the human eye . He looked the dog steadily in the face . He held his breath . Not a nerve trembled . The dog stopped , looked at Paul a moment , broke into a louder growl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly , and stepped slowly forward . Now or never , Paul thought , was his time . The breach of the gun touched his shoulder ; his eye ran along the barrel ,  --  bang ! the dog rolled over with a yelp and a howl , but was up again , growling and trying to get at Paul , who in an instant seized his gun by the barrel , and brought the breech down upon the dog 's skull , giving him blow after blow . " Kill him ! kill him ! " shouted the people from the windows . " Give it to him ! Mash his head ! " cried Hans from the tree . The dog soon became a mangled and bloody mass of flesh and bones . The people came out from their houses . " That was well done for a boy , " said Mr. Funk . " Or for a man either , " said Mr. Chrome , who came up and patted Paul on his back . " I should have thrown my lapstone at him , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leatherby . Mr. Noggin , the cooper , who had taken refuge in Leatherby 's shop , afterwards said that Leatherby was frightened half to death , and kept saying , " Just as like as not he will make a spring and dart right through the window ! " " Nobly , bravely done , Paul , " said Judge Adams . " Let me shake hands with you , my boy . " He and Mrs. Adams and Azalia had seen it all from their parlor window . " O Paul , I was afraid he would bite and kill you , or that your gun would miss fire . I trembled all over just like a leaf , " said Azalia , still pale and trembling . " O , I am so glad you have killed him ! " She looked up into his face earnestly , and there was such a light in her eyes , that Paul was glad he had killed the dog , for her sake . " Were n't you afraid , Paul ? " she asked . " No . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps ; I made up my mind to kill him , and what was the use of being afraid ? " Many were the praises bestowed upon Paul . " How noble ! how heroic ! " the people said . Hans told the story to all the boys in the village . " Paul was just as cool as  --  cool as  --  a cucumber , " he said , that being the best comparison he could think of . The people came and looked at the dog , to see how large he was , and how savage , and went away saying , " I am glad he is dead , but I do n't see how Paul had the courage to face him . " Paul went home and told his mother what had happened . She turned pale while listening to the story , and held her breath , and clasped her hands ; but when he had finished , and when she thought that , if Paul had not killed the dog , many might have been bitten , she was glad , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is our duty to face danger if we can do good . " A tear glistened in her eye as she kissed him . " God bless you , Paul , " she said , and smiled upon him through her tears . All the dogs which had been bitten were killed to prevent them from running mad . A hard time of it the dogs of New Hope had , for some which had not been bitten did not escape the dog-killers , who went through the town knocking them over with clubs . Although Paul was so cool and courageous in the moment of danger , he trembled and felt weak afterwards when he thought of the risk he had run . That night when he said his evening prayer , he thanked God for having protected him . He dreamed it all over again in the night . He saw the dog coming at him with his mouth wide open , the froth dropping from his lips , and his eyes glaring . He heard his growl ,  --  only it was not a growl , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house when the wind blew . That was what set him a-dreaming . In his dream he had no gun , so he picked up the first thing he could lay his hands on , and let drive at the dog . Smash ! there was a great racket , and a jingling of glass . Paul was awake in an instant , and found that he had jumped out of bed , and was standing in the middle of the floor , and that he had knocked over the spinning-wheel , and a lot of old trumpery , and had thrown one of his grandfather 's old boots through the window . " What in the world are you up to , Paul ? " his mother asked , calling from the room below , in alarm . " Killing the dog a second time , mother , " Paul replied , laughing and jumping into bed again . CHAPTER III . MERRY TIMES . When the long northeast storms set in , and the misty clouds hung over the valley , and went hurrying away to the west , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hour after hour , and day after day , fell aslant upon the roof of the little old house ; when the wind swept around the eaves , and dashed in wild gusts against the windows , and moaned and wailed in the forests ,  --  then it was that Paul sometimes felt his spirits droop , for the circumstances of life were all against him . He was poor . His dear , kind mother was sick . She had worked day and night to keep that terrible wolf from the door , which is always prowling around the houses of poor people . But the wolf had come , and was looking in at the windows . There was a debt due Mr. Funk for rice , sugar , biscuit , tea , and other things which Doctor Arnica said his mother must have . There was the doctor 's bill . The flour-barrel was getting low , and the meal-bag was almost empty . Paul saw the wolf every night as he lay in his bed , and he wished he could kill it . When his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nurse . It was hard for him to lay down his books , for he loved them , but it was pleasant to wait upon her . The neighbors were kind . Azalia Adams often came tripping in with something nice ,  --  a tumbler of jelly , or a plate of toast , which her mother had prepared ; and she had such cheerful words , and spoke so pleasantly , and moved round the room so softly , putting everything in order , that the room was lighter , even on the darkest days , for her presence . When , after weeks of confinement to her bed , Paul 's mother was strong enough to sit in her easy-chair , Paul went out to fight the wolf . He worked for Mr. Middlekauf , in his cornfield . He helped Mr. Chrome paint wagons . He surveyed land , and ran lines for the farmers , earning a little here and a little there . As fast as he obtained a dollar , it went to pay the debts . As the seasons passed away ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that the wolf howled less fiercely day by day . He denied himself everything , except plain food . He was tall , stout , hearty , and rugged . The winds gave him health ; his hands were hard , but his heart was tender . When through with his day 's work , though his bones ached and his eyes were drowsy , he seldom went to sleep without first studying awhile , and closing with a chapter from the Bible , for he remembered what his grandfather often said ,  --  that a chapter from the Bible was a good thing to sleep on . The cool and bracing breezes of November , the nourishing food which Paul obtained , brought the color once more to his mother 's cheeks ; and when at length she was able to be about the house , they had a jubilee ,  --  a glad day of thanksgiving ,  --  for , in addition to this blessing of health , Paul had killed the wolf , and the debts were all paid . As the winter came on , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed . Mr. Quaver , a tall , slim man , with a long , red nose , had led the choir for many years . He had a loud voice , and twisted his words so badly , that his singing was like the blare of a trumpet . On Sundays , after Rev. Mr. Surplice read the hymn , the people were accustomed to hear a loud Hawk ! from Mr. Quaver , as he tossed his tobacco-quid into a spittoon , and an Ahem ! from Miss Gamut . She was the leading first treble , a small lady with a sharp , shrill voice . Then Mr. Fiddleman sounded the key on the bass-viol , do-mi-sol-do , helping the trebles and tenors climb the stairs of the scale ; then he hopped down again , and rounded off with a thundering swell at the bottom , to let them know he was safely down , and ready to go ahead . Mr. Quaver led , and the choir followed like sheep , all in their own way and fashion . The people had listened to this style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted a change , and decided to engage Mr. Rhythm , a nice young man , to teach a singing-school for the young folks . " We have a hundred boys and girls here in the village , who ought to learn to sing , so that they can sit in the singing-seats , and praise God , " said Judge Adams . But Mr. Quaver opposed the project . " The young folks want a frolic , sir , " he said ; " yes , sir , a frolic , a high time . Rhythm will be teaching them newfangled notions . You know , Judge , that I hate flummididdles ; I go for the good old things , sir . The old tunes which have stood the wear and tear of time , and the good old style of singing , sir . " Mr. Quaver did not say all he thought , for he could see that , if the singing-school was kept , he would be in danger of losing his position as chorister . But , notwithstanding his opposition , Mr. Rhythm was engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He loved music . " You have n't any coat fit to wear , " said his mother . " I have altered over your grandfather 's pants and vest for you , but I can not alter his coat . You will have to stay at home , I guess . " " I ca n't do that , mother , for Mr. Rhythm is one of the best teachers that ever was , and I do n't want to miss the chance . I 'll wear grandpa 's coat just as it is . " " The school will laugh at you . " " Well , let them laugh , I sha' n't stay at home for that . I guess I can stand it , " said Paul , resolutely . The evening fixed upon for the school to commence arrived . All the young folks in the town were there . Those who lived out of the village ,  --  the farmers ' sons and daughters ,  --  came in red , yellow , and green wagons . The girls wore close-fitting hoods with pink linings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all aglow with the excitement of the occasion . When they saw Mr. Rhythm , how pleasant and smiling he was ,  --  when they heard his voice , so sweet and melodious ,  --  when they saw how spryly he walked , as if he meant to accomplish what he had undertaken ,  --  they said to one another , " How different he is from Mr. Quaver ! " Paul was late on the first evening ; for when he put on his grandfather 's coat , his mother planned a long while to see if there was not some way by which she could make it look better . Once she took the shears and was going to cut off the tail , but Paul stopped her . " I do n't want it curtailed , mother . " " It makes you look like a little old man , Paul ; I would n't go . " " If I had better clothes , I should wear them , mother ; but as I have n't , I shall wear these . I hope to earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but grandpa wore this , and I am not ashamed to wear what he wore , " he replied , more resolute than ever . Perhaps , if he could have seen how he looked , he would not have been quite so determined , for the sleeves hung like bags on his arms , and the tail almost touched the floor . Mr. Rhythm had just rapped the scholars to their seats when Paul entered . There was a tittering , a giggle , then a roar of laughter . Mr. Rhythm looked round to see what was the matter , and smiled . For a moment Paul 's courage failed him . It was not so easy to be laughed at as he had imagined . He was all but ready to turn about and leave the room . " No I wo n't , I 'll face it out , " he said to himself , walking deliberately to a seat , and looking bravely round , as if asking , " What are you laughing at ? " There was something in his manner which instantly won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself for having laughed . " Silence ! No more laughing , " he said ; but , notwithstanding the command , there was a constant tittering among the girls . Mr. Rhythm began by saying , " We will sing Old Hundred . I want you all to sing , whether you can sing right or not . " He snapped his tuning-fork , and began . The school followed , each one singing ,  --  putting in sharps , flats , naturals , notes , and rests , just as they pleased . " Very well . Good volume of sound . Only I do n't think Old Hundred ever was sung so before , or ever will be again , " said the master , smiling . Michael Murphy was confident that he sang gloriously , though he never varied his tone up or down . He was ciphering in fractions at school , and what most puzzled him were the figures set to the bass . He wondered if 6/4 was a vulgar fraction , and if so , he thought it would be better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening , Mr. Rhythm , noticing that Michael sang without any variation of tone , said , " Now , Master Murphy , please sing la with me " ;  --  and Michael sang bravely , not frightened in the least . " Very well . Now please sing it a little higher . " " La , " sang Michael on the same pitch , but louder . " Not louder , but higher . " " LA ! " responded Michael , still louder , but with the pitch unchanged . There was tittering among the girls . " Not so , but thus , "  --  and Mr. Rhythm gave an example , first low , then high . " Now once more . " " LA ! " bellowed Michael on the same pitch . Daphne Dare giggled aloud , and the laughter , like a train of powder , ran through the girls ' seats over to the boys ' side of the house , where it exploded in a loud haw ! haw ! Michael laughed with the others , but he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandpa ! How are you , Old Pensioner ? Your coat puckers under the arms , and there is a wrinkle in the back , " said Philip Funk to Paul . His sister Fanny pointed her finger at him ; and Paul heard her whisper to one of the girls , " Did you ever see such a monkey ? " It nettled him , and so , losing his temper , he said to Philip , " Mind your business . " " Just hear Grandaddy Parker , the old gentleman in the bob-tailed coat , " said Philip . " You are a puppy , " said Paul . But he was vexed with himself for having said it . If he had held his tongue , and kept his temper , and braved the sneers of Philip in silence , he might have won a victory ; for he remembered a Sunday-school lesson upon the text , " He that ruleth his spirit is greater than he that taketh a city . " As it was , he had suffered a defeat , and went home that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under Mr. Rhythm 's instructions the young people made rapid progress . Then what fine times they had at recess , eating nuts , apples , and confectionery , picking out the love-rhymes from the sugar-cockles ! " I can not tell the love I feel for you , my dove . " was Philip 's gift to Azalia . Paul had no money to purchase sweet things at the store ; his presents were nuts which he had gathered in the autumn . In the kindness of his heart he gave a double-handful to Philip 's sister , Fanny ; but she turned up her nose , and let them drop upon the floor . Society in New Hope was mixed . Judge Adams , Colonel Dare , and Mr. Funk were rich men . Colonel Dare was said to be worth a hundred thousand dollars . No one knew what Mr. Funk was worth ; but he had a store , and a distillery , which kept smoking day and night and Sunday , without cessation , grinding up corn , and distilling it into whiskey . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fires were always roaring , and the great vats steaming . Colonel Dare made his money by buying and selling land , wool , corn , and cattle . Judge Adams was an able lawyer , known far and near as honest , upright , and learned . He had a large practice ; but though the Judge and Colonel were so wealthy , and lived in fine houses , they did not feel that they were better than their neighbors , so that there was no aristocracy in the place , but the rich and the poor were alike respected and esteemed . The New Year was at hand , and Daphne Dare was to give a party . She was Colonel Dare 's only child ,  --  a laughing , blue-eyed , sensible girl , who attended the village school , and was in the same class with Paul . " Whom shall I invite to my party , father ? " she asked . " Just whom you please , my dear , " said the Colonel . " I do n't know what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to associate with a fellow who is so poor that he wears his grandfather 's old clothes , " said Daphne . " Poverty is not a crime , my daughter . I was poor once ,  --  poor as Paul is . Money is not virtue , my dear . It is a good thing to have ; but persons are not necessarily bad because they are poor , neither are they good because they are rich , " said the Colonel . " Should you invite him , father , if you were in my place ? " " I do not wish to say , my child , for I want you to decide the matter yourself . " " Azalia says that she would invite him ; but Fanny says that if I invite him , she shall not come . " " Aha ! " The Colonel opened his eyes wide . " Well , my dear , you are not to be influenced wholly by what Azalia says , and you are to pay no attention to what Fanny threatens . You make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom you please ; and if Fanny do n't choose to come , she has the privilege of staying away . I think , however , that she will not be likely to stay at home even if you give Paul an invitation . Be guided by your own sense of right , my darling . That is the best guide . " " I wish you 'd give Paul a coat , father . You can afford to , ca n't you ? " " Yes ; but he ca n't afford to receive it , " Daphne looked at her father in amazement . " He ca n't afford to receive such a gift from me , because it is better for him to fight the battle of life without any help from me or anybody else at present . A good man offered to help me when I was a poor boy ; but I thanked him , and said , ' No , sir . ' I had made up my mind to cut my own way , and I guess Paul has made up his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I shall invite him . I 'll let Fanny know that I have a mind of my own , " said Daphne , with determination in her voice . Her father kissed her , but kept his thoughts to himself . He appeared to be pleased , and Daphne thought that he approved her decision . The day before New Year Paul received a neatly folded note , addressed to Mr. Paul Parker . How funny it looked ! It was the first time in his life that he had seen " Mr. " prefixed to his name . He opened it , and read that Miss Daphne Dare would receive her friends on New Year 's eve at seven o'clock . A great many thoughts passed through his mind . How could he go and wear his grandfather 's coat ? At school he was on equal footing with all ; but to be one of a party in a richly furnished parlor , where Philip , Fanny , and Azalia , and other boys and girls whose fathers had money , could turn their backs on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very kind in Daphne to invite him , and ought he not to accept her invitation ? Would she not think it a slight if he did not go ? What excuse could he offer if he stayed away ? None , except that he had no nice clothes . But she knew that , yet she had invited him . She was a true-hearted girl , and would not have asked him if she had not wanted him . Thus he turned the matter over , and decided to go . But when the time came , Paul was in no haste to be there . Two or three times his heart failed him , while on his way ; but looking across the square , and seeing Colonel Dare 's house all aglow ,  --  lights in the parlors and chambers , he pushed on resolutely , determined to be manly , notwithstanding his poverty . He reached the house , rang the bell , and was welcomed by Daphne in the hall . " Good evening , Paul . You are very late . I was afraid you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , her face beaming with happiness , joy , and excitement . She was elegantly dressed , for she was her father 's pet , and he bought everything for her which he thought would make her happy . " Better late than never , is n't it ? " said Paul , not knowing what else to say . Although the party had been assembled nearly an hour , there had been no games . The girls were huddled in groups on one side of the room , and the boys on the other , all shy , timid , and waiting for somebody to break the ice . Azalia was playing the piano , while Philip stood by her side . He was dressed in a new suit of broadcloth , and wore an eye-glass . Fanny was present , though she had threatened not to attend if Paul was invited . She had changed her mind . She thought it would be better to attend and make the place too hot for Paul ; she would get up such a laugh upon him that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and never show himself in respectable society again . Philip was in the secret , and so were a dozen others who looked up to Philip and Fanny . Daphne entered the parlor , followed by Paul . There was a sudden tittering , snickering , and laughing . Paul stopped and bowed , then stood erect . " I declare , if there is n't old Grandaddy , " said Philip , squinting through his eye-glass . " O my ! how funny ! " said a girl from Fairview . " Ridiculous ! It is a shame ! " said Fanny , turning up her nose . " Who is he ? " the Fairview girl asked . " A poor fellow who lives on charity ,  --  so poor that he wears his grandfather 's old clothes . We do n't associate with him , " was Fanny 's reply . Paul heard it . His cheek flushed , but he stood there , determined to brave it out . Azalia heard and saw it all . She stopped playing in the middle of a measure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked towards Paul , extending her hand and welcoming him . " I am glad you have come , Paul . We want you to wake us up . We have been half asleep , " she said . The laughter ceased instantly , for Azalia was queen among them . Beautiful in form and feature , her chestnut hair falling in luxuriant curls upon her shoulders , her dark hazel eyes flashing indignantly , her cheeks like blush-roses , every feature of her countenance lighted up by the excitement of the moment , her bearing subdued the conspiracy at once , hushing the derisive laughter , and compelling respect , not only for herself , but for Paul . It required an effort on his part to keep back the tears from his eyes , so grateful was he for her kindness . " Yes , Paul , we want you to be our general , and tell us what to do , " said Daphne . " Very well , let us have Copenhagen to begin with , " he said . The ice was broken . Daphne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken from the room , and in five minutes the parlor was humming like a beehive . " I do n't see what you can find to like in that disagreeable creature , " said Philip to Azalia . " He is a good scholar , and kind to his mother , and you know how courageous he was when he killed that terrible dog , " was her reply . " I think he is an impudent puppy . What right has he to thrust himself into good company , wearing his grandfather 's old clothes ? " Philip responded , dangling his eye-glass and running his soft hand through his hair . " Paul is poor ; but I never have heard anything against his character , " said Azalia . " Poor folks ought to be kept out of good society , " said Philip . " What do you say to that picture ? " said Azalia , directing his attention towards a magnificent picture of Franklin crowned with laurel by the ladies of the court of France , which hung on the wall . " Benjamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a living ; but he became a great man . " " Dipped candles ! Why , I never heard of that before , " said Philip , looking at the engraving through his eye-glass . " I do n't think it is any disgrace to Paul to be poor . I am glad that Daphne invited him , " said Azalia , so resolutely that Philip remained silent . He was shallow-brained and ignorant , and thought it not best to hazard an exposure of his ignorance by pursuing the conversation . After Copenhagen they had Fox and Geese , and Blind-man's-buff . They guessed riddles and conundrums , had magic writing , questions and answers , and made the parlor , the sitting-room , the spacious halls , and the wide stairway ring with their merry laughter . How pleasant the hours ! Time flew on swiftest wings . They had a nice supper ,  --  sandwiches , tongue , ham , cakes , custards , floating-islands , apples , and nuts . After supper they had stories , serious and laughable , about ghosts and witches , till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and pointed to the figure twelve , as if in amazement at their late staying . " Twelve o'clock ! Why , how short the evening has been ! " said they , when they found how late it was . They had forgotten all about Paul 's coat , for he had been the life of the party , suggesting something new when the games lagged . He was so gentlemanly , and laughed so heartily and pleasantly , and was so wide awake , and managed everything so well , that , notwithstanding the conspiracy to put him down , he had won the good will of all the party . During the evening Colonel Dare and Mrs. Dare entered the room . The Colonel shook hands with Paul , and said , " I am very happy to see you here to-night , Paul . " It was spoken so heartily and pleasantly that Paul knew the Colonel meant it . The young gentlemen were to wait upon the young ladies home . Their hearts went pit-a-pat . They thought over whom to ask and what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their gloves , while the girls were putting on their cloaks and hoods up stairs . They also were in a fever of expectation and excitement , whispering mysteriously , their hearts going like trip-hammers . Daphne stood by the door to bid her guests good night . " I am very glad that you came to-night , Paul , " she said , pressing his hand in gratitude , " I do n't know what we should have done without you . " " I have passed a very pleasant evening , " he replied . Azalia came tripping down the stairs . " Shall I see you home , Azalia ? " Paul asked . " Miss Adams , shall I have the delightful pleasure of being permitted to escort you to your residence ? " said Philip , with his most gallant air , at the same time pushing by Paul with a contemptuous look . " Thank you , Philip , but I have an escort , " said Azalia , accepting Paul 's arm . The night was frosty and cold , though it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavens , the air was still , and there were no sounds to break the peaceful silence , except the water dashing over the dam by the mill , the footsteps of the departing guests upon the frozen ground , and the echoing of their voices . Now that he was with Azalia alone , Paul wanted to tell her how grateful he was for all she had done for him ; but he could only say , " I thank you , Azalia , for your kindness to me to-night . " " O , do n't mention it , Paul ; I am glad if I have helped you . Good night . " How light-hearted he was ! He went home , and climbed the creaking stairway , to his chamber . The moon looked in upon him , and smiled . He could not sleep , so happy was he . How sweet those parting words ! The water babbled them to the rocks , and beyond the river in the grand old forest , where the breezes were blowing , there was a pleasant murmuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a party , and all were saying , " We are glad if we have helped you . " CHAPTER IV . MUSIC AND PAINTING . Philip went home alone from the party , out of sorts with himself , angry with Azalia , and boiling over with wrath toward Paul . He set his teeth together , and clenched his fist . He would like to blacken Paul 's eyes and flatten his nose . The words of Azalia  --  " I know nothing against Paul 's character "  --  rang in his ears and vexed him . He thought upon them till his steps , falling upon the frozen ground , seemed to say , " Character !  --  character !  --  character ! " as if Paul had something which he had not . " So because he has character , and I have n't , you give me the mitten , do you , Miss Azalia ? " he said , as if he was addressing Azalia . He knew that Paul had a good name . He was the best singer in the singing-school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a duet with Azalia or Daphne . Sometimes he sang a solo so well , that the spectators whispered to one another , that , if Paul went on as he had begun , he would be ahead of Mr. Rhythm . Philip had left the singing-school . It was dull music to him to sit through the evening , and say " Down , left , right , up , " and be drilled , hour after hour . It was vastly more agreeable to lounge in the bar-room of the tavern , with a half-dozen good fellows , smoking cigars , playing cards , taking a drink of whiskey , and , when it was time for the singing-school to break up , go home with the girls , then return to the tavern and carouse till midnight or later . To be cut out by Paul in his attentions to Azalia was intolerable . " Character !  --  character !  --  character ! " said his boots all the while as he walked . He stopped short , and ground his heels into the frozen earth . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dobb was a middle-aged lady , who wore spectacles , had a sharp nose , a peaked chin , a pinched-up mouth , thin cheeks , and long , bony fingers . She kept the village school when Paul and Philip were small boys , and Paul used to think that she wanted to pick him to pieces , her fingers were so long and bony . She knew pretty much all that was going on in the village , for she visited somewhere every afternoon to find out what had happened . Captain Binnacle called her the Daily Advertiser . " You are the cause of my being jilted , you tattling old maid ; you have told that I was a good-for-nothing scapegrace , and I 'll pay you for it , " said Philip , shaking his fist at the house ; and walked on again , meditating how to do it , his boots at each successive step saying , " Character ! character ! " He went home and tossed all night in his bed , not getting a wink of sleep , planning how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night Philip went to bed earlier than usual , saying , with a yawn , as he took the light to go up stairs , " How sleepy I am ! " But , instead of going to sleep , he never was more wide awake . He lay till all in the house were asleep , till he heard the clock strike twelve , then arose , went down stairs softly , carrying his boots , and , when outside the door , put them on . He looked round to see if there was any one astir ; but the village was still ,  --  there was not a light to be seen . He went to Mr. Chrome 's shop , stopped , and looked round once more ; but , seeing no one , raised a window and entered . The moon streamed through the windows , and fell upon the floor , making the shop so light that he had no difficulty in finding Mr. Chrome 's paint buckets and brushes . Then , with a bucket in his hand , he climbed out , closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He approached softly , listening and looking to see if any one was about ; but there were no footsteps except his own . He painted great letters on the side of the house , chuckling as he thought of what would happen in the morning . " There , Miss Vinegar , you old liar , I wo n't charge anything for that sign , " he said , when he had finished . He left the bucket on the step , and went home , chuckling all the way . In the morning Miss Dobb saw a crowd of people in front of her house , looking towards it and laughing . Mr. Leatherby had come out from his shop ; Mr. Noggin , the cooper , was there , smoking his pipe ; also , Mrs. Shelbarke , who lived across the street . Philip was there . " That is a ' cute trick , I vow , " said he . Everybody was on a broad grin . " What in the world is going on , I should like to know ! " said Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny . Why , they are looking at my house , as true as I am alive ! " Miss Dobb was not a woman to be kept in the dark about anything a great while . She stepped to the front door , opened it , and with her pleasantest smile and softest tone of voice said : " Good morning , neighbors ; you seem to be very much pleased at something . May I ask what you see to laugh at ? " " Te-he-he-he ! " snickered a little boy , who pointed to the side of the house , and the by-standers followed his lead , with a loud chorus of guffaws . Miss Dobb looked upon the wall , and saw , in red letters , as if she had gone into business , opened a store , and put out a sign ,  --  " MISS DOBB , LIES , SCANDAL , GOSSIP , WHOLESALE AND RETAIL . " She threw up her hands in horror . Her eyes flashed ; she gasped for breath . There was a paint-bucket and brush on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word Chrome . " The villain ! I 'll make him smart for this , " she said , running in , snatching her bonnet , and out again , making all haste towards Squire Capias 's office , to have Mr. Chrome arrested . The Squire heard her story . There was a merry twinkling of his eye , but he kept his countenance till she was through . " I do not think that Mr. Chrome did it ; he is not such a fool as to leave his bucket and brush there as evidence against him ; you had better let it rest awhile , " said he . Mr. Chrome laughed when he saw the sign . " I did n't do it ; I was abed and asleep , as my wife will testify . Somebody stole my bucket and brush ; but it is a good joke on Dobb , I 'll be blamed if it is n't , " said he . Who did it ? That was the question . " I will give fifty dollars to know , " said Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and said , " Is n't there a fellow who sometimes helps Mr. Chrome paint wagons ? " " Yes , I did n't think of him . It is just like him . There he comes now ; I 'll make him confess it . " Miss Dobb 's eyes flashed , her lips trembled , she was so angry . She remembered that one of the pigs which Paul painted , when he was a boy , was hers ; she also remembered how he sent Mr. Smith 's old white horse on a tramp after a bundle of hay . Paul was on his way to Mr. Chrome 's shop , to begin work for the day . He wondered at the crowd . He saw the sign , and laughed with the rest . " You did that , sir , " said Miss Dobb , coming up to him , reaching out her long hand and clutching at him with her bony fingers , as if she would like to tear him to pieces . " You did it , you villain ! Now you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now you have done this . You are a mean , good-for-nothing scoundrel , " she said , working herself into a terrible passion . " I did not do it , " said Paul , nettled at the charge , and growing red in the face . " You are a liar ! you show your guilt in your countenance , " said Miss Dobb . Paul 's face was on fire . Never till then had he been called a liar . He was about to tell her loudly , that she was a meddler , tattler , and hypocrite , but he remembered that he had read somewhere , that " he who loses his temper loses his cause , " and did not speak the words . He looked her steadily in the face , and said calmly , " I did not do it , " and went on to his work . Weeks went by . The singing-school was drawing to a close . Paul had made rapid progress . His voice was round , rich , full , and clear . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for he had worked for Mr. Chrome , painting wagons , till he had earned enough to purchase a new suit of clothes . Besides , it was discovered that he could survey land , and several of the farmers employed him to run the lines between their farms . Mr. Rhythm took especial pains to help him on in singing , and before winter was through he could master the crookedest anthem in the book . Daphne Dare was the best alto , Hans Middlekauf the best bass , and Azalia the best treble . Sometimes Mr. Rhythm had the four sing a quartette , or Azalia and Paul sang a duet . At times , the school sang , while he listened . " I want you to learn to depend upon yourselves , " said he . Then it was that Paul 's voice was heard above all others , so clear and distinct , and each note so exact in time that they felt he was their leader . One evening Mr. Rhythm called Paul into the floor , and gave him the rattan with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be leader in this tune ; I resign the command to you , and you are to do just as if I were not here . " The blood rushed to Paul 's face , his knees trembled ; but he felt that it was better to try and fail , than be a coward . He sounded the key , but his voice was husky and trembling . Fanny Funk , who had turned up her nose at Mr. Rhythm 's proposition , giggled aloud , and there was laughing around the room . It nerved him in an instant . He opened his lips to shout , Silence ! then he thought that they would not respect his authority , and would only laugh louder , which would make him appear ridiculous . He stood quietly and said , not in a husky voice , but calmly , pleasantly , and deliberately , " When the ladies have finished their laughter we will commence . " The laughter ceased . He waited till the room was so still that they could hear the clock tick . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not sing it right , and he made them go over it again and again , drilling them till they sang it so well that Mr. Rhythm and the spectators clapped their hands . " You will have a competent leader after I leave you , " said Mr. Rhythm . Paul had gained this success by practice hour after hour , day after day , week after week , at home , till he was master of what he had undertaken . The question came up in parish meeting , whether the school should join the choir ? Mr. Quaver and the old members opposed it , but they were voted down . Nothing was said about having a new chorister , for no one wished to hurt Mr. Quaver 's feelings by appointing Paul in his place ; but the school did not relish the idea of being led by Mr. Quaver , while , on the other hand , the old singers did not mean to be overshadowed by the young upstarts . It was an eventful Sunday in New Hope when the singing-school joined the choir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom attended meeting were present to see their children in the singers ' seats . The girls were dressed in white , for it was a grand occasion . Mr. Quaver and the old choir were early in their places . Mr. Quaver 's red nose was redder than ever , and he had a stern look . He took no notice of the new singers , who stood in the background , not daring to take their seats , and not knowing what to do till Paul arrived . " Where shall we sit , sir ? " Paul asked , respectfully . " Anywhere back there , " said Mr. Quaver . " We would like to have you assign us seats , " said Paul . " I have nothing to do about it ; you may sit anywhere , and sing when you are a mind to , or hold your tongues , " said Mr. Quaver , sharply . " Very well ; we will do so , " said Paul , a little touched , telling the school to occupy the back seats . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Quaver , with Hans , Azalia , and Daphne near him . Mr. Quaver did not look round , neither did Miss Gamut , nor any of the old choir . They felt that the new-comers were intruders , who had no right there . The bell ceased its tolling , and Rev. Mr. Surplice ascended the pulpit-stairs . He was a venerable man . He had preached many years , and his long , white hair , falling upon his shoulders , seemed to crown him with a saintly glory . The people , old and young , honored , respected , and loved him ; for he had grave counsel for the old , kind words for the young , and pleasant stories for the little ones . Everybody said that he was ripening for heaven . He rejoiced when he looked up into the gallery and saw such a goodly array of youth , beauty , and loveliness . Then , bowing his head in prayer , and looking onward to the eternal years , he seemed to see them members of a heavenly choir , clothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glory and honor and power unto the Lord our God ! " After prayer , he read a hymn :  --  " Now shall my head be lifted high Above my foes around ; And songs of joy and victory Within thy temple sound . " There was a smile of satisfaction on Mr. Quaver 's countenance while selecting the tune , as if he had already won a victory . There was a clearing of throats ; then Mr. Fiddleman gave the key on the bass-viol . As Mr. Quaver had told Paul that the school might sing when they pleased , or hold their tongues , he determined to act independently of Mr. Quaver . " After one measure , " whispered Paul . He knew they would watch his hand , and commence in exact time . The old choir was accustomed to sing without regard to time . Mr. Quaver commenced louder than usual ,  --  twisting , turning , drawling , and flattening the first word as if it was spelled n-e-a-w . Miss Gamut and Mr. Cleff and the others dropped in one by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All stood eagerly watching Paul . He cast a quick glance right and left . His hand moved ,  --  down  --  left  --  right  --  up . They burst into the tune , fifty voices together . It was like the broadside of a fifty-gun frigate . The old choir was confounded . Miss Gamut stopped short . Captain Binnacle , who once was skipper of a schooner on the Lakes , and who owned a pew in front of the pulpit , said afterwards , that she was thrown on her beam-ends as if struck by a nor'wester and all her main-sail blown into ribbons in a jiffy . Mr. Quaver , though confused for a moment , recovered ; Miss Gamut also righted herself . Though confounded , they were not yet defeated . Mr. Quaver stamped upon the floor , which brought Mr. Cleff to his senses . Mr. Quaver looked as if he would say , " Put down the upstarts ! " Mr. Fiddleman played with all his might ; Miss Gamut screamed at the top of her voice , while Mr. Cleff puffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doing his utmost to drown them . The people looked and listened in amazement . Mr. Surplice stood reverently in his place . Those who sat nearest the pulpit said that there was a smile on his countenance . It was a strange fugue , but each held on to the end of the verse , the young folks getting out ahead of Mr. Quaver and his flock , and having a breathing spell before commencing the second stanza . So they went through the hymn . Then Mr. Surplice read from the Bible : " Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity ! As the dew of Hermon , and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion ; for there the Lord commanded his blessing forevermore . " Turning to the choir , he said , " My dear friends , I perceive that there is a want of unity in your services , as singers of the sanctuary ; therefore , that the peace and harmony of the place may not be broken , I propose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the choir sing the first stanza , and the new members the second , and so through the hymn . By thus doing there will be no disagreement . " Each one  --  old and young  --  resolved to do his best , for comparisons would be made . It would be the struggle for victory . " I will give them a tune which will break them down , " Mr. Quaver whispered to Miss Gamut , as he selected one with a tenor and treble duet , which he and Miss Gamut had sung together a great many times . Louder and stronger sang Mr. Quaver . Miss Gamut cleared her throat , with the determination to sing as she never sang before , and to show the people what a great difference there was between her voice and Azalia Adams 's . But the excitement of the moment set her heart in a flutter when she came to the duet , which ran up out of the scale . She aimed at high G , but instead of striking it in a round full tone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint squeak on F , which sounded so funny that the people down stairs smiled in spite of their efforts to keep sober . Her breath was gone . She sank upon her seat , covered her face with her hands , mortified and ashamed . Poor Miss Gamut ! But there was a sweet girl behind her who pitied her very much , and who felt like crying , so quick was her sympathy for all in trouble and sorrow . Mr. Quaver was provoked . Never was his nose so red and fiery . Determined not to be broken down , he carried the verse through , ending with a roar , as if to say , " I am not defeated . " The young folks now had their turn . There was a measure of time , the exact movement , the clear chord , swelling into full chorus , then becoming fainter , till it seemed like the murmuring of voices far away . How charming the duet ! Where Mr. Quaver blared like a trumpet , Paul sang in clear , melodious notes ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sweetly that every heart was thrilled . Then , when all joined in the closing strain , the music rolled in majesty along the roof , encircled the pulpit , went down the winding stairs , swept along the aisles , entered the pews , and delighted the congregation . Miss Gamut still continued to sit with her hands over her face . Mr. Quaver nudged her to try another verse , but she shook her head . Paul waited for Mr. Quaver , who was very red in the face , and who felt that it was of no use to try again without Miss Gamut . He waved his hand to Paul as a signal to go on . The victory was won . Through the sermon Mr. Quaver thought the matter over . He felt very uncomfortable , but at noon he shook hands with Paul , and said , " I resign my place to you . I have been chorister for thirty years , and have had my day . " He made the best of his defeat , and in the afternoon , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adams bowed to Paul very cordially at the close of the service . Colonel Dare shook hands with him , and Rev. Mr. Surplice , with a pleasant smile , said , " May the Lord be with you . " It was spoken so kindly and heartily , and was so like a benediction , that the tears came to Paul 's eyes ; for he felt that he was unworthy of such kindness . There was one person in the congregation who looked savagely at him ,  --  Miss Dobb . " It is a shame , " she said , when the people came out of church , speaking loud enough to be heard by all , " that such a young upstart and hypocrite should be allowed to worm himself into Mr. Quaver 's seat . " She hated Paul , and determined to put him down if possible . Paul went home from church pleased that the school had done so well , and grateful for all the kind words he heard ; but as he retired for the night , and thought over what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leader of the choir , and that singing was a part of divine worship ,  --  when he considered that he had fifty young folks to direct  --  and that it would require a steady hand to keep them straight , he felt very sober . As these thoughts , one by one , came crowding upon him , he felt that he could not bear so great a responsibility . Then he reflected that life is made up of responsibilities , and that it was his duty to meet them manfully . If he cringed before , or shrank from them , and gave them the go-by , he would be a coward , and never would accomplish anything . No one would respect him , and he would not even have any respect for himself . " I wo n't back out ! " he said , resolving to do the best he could . Very pleasant were the days . Spring had come with its sunshine and flowers . The birds were in their old haunts ,  --  the larks in the meadows , the partridges in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as happy as they , singing from morning till night the tunes he had learned ; and when his day 's work was over , he was never too wearied to call upon Daphne with Azalia , and sing till the last glimmer of daylight faded from the west ,  --  Azalia playing the piano , and their voices mingling in perfect harmony . How pleasant the still hours with Azalia beneath the old elms , which spread out their arms above them , as if to pronounce a benediction ,  --  the moonlight smiling around them ,  --  the dews perfuming the air with the sweet odors of roses and apple-blooms ,  --  the cricket chirping his love-song to his mate ,  --  the river forever flowing , and sweetly chanting its endless melody ! Sometimes they lingered by the way , and laughed to hear the grand chorus of bull-frogs croaking among the rushes of the river , and the echoes of their own voices dying away in the distant forest . And then , standing in the gravelled walk before the door of Azalia 's home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stars , shining so far away , and talked of choirs of angels , and of those who had gone from earth to heaven , and were singing the song of the Redeemed . How bright the days ! how blissful the nights ! CHAPTER V. THE NIGHT-HAWKS . Mr. Shell was proprietor of the New Hope Oyster Saloon . He got up nice game suppers , and treated his customers to ale , whiskey , and brandy . Philip loved good living , and often ate an oyster-stew and a broiled quail , and washed it down with a glass of ale , late at night in Mr. Shell 's rooms , in company with three or four other boys . After supper they had cigars and a game of cards , till midnight , when Mr. Shell put out his lights and closed his doors , often interrupting them in the middle of a game . That was not agreeable , and so the young gentlemen hired a room over the saloon , fitted it up with tables and chairs , and organized a club , calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They met nearly every evening . No one could get into their room without giving a signal to those within , and they had a secret sign by which they knew each other in the dark . At first they enjoyed themselves , playing cards , smoking cigars , drinking ale , sipping hot whiskey punch , and telling stories ; but in a short time the stories were not worth laughing at , the games of cards were the same thing over and over , and they wanted something more exciting . It was the fall of the year . There was rich fruit in the orchards and gardens of New Hope , russet and crimson-cheeked apples , golden-hued pears , luscious grapes purpling in the October sun , and juicy melons . The bee-hives were heavy with honey , and the bees were still at work , gathering new sweets from the late blooming flowers . Many baskets of ripe apples and choicest pears , many a bunch of grapes , with melons , found their way up the narrow stairs to the room of the Night-Hawks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pears under the windows of the unsuspecting people fast asleep , or in plucking the grapes from garden trellises at midnight . But people began to keep watch . " We must throw them off our track . I 'll make them think that Paul does it , " said Philip to himself one day . He had not forgotten the night of Daphne 's party ,  --  how Paul had won a victory and he had suffered defeat . Paul was respected ; he was the leader of the choir , and was getting on in the world . " I 'll fix him ! " said he . The next morning , when Mr. Leatherby kindled the fire in his shoe-shop , he found that the stove would not draw . The smoke , instead of going up the funnel , poured into the room , and the fire , instead of roaring and blazing , smouldered a few moments and finally died out . He kindled it again , opened the windows to let in the air , but it would not burn . He got down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , got his eyes filled with smoke , which made the tears roll down his cheeks . The shop was a mere box of a building , with a low roof ; so he climbed up and looked into the chimney and found it stuffed with newspapers . Pulling them out , he saw a crumpled piece of writing-paper . He smoothed it out . " Ah ! what is this ? " said he ; and , putting on his spectacles , he read , " North 69 deg . East , 140 rods to a stake ; South 87 deg . West , 50 rods to an oak-tree . " " That is Paul Parker 's figuring , I reckon . I always knew that Paul loved fun , but I did n't think he would do this ! " said Mr. Leatherby to himself , more in sorrow than in anger . " Good morning , Mr. Leatherby , " said Philip , coming up at that moment . " What is the matter with your chimney ? " " Some of you boys have been playing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to know , is there in New Hope mean enough to do that ? " Philip asked . " Whose figuring do you call that ? " Mr. Leatherby asked , presenting the paper . " Paul Parker 's , as sure as I am alive ! You ought to expose him , Mr. Leatherby . " " I do n't like to say anything against him . I always liked him ; but I did n't think he would cut up such a shine as this , " Mr. Leatherby replied . " Appearances are deceptive . It wo n't do for me to say anything against Paul , for people might say I was envious ; but if I were you , Mr. Leatherby , I 'd put him over the road , " said Philip , walking on . Mr. Leatherby thought the matter over all day , as he sat in his dingy shop , which was only a few rods from Mr. Chrome 's , where Paul was painting wagons , singing snatches of songs , and psalms and hymns . Mr. Leatherby loved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It rested him when he was tired , cheered him when he was discouraged . It was like sunshine in his soul , for it made him happy . Thinking it over , and hearing Paul 's voice so round , clear , full , and sweet , he could n't make up his mind to tell anybody of the little joke . " After all , he did n't mean anything in particular , only to have a little fun with me . Boys will be boys , "  --  and so Mr. Leatherby , kind old man that he was , determined to keep it all to himself . When Paul passed by the shop on his way home at night , he said , " Good evening , Mr. Leatherby , " so pleasantly and kindly , that Mr. Leatherby half made up his mind that it was n't Paul who did it , after all , but some of the other boys ,  --  Bob Swift , perhaps , a sly , cunning , crafty fellow , who was one of Philip 's cronies . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Paul , and so I wo n't say anything to anybody , " said the mild old man to himself . Miss Dobb 's shaggy little poodle came out , barking furiously at Paul as he passed down the street . Paul gave him a kick which sent him howling towards the house , saying , " Get out , you ugly puppy ! " Miss Dobb heard him . She came to the door and clasped the poodle to her bosom , saying , " Poor dear Trippee ! Did the bad fellow hurt the dear little Trippee ? " Then she looked savagely at Paul , and as she put out her hand to close the door , she seemed to clutch at Paul with her long , bony fingers , as if to get hold of him and give him a shaking . Trip was n't hurt much , for he was out again in a few minutes , snapping and snarling at all passers-by . Just at dark he was missing . Miss Dobb went to the door and called , " Trip ! Trip ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call . She looked up and down the street , but could not see him . The evening passed away . She went to the door many times and called ; she went to Mr. Shelbarke 's and to Mr. Noggin 's , but no one had seen Trip . She went to bed wondering what had become of him , and fearing that somebody had killed or stolen him . But in the night she heard him whining at the door . She opened it joyfully . " Where have you been , you dear little good-for-nothing darling Trip ? " she said , kissing him , finding , as she did so , that all his hair had been sheared off , except a tuft on the end of his tail . She was so angry that she could not refrain from shedding tears . The puppy shivered , trembled , and whined in the cold , and Miss Dobb was obliged to sew him up in flannel . He looked so funny in his coat , with the tuft of hair waving on the end of his tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning she went out to tell her neighbors what had happened , and met Philip . " Good morning . I hope you are well , Miss Dobb , " he said politely . " Yes , I am well , only I am so vexed that I do n't know what to do . " " Indeed ! What has happened ? " " Why , somebody has sheared all of Trip 's hair off , except a tuft on the end of his tail , which looks like a swab . It is an outrageous insult , for Trip had a beautiful tail . I would pull every hair out of the villain 's head , if I knew who did it . " " Who was it that kicked your dog last night , and called him an ugly puppy ? " Philip asked . Miss Dobb remembered who , and her eyes flashed . Philip walked on , and came across Bob Swift , who had been standing round the corner of Mr. Noggin 's shop , listening to all that was said . They laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bees , which were buzzing and humming merrily in the bright October sun . That night Mr. Noggin heard a noise in his yard . Springing out of bed and going to the window , he saw that a thief was taking the boxes of honey from his patent hives . He opened the door and shouted , " Thief ! Thief ! " The robber ran . In the morning Mr. Noggin found that the thief had dropped his hat in his haste . He picked it up . " Aha ! ' Pears to me I have seen this hat before . Paul Parker 's , as sure as I am alive ! " he said . It was the hat which Paul wore in Mr. Chrome 's paint-shop . Everybody knew it , because it was daubed and spattered with paint . Mr. Noggin went to his work . He was a well-meaning man , but shallow-brained . He knew how to make good barrels , tubs , and buckets , but had no mind of his own . He put on his leather apron , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his adze , singing , and making the barrel ring with " Cooper ding , cooper ding , cooper ding , ding , ding ! Cooper ding , cooper ding , cooper ding , ding , ding ! Cooper ding , job , job , Cooper ding , bob , bob , Heigh ho ,  --  ding , ding , ding ! " Mr. Noggin was rattling on in that fashion when Miss Dobb , followed by Trip , entered the shop . " Well , I declare ! That is the first time I ever saw a pup with a shirt on , " said Mr. Noggin , stopping and looking at the poodle sewed up in flannel . " That is Paul Parker 's doings ,  --  I mean the shearing , " said Miss Dobb , her eyes flashing indignantly . " Paul 's work ! O ho ! Then he shears pups besides robbing bee-hives , does he ? " said Mr. Noggin . He told Miss Dobb what had happened . " It is your duty , Mr. Noggin , to have him arrested at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a law and order abiding citizen to put the sheriff upon his track . He is a hypocrite . He ought to be pitched out of the singing-seats head first . " So Miss Dobb wound Mr. Noggin round her finger , and induced him to enter a complaint against Paul . CHAPTER VI . PAUL 'S FRIENDS . For five months Paul had been leader of the choir , and so faithfully were his duties performed , so excellent his drill , and so good his taste and mature his judgment , so completely were the choir under his control , that the ministers from the surrounding parishes , when they exchanged with Rev. Mr. Surplice , said , " What glorious singing they have at New Hope ! " It was so good , that people who never had been in the habit of attending church hired pews ,  --  not that they cared to hear Mr. Surplice preach and pray , but it was worth while to hear Azalia Adams and Daphne Dare sing a quartette with Paul and Hans , and the whole choir joining in perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing worth doing at all was worth doing well . His heart was in his work . It was a pleasure to sing . He loved music because it made him happy , and he felt also that he and Azalia and Daphne and all the choir were a power for good in the community to make men better . Farmer Harrow , who used to work at haying on Sunday , said it was worth a bushel of turnips any time to hear such sweet singing . So his hired man and horses had rest one day in seven , and he became a better man . In the calm moonlight nights Paul often lay wide awake , hour after hour , listening with rapture to the sweet music which came to him from the distant woods , from the waterfall , from the old maple in front of the house , when the leaves , tinged with gorgeous hues , were breaking one by one from the twigs , and floating to the ground , from the crickets chirping the last lone songs of the dying year , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunts . It was sweet to think of the pleasant hours he had passed with Azalia and Daphne , and with all the choir ; and then it was very pleasant to look into the future , and imagine what bliss there might be in store for him ;  --  a better home for his mother in her declining years ,  --  a better life for himself . He would be a good citizen , respected and beloved . He would be kind to all . He wished that all the world might be good and happy . When he became a man , he would try and make people good . If everybody was as good as Azalia , what a glorious world it would be ! She was always good , always cheerful . She had a smile for everybody . Her life was as warm and sunny and golden as the October days , and as calm and peaceful as the moonlight streaming across his chamber . Sweet it was to think of her ,  --  sweeter to see her ; sweetest of all to stand by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his soul the charm of her presence . In his dreams he sometimes heard her and sat by her side . Sometimes , while thus lying awake , watching the stars as they went sailing down the western sky , his thoughts went beyond the present into the unseen future , whither his father and grandfather had gone . They sang when on earth , and he thought of them as singing in heaven . Sometimes he gazed so long and steadily toward the heavenly land , that his eyes became dim with tears , so sweet and yet so sad the sounds he seemed to hear ,  --  so near and yet so far away that land . So the days went by , and the calm and peaceful nights , bringing him to October ,  --  the glorious harvest month . And now suddenly people looked shyly at him . There were mysterious whisperings and averted faces . He met Squire Capias one morning on the street . " Good morning , " said Paul ; but the lawyer walked on without reply . He passed Miss Dobb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glared at him savagely ; and yet she seemed to smile , but her countenance was so thin , wrinkled , and sharp , and her eyes so fierce , her smile so fiendish , that it put him in mind of a picture he once saw in a horrible story-book , which told of a witch that carried off little children and ate them for breakfast . Paul thought that Miss Dobb would like to pick his bones . But he went on to his work , rejoicing that there were not many Miss Dobbs in the world . While hard at it with his paint-brush , Mr. Ketchum entered . He was a tall , stout man , with black , bushy whiskers , and so strong that he could take a barrel of cider on his knees and drink out of the bunghole . He was a sheriff . The rowdies who fell into his hands said it was no use to try to resist Mr. Ketchum , for he once seized a stubborn fellow by the heels , and swung him round as he would a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath and was frightened half out of his wits . " I have called in to ask you to walk up to Judge Adams 's office on a matter of business , " said Mr. Ketchum . " With pleasure , sir , " said Paul , who , now that he had become a surveyor of land , had been called upon repeatedly to give his testimony in court . They entered Judge Adams 's office , which was crowded with people . Mr. Noggin , Miss Dobb , Philip , and Bob Swift were there . A buzz ran round the room . They all looked upon Paul . " You have been arrested , Paul , and are charged with stealing honey from Mr. Noggin 's bee-hives . Are you guilty or not guilty ? " said Judge Adams . " Arrested !  --  arrested for stealing ! "  --  Paul exclaimed , stupefied and astounded at the words of the judge . It was like a lightning-stroke . His knees became weak . He felt sick at heart . Great drops of cold and clammy sweat stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? Her son accused of stealing ! What would everybody say ? What would Azalia think ? What would Rev. Mr. Surplice say ? What would his class of boys in the Sunday-school say , not about him , but about truth and honor and religion , when they heard that their teacher was arrested for stealing ? His throat became dry , his tongue was parched . His voice suddenly grew husky . His brain reeled . His heart one moment stood still , then leaped in angry throbs , as if ready to burst . He trembled as if attacked by sudden ague , then a hot flash went over him , burning up his brain , scorching his heart , and withering his life . " What say you , are you guilty or not guilty ? " " I am innocent , " said Paul , gasping for breath , and sinking into his seat , taking no notice of what was going on around him . He was busy with the future . He saw all his hopes of life dead in an instant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was innocent , but he was accused of crime , arrested , and a prisoner . The world would have it that he was guilty . His good name was gone forever . His hopes were blighted , his aspirations destroyed , his dreams of future joy ,  --  all had passed away . His mother would die of a broken heart . Henceforth those with whom he had associated would shun him . For him there was no more peace , joy , or comfort ,  --  nothing but impenetrable darkness and agony in the future . So overwhelmed was he , that he took no notice of Mr. Noggin 's testimony , or of what was done , till he heard Judge Adams say : " There are some circumstances against the accused , but the testimony is not sufficient to warrant my binding him over for trial . He is discharged . " Paul went out into the fresh air , like one just waking from sleep , numbed and stupefied . The words of the judge rang in his ears ,  --  " Circumstances against the accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a prisoner . All the world would know of it , but would not know that he was innocent . How could he bear it ? It was a crushing agony . Then there came to him the words of the psalm sung on Sunday ,  --  " My times are in thy hand , Why should I doubt or fear ? My Father 's hand will never cause His child a needless tear . " So he was comforted in the thought that it was for his good ; but he could n't see how . He resolved to bear it manfully , conscious of his innocence , and trusting in God that he would vindicate his honor . He went home and told his mother all that had happened . He was surprised to find that it did not shock her , as he supposed it would . " I know you are innocent , Paul , " she said , kissing him . " I am not surprised at what has happened . You are the victim of a conspiracy . I have been expecting that something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and prosperity brings enemies . It will all come out right in the end . " Thus his mother soothed him , and tried to lift the great weight from his heart . He was innocent , but half of the community thought him guilty . " He did it ,  --  he did it , "  --  said Miss Dobb to all her neighbors . What should he do ? How could he establish his innocence ? How remove all suspicion ? Ought he to resign his position as leader of the choir ? or should he retain it ? But the committee of the society settled that . " After what has happened , you will see the propriety of giving up your position as leader of the choir , " said they . " Also your class in the Sunday-school , " said the Superintendent . O , how crushing it was ! He was an outcast ,  --  a vile , miserable wretch ,  --  a hypocrite ,  --  a mean , good-for-nothing fellow ,  --  a scoundrel ,  --  a thief ,  --  a robber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . They did not speak to him on the street . Colonel Dare , who usually had a pleasant word , did not notice him . He met Daphne Dare , but she crossed the street to avoid him . How terrible the days ! How horrible the nights ! He tossed and tumbled , and turned upon his bed . There was a fire in his bones . His flesh was hot . His brain was like a smouldering furnace . If he dropped off to sleep , it was but for a moment , and he awoke with a start , to feel the heat burning up his soul with its slow , consuming flame . At evening twilight he wandered by the river-side to cool his fever , dipping his hand into the stream and bathing his brow . He stood upon the bridge and looked over the railing into the surging waters . A horrible thought came over him . Why not jump in and let the swollen current bear him away ? What use was it to live , with his good name gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . He would live on and trust in God . He heard a step upon the bridge , and , looking up , beheld Azalia . She had been out gathering the faded leaves of autumn , and late-blossoming flowers , in the woods beyond the river . " Will she speak to me ? " was the question which rose in his mind . His heart stood still in that moment of suspense . She came towards him , held out her hand , and said , " Good evening , Paul . " " Then you do not turn away from me ? " " No , Paul , I do n't believe that you are a thief . " Tears came to his eyes as he took her proffered hand ,  --  tears which welled up from his heart and which saved it from bursting . " O Azalia , if you had turned from me , I should have died ! I have suffered terrible agony , but I can live now . I am innocent . " " I believe you , Paul , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . There is my pledge , " she said , setting down her basket , and putting a frost-flower into a button-hole of his threadbare coat . Then , to make him forget that the world was looking coldly upon him , she showed him the flowers she had gathered , and the gorgeous maple leaves ,  --  scarlet , orange , purple , and crimson , and talked of their marvellous beauty . And when , with a smile , she said " Good night , " and went tripping homeward , his heart was so full of gratitude that he could not utter his thanks . He could only say in his heart , " God bless her . " It was as if he had met an angel in the way , and had been blessed . He stood there while the twilight deepened , and felt his heart grow strong again . He went home . His mother saw by the deep-settled determination on his face , by his calmness , and by his sad smile , that he was not utterly broken down and overwhelmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , had rolled upon him . " There is one who does not pass me by ; Azalia is still a friend , " he said . " There are several whom you may count upon as being still your friends , " she replied . " Who are they , mother ? " " God and the angels , my son . " So she comforted him , telling him that the best way to put down a lie was to live it down , and that the time would surely come when his honor and integrity would be vindicated . When they kneeled together to offer their evening prayer , and when his mother asked that the affliction might work out for him an eternal weight of glory , he resolved that he would , with God 's help , live down the lie , and wait patiently , bearing the ignominy and shame and the cold looks of those who had been his friends , till his character for truth and honesty was re-established . He was calm and peaceful now . Once more he heard sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night the winds , the waterfall , the crickets , seemed to be saying with Azalia , " We are still your friends ,  --  still your friends  --  your friends  --  your friends ! " CHAPTER VII . IN A TRAP . A kind word , a look , a smile , a warm grasp of the hand by a friend in time of trouble ,  --  how they remain in memory ! Sometimes they are like ropes thrown to drowning men . The meeting between Paul and Azalia upon the bridge was a turning point in his life . He felt , when he saw her approaching , that , if she passed him by , looking upon him as a vile outcast from society , he might as well give up a contest where everything was against him . He loved truth and honor for their own sake . He remembered the words of his grandfather , that truth and honor are better than anything else in the world . Many a night he had heard the winds repeating those words as they whistled through the cracks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof , saying over and over and over again , Truth and honor , truth and honor . He had tried to be true , honest , and manly , not only to make himself better , but to help everybody else who had a hard time in life ; but if Rev. Mr. Surplice , Judge Adams , Colonel Dare , and all the good folks looked upon him as a thief , what was the use of trying to rise ? There was one who was still his friend . Her sweet , sad smile followed him . He saw it all the time , by day and by night , while awake and while asleep . He felt the warm , soft touch of her hand , and heard her words . He remembered that God is always on the side of truth , and so he resolved to go right on as if nothing had happened , and live down the accusation . But he could n't go on . " After what has happened , it is expedient that you should leave the choir till your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was chairman of the singing committee ,  --  a good , well-meaning man , who was very zealous for maintaining what he considered to be the faith once delivered to the saints . He carried on an iron foundery , and people sometimes called him a cast-iron man . He believed , that it was the duty of everybody to do exactly right ; if they did wrong , or if they were suspected of doing wrong , they must take the consequences . Miss Dobb told him that Paul ought to be pitched out of the choir . " I think so too , Miss Dobb , " said the Deacon , and it was done . It required a great bracing of Paul 's nerves , on Sunday morning , to go to church , and take a seat in the pew down stairs , with every eye upon him ; but he did it manfully . The bell ceased tolling . It was time for services to commence , but there was no choir . The singers ' seats were empty . Azalia , Daphne , Hans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surplice waited awhile , then read the hymn ; but there was a dead silence ,  --  no turning of leaves , no blending of sweet voices , no soul-thrilling strains , such as had reformed Farmer Harrow , and given rest to his horses one day in seven . People looked at the singers ' seats , then at Paul , then at each other . The silence became awkward . Deacon Hardhack was much exercised in mind . He had been very zealous in committee meeting for having Paul sent down stairs , but he had not looked forward to see what effect it would have upon the choir . Mr. Cannel , who owned a coal-mine , sat in front of Paul . He was not on good terms with Deacon Hardhack , for they once had a falling out on business matters , and so whatever the Deacon attempted to do in society affairs was opposed by Mr. Cannel . They were both members of the singing committee , and had a stormy time on Saturday evening . Mr. Cannel did what he could to keep Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . " I 'll triumph yet , " was the thought which flashed through Mr. Cannel 's mind , when he saw how matters stood . He turned and nodded to Paul to strike up a tune , but Paul took no notice of him . Mr. Cannel half rose from his seat , and whispered hoarsely , " Strike up a tune , Paul . " All the congregation saw him . Paul made no movement , but sat perfectly still , not even looking towards Mr. Cannel . Deacon Hardhack saw what Mr. Cannel was up to , and resolved to head him off . He rose from his seat , and said aloud , " Brother Quaver , will you pitch a tune ? " Again , as in other days , Mr. Quaver rubbed his great red nose , as trumpeters wipe their instruments before giving a blast . Then , after a loud Ahem ! which made the church ring , he began to sing . It was so strange a sound , so queer , so unlike the sweet music which had charmed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the church . His voice trembled and rattled , and sounded so funny that a little boy laughed aloud , which disconcerted him , and he came near breaking down . Miss Gamut sat in one corner of the church , many pews from Mr. Quaver . She attempted to join , but was so far away that she felt , as she afterwards remarked , like a cat in a strange garret . Paul did not sing . He thought that , if it was an offence for him to sing in the choir , it would be equally offensive to sing in the congregation . Azalia , Daphne , Hans , and all the members of the choir , who were sitting in the pews with their parents , were silent . They had talked the matter over before church . " Paul is innocent ; he has only been accused . It is n't right to condemn him , or turn from him , till we know he is not worthy of our confidence . I met him on the bridge last night , and he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I shall stand by him , " said Azalia . " Deacon Hardhack and Miss Dobb mean to break down the choir . It is a conspiracy , " said Hans , who felt that Paul 's case was his own . Daphne began to look at the matter in a new light , and felt ashamed of herself for having passed by Paul without noticing him . After service there was a great deal of loud talking . " If that is the kind of singing you are going to have , I 'll stay at home , " said Farmer Harrow . " It would be a desecration of the sanctuary , and we should be the aiders and abettors of sin and iniquity , if we allowed a fellow who has been accused of stealing to lead the singing , " said Deacon Hardhack to Mr. Cannel . " Let him that is without sin among you cast the first stone , " was Mr. Cannel 's reply , and he felt that he had given the Deacon a good hit . " Paul has n't had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dobb . " He has been treated shamefully , " said Azalia , indignantly . All took sides , some for Paul , and some against him . Old things , which had no connection with the matter , were raked up . Mr. Cannel twitted Deacon Hardback of cheating him , while on the other hand the Deacon accused Mr. Cannel of giving false weight in selling coal . The peace and harmony of the church and society were disturbed . Mr. Quaver felt very sore over that laugh which the little boy had started . He knew his voice was cracked , and that his singing days were over . " I am not going to make a fool of myself , to be laughed at , " he said , and made up his mind that he would n't sing another note to please the Deacon or anybody else . In the afternoon Mr. Quaver 's seat was empty . Mr. Surplice read a hymn and waited for some one to begin . Mr. Cannel once more nodded to Paul , but Paul took no notice of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull service it was . After the benediction , Mr. Cannel , Colonel Dare , and Judge Adams said to Paul , " We hope you will lead the singing next Sunday . " " Gentlemen , I have been requested by the chairman of the committee to leave the choir . When he invites me to return I will take the matter into consideration ; till then I shall take no part in the singing , "  --  he replied , calmly and decidedly . Through the week Paul went on with his business , working and studying , bringing all his will and energy into action ; for he resolved that he would not let what had taken place break him down . Mr. Noggin believed him guilty . " He will steal your grapes , Mr. Leatherby , if you do n't look out , " he said to the shoemaker , who had a luxuriant vine in his garden , which was so full of ripe clusters that people 's mouths watered when they saw them purpling in the October sun . Mr. Leatherby concluded to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He waited till evening , that no one might see what he was about . His garden was a warm , sunny spot , upon a hillside . A large butternut-tree , with wide-spreading branches , gave support to the vine . Mr. Leatherby filled a hogshead with stones , headed it up , rolled it to the spot , and tilted it so nicely that a slight jar would send it rolling down the hill . Then fastening one end of a rope to the hogshead , he threw the other end over a branch of the tree , brought it down to the ground , and made a noose . Then , taking a board , he put one end upon the hogshead and rested the other end on the ground , where he had placed the noose . He expected that whoever came after the grapes would walk up the board to reach the great clusters which hung overhead , that the hogshead would begin to roll , the board would drop , the noose draw , and the thief would find himself dangling by the heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the board drop . " I 've got him ! " he shouted , springing out of bed , alarming Mrs. Leatherby , who thought he was crazy . He had not told her of the trap . " Got whom ? Got what ? " she exclaimed , wondering what he meant . " Paul Parker , who has come to steal the grapes , " he said , as he put on his clothes . He went out , and found that it was not Paul , but Bob Swift , who was dangling , head downwards . The noose had caught him by one leg . A very laughable appearance he made , as he kicked and swung his arms , and swayed to and fro , vainly struggling to get away . " So you are the thief , are you ? How do you like being hung up by the heels ? Are the grapes sweet or sour ? " Mr. Leatherby asked , not offering to relieve him . " Please let me go , sir . I wo n't do so again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt you to hang awhile , I reckon , " Mr. Leatherby replied , going into the house and telling Mrs. Leatherby what had happened , then calling up Mr. Shelbarke , who lived near by , and also Mr. Noggin . " I reckon that this is n't your first trick , Bob , " said Mr. Leatherby , when he returned with his neighbors . He liked Paul , and had been loath to believe that he was guilty of stealing . " It is you who have been playing tricks all along . Come now , own up , " he added . " It ai n't me , it is Philip ,  --  he told me to come , " said Bob , who was thoroughly cowed by the appearance of Mr. Noggin and the others , and who feared that he would be harshly dealt with . " O ho ! Philip Funk is at the bottom , is he ? " Mr. Leatherby exclaimed , remembering how Philip suggested that it was Paul who had stuffed his chimney with old paper . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Bob , groaning with pain from the cord cutting into his ankle . " We will hear your confession before we let you down , " said Mr. Leatherby . Bob begged , and whined , but to no purpose , till he told them all about the Night-Hawks ,  --  that Philip set them on , and that Paul did not take Mr. Noggin 's honey , nor smoke out Mr. Leatherby . It was Philip who sheared Miss Dobb 's puppy , who took Mr. Shelbarke 's watermelons , and robbed Deacon Hardhack 's hen-roost . When Bob had told all , they let him go . He went off limping , but very glad that he was free . In the morning Mr. Leatherby and Mr. Noggin reported what had happened ; but Philip put on a bold face , and said that Bob was a liar , and that there was n't a word of truth in what he had said . The fact that he was caught stealing Mr. Leatherby 's grapes showed that he was a fellow not to be believed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not hesitate to lie . Deacon Hardhack called upon Paul . " I have been requested by the committee to call and see you . They wish you to take charge of the singing again , " he said , with some confusion of manner ; and added , " Perhaps we were hasty in the matter when we asked you to sit down stairs , but we are willing to let bygones be bygones . " " Am I to understand that there is no suspicion against me ? " Paul asked . " Yes  --  sir  --  I suppose so , " said the Deacon , slowly and hesitatingly . " Then you may say to the committee that I will do what I can to make the singing acceptable as a part of the service , " Paul replied . There was a hearty shaking of hands with Paul , by all the choir , at the rehearsal on Saturday night . They were glad to meet him once more , and when they looked upon his frank , open countenance , those who for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great wrong . And on Sunday morning how sweet the music ! It thrilled the hearts of the people , and they too were ashamed when they reflected that they had condemned Paul without cause . They were glad he was in his place once more . Mr. Surplice in his prayer gave thanks that the peace and harmony of the congregation was restored , and that the wicked one had not been permitted to rule . When he said that , Mr. Cannel wondered if he had reference to Deacon Hardhack . Everybody rejoiced that the matter was settled ,  --  even Miss Dobb , who did not care to have all the old things brought up . When the service was over , when Paul sat once more by his mother 's side in their humble home , before the old fireplace , when he listened to her words , reminding him of all God 's goodness ,  --  how He had carried him through the trial ,  --  Paul could not keep back his tears , and he resolved that he would always put his trust in God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Hope school , engaged for the winter , proved to be a poor stick . He allowed the scholars to throw spit-balls , snap apple-seeds , eat molasses candy , pull each other 's hair , and have fine frolics . Paul wished very much to attend school , to study Latin , and fit himself for College ; but when he saw how forceless a fellow Mr. Supple was , he concluded that it would be lost time to attend such a school . He knew that knowledge is power , and he longed to obtain a thorough education . Sometimes , when he thought how much Judge Adams knew , and when he read books written by learned men , he felt that he knew next to nothing . But whenever he felt like giving up the contest with adverse circumstances , a walk in the fresh , cool , bracing air , or a night 's sleep , revived his flagging spirit . The thought often came , " What would Daphne or Azalia say if they knew how chicken-hearted I am ? " So his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , he made rapid progress studying at home . Matters came to a crisis in the school , for one day the big boys  --  Bob Swift among others  --  carried Mr. Supple out of the school-house , dug a hole in a snow-drift , and stuck him into it with his head down and his heels up . Then they took possession of the school-house and played tag over the benches for the rest of the day . Mr. Supple did not attempt to enter the school-house again , but picked up his hat , went to his boarding-house , packed his trunk , and left town . After a week 's vacation , Mr. Cannel , who was the school-agent , obtained another teacher ,  --  a thin , pale-faced , quick-tempered young man ,  --  Mr. Thrasher . " I 'll bring them to their trumps , " he said , when Mr. Cannel engaged him . " I intend to have order in this school . I shall lick the first boy who throws a spit-ball , or who does anything contrary to the rules of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw hide , on the first morning . He read a long list of rules , numbered from one up to eighteen . Before he finished his rules , a little boy laughed , and caught a whipping . Before noon half a dozen were hauled up . There was a council of war at noon among the big boys , who , having had their own way , were determined to keep it . They agreed to give Mr. Thrasher a pitched battle . They had it in the afternoon ; a half-dozen pounced upon the master at once , and after a short struggle put him out doors . They gave a grand hurrah , and pelted him with snowballs , and drove him up the street . There was great commotion in the town . Those who loved law and order were alarmed for the welfare of their children . " We must have a master who can rule them , or they will grow up to be lawless citizens , " said Judge Adams . Mr. Cannel could find no one who was willing to teach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is competent to teach should be afraid to undertake the task , " said Paul to Mr. Chrome , one day , as they talked the matter over . Mr. Chrome met Mr. Cannel that evening on the street . " If there is anybody who is competent to keep the school , it is Paul Parker , " said Mr. Chrome , who had exalted ideas of Paul 's ability to overcome difficulties . " I believe you , " Mr. Cannel replied , and started at once to see Paul . " I will think of it , and let you know in the morning whether I will teach or not , " was Paul 's reply , after hearing what Mr. Cannel had to say . He talked the matter over with his mother . " It is a great undertaking , Paul ; I can not advise you , " she said . When he offered his evening prayer , he asked that God would direct him . He thought upon the subject during the night . Could he carry it through ? The scholars all knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  were his old friends and playmates . Bob Swift was a ringleader ; and outside , not in the school , was Philip , who would make all the trouble he could . There was Miss Dobb , who would like to have picked him to pieces . There were others who would rejoice to see him fail . But would it not be glorious to succeed ,  --  to triumph over Miss Dobb ? But that was an unworthy motive , and he put the thought out of his mind . He resolved to undertake the task , and try to do good ,  --  to guide and mould the minds of the scholars ,  --  those who were to be men and women , who were to act an important part in life , and who were to live not only here , but in another world ,  --  who , he hoped , would be companions of the angels . Would it not be worth while to aid in overcoming evil , in establishing law and order ,  --  to inculcate a love of virtue , truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , patience , and wisdom . " I 'll try it , " he said to himself , after looking at all sides . When it was known that Paul was going to try his hand at school-keeping the big boys chuckled . " We 'll sweeten him , " said Bob , rubbing his hands , and anticipating the glorious fun they would have . Conscious that he had a task before him which would try him severely , Paul yet went bravely to his work , locking the door as he entered the school-room , and putting the key in his pocket . The big boys looked at each other , somewhat amazed , each anxious to see what the others thought of it . He walked deliberately to his desk . " It is always best to begin an undertaking rightly , " said Paul , standing erect and looking calmly round the room . " There is no better way than to ask our Heavenly Father to direct us , and so we will all repeat the Lord 's Prayer , " he said and waited till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the beating of their hearts . The stillness filled them with awe . After prayer he addressed them ,  --  not alluding to anything which had taken place , but simply saying that he had been employed to teach them , and should do what he could to make the school-room a pleasant place to all . He expected that they would obey whatever rules were necessary for the good of the school , but did not threaten them with punishment . It was so unlike what they had expected that the big boys did not know what to make of it , or how to take it . Bob could not decide whether it was best to begin a war , or wait till something happened , and then have a grand battle . So the forenoon passed without any disturbance . Philip saw Bob at noon . " You are a coward , Bob , or you would have pitched Paul heels over head out of the door . I would if I were there , and so would you if you had as much gumption as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' sweeten him , ' " he said , with a sneer . " So I am , " said Bob , nettled at the taunt , and resolving to drive Paul out in the afternoon . When Paul entered the school-room after dinner , he saw at a glance that there was mischief ahead . The whole school was on tip-toe . He locked the door , and again put the key in his pocket . Bob was standing in the middle of the floor with his hat on . " Take off your hat , Master Swift , and go to your seat , " said Paul . " I sha' n't do it , " said Bob ,  --  who the next instant went spinning round the room , tumbling over a chair , falling upon the floor , finding himself picked up and thrown against a desk , then having his heels tripped up , and then set to whirling so fast that the room seemed all windows . He was cuffed backward and forward , to the right and the left , pitched headlong , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . He was like a little child in the hands of a giant . He was utterly powerless . One of the other boys sprang to help him , but was met by a blow between his eyes which knocked him to the floor . A second started , but when he saw what had happened he sat down . Bob 's brain was in a whirl . His ears were tingling . He saw stars , and it seemed as if all his hair had been torn out by the roots . He heard Paul say , once more , calmly , as at first , " Take your seat , Master Swift . " He hesitated a moment , but when , through the blinking stars , he saw how cool and decided Paul was , standing there as if nothing had happened ,  --  when he saw the boy who had started to aid him sprawling on the floor , and the others who had promised to help put Paul out of doors sitting in their seats ,  --  he knew that it was of no use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon wondering at Paul 's strength . Paul was surprised to find himself so powerful and athletic ; but then he remembered that he had right on his side , which always helps a man . The victory was won . The school felt that he was their master . Yet he had a pleasant smile . When they were tired of study he said , " I see that you are getting dull and need stirring up . " Then he told them a story which set them all laughing , and so made them forget that they were tired and sleepy . At night he had a talk with Bob all alone , telling him that he ought to be a good boy for his poor old mother 's sake . That touched Bob in a tender place , for he loved his mother , and was a good-hearted fellow , but had allowed Philip to twist him round his little finger . " For her sake , Bob , I want you to be good ; I will help you all I can , " said Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew Paul meant it . " Cut loose from those who advise you to do wrong , and tell them that you are going to do right , " said Paul , as they parted for the night . " I will , " said Bob , who , as he thought it all over that night , and recalled the kind words , felt that Paul would be his best friend if he did right . " I must get Azalia and Daphne to help me make a man of Bob , " said Paul to himself ,  --  " they can do what I ca n't . " He called upon Azalia . There was a bright fire on the hearth in the sitting-room , but the smile on her face , he thought , was more pleasant to see . " I am glad you have conquered , " she said . " I do n't know that I have done so , yet ; when I can feel that they all love me , then I may begin to think that it is a victory . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good fellow , but under bad influences . I want you to help me . If we can make him respect himself , we shall make a man of him . " " I will do what I can , " said Azalia . When Paul went away she sat down by the window and watched him till he was out of sight . " How thoughtful he is for the welfare of others ! " was the thought which passed through her mind . Then she gazed upon the red and purple clouds with gold and silver linings , and upon the clear sunset sky beyond , till the twilight faded away , and the stars came out in the heavens . Paul 's words were ringing in her ears ,  --  " I want you to help me . " Yes , she would help him , for he was trying to make the world better . CHAPTER IX . RALLYING ROUND THE FLAG . There came a gloomy day to the people of New Hope ,  --  that gloomiest of the year , of all the years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort Sumter had been attacked by the people of South Carolina , and that Major Anderson commanding it , with his little company , had been compelled to surrender . News so startling brought all the people into the streets . They assembled around the telegraph office , where Mr. Magnet read the despatch ; how the attack had been made at daybreak on Friday , the 12th of April , all the batteries which General Beauregard had erected opening fire upon the half-starved garrison ; how shot and shell were rained upon the fort , from Moultrie , from the guns on Morris Island , and from the floating battery which the Rebels had built ; how Major Anderson coolly ate his breakfast ; how Captain Doubleday fired the first gun in reply ; how the cannonade went on all day , the great guns roaring and jumping ; how the fight commenced again next morning ; how the barracks were set on fire by the shells from the Rebel guns ; how manfully the garrison fought against the flames , rolling kegs of powder into the sea to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat and almost suffocated by the smoke ; how the flag-staff was shot away ; how the flag was nailed to the broken mast ; how the brave little band held out till their powder was almost exhausted , and till there was nothing to eat but raw salt pork ; how at last , after thirty-six hours ' fighting , Major Anderson surrendered the fort , saluting his flag as he hauled it down , carrying it away with him , being permitted to sail with his company to New York ; and how the President had called for seventy-five thousand men to suppress the rebellion . The people held their breath while Mr. Magnet was reading , and when he had finished looked at one another in mournful silence . The flag of their country was trailed in the dust , and dishonored in the sight of the nations . They could not have felt worse if they had lost a dear friend by death . " The country is gone , gone , gone , " said Judge Adams , wiping the tears from his eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the people will have something to say about this insult to the flag . They will wipe out the disgrace by sweeping those scoundrels into the sea . " The Colonel usually looked on the bright side of things . He recalled the trainings of other days , when his regiment paraded on the green and had a sham-fight . He wished that he were once more in command ; he would march to Charleston , burn the city , and sow it with salt . " The question is , whether a sovereign State has not a right to secede if she chooses , " said Mr. Funk ,  --  for he and Philip were the only persons in New Hope who were not sorrowful over the intelligence . Mr. Funk was a native of Virginia , and had much to say about the superiority of Southern gentlemen over all other men ,  --  how noble and chivalric they were . " I am glad that the President has called for seventy-five thousand men to crush the vipers , " said the Colonel . " He ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't coerce a sovereign State , " said Mr. Funk . " We will do it . Let me tell you , Mr. Funk , that this is a government of the people ,  --  the whole people ,  --  and that the old flag which has been stricken from the walls of Sumter shall go up there , if it takes a million of men to put it there ! " " You ca n't do it . One Southerner can whip five Yankees any day , " said Philip . Colonel Dare took no notice of what Philip said . And he was too much depressed by the news to enter into an argument with Mr. Funk upon the right of a State to secede from the Union . One by one the people went to their homes , meditating upon what they had heard , and wondering what next would happen . They could not work ; they could only think of the terrible event . What a gloomy day it was to Paul Parker ! He went home , sat down before the fire , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather carried at Bunker Hill , and which in his hands had brought down many a squirrel from the highest trees , was hanging in its usual place . He felt like shouldering it and marching for Charleston . He recalled the stories which his grandfather had told him there upon the hearth , of Bunker Hill and Saratoga . Many times he had wished that he had lived in those glorious days , to be a patriot , and assist in securing the independence of America . But now the work which his grandfather and the Revolutionary sires had accomplished seemed to be all lost . It made him sick at heart to think of it . Would the people resent the insult which South Carolina had given to the flag ? What would the President do ? What if he did nothing ? What would become of the country ? What would become of liberty , justice , truth , and right ? O , how hard it was to see them all stricken down ,  --  to think that the world was turning backward ! He looked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle ,  --  houses in flames , and the country drenched in blood . He sat motionless , forgetful of everything but the terrible intelligence and the gloomy future . What part should he take in the contest ? What could he do ? The President had called for men to help raise the flag once more upon the walls of Sumter ; could he leave his home , his mother , his friends ? These were trying questions ; but he felt that he could go wherever duty called him . Colonel Dare , as he reflected upon what had happened , saw that the people needed stirring up to sustain the President ; that the Rebellion must be put down , or there would be an end of all government . He resolved to get up a public meeting . " We will have it this evening , and you must be chairman , " he said to Judge Adams . He called upon Rev. Mr. Surplice . " I want you to open the meeting by prayer , " he said , " for these are sober days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him , He will help us . And you must make a speech . Come down on the Rebels , " he added , with sudden indignation ; " curse them , as David cursed the enemies of God . You , who are watchman on the walls of Zion , must lead off , and the people will follow . Their hearts are burning within them ; the kindlings are laid ; strike the match now , and there will be such a flame of patriotism as the world never saw . " " We shall want singing , " he said to Paul . " You must get that up . " He engaged Mr. Tooter to be there with his fife , and Mr. Noggin with his drum . These two were old companions on training days . They had drank many glasses of cider together , and had played " Yankee Doodle , " and " The Campbells are coming , " and " Saint Patrick 's Day in the Morning , " on many occasions . " We shall expect some resolutions and a speech from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he laid out the work , and entered upon it with so much zeal , that all hands caught the spirit of his enthusiasm . Judge Adams , who had been very much depressed , became more cheerful , and thought over what he should say upon the occasion . Rev. Mr. Surplice looked through the Psalms and Isaiah and the New Testament to find the Scripture most appropriate to read . Squire Capias sat down by his round table in his dingy office , ran his fingers through his long black hair , and thought over his speech . Paul and Azalia , with Hans , went to Colonel Dare 's , and , with Daphne , rehearsed the " Star-Spangled Banner , " and " America , " while Mr. Noggin put a new cord into his drum , which had been lying for months in his garret , and was covered with dust . Evening came . The sexton rang the bell of the church ,  --  not soberly and steadily , but he tugged with all his might at the rope , throwing the bell over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a blaze . The farmers out on the hills heard it , and came driving furiously into the village to see what was the matter . Mr. Tooter and Mr. Noggin , with Mr. Chrome , who had a new flag , walked out upon the parade-ground . The musicians struck up Yankee-Doodle . How it stirred the hearts of everybody ,  --  the sharp , shrill notes of the fife ,  --  the roll , the rattle , and the rat-a-tat-tat of the drum , and the clanging of the bell , and the sight of that flag , its crimson folds and fadeless stars waving in the evening breeze ! Never had it looked so beautiful . The little boys swung their caps and cheered , the women waved their handkerchiefs , and the men hurrahed in an outburst of wild enthusiasm . Then they formed in procession with Colonel Dare for marshal ,  --  the music and the flag in advance , Rev. Mr. Surplice , Judge Adams , and Squire Capias next , and then all the citizens , marching round the public square to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aisles , the entry , and hanging like a swarm of bees around the windows . Judge Adams forgot all his despondency , while Mr. Surplice , who was getting a little prosy as a preacher , was as full of fire as in his younger days . Mr. Capias was so eloquent that the people stamped till the house fairly shook with applause . He ended with resolutions , pledging the support of the people of New Hope to the government ,  --  their lives , their fortunes , and their sacred honor towards suppressing the Rebellion . But more thrilling than all the eloquence of the evening was the singing of the Star-Spangled Banner , by Azalia , Daphne , Paul , and Hans . They stood on the platform in front of the pulpit , Azalia and Daphne with flags in their hands . How sweet their voices ! How inspiring the moment when they sang : " And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave ! " Men threw up their hats , women waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many shed tears , as they looked upon the banner of their country , which had been so insulted and despised . There , in the place where they met on the Sabbath to worship God , they resolved that , let it cost what it might of money , of sacrifice , or of life , the old flag should once more wave in triumph upon the walls of Fort Sumter ,  --  that the Rebellion should be subdued and the traitors punished . That was an ever memorable night to Paul . Alone in his chamber , lying on his bed , whence he could look out , as in childhood , upon the stars , he thought upon what had happened at Fort Sumter , and of the meeting in the church at New Hope , and how he had pledged himself with the rest to stand by the flag of his country . The water by the mill was repeating the soul-stirring song , which Azalia , Daphne , Hans , and himself had sung . The maples , elms , and all the forest-trees , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were saying , " It shall wave  --  shall wave  --  over the home of the brave ! " But men were wanted . The President had called for them . Ought he not to be one of the seventy-five thousand ? Would not his grandfather , if alive , point to the old gun , and say , " Go , Paul , your country calls you ? " Were not all who have died for liberty , justice , truth , and right calling upon him to do his duty ? Were not the oppressed everywhere looking to him ? What answer could he give to the millions yet to be , if in his old age they were to question him as to what part he bore in the great struggle ? Thus the voices of the ages propounded solemn questions  --  voices of earth and heaven  --  of his duty to his country and to God . But how could he leave his home , his mother , his friends , his school , the choir , Azalia , Daphne , Hans , and give up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall in battle ? Could he meet death face to face ? But then he remembered that the path of duty , though it may lead through dangers , though it may lead to the death of the body , is the way by which peace comes to the soul . It was the most solemn moment of his life , for God was questioning him . He heard not only the voices of the past , and of the winds , the water , and of his country , calling him to do his duty as a patriot , but there was a still , small voice talking of sins committed and duties neglected ; of a lie which he had told in childhood , and which had burned through all the years like a red-hot iron , leaving a crisped and blackened scar upon his soul . How could he be at peace ? How ease the pain ? Tears of anguish rolled down his cheeks . He turned and tossed in agony , wishing that the scar could be cut away , and that he could be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agony he heard another voice saying , " Come unto me , and I will give you rest . " They were no longer tears of sorrow which wet his pillow , but of joy , for he saw that Jesus , having carried the cross up to Calvary , was able and willing also to bear his burden . What a friend ,  --  to take away all his sin , and leave no scar , no pain , no sorrow ! He would serve such a friend with his whole soul . He would do his duty , whatever it might be . For such a friend , he could go through all dangers and win his way to victory . For him he would live , and for him he would die , if need be , to save his country . " Go , my son ,  --  your country calls you , and God will take care of you , " said his mother in the morning , when he told her that he thought it his duty to enlist . " I have decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school and then dismiss it , and this will be my last day as a teacher , " said Paul to the school committee , as he went for the last time to the school-house . It was hard to part with those who were dear to him . He had been so kind and gentle , and yet so firm and just , that all the scholars loved him . " You may lay aside your books , I have not time to hear your lessons , "  --  he said , and then talked of what had happened ,  --  said that the flag had been insulted , that justice , law , religious liberty , truth , and right had been overthrown , and that , unless the Rebellion was put down , they would have no country , no home ,  --  that God and his country called him , and he must go . The issues at stake were not only worth living for , but they were worth dying for , if they could be secured in no other way . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say " Good by ! " They would meet again , but perhaps not in this world . His voice trembled ; there was weeping around the room . When he dismissed them , they had no heart to play ; they could only think how good and kind he was , and how great their loss ; and in imagination , looking into the gloomy future , beheld him in the thickest of the fight upon the battle-field . The whole country was aflame with patriotism . The drum-beat was heard not only in New Hope , but in every city and village of the land . There was a flag on almost every house . Farmers left their ploughs in the unfinished furrows ; the fire of the blacksmith 's forge went out ; carpenters laid down their planes ; lawyers put aside their cases in the courts ,  --  all to become citizen soldiers and aid in saving the country ,  --  assembling in squads , companies , and regiments at the county-seats . He called upon Rev. Mr. Surplice . " The Lord be with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the good man as he bade Paul farewell . It was a blessing and a benediction which followed Paul all the day , which comforted and strengthened him , when he reflected that he might be bidding a last farewell to his friends . He was surprised to find that everybody was his friend ; that all bade him God speed ,  --  all , except Mr. Funk and Philip . It was evening when he called upon Azalia . He had shaken hands with Daphne and Hans , and others of his associates . The train would bear him away in the morning . Azalia came tripping down the path , holding out both hands to meet him at the gate . She greeted him with a sad smile . " You are not going away to the war , are you ? " she asked with faltering voice . " Yes , Azalia , and I have come to bid you good by ! " " Do you think it your duty to go and leave your mother ? It will be hard for her to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we shall all miss you . " " I know that the old house will be lonesome ,  --  that the days will be long and the nights dreary to my mother ,  --  that she will listen to every approaching footstep and think perhaps it is mine . I know , Azalia , that possibly I may never return ; I feel that perhaps this is the last time I may ever take you by the hand ; but I feel that God and my country both are calling me , and that I must go . " " But what if you are killed on the battle-field ! O Paul , it is dreadful to think of ! " " I would rather die there while doing what I feel to be my duty , than remain here shirking responsibility . Last night I heard the voices of the past calling me , and I seemed to see the myriads who are to come after us beckoning me . I know it is my duty to go . You would not have me falter , would you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choked with emotion ; she had not expected such a question . Tears came into her eyes , and she turned away to hide them . " I could not go without coming to see you , to thank you for all your kindness to me ; you have been always a faithful and true friend . God bless you for all you have done for me ! I know your goodness of heart , and I hope that , when I am gone , you will sometimes go in and comfort my mother , and shorten the hours for her ; for your smile is always like the sunshine , and it will cheer her . " " I will do what I can to make her forget that you are gone . " " And you will not wholly forget me . " " I shall never forget you , " she replied ; then , looking steadily upon him , with a strong effort to keep down her emotion , said , " Paul , I have heard that there are many dangers in camp ; that soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hardened to good influences ; that they lose sight of heaven and things holy and pure amid the new duties and strange excitements . But for the sake of those who respect and honor and love you , you will not give way to vice , will you ? I know you will not , for my sake . " " For your sake , Azalia , if for no other reason , I will resist evil , and I will try to serve God and my country faithfully in all things , so that if I come back , or if I fall in battle , you will not be ashamed of having once been my friend . " She touched her sweet lips to his forehead , saying , " I have nothing else to give you for such a promise . Remember that it came from your old friend , Azalia . " His heart was full . He had braved himself to say farewell to all his friends without shedding a tear , but his courage was faltering . How could he go , perhaps never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to sit down at her feet and worship such goodness ; but he could only dash away the tears , look for a moment into her eyes , drink in the sad smile upon her face , leave a kiss upon her cheek , press her a moment to his heart , and say , " God bless you , Azalia ! " He turned hastily away , and passed through the gate . He cast one glance behind , and beheld her standing in the gravelled walk , her chestnut hair falling upon her shoulders , and the setting sun throwing around her its golden light . She waved him an adieu , and he passed on , thinking of her as his good angel . When far away , pacing his lonely beat at dead of night , he would think of her and behold her as in that parting hour . CHAPTER X. A SOLDIER . He was a soldier in camp , wearing a blue uniform , sleeping in a tent , wrapped in a blanket , with a knapsack for a pillow . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to yield obedience to military rule . He could not pass the guard without a permit . When the drum beat , he must spring to his feet . He was obliged to wear a knapsack , a cartridge-box , a canteen , and a bayonet scabbard , and carry a gun , not always as he would like to carry it , but as ordered by the officer in command . He was obliged to march hour after hour , and if he came to a brook or a muddy place , instead of turning aside and passing over on stepping-stones or upon a fallen tree , he must go through without breaking the ranks . His companions were not altogether such as he liked to associate with . Some were very profane , and used indecent language . There was one great , over-grown Dutchman , Gottlieb von Dunk , who smoked nearly all the time when awake , and who snored terribly when asleep . But he was a good-hearted fellow for all that , and had a great many pleasant stories to tell . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bugle , and the playing of the band . It was glorious to look upon the star-spangled banner , waving in the breeze ; but the excitement soon wore away . There were rainy days , comfortless and cheerless . Sometimes the rations were not fit to be eaten , and there was grumbling in the camp . There were days of homesickness , when the soldiers longed to break away from the restraints of camp life , and be free once more . The regiment in which Paul enlisted was ordered to Cairo , in Illinois , where it joined several others . When the men were enlisted , they expected to march at once upon the Rebels , but week after week passed by , spring became summer , and summer lengthened into autumn , and there was no movement of the troops . The ardor of their patriotism died out . It was a monotonous life , waking early in the morning to answer roll-call , to eat breakfast of salt pork and hard-tack , drilling by squads , by companies , by battalion , marching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shouldering , ordering , and presenting arms , making believe load and fire , standing on guard , putting out their lights at nine o'clock at night ,  --  doing all this , week after week , with the Rebels at Columbus , only twenty miles down the river . It was very irksome . Sometimes Paul 's heart went back to New Hope , as the dear old times came crowding upon him ; but he had learned to be patient . He knew that it was necessary for soldiers to become disciplined . He had enlisted for the war , he gave his whole attention to doing his duty , and received his reward by being made a sergeant . He kept his gun clean , his equipments in good order , and he was always in his place . So prompt was he , that his commander nicknamed him Sergeant Ready . He was as ready to play a game of football , or to run a race , as he was to appear in the ranks at drill . When off duty , instead of idling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning not only his duty as a sergeant , but what it would be if he were a lieutenant or a captain . The camp of his regiment was near the town , on the bank of the Mississippi , where he saw the great steamboats pass down the Mississippi from St. Louis , and down the Ohio from Louisville and Cincinnati , with thousands of troops on board , with the flags and banners streaming , the bands playing , and the soldiers cheering . It was pleasant to stand upon the levee , and behold the stirring scenes ,  --  the gunboats commanded by the brave and good Admiral Foote , the great eleven-inch guns peeping from the portholes ,  --  but Paul longed for active life . He rejoiced when he heard that his regiment was ordered to leave the Ohio River and go down toward Columbus on a reconnoitring expedition . The soldiers were so happy that they threw up their caps and gave a loud hurrah . With their haversacks full of hard-tack and cold boiled beef , carrying their tin cups and plates , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great steamboats , and floated down the river . They were exhilarated with the thought that they were to have new and untried experiences ,  --  that perhaps there would be a battle . They paced the deck of the steamboat nervously , and looked carefully into the woods along the river-bank to see if there were any Rebel scouts lurking behind the trees . Six miles below Cairo is a place called Old Fort Jefferson , where many years ago the white settlers built a fort , and where they had a battle with the Indians . The Essex gunboat , Captain Porter , was lying there , swinging at her anchors in the stream . A sailor paced the deck in a short blue jacket , who had a spy-glass in his hand , and kept a sharp lookout down the river , for there were two Rebel gunboats below in the bend . The regiment landed on the Kentucky side , where a narrow creek comes down from the hills through a wild ravine . Suddenly there was a cry of " There they come ! the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw two dark-colored boats . " Heave anchor ! Put on steam . Light up the magazines . Pipe all hand to quarters ! Lively ! " were the orders on board the Essex . The boatswain blew his whistle , the drummer beat the long roll , and the sailors , who had been dozing about the decks , were instantly astir , weighing the anchors , running out the great guns , bringing up shot and shell from the hold , and clearing the deck for action . The great wheels turned , and the Essex swung out into the stream , and prepared to meet her antagonists . What an exciting moment ! Paul felt the blood rush through his veins as he never felt it before . One of the approaching gunboats was suddenly enveloped in white smoke . He heard a screaming in the air , coming nearer and nearer , and growing louder and louder and more terrifying . He felt a cold chill creep over him . He held his breath . He was in doubt whether it would be better to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his heels . He could see nothing in the air , but he knew that a shot was coming . Perhaps it might hit him . He thought of home , his mother , Azalia , and all the old friends . He lived years in a second . " I wo n't run , " he said to himself , as the iron bolt came on . Crash ! it went through a great oak-tree , shivering it to splinters , and flying on into the woods , cutting off branches , and falling to the ground at last with a heavy thug ! ploughing a deep furrow and burying itself out of sight . There was a roar of thunder rolling along the river-banks , echoing from woodland to woodland . Then the heavy eleven-inch gun of the Essex jumped up from the deck , took a leap backwards , almost jerking the great iron ringbolts from the sides of the ship , coming down with a jar which made her quiver from stem to stern , sending a shell , smoking and hissing , down stream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing the planks into the water . " Hurrah ! Hurrah ! " shouted the crew of the Essex . " Hurrah ! Hurrah ! " answered the soldiers on shore , dancing about and cheering . Another shot came screeching towards them as loud as the first ; but it was not half so terrifying . Paul thought it was not worth while to be frightened till he was hurt , and so he stood his ground , and watched the firing till the Rebel gunboats turned towards Columbus and disappeared behind the distant headland , followed by Captain Porter , who kept his great guns booming till he was almost within range of the Rebel batteries at Columbus . He was a brave man , short and stout , with a heavy beard . His father commanded the United States ship Essex in 1812 , and had a long , hard fight with two British ships in the harbor of Valparaiso , fighting against great odds , till his decks were slippery with blood , till nearly all of his guns were dismounted , when he was obliged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old block , " said Admiral Foote the next day to Captain Porter , commending his watchfulness and promptness to meet the enemy . Paul saw how necessary it was in military operations to be always on the watch , and he felt that it was also necessary to be calm and self-possessed when on the battle-field . The regiment took up its line of march , for a reconnoissance towards Columbus , along a winding path through the woods , passing log farm-houses , crossing creeks on log bridges . Paul noticed all the windings of the road , the hills , houses , and other objects , keeping count of his steps from one place to another , jotting it down on a slip of paper when the regiment came to a halt . They could not kindle a fire , for they were in the enemy 's country , and each man ate his supper of hard-tack and cold beef , and washed it down with water from the creek . Paul was sitting on a log eating his supper , and looking about for a place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the regiment came to him and said : " Sergeant Parker , it is very important that a reconnoissance be made to-night towards the enemy 's lines . I hear that you are a good , faithful , and trustworthy soldier . Are you willing to take it ? " " I have no desire to shirk any responsibility . If you wish me to go , I am ready , " said Paul . " Very well ; gain all the information you can , and report at daybreak , " said the Colonel . He went out alone in the darkness , past the pickets . And now that he was alone , and moving towards the enemy , he felt that he was engaged in a hazardous undertaking . He walked softly , crouching down , listening to every sound ;  --  on through deep and gloomy ravines , through the dense forests , past farm-houses , where dogs were howling ,  --  noticing all the objects , and picturing them in memory . " Halt ! Who comes there ? " shouted a voice . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very dark night ; stooping close to the ground , he could see an object by the roadside , immediately before him . He held his breath . What should he do ? " Keep cool , " said a monitor within . His heart had leaped into his throat , but it went back to its proper place . " Who comes there ? " said the sentinel again . Instead of answering , he moved backward so softly and noiselessly that he could not hear his own footsteps . " What is the row ? " he heard a Rebel officer ask of the sentinel . " There is a Yankee prowling about , I reckon , " said the sentinel in a whisper , and added , " There he is . " " Shoot him ! " said the officer . There was a flash which blinded Paul . He heard the Minie bullet sing above him . He could see the dark forms of the two men . He had a revolver in his hand , and could have shot them , but he was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight . " It is nothing but a stump , after all , " said the officer . The report of the gun re-echoed far and near . The night was still , and he could hear other pickets talking out in the field on his right hand and on his left . How fortunate ! He knew where they were , and now could avoid them . But ought he not to turn back ? He resolved not to be frightened from his object . After lying still awhile , he went back along the road , then turned aside , walked softly from tree to tree , careful not to crackle a twig beneath his feet , crept on his hands and knees through the thick underbrush , and gained the road in the rear of the picket . Being inside of the enemy 's lines , he knew that he could move more freely , for if any of the sentinels heard him they would think it one of their own number . He walked on , but suddenly found himself standing face to face with a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankees down there ? " one asked . " The sentinel thought he saw a Yankee , but I reckon he fired at a stump , " said Paul , passing boldly by them to their rear . He now saw that he was in a Rebel camp . There were smouldering fires , tents , a cannon , baggage-wagons , and horses which were munching their grain . What should he do ? He felt that he was in a critical situation . If taken , he would be hung as a spy . He stood still and reflected a moment , to calm his nerves . He had blundered in , perhaps he might get out . He would try ; but as he was there , ought he not to improve the opportunity to find out all about the camp , how large it was , how many men there were ? He counted the baggage-wagons and the tents . He almost stumbled over a man who was wrapped in his blanket . It was an officer sound asleep , with his sword by his side . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword , for he thought , unless he carried something back as evidence , his report would not be believed . And then he crept back past the grand guard , and past the sentinels , sometimes crawling an inch at a time , then stepping as noiselessly as a cat in search of her prey , till he was past them all . He was surprised to find how cool and self-possessed he was , how clear his brain , and how wide awake were all his faculties . He was as light-hearted as a bird in spring-time , for even in the darkness , while he was dimly discerning what was around him , he saw Azalia , as he last beheld her in the gravelled walk before her home , waving him on ! At daybreak he reached the lines once more . The Colonel heard his story , and was in doubt about its truth ; but when he saw how accurate a map Paul drew , and that the sword was marked C. S. A. , for the Confederate States of America ,  --  when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did ,  --  he said , " Sergeant Parker , I shall inform General Grant that you have done your duty faithfully . " CHAPTER XI . SCOUTING . " Sergeant Parker is hereby ordered to report immediately at General Grant 's Headquarters , " was the order which Paul received the next morning . He wondered what General Grant could want of him . He entered the General 's tent , and saw a short , thick-set , middle-aged man with sandy whiskers , sitting at a table , reading letters and smoking a cigar . He was dressed in a plain blue blouse , and as he had no straps on his shoulders , Paul thought he was the General 's orderly . " Is General Grant about ? " he asked . " Yes , sir , " said the man , looking up pleasantly . " I should like to see him , " said Paul . " I am General Grant . " Paul was astonished to find a general so affable and pleasant , for he had seen some lieutenants and captains strut like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul saluted the General , and said , " I am ordered to report to you , sir . " " O yes ; you are Sergeant Parker , who made a reconnoissance last night ; sit down , Sergeant , till I finish my letters . " It was spoken so pleasantly and kindly , that Paul said to himself , " He is a gentleman . " When the General had finished his letters he lighted another cigar , and questioned Paul about his adventures ; how far it was to the Rebel camp , and how the camp was situated . " I will give you a sketch of the place , " said Paul ; and , sitting up to the table , he drew a map , putting down the creeks , the roads , the woods , the distances from point to point , the place where he came upon the pickets , the position of the tents , and all the objects he saw . The General sat in silence , smoking , and looking at Paul with a keen eye . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised the General . Paul had kept count of his steps from one object to another . By looking up to the stars he had kept the points of the compass , and knew whether he travelled south , or southeast , or southwest , and so he was able to draw an excellent map . " Where did you study topographical engineering ? " the General asked . " By the kitchen fire , " Paul replied . " A good college to graduate from , especially if a fellow has grit , " said the General , smiling . " Are you willing to undertake a hazardous enterprise ? " he asked . " I am willing to undertake anything for my country , " Paul replied . The General then told him that he wished to obtain information about Fort Henry on the Tennessee River , and Fort Donelson on the Cumberland . He showed him the positions on a map , and said it was an undertaking of great importance , and which might cost him his life . " I will give you a trustworthy companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it alone , if you please . Two is one too many ; it doubles our risk . If discovered by the Rebels , I could n't help my comrade , neither could he help me . If we keep together , we shall have the same information . I think I shall succeed better alone , " said Paul . " You are right , " said the General , who told him that he might prepare for the trip , and that he would be sent up the Tennessee River on a gunboat , and put on shore a few miles from Fort Henry , and that he must return in ten days . " I hear a good report of you , and have confidence in you . I desire accurate information ; for if it is not accurate , it may lead to very disastrous results , " said the General . Two nights later , Paul stood alone on the bank of the Tennessee . The gunboat which had brought him was going back . He could hear the plashing of her wheels growing fainter each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an undertaking which might cost him his life . If discovered , he would be hung . For an instant his heart failed him , and he felt that he must turn back ; then he remembered that he had enlisted in the service of his country , to do his duty , whatever it might be . His duty was before him . He was upon the ground . Would not God take care of him ? Was not the path of duty , although it might lead to death , the only path of safety ? There are times when duty is worth more than life . " Whatever is right before the Eternal God , that I will do , " said Paul to himself . His fear was gone . He resolved to be bold , yet cautious , and to keep his thoughts perfectly collected under all circumstances . He had succeeded in one reconnoissance , which made him hopeful ; but he reflected that success often makes men careless , so he resolved to be always on his guard . He had changed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ragged coat , and a slouched hat which had a hole in the crown . He hardly recognized himself he was so altered in appearance . He wondered if Azalia or Daphne would know him . He had no weapon or equipments . There was nothing about him which indicated that he was a soldier of the Union army ready to lay down his life for the old flag . He walked cautiously along the winding path , noticing all the objects ; looking up to the north star at every turn of the road , keeping tally of his steps that he might know the distance travelled . He walked stealthily , expecting every moment to hear the challenge of the Rebel pickets . He was startled by the cry , " Who ! Who ! Who ! " He came to a sudden halt , and then laughed to think that he had been challenged by an owl . In the morning he came upon a party of men cutting wood , and found that they were Rebel soldiers outside of the picket line . Paul took an axe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . When they went into camp he accompanied them , carrying the axe on his shoulder , thus passing the picket as a wood-chopper . He found three or four thousand soldiers at Fort Henry , hard at work , throwing up breastworks , digging ditches , hewing timber , mounting guns . He worked with them , but kept his eyes and ears open , noticing the position of the fort on the bank of the river , and how many guns there were . He found out what troops were there , where they came from , and who commanded them . He learned that a wagon-train was going to Fort Donelson after ammunition . He joined it and passed the picket as one of the train guards . As the wagons were empty , he had a chance to ride , and thus saved a weary walk of twelve miles . The little town of Dover , which is near Fort Donelson , he found alive with troops ; regiments were arriving from Arkansas , Mississippi , Texas , and Tennessee . General Pillow was there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States and fought in Mexico . General Floyd was there with a brigade of Virginians . He was Secretary of War when Buchanan was President , and did what he could to destroy the Union . He was a thief as well as a Rebel . He was a large , coarse man . Paul despised him , and could hardly restrain himself from knocking the villain from his horse when he saw him ride by wearing the uniform of a traitor . There was not much discipline in the Rebel army , and Paul found little difficulty in going through all the camps , ascertaining what regiments were there . It nettled him to hear the boasts of the soldiers that one Southerner could whip five Yankees , but he said nothing for fear of betraying himself . He obtained food at a sutler 's tent . He was very tired and sleepy when the second night came , but he found a place to sleep at a house in the village . " What regiment do you belong to ? " asked a girl with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scout , " said Paul . " Be you a scout ? Wal , I hope you will run across Old Abe Linkum . If you do , jest take his skelp for me . " ( She meant his scalp . ) " Wal , if I cotch him , I reckon I 'll skelp him , " said Paul , flourishing his knife , as if he was ready for such bloody work . " The Yanks are a set of vagabonds ; they are the meanest critters on airth , " said the woman . " They 'll hang you if they cotch you . " " I reckon I wo n't let ' em cotch me , " said Paul . " Where be you gwine next ? " " Down to Cairo , I reckon ; though I go wherever the General sends me . " " May be you would do a little chore for me ,  --  get me some pins , needles , and thread ? " " It is mighty skittish business , but I 'll see what I can do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next business was to get away . He waited till the lights were put out in the camps at night , then , walking down to the river he found a small boat , jumped in and pushed out into the stream . He could see the sentinels on the parapet of the fort as he floated past , but they did not discover him . Paul congratulated himself that he was beyond the picket line when he heard a hail from both shores at the same time . " Boat ahoy ! " He made no reply . " Boat ahoy ! come ashore or I 'll fire , " said both sentinels . He saw that he could not escape by rowing . They would fire if he attempted to go ahead or turn back . If he went ashore , he would be taken to the guard-house , questioned , probably put into prison , perhaps tried as a spy . He resolved that he would n't go ashore . There was no time for deliberation . It was mid-winter ; the air was keen , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the boat he might be shot , so he lowered himself noiselessly into the water . How cold it was ! He felt the chill strike through him , setting his teeth to chattering , and his limbs quivering . There was another hail , and then a flash on both shores . The balls went through the boat . He heard the stroke of oars , and saw a boat pushing out from the shore . He darted ahead , swimming noiselessly down stream , gradually nearing the shore , for his strength was failing . He heard the men in the boat say , " We are fooled , it is only an empty dug-out . " How hard it was to climb the bank ! He could not stand , he was so chilled . Once he rose to his feet , but tumbled like a log to the ground . He wanted to go to sleep , but he knew it would be his last sleep if he yielded . He drained the water from his boots , rubbed his legs , thrashed his hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen trees . What a wearisome , cheerless night it was ! How he longed for a fire ,  --  a cup of warm coffee ,  --  a comfortable bed ! He thought of his own bed in the little old house at New Hope , and wished that he might lie there once more , and snuggle down beneath the warm comforters . His clothes were frozen , and notwithstanding he beat his hands till the blood dripped from his fingers , he could get up no warmth . " Halt ! Who comes there ? " was the sharp challenge which startled him from his dreaming . He was close upon a picket . He turned in an instant , and began to run . He heard footsteps following . The thought that he was pursued roused all his energies . The footsteps came nearer . Putting forth all his strength , holding his breath , Paul went on , stumbling , rising again , leaping , hearing the footsteps of his pursuer coming nearer ; suddenly he came to a deep , narrow creek . He did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other bank , gained the solid ground , and dropped behind a tree just as his pursuer reached the creek . The Rebel stopped and listened , but Paul remained perfectly still , hardly daring to breathe , till he heard the fellow go back muttering to himself and cursing the creek . The running had warmed Paul , but he was exhausted and drenched once more . Daybreak came , and he did not dare to travel ; so , finding some stacks of corn in a field , he tore one of them open , made a bed inside , drew the bundles over him , shivered awhile , and then dropped asleep . He awoke suddenly to find his house tumbling to pieces ,  --  torn down by Rebel soldiers . " Hello ! What 's here ? Who be ye ? What are ye up to ? " said a sergeant , startled to find a man under the bundles . " Deserter , eh ? or a spy , I reckon , " said the fellow , holding a pistol to Paul 's head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coolly . " Give an account of yourself , how ye came here , whar ye have been , and whar ye gwine . " Paul noticed that he said whar for where , and replied , " I am a scout , and have been down by the river whar the Yankee gunboats is . " " I do n't believe it ; you look like a scarecrow , but I reckon you are a Yankee spy , " said the Sergeant . He searched Paul , but found nothing . He was commanding a cavalry foraging-party , and was a brutal , ignorant fellow , and had been drinking whiskey , and wanted to show that he had power . " Boys , bring a halter ; I reckon I 'll make this fellow confess that he is a Yankee . " A soldier brought a rope ; one end was thrown over the limb of a tree , and the other made into a slip-noose , and put round his neck ; but he did not flinch . To confess that he was a spy was sure death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back to his home . He thought of his mother and Azalia ; but there was little time for such reflection . He did not feel that his work was done . " Wal , Sergeant , what be you gwine to do ? " he asked . " Hang you as a spy , " said the Sergeant . " What sort of a report will you make to the General ? What do ye think he will do to you when he finds that you have hung one of his scouts ? " Paul asked . " See here , Sergeant , I reckon your are a leetle too fast in this matter , " said one of the soldiers . Paul saw that the time had come for a bold course on his part . He had already ascertained what regiment of cavalry they belonged to . He had seen their Colonel at Dover . " What do you suppose Colonel Forrest will say , when he hears of this proceeding of yours ? " he asked . The Sergeant started at the mention of the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a new light . Paul threw the noose from his neck and said , in a tone of authority : " I will report you , sir . I will have you arrested . I 'll teach you to do your duty better than this . I am an officer . I know General Pillow , General Floyd , General Buckner , and Colonel Forrest . I am out on important business . You found me asleep , and instead of taking me to your superior officer , as you ought to have done , you proceed to hang me . You are drunk , sir , and I 'll have you punished . " The Sergeant was very much frightened . He saw how noble a countenance Paul had , and felt his tone of authority . " I did n't mean any harm , sir ; I wanted to do my duty , " said the Sergeant , taking off his hat , and holding down his head . " Because you are a sergeant , you wanted to show your authority , " said Paul . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when I get to General Pillow 's head-quarters I will see to your case . " The soldiers who had gathered round started off at once to their work , while Paul walked towards Fort Donelson . He had gone but a few steps , when the Sergeant followed him , and , taking off his hat , said , " Please , Colonel , do n't be too hard on me , I wo n't do so again . " " It will be my duty to report you ; but if you will promise to be more careful in the future I will tell the General when I make my report not to be too hard , " said Paul . " I 'll be more keerful next time , and wo n't get drunk again , Colonel , never . " " Very well , " said Paul , walking on till he reached a piece of woods ; then , turning from the path , he made his way towards the river again , wondering at his escape . He had a long walk through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stream , how his heart leaped for joy ! He kept all he had seen so well in memory , that when he reached Cairo he was able to draw an accurate plan of the forts and country around them . General Grant listened to his story with great interest , and when Paul had finished said , " You have performed your work acceptably ; you understand topography ; I wish to keep you at my head-quarters , and therefore appoint you a Lieutenant of Engineers . " It was so unexpected a promotion , and such an expression of confidence , that Paul was very much confused , and could only say , while blushing very red , " I thank you , sir . " CHAPTER XII . MISSED FROM HOME . How lonesome it was in New Hope through all these days ! Everybody missed Paul . He was missed by the school-children , for the teacher who succeeded him was cross and harsh , while Paul was always kind and pleasant . He was missed by the congregation on Sunday , for although Hans did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fill Paul 's place . He was missed by his mother , who , through the long , wearisome days and lonely nights , thought only of him , her pride , her joy , her hope . How good Azalia was to visit the Post-office every morning to get the letters which Paul wrote to his mother , often finding one for herself ! How pleasant to read what he wrote of life in camp ! How thrilling the narrative of his adventures , his visit to the forts , his narrow escapes ! As she read it , her heart stood still while the letter was wet with tears . What if the rebels had hung him ! It was terrible to think of . What could she do to comfort him ? How help him ,  --  how relieve his sufferings and hardships ? She would knit him a pair of gloves and stockings . But his comrades needed them as well as he . Why not ask Daphne to help ? Why not ask all the girls to do something ? So she thought the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' sewing and knitting society . Pleasant gatherings they had in the vestry of the church on Wednesday afternoons working for the soldiers . Azalia 's cheeks were flushed with rare beauty when she read Paul 's letters to them with trembling voice . There were many moist eyes , for all felt that , if he and his comrades were undergoing such hardships and dangers for them , that they might have a home and a united country , they ought to do all they could in return ; and so , while knitting stockings for the soldiers , their hearts were knit in deeper love and devotion to their country . But they had something besides Paul 's adventures to talk about ; for one Monday morning when Mr. Bond , the town treasurer , opened his office , he found that it had been entered by robbers , who had stolen all the money ,  --  several thousand dollars . It was soon discovered that Philip Funk was missing . The sheriffs and constables set themselves to hunt him up . They got upon his track , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but he was too swift for them , and succeeded in getting into the Rebel lines with the stolen money . Notwithstanding he was a robber , his sister Fanny held her head as high as ever . She did not attend the soldiers ' aid society . She hoped that the South would succeed in establishing its independence , and was glad that Philip had gone to help the Southern soldiers . " I hope he will come across Paul , " said Fanny to Daphne Dare one day . " So do I , and I hope that Paul will shoot him , " said Daphne , with flashing eyes . She had the spirit of her father , and added , " He is a traitor and a robber , and I hope somebody will shoot him . " Fanny spit at the flag which hung over the street every time she passed it , to show her hatred of it . Daphne was very indignant , and proposed to her associates that they should compel Fanny to wave the stars and stripes ; but Azalia said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her . " We might make her wave the flag , but that would not make her love it , and such forced loyalty would be of no value . " So , acting upon Azalia 's advice , all of the girls passed her by , taking no notice of her on the street , at the Post-office , or in church , not recognizing her by word or look . Fanny bore it awhile with a brazen face , but soon found it hard to have no one to speak to . The great want of the human heart in time of trouble is sympathy . Our wills may bear us up awhile , but sooner or later we must unburden our feelings , or feel the burning of a slow consuming fire , destroying all our peace and happiness . The days were cheerless to Fanny . If she walked out upon the street , she saw only the averted faces of her former friends . They would not speak to her , and if she addressed them they turned away without answering ,  --  avoiding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold northeast storms came , when the clouds hung low upon the hills , when the wind howled in the woods , when the rain pattered upon the withered leaves , how lonesome the hours ! She was haughty and self-willed , friendless and alone ; but instead of becoming loyal and behaving like a good , sensible girl , she nursed her pride ; and comforted herself by thinking that her great-grandfather Funk was a fine old Virginian gentleman . If a still , small voice whispered that it was mean and wicked in Philip to take money which did not belong to him , she quieted her conscience by the reflection that it was right for the Rebels to do all the damage they could to their enemies in securing their independence . When the storm was loudest , she rejoiced in the hope that some of the Yankee ships would be wrecked , or that the Mississippi River would overflow its bank and drown the Yankee regiments in their camps . Not so did Azalia listen to the storm . When the great drops rattled upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul and his comrades as rushing into battle amid volleys of musketry ; the mournful sighing of the wind was like the wailing of the wounded . She thought of him as marching wearily and alone through the dismal forest to perform deeds of daring ; she thought of him as keeping watch through the stormy nights , cold , wet , hungry , and weary ; not for glory , or fame , or hope of reward , but because it was his duty . And these were not sad hours to her . CHAPTER XIII . THE MARCH . On Wednesday , the 12th of February , 1862 , Paul found himself once more upon the road leading from Fort Henry to Fort Donelson , not now alone , but guiding an army of fifteen thousand men , with forty pieces of artillery . He was on horseback , and sat so well in the saddle that the cavalry-men said he rode like an old trooper . He was in uniform , and wore straps on his shoulders , and was armed with a sword and a revolver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thickets and down the ravines , to see if there were any Rebels in ambush . The sharpshooters followed him . They wore gray jackets and skull-caps , and were armed with rifles and long hunting-knives . They were famous hunters , and could shoot a deer upon the run , or bring down a prairie-chicken upon the wing . They were tough , hearty , jolly , courageous , daring fellows . They were in good spirits , for the rebels had fled in dismay from Fort Henry when the gunboats sent their shells into the fort . It was a hard march , for the roads were muddy , and they were obliged to wade through creeks although it was mid-winter . Paul noticed one brave fellow among them , whose feet were so sore that his steps were marked with blood , which oozed from a hole in the side of his shoe , and yet the man kept his place in the ranks . " Let me carry your gun , " said Paul , and so , taking it across his saddle , helped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Paul . " I ca n't stay behind if there is to be any fighting , " said the soldier , thanking Paul for his kindness ; and then , in a low tone , the soldier said to his comrade , " There a' n't many officers like him who will help a fellow . " At sunset the army halted in the woods beside a brook . Tents had been left behind , and the soldiers had no shelter from the wintry air . They cut down great trees and kindled huge fires . The farmers in that part of the country had large herds of pigs , which roamed the woods and lived on nuts . The soldiers had lived on salt meats for many months , and , notwithstanding orders had been issued against committing depredations , they were determined to have a good supper . Crack ! crack ! crack ! went their rifles . Some , instead of shooting , tried to catch the pigs . There were exciting chases , and laughable scenes ,  --  a dozen men after one pig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the hind legs , or by the tail . They had a charming time , sitting around the roaring fires , inhaling the savory odors of the steaks and spareribs broiling and roasting over the glowing coals on forked sticks , and of the coffee bubbling in their tin cups . The foot-sore sharpshooter whom Paul had helped on the march cooked a choice and tender piece , and presented it to Paul on a chip , for they had no plates . It was cooked so nicely that Paul thought he had never tasted a more delicious morsel . In the morning they had an excellent breakfast , and then resumed the march , moving slowly and cautiously through the woods , but finding no enemy till they came in sight of Fort Donelson . Paul had guided the army to the fort , but now he had other duties to perform . He was required to make a sketch of the ground around the fort , that General Grant might know where to form his lines ,  --  on what hills to plant his cannon ,  --  where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see fit to come out and attack him . Leaving his horse behind , Paul began his dangerous but important work on foot , that he might make an accurate map ,  --  examining through his field-glass the breastworks of the rebels , counting their cannon , and beholding them hard at work . When night came he crept almost up to their lines . He was between the two armies ,  --  a dangerous position , for the pickets on both sides were wide awake , and his own comrades might fire upon him before he could give the countersign . Although he stepped lightly , the sticks sometimes crackled beneath his feet . " Halt ! Who goes there ? " shouted a Rebel picket directly in front of him . It was so sudden , and he was so near , that Paul 's hair stood on end . He darted behind a tree . Click ! flash ! bang ! and a bullet came with a heavy thug into the tree . Bang ! went another gun ,  --  another ,  --  and another ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankees were coming , blazed away at random . The Yankee pickets , thinking that the rebels were advancing , became uneasy and fired in return . Paul could hear the bullets spin through the air and strike into the trees . His first thought was to get back to his comrades as soon as possible ; then he reflected that it would be dangerous to attempt it just then . The firing woke up all the sleepers in the two armies . The drums were beating the long roll , the bugles were sounding , and he could hear the Rebel officers shouting to the men , " Fall in ! fall in ! " He laughed to think that the crackling of a stick had produced all this uproar . He wanted very much to join in the fun , and give the Rebel picket who had fired at him a return shot , but his orders were not to fire even if fired upon , for General Grant was not ready for a battle , and so , while the Rebels were reloading their guns , he glided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to be hit ; but as he was less than six feet high and only eighteen inches across his shoulders , and as it was dark and the soldiers were firing at random , he calculated that there was not one chance in a million of his being injured , and so through the night he went on with his reconnoissance along the lines , and completed the work assigned him . CHAPTER XIV . THE BATTLE . In the morning he found General Grant in a little old farm-house , where he had established his head-quarters . He appeared to be pleased with the map which Paul made of the ground , and said to Major Cavender , who commanded the regiment of Missouri Artillery , " Place your guns on that hill , and be ready to open upon the fort . " He issued orders to General McClernand to go round to the southwest side of the town ; to General Wallace , to hold the centre of the line , west of the town ; and to General Smith , to be ready to storm the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . The air was mild , and the birds sang in the trees though it was mid-winter . The sharpshooters ate their breakfast before sunrise , and began the battle by exchanging shots with the Rebel pickets . Though Paul had been up all night , there was no time for rest . He was sent with orders to the artillery officers ,  --  to Captain Taylor , Captain Dresser , and Captain Schwartz , telling them where to place their guns . As he rode over the hills and through the ravines , he passed the sharpshooters . Their rifles were cracking merrily . Among them was the soldier whom Paul had helped on the march . The soldier saluted him . Paul saw that he was not only foot-sore , but also sick . " You are not fit to go into battle ; you ought to report to the surgeon , " said Paul . " I would n't miss of being in this scrimmage that we are going to have to-day for the best farm in Illinois , " said the soldier . Just then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the front . Major Cavender had wheeled his guns into position , and was sighting them . One of the shells struck at his feet , and ploughed a deep furrow in the ground . Another struck a poor fellow in the breast , whirled him into the air , spattering his blood upon those who stood around , killing him instantly . As Paul beheld the quivering flesh , the sight filled him with horror , and made him sick at heart . Such might be his fate before the day was done . He thought of home ,  --  of his mother , of Azalia , and of the dear friends far away . He thought also of God , and the hereafter ; but remembered that he was in the keeping of his Heavenly Father . He was there to do his duty , and if he was to meet with death , would meet it resolutely ; and so , regaining his composure , rode calmly along the lines , acting as aid to General Grant doing the duties assigned him . The battle lasted through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gunboats which were to sail up the Cumberland River had not arrived , and the provisions which the troops brought from Fort Henry were nearly exhausted . The day which had been so bright and beautiful was succeeded by a dreary night . The wind blew from the northeast . A rainstorm set in , which changed to snow , and became one of the severest storms ever known in that section of the country . It was a terrible night for the wounded . They had no protection from the storm . Hundreds had fallen during the day . Some were lying where they fell , close up under the Rebel breastworks , amid the tangled thickets , the blood oozing from their wounds and staining the drifting snow . It was heart-rending to hear their wailings , and cries of distress , and calls for help . When morning came , many a brave soldier was frozen to the ground . When Paul saw the terrible suffering , he felt that he was willing to make any sacrifice to put a stop to such horrors . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more valuable than human life , and that it is better to fight for them than to yield to injustice and wickedness . But now the hearts of the soldiers were cheered with the news that the gunboats were coming . Paul looked down the river and saw a cloud of black smoke hanging over the forest , rising from their tall chimneys . Steamboats loaded with provisions came with the fleet . The soldiers swung their caps , and made the air ring with their lusty cheers . What a magnificent sight it was when the gunboats steamed up the river and opened fire upon the fort , covering themselves with clouds of smoke and flame , and all of the guns in the fort replying ! The storm had died away , the air was still , and the roar of the cannonade was like thunder . All along the lines the sharpshooters ' rifles were ringing . The soldiers crouched behind trees and logs and hillocks , lying on their faces , picking off the Rebel gunners when they attempted to load their cannon . But the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came , and the Rebels , finding themselves short of provisions , instead of waiting to be attacked , came out from the fort at daybreak , fifteen thousand strong , and made a sudden attack upon the Union army . A great battle followed , which lasted nearly all day . Thousands were killed and wounded . Paul was obliged to ride all over the field , carrying orders to the different generals , while the bullets fell like hailstones around him . Cannon-balls flew past him , shells exploded over his head , men fell near him , but he was unharmed . He saw with grief his comrades overpowered and driven , and could hardly keep back the tears when he saw the Rebels capture some of Captain Schwartz 's guns . But when the infantry gave way and fled panic-stricken along the road towards Fort Henry , throwing away their muskets , his indignation was aroused . " Stop ! or I 'll shoot you , " he said , drawing his revolver . " A' n't you ashamed of yourselves , you cowards ? " shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , and discovered his friend the sharpshooter , who thus aided him in rallying the fugitives . Blood was dripping from his fingers . A ball had passed through one arm , but he had tied his handkerchief over the wound , and was on his way back to the lines to take part once more in the battle . Paul thanked the noble fellow for helping him , and then , with the aid of other officers , they rallied the fugitives till reinforcements came . Onward came the Rebels , flushed with success , and thinking to win a glorious victory ; but they were cut down with shells and canister , and by the volleys of musketry which were poured upon them . It was with great satisfaction that Paul saw the shells tear through the Rebel ranks ; not that he liked to see men killed , but because he wanted Right to triumph over Wrong . Again and again the Rebels marched up the hill , but were as often swept back by the terrible fire which burst from Captain Wood 's , Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's batteries . The little brook which trickled through the ravine at the foot of the hill was red with the blood of the slain . It was a fearful sight . But the Rebels at last gave up the attempt to drive the Union troops from the hill , and went back into the fort . Then in the afternoon there was a grand charge upon the Rebel breastworks . With a wild hurrah they carried the old flag across the ravine , and up the hill beyond , over fallen trees and through thick underbrush . Men dropped from the ranks in scores , but on  --  on  --  on they went , driving the Rebels , planting the stars and stripes on the works ; and though the Rebel regiments in the fort rained solid shot and shell and grape and canister and musket-balls upon them , yet they held the ground through the long , weary , dreary winter night . When the dawn came , the dawn of Sunday , they saw a white flag flung out from the parapet of the fort , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they gave ! They swung their hats , sang songs , and danced for joy . How beautifully the stars and stripes waved in the morning breeze ! How proudly they marched into the fort and into the town ,  --  the drums beating , the bugles sounding , and the bands playing ! But how horrible the sight upon the field when the contest was over ,  --  the dead , some cold and ghastly , others still warm with departing life , lying with their faces toward heaven , smiling as if only asleep ! The ground was strewn with guns , knapsacks , and blood-stained garments ; the snow had changed to crimson . Many wounded were lying where they fell , some whose lives were ebbing away calmly waiting the coming of death . As Paul walked over the field he came upon one lying with clasped hands and closed eyes , whose blood was flowing from a ghastly wound in his breast . As Paul stopped to gaze a moment upon a countenance which seemed familiar , the soldier opened his eyes and smiled ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had helped on the march , who , though sick , would not go into the hospital , though wounded , would not leave the field , and had aided him in rallying the fugitives . He had fought gallantly through the battle , and received his death-wound in the last grand charge . " I am glad you have come , for I know that one who was kind enough to help a poor fellow on the march will be willing to do one thing more , " said the soldier , faintly . " Certainly . What can I do for you ? " " Not much , only I would like to have you overhaul my knapsack for me . " Paul unstrapped the knapsack from the soldier 's back , and opened it . " There is a picture in there which I want to look at once more before I die . You will find it in my Bible . " Paul handed him the Bible . " My mother gave me this blessed book the day I left home to join the army . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day , and I would like to have you write to her and tell her that I have kept my promise . Tell her that I have tried to do my duty to my country and to my God . I would like to live , but am not afraid to die , and am not sorry that I enlisted . Write to my sister . She is a sweet girl ,  --  I can see her now ,  --  a bright-eyed , light-hearted , joyous creature . O , how she will miss me ! Tell her to plant a rose-bush in the garden and call it my rose , that little Eddie , when he grows up , may remember that his eldest brother died for his country . They live away up in Wisconsin . " He took a photograph from the Bible . It was the picture of a dark-haired , black-eyed , fair-featured girl , and he gazed upon it till the tears rolled down his cheeks . He drew his brawny hand across his face and wiped them away , but the effort started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is hard to part from her . She promised to be my wife when I came home from the war , " he said , and touched it to his lips , then gazed again till his sight grew dim . He laid it with the Bible on his breast . Paul wiped the cold sweat from the soldier 's brow . " God bless you , " he whispered , and looked up and smiled . His eyes closed , and the slowly heaving heart stood still . He was gone to the land where the Faithful and True receive their just reward . CHAPTER XV . SHOWING WHAT HE WAS MADE OF . There came a Sabbath morning ,  --  one of the loveliest of all the year . The sun rose upon a cloudless sky , the air was laden with the fragrance of locust and alder blossoms , the oaks of the forest were changing from the gray of winter to the green of summer . Beneath their wide-spread branches were the tents of a great army ; for after the capture of Fort Donelson the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack the Rebels at Corinth . Paul was lying in his tent , thinking of home , of the calmness and stillness there , broken only by the chirping of the sparrows and robins , the church-bell , the choir , and the low voices of the congregation . How different from what was passing around him , where the drummers were beating the reveille ! He was startled from his waking dream by a sudden firing out among the pickets . What could it mean ? It grew more furious . There was confusion . He sprang to his feet and looked out to see what was the matter . Soldiers were running through the camp . " What is the row ? " he asked . " The Rebels are attacking us . " It did not take him long to dress ; but , while pulling on his boots , a bullet tore through the tent-cloth over his head . The camp was astir . Officers shouted , " Fall in ! " Soldiers , waking from sound sleep , buckled on their cartridge-boxes , seized their guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fairly awake . The drummers beat the long-roll , the buglers sounded the signal for saddling horses , the artillery-men got their guns ready , cavalry-men leaped into their saddles , baggage-wagons went thundering towards the river . There was a volley of musketry , and then a deeper roar from the artillery , and the terrible contest of the day began , which became more terrific from morning till noon , from noon till night , with deafening rolls of musketry , with the roaring of a hundred cannon , with the yelling of the Rebels and the cheering of the soldiers of the Union , as the tempest surged through the forest , up and down the ravines , around Shiloh church , in the old cotton-fields , up to the spring where the country people were accustomed to eat their Sunday dinners , down to the Tennessee River , where the gunboats were waiting for the hour when they could open with their great guns . Paul was in the storm , riding through the leaden hail which fell all around him , pattering upon the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scarring the trees ,  --  riding along the lines carrying messages to General Sherman , who was fighting like a tiger by the church , with the bullets piercing his clothes ,  --  to McClernand , who was near by ,  --  to Wallace , to Prentice , to Hurlburt , to Stuart ,  --  riding where shells were bursting , where solid shot cut off great branches from the trees , splintered the trunks , ploughed the ground , whirled men and horses into the air , tearing them limb from limb , and then passed away with weird howlings . He breathed the thick smoke as it belched from the cannon 's mouth , and felt the hot flashes on his face . He stood beside his commander , General Grant , while waiting for orders , and beheld him when tidings of disaster were brought in ,  --  that General Prentice and hundreds of his men were captured ,  --  that the line was broken , and the men were falling back . He could hear the triumphant shouts of the Rebels . Yet amid it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We will whip them yet , " he said . Paul felt stronger after that , and resolved to die rather than be beaten . But how slowly dragged the hours ! The sun seemed to stand still in the western sky . How hard to see the poor wounded men , thousands of them , borne to the rear , their feet crushed , their legs broken , their arms torn and mangled , and to know that there were other thousands lying upon the ground where they had fallen , and the strife still going on around them ! Other thousands who were not wounded were leaving the ranks , exhausted and disheartened . " Lieutenant Parker , you will select a line along this ravine , throw up such defences as you can , bring up those thirty-two pounders from the river , and put them in position . They ca n't cross this . We will beat them here , " said General Grant . Sometimes in battle minutes are of priceless value ; momentous decisions must be made at once . Then men show what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life . Paul galloped along the ravine . He saw that it was wide and deep , and that , if the Rebels could be kept from crossing it , the battle would be won ; for it was their object to reach the steamboat-landing , where General Grant had all his supplies of food . There were five great iron cannon at the landing . There , also , crouching under the river-bank , to avoid the shot and shell , were thousands of fugitives , who had become disheartened , and who had left their comrades to be overpowered and driven back . He saw the situation of affairs in an instant . His brain was clear . He made up his mind instantly what to do . " Here , you  --  men ! " he shouted . " Each of you shoulder one of those empty pork-barrels , and carry it up the bluff . " But not a man stirred . His indignation was aroused ; but he knew that it was not a time for argument . He drew his revolver , pointed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or I 'll shoot you . " It was spoken so resolutely that they obeyed . He told them how , if they could hold that position , the Rebels would be defeated ,  --  how a few minutes of resolute work would save the army . He saw their courage revive . They dug a trench , cut down trees , rolled up logs , filled the barrels with dirt , and worked like beavers . Others wheeled up the great guns , and Paul put them into position . Others brought shot and shell , and laid them in piles beside the guns . The storm was coming nearer . The lines were giving way . Regiments with broken ranks came straggling down the road . " Bring all the batteries into position along the ravine , " said General Grant . Away flew half a dozen officers with the orders , and the batteries , one after another , came thundering down the road ,  --  the horses leaping , the artillery-men blackened and begrimed , yet ready for another fight . " Get anybody you can to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief of artillery , to Paul . " I can sight a cannon , " said a surgeon , who was dressing wounds in the hospital . He laid down his bandages , went up and patted one of the guns , as if it were an old friend , ran his eye along the sights , and told the gunners what to do . It was sunset . All day long the battle had raged , and the Union troops had been driven . The Rebels were ready for their last grand charge , which they hoped would give them the victory . Onward they came down the steep bank opposite , into the ravine . The Union batteries were ready for them ,  --  Captain Silversparre with his twenty-pounders , Captain Richardson and Captain Russell with their howitzers , Captain Stone with his ten-pounders , Captain Taylor , Captain Dresser , Captain Willard , and Lieutenant Edwards ,  --  sixty or more cannon in all . A gunner was lacking for one of the great iron thirty-twos . Paul sprang from his horse , and took command of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view . " Bang ! bang ! bang ! bang ! " went the guns . Then half a dozen crashed at once ,  --  the great thirty-twos thundering heavier than all the others . Shells , solid shot , and canister tore through the ravine , rolling back the Rebel lines , drenching the hillsides with blood , turning the brook to crimson , and the fresh young leaves to scarlet . O the wild commotion ,  --  the jarring of the earth , the deep reverberations rolling far away , and the shouts of the cannoneers ! " Give them canister ! " shouted Paul to the cannoneers , and the terrible missiles went screaming down the ravine . The bullets were falling around him , singing in his ears , but he heeded them not . But O how painful it was to see a brother officer torn to pieces by his side ! Then how glorious to behold , through the rifts in the battle-cloud , that the Rebels were flying in confusion through the woods . Then there came a cheer . General Nelson had arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The thirty-two-pounders , the howitzers , and the batteries had saved the day , and the victory was won . And now , as night came on , the gunboats joined , throwing eleven-inch shells into the woods among the Rebel troops , which added discomfiture to defeat . And when the uproar , the noise , and the confusion had died away , how good to thank God for the victory , and for the preservation of his life ! How gratifying to receive the thanks of his commander on the field ,  --  to be mentioned as one who had done his duty faithfully , and who was deserving of promotion ! After the battle he was made a captain , and had greater responsibilities resting upon him . He was called upon to take long rides , with the cavalry , on expeditions into the enemy 's country . Sometimes he found himself alone in the dark woods of Mississippi , threading the narrow paths , swimming rivers , wading creeks , plunging into swamps ,  --  at other times , with his comrades , sweeping like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the retreating foe , riding day and night , often without food , but occasionally having a nice supper of roast chicken cooked by the bivouac-fire in the forest . Sometimes he spread his blanket beneath the grand old trees , and had a rest for the night ; and often , when pursued by the enemy , when there was no time to stop and rest , he slept in his saddle , and dreamed of home . So he spent the months which followed that terrible battle , obtaining information which was of inestimable value . Thus he served his country ,  --  at Corinth , at Memphis , and at Vicksburg , where , through the long , hot , weary , sickly months , the brave soldiers toiled , building roads , cutting trenches , digging ditches , excavating canals , clearing forests , erecting batteries , working in mud and water , fighting on the Yazoo , and at last , under their great leader , sweeping down the west side of the Mississippi , crossing the river , defeating the enemy in all the battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capturing it , after months of hardship and suffering . How hard this work ! how laborious , and wearing , and dangerous ! Paul found little time to rest . It was his duty to lay out the work for the soldiers , to say where the breastworks should be thrown up , where the guns should be placed in position . In the dark nights he went out beyond the picket-lines and examined the hills and ravines , while the bullets of the Rebel sharpshooters were flying about his ears , and in the daytime he was riding along the lines while the great guns were bellowing , to see if they were in the best position , and were doing their proper work . At length there came a morning when the Rebels raised a white flag , and Vicksburg surrendered . It was the glorious reward for all their hardship , toil , suffering , and endurance . How proudly the soldiers marched into the city , with drums beating , bands playing , and all their banners waving ! It was the Fourth of July , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were glad hearts all over the land ,  --  ringing of bells and firing of cannon , songs of praise and thanksgivings ; for not only at Vicksburg , but at Gettysburg , the soldiers of the Union had won a great victory . CHAPTER XVI . HONOR TO THE BRAVE . Paul 's mother lived alone , and yet she was not without company ; for the bees and the humming-birds buzzing among the flowers , the old clock ticking steadily , the cat purring in the sunshine , were her constant friends through the long summer days . And every morning Azalia came in and read the news . Pleasant the sound of her approaching step ! Ever welcome her appearance ! Winsome her smile ! How beautiful upon her cheek the deepening bloom of a guileless heart ! " Good news ! " she exclaimed one morning , as she entered , with glowing countenance and sparkling eyes , tossing aside her hat . " What is it , dear ? " Mrs. Parker asked . Azalia replied by opening a newspaper , and reading that " Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was promoted to be a colonel for meritorious and distinguished services at Vicksburg . " " I am glad he has served his country so faithfully , " said Mrs Parker , pleased and gratified , and proud of her son . " Who knows but that he may be a general yet ? " said Azalia , triumphantly . " We are going to have a jubilee this afternoon over the victories , " she added . She could stop no longer , for she was to take part in the jubilee with Daphne , and hastened away to prepare for the occasion . All New Hope turned out to rejoice over the glorious news . Farmers came with their wagons loaded with things for the soldiers ,  --  bottles of wine , jars of jellies and preserves , for there were thousands of wounded in the hospitals . Those who could not contribute such things were ready to give money , for their hearts were overflowing with gratitude . Old men came , leaning on their staves or supported by their children , with the fires of youth rekindling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sons in the service . Paul was not the only soldier who had gone from New Hope . A score had enlisted . Old folks , young folks , all the people of the place were there , in the old church . The evening train came thundering along the railroad , stopping long enough to leave Paul , who had unexpectedly been ordered to duty in Tennessee with General Rosecrans . He was granted a week 's leave of absence . There was no one at the depot . He wondered at the silence in the streets . Houses and stores and shops were all closed . He passed up the hill to his old home ; but his mother was not there , and the door was fast . The cat was lying upon the step , and purred him a welcome . The bees were humming over the flower-beds , and the swallows twittered merrily upon the roof of the house . The remembrance of his boyhood came back , and he was a child again amid the flowers . He noticed that the people were around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called them together . " Why , that is Paul Parker , as true as I am alive ! " said Mr. Chrome , as he approached the church . The little boys caught it up , and cried , " Paul has come ! Paul has come ! " and looked wonderingly at his blue uniform , and the eagle on his shoulders . It was buzzed through the church that he had come . Judge Adams , who was on the platform , and who was chairman of the meeting , said : " It gives me great pleasure to announce the arrival of our esteemed fellow-citizen , Colonel Parker , who has so nobly distinguished himself in the service of our country . " " Three cheers for Colonel Parker ! " shouted Mr. Chrome , and the people , glad to see him , and brimming over with joy for the victories , sprang to their feet and hurrahed and stamped till the windows rattled . Judge Adams welcomed him to the platform , and Father Surplice , Colonel Dare , and Esquire Capias rose and shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Paul entered ; but he left off suddenly , saying : " I know that you want to hear from Colonel Parker , and it will give me greater pleasure to listen to him than to talk myself . " Then there were cries for Paul . " It is not necessary for me to introduce Colonel Parker on this occasion , " said Judge Adams . " He is our fellow-citizen ; this is his home . He has honored himself and us . We have been trying to be eloquent over the great victories ; but the eloquence of speech is very poor when compared with the eloquence of action . " Then turning to Paul , he said : " What you and your comrades have done , Sir , will be remembered through all coming time . " " We tried to do our duty , and God gave us the victory , " said Paul . He stood before them taller and stouter than when he went away . He was sunburnt ; but his countenance was noble and manly , and marked with self-reliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know what to say . To stand there facing the audience , with his mother , Azalia , Daphne , and all his old friends before him , was very embarrassing . It was worse than meeting the Rebels in battle . But why should he be afraid ? They were all his friends , and would respect him if he did the best he could . He would not try to be eloquent . He would simply tell them the story of the battles ; how the soldiers had marched , and toiled , and fought ,  --  not for glory , honor , or fame , but because they were true patriots ; how he had seen them resign themselves to death as calmly as to a night 's repose , thinking and talking of friends far away , of father , mother , brothers and sisters , their pleasant homes , and the dear old scenes , yet never uttering a regret that they had enlisted to save their country . There were moist eyes when he said that ; but when he told them of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the snow in long , unbroken lines , and with a hurrah went up the hill , over fallen trees , and drove the Rebels from their breastworks ,  --  the men swung their hats , and shouted , and the women waved their handkerchiefs , and cheered as if crazy with enthusiasm . Then Azalia and Daphne sung the Star-spangled Banner , the congregation joining in the chorus . Under the excitement of the moment , Judge Adams called for contributions for the soldiers , and the old farmers took out their pocket-books . Those who had made up their minds to give five dollars gave ten , while Mr. Middlekauf , Hans 's father , who thought he would give twenty-five , put fifty into the hat . When the meeting was over , Paul stepped down from the platform , threw his arms around his mother 's neck and kissed her , and heard her whisper , " God bless you , Paul . " Then the people came to shake hands with him . Even Miss Dobb came up , all smiles , shaking her curls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am glad to see you , Colonel Parker . You know that I was your old teacher . I really feel proud to know that you have acquitted yourself so well . I shall claim part of the honor . You must come and take tea with me , and tell me all about the battles , " she said . " My leave of absence is short . I shall not have time to make many visits ; but it will give me great pleasure to call upon those who have always been my friends , " said Paul , with a look so searching that it brought the blood into her faded cheeks . Hearty the welcome from Azalia and Daphne , and from those who had been his scholars , who listened with eager interest to the words which fell from his lips . Golden the days and blissful those few hours spent with his mother , sitting by her side in the old kitchen ; with Daphne and Azalia , singing the old songs ; with Azalia alone , stealing down the shaded walk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking into the dreamy future , the whippoorwills and plovers piping to them from the cloverfields , the crickets chirping them a cheerful welcome , and the river saluting them with its ceaseless serenade ! CHAPTER XVII . CHICKAMAUGA . Quick the changes . Paul was once more with the army , amid the mountains of Tennessee , marching upon Chattanooga with General Rosecrans , tramping over Lookout Mountain , and along the Chickamauga . Then came a day of disaster in September . A great battle began on Saturday morning , lasted through Sunday , and closed on Monday . Paul rode courageously where duty called him , through the dark woods , along the winding river , where the bullets sang , where the shells burst , where hundreds of brave men fell . Terrible the contest . It was like a thunder-storm among the mountains ,  --  like the growling of the angry surf upon the shore of the ocean . How trying , after hours of hard fighting , to see the lines waver and behold the Rebels move victoriously over the field ! with disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth living for is trembling in the scale ! There are such moments in battle . General Rosecrans 's army was outnumbered . Paul saw the Rebels driving in the centre and turning the left flank to cut off all retreat to Chattanooga . The moment for great , heroic action had come . He felt the blood leap through his veins as it never had leaped before . The Rebel line was advancing up the hill . The Union batteries were making ready to leave . " Stay where you are ! " he shouted . " Give them canister ! Double shot the guns ! Quick ! One minute now is worth a thousand hours . " " Rally ! rally ! Do n't let them have the guns ! " he shouted to the flying troops . They were magic words . Men who had started to run came back . Those who were about to leave stood in their places , ready to die where they were . Five minutes passed ; they seemed ages . On  --  nearer  --  up to the muzzles of the guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the hill , where hundreds of their comrades lay dying and dead . Their efforts to break the line had failed . But once more they advanced in stronger force , rushing up the hill . Fearful the din and strife , the shouts and yells , the clashing of sabres and bayonets , the roar of the cannon , the explosion of shells . Paul found himself suddenly falling , then all was dark . When he came to himself the scene had changed . He was lying upon the ground . A soldier , wearing a dirty gray jacket , and with long hair , was pulling off his boots , saying , " This Yankee has got a pair of boots worth having . " " Hold on ! what are you up to ? " said Paul . " Hullo ! blue bellie , ye are alive , are ye ? Tho't yer was dead . Reckon I 'll take yer boots , and yer coat tew . " Paul saw how it was : he was wounded , and left on the field . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear was the thought that the army had been defeated . He was stiff and sore . The blood was oozing from a wound in his side . He was burning up with fever . He asked the Rebels who were around him for a drink of water ; but , instead of moistening his parched lips , one pointed his gun at him and threatened to blow out his brains . They stripped off his coat and picked his pockets . Around him were hundreds of dead men . The day wore away and the night came on . He opened his lips to drink the falling dew , and lay with his face towards the stars . He thought of his mother , of home , of Azalia , of the angels and God . Many times he had thought how sad it must be to die alone upon the battle-field , far from friends ; but now he remembered the words of Jesus Christ : " I will not leave you comfortless . My peace I give unto you . " Heaven seemed near , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tried to do his duty . He believed that , whether living or dying , God would take care of him , and of his mother . In his soul there was sweet peace and composure ; but what was the meaning of the strange feeling creeping over him , the numbness of his hands , the fluttering of his heart ? Was it not the coming on of death ? He remembered the prayer of his childhood , lisped many a time while kneeling by his mother 's side , and repeated it once more . " Now I lay me down to sleep , I pray the Lord my soul to keep ; If I should die before I wake , I pray the Lord my soul to take . " The stars were fading . His senses reeled . His eyelids closed , and he lay pale , cold , and motionless , among the dead . CHAPTER XVIII . HOW HE LIVED IN THE MEMORY OF HIS FRIENDS . " Colonel Parker , mortally wounded and left on the field . " So read the account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the disaster to the army ,  --  how the lines were broken , how the cannon were lost , how Paul was shot through the breast , how , had it not been for General Thomas , it would have been a day of utter ruin . Father Surplice went up to the little old house to break the sad tidings to Paul 's mother , for he could best give comfort and consolation in time of affliction . " I have sad news , " he said . She saw it in his face , even before he spoke , and knew that something terrible had happened . " A great battle has been fought , and God has seen fit that your son should die for his country . " She made no outcry , but the tears glistened in her eyes . She wiped them away , and calmly replied : " I gave him freely to the country and to God . I know that he was a dutiful , affectionate son . I am not sorry that I let him go . " Then with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thanked God that Paul had been faithful , honest , true , and good . The neighbors came in to comfort her , but were surprised to find her so calm , and to hear her say , " It is well . " It was a gloomy day in New Hope ,  --  in the stores and shops , and in the school-house , for the children affectionately remembered their old teacher . When the sexton tolled the bell , they bowed their heads and wept bitter tears . Mr. Chrome laid down his paint-brush and sat with folded hands , saying , " I ca n't work . " Colonel Dare dashed a tear from his eye , and said , " So slavery takes our noblest and best . " He walked down to the little old house and said to Mrs. Parker , " You never shall want while I have a cent left . " Judge Adams came , and with much emotion asked , " What can I do for you ? " " The Lord is my shepherd , I shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastures , he leadeth me beside the still waters , " she replied , so calmly that the Judge felt that she was the strong one and he the weak . When Azalia heard the news the rose-bloom faded from her cheeks and her heart stood still . In imagination she saw Paul lying on the ground , with blood flowing from his side , enduring dreadful agony , while waiting the coming of death . She could hardly think of him as gone , never to return , yet the church-bell was tolling mournfully , gone , gone , gone ! She clasped her hands upon her heart to keep it from bursting . " Be comforted , my child . He has gone to a better world than this , " said her mother , sympathizing in her sorrow . Daphne came in , and bathed Azalia 's burning brow , kissed her tenderly , and said , " Do n't cry , dear . " Azalia was not weeping ,  --  there were no tears in her eyes . God had not wiped them all away , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fiery furnace . It had dried the fountains . Though her mother and Daphne were so kind and tender , they could not take away her heart-ache . It was a weary day . She sat by the window and gazed upon the wheat-fields , brown and bare , for it was almost October , and the reapers had gathered the grain . Beyond the fields was the river , shrunk to a narrow bed by the heats of summer . Dead leaves were floating down the stream . Like the Miserere which the choir chanted at the funeral of a sweet young girl before Paul went to the army , was the murmuring of the water . Beyond the river were green meadows and gardens and orchards , where dahlias were blooming , and grapes and apples ripening in the mellow sunshine . She thought of Paul as having passed over the river , and as walking in the vineyard of the Lord . The summer flowers which she had planted in her own garden were faded , the stalks were dry , and the leaves withered . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her life had passed away . Night brought no relief . It seemed as if her heart would break , but she remembered what Jesus said : " Come unto me and I will give you rest . " She told Him all her grief , asked Him to help her , inasmuch as He was able to bear the sorrows of all the world . So confiding in Him , she experienced indescribable peace of mind . Then in the evening they who walked along the street stopped and listened by the gate to hear the music which floated out through the open window , bowing their heads , and in silence wiping away their tears . It was the music of the " Messiah , " which Handel composed . She sung it in church one Sunday before Paul went to the army , and Father Surplice said it set him to thinking about the music of heaven ; but now to the passers in the street it was as if Jesus called them , so sweet and tender was the song . It was consoling to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and read again what she had read many times ,  --  to look upon the laurel-leaf which he plucked in the woods at Donelson , the locust-blossoms which he gathered at Shiloh , the moss-rose which grew in a garden at Vicksburg ,  --  to read his noble and manly words of his determination to do his duty in all things . " Life is worth nothing , " read one of the letters , " unless devoted to noble ends . I thank God that I live in this age , for there never has been so great an opportunity to do good . The heroes of all ages , those who have toiled and suffered to make the world better , are looking down from the past to see if I am worthy to be of their number . I can see the millions yet to come beckoning me to do my duty for their sake . They will judge me . What answer can I give them if I falter ? " Thus in her sorrow Azalia found some comfort in looking at the faded flowers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trial , but had proved himself worthy to be numbered with the heroic dead . CHAPTER XIX . WHAT BECAME OF A TRAITOR . But Paul was not dead . He was in the hands of the enemy . He had been taken up from the battle-field while unconscious , put into an ambulance , and carried with other wounded to a Rebel hospital . " We ca n't do anything for this Yankee , " said one of the surgeons who looked at his wound . " No , he will pop off right soon , I reckon , " said another ; and Paul was left to live or die , as it might be . When he awoke from his stupor he found himself in an old barn , lying on a pile of straw . He was weak and faint , and suffered excruciating pain . The Rebel soldier had stolen his coat , and he had no blanket to protect him from the cold night-winds . He was helpless . His flesh was hot , his lips were parched . A fever set in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glassy , and sunken . Week after week he lay powerless to help himself , often out of his head and talking of home , or imagining he was in battle . How long the days ! how lonesome the nights ! But he had a strong constitution , and instead of " popping off , " as the surgeon predicted , began to get well . Months passed , of pain and agony and weary longing . It was sweet relief when he was able to creep out and sit in the warm sunshine . One day a Rebel lieutenant , wearing a gay uniform trimmed with gold lace , came past him . Paul saw that he had been drinking liquor , for he could not walk straight . " Why do n't you salute me , you Yankee villain ? " said the fellow , stopping . Paul was startled at the voice , looked the lieutenant in the face , and saw that it was Philip Funk . His face was bloated , and his eyes bloodshot . When he fled from New Hope after robbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rebels , and was now a lieutenant . Paul was so changed by sickness that Philip did not recognize him . " Why do n't you salute me , you dirty Yankee puppy ? " said Philip , with an oath . " I do n't salute a traitor and a robber , " said Paul . Philip turned pale with anger . " Say that again , and I will cut your heart out ! " he said , with a horrible oath , raising his sword and advancing upon Paul , who stood still and looked him calmly in the eye . " Cowards only attack unarmed men , " said Paul . " What do you mean , sir , by calling me a robber , traitor , and coward ? " Philip asked , white with rage , not recognizing Paul . " I mean that you , Philip Funk , committed robbery at New Hope , ran away from home , became a traitor , and now you show yourself to be a coward by threatening to cut out the heart of a weak defenceless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip . " My name is Paul Parker . I am a colonel in the service of the United States , " Paul replied , not recognizing by any familiar act his old playmate and school-fellow . Philip dropped his sword , and stood irresolute and undecided what to do . A group of Rebel officers who had been wounded , and were strolling about the grounds , saw and heard it all . One was a colonel . " What do you know about Lieutenant Funk ? " he asked . " He was my schoolmate . He committed robbery and came south to join your army , " Paul replied . The Colonel turned to the officers who were with him , and said , " This is the fellow who is suspected of stealing from the soldiers , and it is said that he skulked at Chickamauga . " " The cuss ought to be reduced to the ranks , " said another . Philip did not stop to hear any more , but walked rapidly away . The next day he was arrested and brought before a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stump when ordered to make a charge in battle , and of stealing money from the soldiers . The court ordered that he be stripped of his uniform and reduced to the ranks , and wear the " rogue 's coat " through the camp . The coat was a flour-barrel , without heads , but with holes cut in the sides for his arms . Philip was brought out upon the parade-ground , deprived of his sword and uniform , and compelled to put on the barrel , on which were written the words , COWARD , ROBBER . Thus , with two soldiers to guard him , with a drummer and fifer playing the Rogues ' March , he was paraded through the camp . The soldiers hooted at him , and asked him all sorts of questions . " How are you , Bummer ? " asked one . " Did you pay your tailors with the money you stole ? " asked another . " Your coat puckers under the arms and wrinkles in the back , " said another . " He felt so big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " remarked one , who remembered how pompous Philip had been . After being marched through the camp , he was set to work with a shovel , cleaning up the grounds . It was a sorry day to Philip . He wished he had never been born . He was despised alike by officers and soldiers . The officers made him do their dirty work , while the soldiers , knowing that he had not courage enough to resent an insult , made him the general scavenger of the camp . This treatment was so hard to bear that Philip thought of deserting ; but he knew that if he was caught he would be shot , and did not dare to make the attempt . The slaves in the camp looked down upon him , and spoke of him as the " meanest sort of Yankee white trash . " The soldiers turned him out of their tents . " We wo n't have a Yankee thief and coward in our mess , " said they , and he was obliged to sleep under the trees , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ragged . His clothes dropped from him piece by piece , till he had nothing left but rags . He had little to eat . He had no friends . When he was sick , no one cared for him . Those were bitter days ; but instead of being made better at heart by his punishment , he cursed and swore , and wished only that he could get whiskey to drink . Winter set in . There came a cold , stormy night . Philip wandered about the camp to keep himself warm . He was weak and faint , and at last , tired , exhausted , and his teeth chattering with ague , crawled into a wagon , drew his old tattered blanket over his head , and after shivering awhile went to sleep . The teamsters found him there in the morning , stiff and cold . He had died during the night , with no friend near him , a vagabond , an outcast , despised by everybody . The officer who had charge of the camp , when he heard that Philip was dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guard-house for getting drunk , and said to them , " You were drunk yesterday , and for a punishment I sentence you to bury the camp-scullion who froze to death last night . " The teamster harnessed his horses , drove outside of the camp into a field , where the two soldiers dug a shallow grave , tumbled the body into it , threw back the earth , trampled it down with their feet , shouldered their shovels , and went back to camp as unconcerned as if they had buried a dog . CHAPTER XX . DARK DAYS . When Paul 's wound had healed sufficiently to enable him to travel , he was put into a freight car with his comrades and sent to the Rebel prison at Andersonville . The ride was long and hard , but the prisoners bore the jolting without a murmur , for they supposed they would soon be exchanged and sent North . They were doomed to bitter disappointment . The prison was a yard enclosed by a high fence . There was a platform on the outside where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who approached nearer than what they called " the dead line . " The prisoners had no shelter from the scorching rays of the sun through the long summer days , nor from the sleety rains and freezing nights of winter . They dug holes in the ground with their hands , and made the cold , damp earth their bed . A slimy brook ran through the grounds , foul with filth from the camps of the Rebels . There was a marsh in the centre of the yard , full of rottenness , where the water stood in green and stagnant pools , breeding flies , mosquitos , and vermin , where all the ooze and scum and slops of the camp came to the surface , and filled the air with horrible smells . They had very little food ,  --  nothing but a half-pint of coarse corn-meal , a little molasses , and a mouthful of tainted bacon and salt , during each twenty-four hours . They were herded like sheep . The yard was packed with them . There were more than twenty thousand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his comrades reached the prison , they were examined by the officer in command , a brutal fellow named Wirz , who robbed them of what money they had . The gate opened , and they passed in . When Paul beheld the scene , his heart sank within him . He had suffered many hardships , but this was an experience beyond everything else . He was still weak . He needed nourishing food , but he must eat the corn-meal or starve . Everywhere he saw only sickening sights ,  --  pale , woe-begone wretches , clothed in filthy rags , covered with vermin . Some were picking up crumbs of bread which had been swept out from the bakery . Others were sucking the bones which had been thrown out from the cook-house . Some sat gazing into vacancy , taking no notice of what was going on around them ,  --  dreaming of homes which they never were again to behold . Many were stretched upon the ground , too weak to sit up , from whose hearts hope had died out , and who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sufferings . Thousands had died . One hundred died on the day Paul entered , and another hundred during the night . All day long the bodies lay among the living in the sun . When the dead-cart came in , they were thrown into it like logs of wood . It was a horrible sight ,  --  the stony eyes , the sunken cheeks , the matted hair , the ghastly countenances , the swaying limbs , as the cart jolted along the uneven ground ! More than thirteen thousand soldiers starved and murdered by the Rebels were thus carried out in the dead-carts . The keepers of the prison were cruel . Paul saw a poor cripple crawl towards the fence and reach his hand over the dead line to get a bone . Crack went the rifle of the sentinel , which sent a bullet through the prisoner 's brain , who tossed up his hands , gave one heart-rending outcry , and rolled over  --  dead . On a dark and stormy night some of the prisoners escaped , but ferocious dogs were put upon their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and the Rebel officers had them tied up and whipped , till death put an end to their sufferings . It was terrible to hear the coughing of those who were dying of consumption ,  --  to see them crawling from place to place , searching in vain to find a shelter from the driving storms ,  --  to hear the piteous cries of those who were racked with pains , or the moans of those who gave themselves up to despair . For want of proper food the prisoners suffered from scurvy ;  --  their gums rotted , their teeth fell out , and their flesh turned to corruption ; they wasted away , and died in horrible agony . It was so terrible to hear their dying cries , that Paul put his fingers in his ears ; but soon he became accustomed to the sights and sounds , and looked upon the scenes with indifference . He pitied the sufferers , but was powerless to aid them . Soon he found that his own spirits began to droop . He roused himself , determined to brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs and told stories , and got up games to keep his fellow-prisoners in good heart . But notwithstanding all his efforts to maintain his cheerfulness and composure , he felt that he was growing weaker . Instead of being robust , he became thin and spare . His cheeks were hollow and his eyes sunken . There was a fever in his bones . Day by day he found himself taking shorter walks . At night , when he curled down in his burrow , he felt tired , although he had done no work through the day . In the morning he was stiff , and sore , and lame , and although the ground was cold and damp , it was easier to lie there than to get up . His hair became matted ,  --  his fingers were long and bony . Each day his clothes became more ragged . When he first entered the prison , he tried to keep himself clean and free from vermin , but in vain . One day he went out to wash his tattered clothes , but the stream was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become clear . He sat hour after hour , but it was always the same slimy , sickening stream . The Rebels took delight in deluding the prisoners with false hopes ,  --  telling them that they were soon to be exchanged and sent home ; but instead of release , the dead-cart went its daily rounds , bearing its ghastly burden . That was their exchange , and they looked upon the shallow trenches as the only home which they would ever reach . Hope died out and despair set in . Some prisoners lost their reason , and became raving maniacs , while others became only gibbering idiots . Some who still retained their reason , who all their lives had believed that the Almighty is a God of justice and truth , began to doubt if there be a God . Although they had cried and begged for deliverance , there was no answer to their prayers . Paul felt that his own faith was wavering ; but he could not let go of the instructions he had received from his mother . In the darkest hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cursing , he was comforted and reassured by Uncle Peter , an old gray-headed negro , who had been a slave all his life . Peter had been whipped , kicked , and cuffed many times by his hard-hearted , wicked master , not because he was unfaithful , but because he loved to pray , and shout , and sing . Through the long night , sitting by his pitch-knot fire in his cabin , Uncle Peter had sung the songs which lifted him in spirit almost up to heaven , whither his wife and children had gone , after cruel whippings and scourgings by their master . It was so sweet to think of her as having passed over the river of Jordan into the blessed land , that he could not refrain from shouting : " O my Mary is sitting on the tree of life , To see the Jordan roll ; O , roll Jordan , roll Jordan , roll Jordan , roll ! I will march the angel march ,  --  I will march the angel march . O my soul is rising heavenward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given food and shelter to some of the prisoners who escaped from the horrible place , and had piloted them through the woods , and for this was arrested and thrown into the prison . Uncle Peter took a great liking to Paul , and , when Paul was down-hearted , cheered him by saying : " Never you give up . Do n't let go of de hand of de good Lord . It is mighty hard to bear such treatment , but we colored people have borne it all our lives . But ' pears like my heart would break when I think of my children sold down Souf . " Uncle Peter wiped his eyes with his tattered coat-sleeve , and added : " But de Lord is coming to judge de earth with righteousness , and den I reckon de Rebs will catch it . " Uncle Peter dug roots and cooked Paul 's food for him , for the Rebels would not allow them any wood , although there was a forest near the prison . Paul could not keep back the tears when he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never should weep again , for he felt that the fountains of his heart were drying up . Uncle Peter sat by him through the long days , fanning him with his old tattered straw hat , brushing the flies from his face , moistening his lips with water , and bathing his brow . He was as black as charcoal , and had a great nose and thick lips ,  --  but notwithstanding all that Paul loved him . Thus the days and weeks and months went by , Uncle Peter keeping the breath of life in Paul 's body , while thousands of his comrades died . There was no change in prison affairs for the better . There was no hope of release , no prospect of deliverance ,  --  no words from home , no cheering news , no intelligence , except from other prisoners captured from time to time , and sent to the horrible slaughter-pen to become maniacs and idiots ,  --  to be murdered ,  --  to die of starvation and rottenness ,  --  to be borne out in the dead-cart to the trenches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despondency , there were hours when , with clear vision , he looked beyond the horrors of the prison to the time when God would balance the scales of justice , and permit judgment to be executed , not only upon the fiend Wirz , who had charge of the prison , but also upon Jeff Davis and the leaders of the rebellion . And though his sufferings were terrible to bear , there was not a moment when he was sorry that he had enlisted to save his country . So through all the gloom and darkness his patriotism and devotion shone like a star which never sets . CHAPTER XXI . CONSECRATION . As the weeks passed by , bringing no intelligence to New Hope that Paul was living ,  --  when there was no longer a doubt of his death ,  --  Father Surplice held a memorial service . It was on Sunday , and all the people were at church . Appropriate for the occasion were the words which he read from the New Testament of the widow of Nain ,  --  how , " as Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow ; and when the Lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and said , ' Weep not ! ' " Consoling and comforting were his own words , which sank deep into the hearts of the stricken people ; and though the good man said , " Weep not ! " tears dropped from his own eyes , and fell upon the great Bible which lay open before him . It was a sad and solemn service . Though the heart of the mother was yearning for her son , yet she could say , " The Lord gave , and the Lord hath taken away ; blessed be the name of the Lord . " Mrs. Parker still lived in the little old cottage . The neighbors were very kind , and she wanted for nothing , for Colonel Dare remembered his promise . Peaceful was her life . The birds sang cheerful songs ; sweet was the humming of the bees , fragrant the flowers in the garden , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to the waterfall , she thought of Paul as standing by the River of Life . How , then , could she mourn for him ? Yet she missed him . Sometimes she listened as if to hear his footsteps coming up the garden walk . Sometimes her eyes filled with tears , as her heart went out to the lonely battle-field where she thought him lying . O , if she could but behold him again ,  --  clasp him in her arms ,  --  and once more lay her hand upon his brow , and bless him with a mother 's tenderest love ! But he was gone , and for him she could work no more . His comrades were bearing on the flag , upholding it on bloody fields , fighting as he fought , suffering as he suffered , needing help and comfort and cheer from those at home . There was work to be done for them ; so through the days she sat in the old kitchen , knitting and sewing for the soldiers , wishing that she had half a dozen hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was one who came to aid her every day ,  --  Azalia , who , in the silence and seclusion of her chamber , had looked out upon the yellow harvest-fields where the farmers were gathering the first ripe ears of seed-corn , and had tried to still the wild commotion in her heart by remembering that it was just and right for the Lord of the harvest to gather his " choicest grains . " Down on the lowlands by the river the nurserymen were selecting their fairest trees , and transplanting them in their orchards on the pleasant hills beyond the stream . Why , then , should she complain if the kind Father had seen fit to do the same ? It was consoling to take from her bureau drawer , where her keepsakes were stored , the letters which Paul had written , undo the black ribbon which she had tied around the package , and read again and again that which she almost knew by heart . What manly words were there : " Life is worth nothing unless devoted to noble ends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do my duty for their sake . What answer can I give them if I falter ? " So read one of the letters . They were words which she could not forget . They were written from the trenches before Vicksburg , when the prospects of the country were dark and gloomy ,  --  when craven men at home were crying , " Peace ! Peace ! Let us have peace at any price ! " forgetting that there can be no reconcilement between right and wrong . Paul had sacrificed everything  --  life itself  --  for the sake of those who were to come after him ,  --  for Truth and Justice . She thought of him as asleep beneath the sod of the battle-field where he fell ,  --  of all that was mortal lying there , but of his soul as having passed up into heaven , perhaps even then beholding her from the celestial sphere . " What answer can I give to those who come after me ? " The question haunted her through the waning days and the lonely nights . What could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little account ! How feeble , forceless , and narrow all her efforts ! What sacrifices had she made ? None . She had lived for herself alone . Was this all of life ? In the silent hours , when all around were hushed in slumber , her longing soul , with far-reaching sight , looked out upon the coming years , and beheld the opening prospect ,  --  a country saved , a nation redeemed , justice and truth triumphant , and Peace , with her white wings , brooding over the land ! This through sacrifice of blood , of strength , of ease and comfort . To withhold the sacrifice was to lose all . To her the coming millions were beckoning as they had beckoned to him . With prayers of consecration she gave herself to the country ,  --  to go wherever duty called , to labor , to endure hardship , and brave scenes which would wring out her heart 's blood ,  --  to face disease and death itself , if need be , to hand down a priceless inheritance to the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have not strength to be a nurse in the hospital , " said her mother , when Azalia told her that she must go and take care of the soldiers . " I can not spare you , my daughter , " said her father , tenderly taking her in his arms , and kissing her ruby lips . She was his only child , and he loved her dearly . " I do n't think it is your duty to go ; and how lonesome the house would be without my darling ! " And so , knowing that it was her duty to do whatever her parents wished , she tried to be content . But the days dragged wearily . She was ever thinking of the soldiers ,  --  thinking through the days and through the nights , till the bright bloom faded from her cheek . Her heart was far away . Her life was incomplete ,  --  she felt that it was running to waste . Her father saw that his flower was fading . At last he said , " Go , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think that Judge Adams ought to let Azalia go into the hospital . It is n't a fit place for girls , " said Miss Dobb , when she heard that Azalia was to be a nurse . But , giving no heed to Miss Dobb , with the blessing of her parents following her , she left her pleasant home , gave up all its ease and comfort , to minister to the sick and wounded , who had fought to save the country . She went to Washington , and thence to the hospitals at Annapolis . It was hard work to stand all day by the side of the sick , bathing their fevered brows , moistening their parched lips , binding up their bleeding wounds . It was painful to look upon the quivering flesh , torn and mangled by cannon-shot . But she learned to bear it all ,  --  to stand calmly by , waiting upon the surgeon while he ran his sharp knife into the live flesh . It was a pleasure to aid him in his work . Her step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch of her hand . There was no light so sweet and pure as that which beamed from her earnest eyes . The sick waited impatiently for her appearance in the morning , watched her footsteps through the day , thanked her for all she did , and said , " God bless you ! " when she bade them good night . Men who were in the habit of uttering fearful oaths wept when she talked with them about their mothers ; she wrote their letters , and read to them the words of affection which came from home . She sang the songs they loved to hear . It was like wine to the weak . The down-hearted took new courage , and those who were well enough to be hobbling about on crutches , who were telling stories of the battles , forgot what they were saying while listening to her voice . Her presence was noonday , her absence night . Once , when through long watching and patient waiting her strength gave way , and the fever raged in her own veins , it was touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and walked noiselessly along the wards , for fear of increasing the pain which racked her aching head ; the sick ones , who missed the touch of her magic hand , and the sweet music of her voice , and the sunlight of her presence , whose fevers were raging because she was absent , when the physician went his rounds in the morning , at noon , and at night , inquired not about themselves , but her . When the fever passed ,  --  when she was well enough to walk through the wards , and hold for a moment the hands which were stretched out on every side ,  --  it was as if her very presence had power to heal . How blessed her work !  --  to give life and strength ; to soothe pain , change sorrow to joy ; to sit beside the dying , and talk of the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world ; to wipe the dampness of death from their brows , listen to their last words , and , when the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut from the pale brow a lock of hair for a fond mother far away , thinking ever of her dying boy . So the months went by ,  --  autumn to winter , winter to spring , and spring to summer . CHAPTER XXII . UNDER THE OLD FLAG . There was no change at Andersonville , but in the loathsome prison it was ever the same terrible scene of starvation , corruption , disease , despair , and death . Every morning those who had died during the night were collected by the prisoners and laid in rows by the prison gate , where , during the day , they were piled upon the dead-cart and borne out to the trenches . There was no hope of relief for the living , and each prisoner looked forward with indifference to his inevitable fate . Above them floated the Rebel flag . They were kept there beneath its folds by Jefferson Davis and General Lee , till thirteen thousand had been starved and murdered . Paul knew that , notwithstanding Uncle Peter 's constant care and nursing , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmly in the face , and so was undisturbed by the prospect . He knew that God , who takes care of the sparrows , would not forget his mother , and he felt that Azalia would sometimes shed a tear when she thought of him . But one morning there was an unusual stir among the prisoners . " You are to be exchanged and sent home , " said the Rebel officers . They had been told the same thing so many times , and had been always so cruelly deceived , that they did not believe the statement till orders were issued for a portion of them to be ready to march to the cars at an appointed hour . Paul was among those who were ordered away . All were ready in an instant , for they had no baggage to pack up , no knapsacks , no equipments , no overcoats ,  --  nothing but the rags upon their bodies . Those who were so weak that they could scarcely creep from place to place rose and stood upon their feet when told that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life sweep over him , thrilling every fibre of his wasted frame . Hope revived . Home ! O the blissful thought ! He rose weak and trembling from his bed on the cold , damp ground , wrapped his rags about him , and , leaning on a cane , supported by Uncle Peter , hobbled out and took his place in the long line of skeletons , and waited with eager eyes to see the gate turn upon its rusty hinges . It was hard to part with Uncle Peter , who had been so kind to him . " God bless you and reward you for all your kindness to me , " said Paul , bidding him good by , and shaking hands for the last time . " I'se sorry to part with ye , Kurnel , but I bless de Lord you is gwine . We 'll meet again one of dese days , whar de Rebs wo n't trouble us , and whar we will be free foreber , " said the old negro , looking up into heaven . He could not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him till the rebellion was crushed , or till the grave opened . The gates turned on their hinges , and the regiment of skeletons in rags took up its march . Such a procession never before was seen on earth . A thousand emaciated forms , tottering , reeling , hobbling on canes and crutches , wending their way to the cars ,  --  not to luxurious cushioned seats , but to hard , jolting cattle-cars ,  --  for a long ride of hundreds of miles before reaching the sea-coast . But hope inspired them . They were breathing fresh air , and were gazing on smiling fields , waving with grain . They were on their way home . The birds cheered them , singing of home . " Going home , going home ! " said the car-wheels , as they passed from rail to rail . In joy and gladness they sang : " I 'm going home , I 'm going home , To die no more , to die no more . " It was as if they had left behind them forever all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no more distress , or pain , or anguish . It was a long , weary , dusty ride . Some died on the way , but hope kept most of them alive . They reached the city of Charleston , passed from the cars to a steamboat , which was to take them down the harbor to the place of exchange . The waters danced joyfully around them , as if greeting them with gladness . The breezes came in from the dark blue ocean and fanned their wasted cheeks . The waves , like a loving mother , gently rocked them and sung a soothing lullaby . But O what joy to behold once more the dear old flag ! How serenely and lovingly it floated in the breeze ! They saluted it with cheers ,  --  shed tears of gratitude ,  --  clasped each other by the hand ,  --  rushed into each other 's arms . Those who were able to stand danced in a delirium of joy ! Paul was too weak to sit up . He could only lie upon the deck , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and say : " Thank God , I have seen it once more ! " Beneath that flag there was joy , peace , comfort , food , clothing , and freedom . Hospital nurses were there with blankets , and great kettles filled with soup and coffee . For the wounded there were bandages ; for the sick there were cordials , wines , and medicines . There were tender-hearted men , ready to relieve all their sufferings . It was like passing from the prison of despair into a paradise of peace and rest , and in joy and gladness they began to sing , " Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord . " The strong men on board of the ship , the nurses , and the stout-hearted sailors wept like children , and spoke hard words against the Rebels when they looked upon the haggard countenances , the hollow cheeks , the sunken eyes , of the skeleton forms around them . Although Paul was so weak that he could hardly lift his hands to his head , although his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bodies , wrapped in hammocks and weighted with shot , cast into the sea , yet he never experienced such bliss , such contentment , as while lying on the deck through the long summer day , looking up to the old flag , and the clear sky , and out upon the calm and peaceful sea , thinking of the sea of glass and the great white throne , and the calmness , sereneness , and rest of heaven . And at night , when lulled to sleep by the rippling waves , how enchanting his dreams of home , of his mother , of the scenes of other days ,  --  the old house , the swallows twittering around its eaves , the roses blooming beneath the window , the night-wind sweeping down the valley , the church-bell ringing the evening hour , its deep tolling when the funeral train passed on to the cemetery in the shady grove ,  --  his friends welcoming him home once more , Azalia among them , queen of the hour , peerless in beauty , with rose bloom on her cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Dare , all saying , " We are glad to see you , "  --  dreaming , and waking , to find it only a dream . But the ship was bearing him on . The distance was lessening . One more day , and the voyage would be at an end , the ship in port . O , if he could but see his mother once more ,  --  feel her hand upon his brow , her kiss upon his lip ,  --  then he could die content ! A desire for life set in . Hope revived . He would fight death as he had fought the Rebels , and , God willing , he would win the victory . CHAPTER XXIII . THE JAWS OF DEATH . The hospital steamer , with its freight of living skeletons , had accomplished its voyage in safety , and lay moored at the wharf in Annapolis . Nurses and sailors were carrying the emaciated forms from the ship to the shore , to the clean and tidy wards of the hospital . It was a sight which wrung tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ship was a charnel-house . Death in its most horrible forms was there ,  --  from starvation , from corruption , scurvy , lock-jaw , gangrene , consumption , and fever . How ghastly the scene ! Men , once robust and strong , weak and helpless as babes , with hollow cheeks , toothless gums , thin pale lips , colorless flesh , sunken eyes , long , tangled hair , uncombed for many months , skeleton fingers with nails like eagles ' claws , lying in rags upon the deck ,  --  some , with strained eyes , looking up for the last time to the dear old flag which waved above them , for which they had fought , for which they had starved , for which they were dying , gazing in rapture on its blessed folds , till their eyes were fixed in death , and the slowly-heaving heart stood still forever ! They , and all their comrades , sleeping on a hundred battle-fields , and mouldering in the trenches at Andersonville , were the victims of Jefferson Davis and General Lee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was work for the gentle-hearted nurses who stood waiting in the hospital wards ,  --  work which required tenderest care ;  --  removing the rags , washing the fevered skeletons , bathing the bleeding wounds where the sharp bones had pierced the skin ; feeding them ,  --  a crumb at a time ; administering cordials drop by drop , to bring back with delicate nursing the receding tides of life . With a bleeding heart , but yet with steady nerves , Azalia passed among them , doing her appointed work . There was one who was lying as if asleep , with his hands clasped upon his breast . His beard had been long uncut . His cheeks were wasted , his eyes sunken , but he had a manly brow . A strange fear and trembling crept over her ,  --  a shuddering of the heart . Alarmed and frightened at she knew not what , she brushed back the matted hair from his temples , and laid her hand upon his brow , cold and damp with the dews of death . The soldier opened his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tried to speak . It was but one word , and that a whisper ,  --  her own name , " Azalia ! " A cry rang through the ward , startling the physicians and the nurses , and waking those who were asleep . She clasped him in her arms , fell upon his face , and kissed his wasted lips . " O Paul ! Can it be that you are here ? " she said . The throbbing of her heart was like the fluttering of a frightened bird . Sweet , calm , and beautiful as the setting sun was the smile upon his face , and in his eyes the celestial light of Peace ! They closed , and he lay again as if in slumber . " They told me that you were dead , " she said . There was no reply ; she laid her hand upon his heart , but could feel no beating there ; touched her fingers to his fleshless wrist , but could find no throbbing of the pulse . The thin blood was receding from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Doctor ! Doctor ! O come quick ! Save him ! " she cried . The doctor came and gazed upon the face of Paul . " He is not quite gone , " he said , then moistened his lips with brandy . There was a quickening of the pulse . " If he rallies from this , we may save him , " he said . They wrapped him in warm flannels , rubbed his fleshless limbs , and gave him cordials , drop by drop . How long the hours ,  --  the weary hours of hope and fear ,  --  of expectation and distress ,  --  while the faltering spirit , as if tired of earth , was but fluttering awhile along the shore of Time before taking its returnless flight over the dark and silent river to another land ! Through the night Azalia sat by his side , watching him with sleepless eyes , fanning his pale brow . The morning sun beamed upon her still sitting there . Those who were accustomed to watch for her appearance in the early morning , restless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and said one to another , " There sits our Angel of Light ! " Through the day she was there , watching the slow heavings of his heart , holding her breath while listening to assure herself that he was still breathing ; hoping and fearing , holding her hands at times upon her own heart to still its wild , tumultuous beating ,  --  giving him atom by atom the needful nourishment ,  --  bending over him to smooth his pillow ,  --  opening the casement for the winds to blow upon his bloodless cheek ,  --  thus snatching him from the very jaws of death and winning him back to life ! CHAPTER XXIV . HOME . A despatch came clicking into the telegraph office in New Hope that Paul Parker was alive ,  --  that he had been a prisoner at Andersonville , was very feeble , but in a fair way to get well , and would soon be at home . It was from Azalia . Mr. Magnet read it in amazement , then ran as fast as he could to carry it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shouted , rushing into the house out of breath , without knocking . " Paul is alive ! Paul is alive ! " " My son alive ! " exclaimed Mrs. Parker , her heart leaping wildly . " Yes ; there is the despatch . " She read it in fear and trembling , her brain in a whirl . She must fly to him ! O if she only had wings ! Paul alive ! The old clock took up the word , " Alive ,  --  alive ,  --  alive , " it said . A robin perched in the great maple sang all day , " He is coming home ,  --  is coming home , " while the swallows from their nests under the eaves looked into the old kitchen through the open door , twittering together , as if saying , " How glad we are ! " Never so bright the sunshine as on that morning , nor so fragrant the flowers ! All nature was glad , and rejoiced in her joy . Mr. Magnet told the news through the village , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his paint-brush , took off his old hat , swung it over his head , and gave three cheers . Through the day he kept saying to himself , " That beats the Dutch ! " The children ran through the streets shouting , " Paul is alive ! Paul is alive ! " Father Surplice , Judge Adams , Colonel Dare , and the neighbors  --  a dozen at a time  --  went down to shake hands with Paul 's mother , making it such a day of gladness as never was known before in New Hope . Impatiently they waited for the day when Paul would be with them again . " We will let him know that we have not forgotten him , " said Colonel Dare ; " but it is little that we can do for one who has suffered so much . " So also said Judge Adams , and Mr. Capias , and all the people . The day came at last . He was on board the train , feeble and weak , but Azalia was by his side , supporting his weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All New Hope was at the depot to receive him , looking with eager eyes down the level track to see the approaching train when it rounded the distant curve . " It is coming ! There it is ! " shouted the boys . They loved him , their dear old teacher . The train stopped , and the conductor came out with Paul leaning on his arm , Azalia following . The people were going to hurrah , but when they saw how poor , pale , and emaciated he was , how thin his cheeks , how hollow and sunken his eyes , how languid and weary , how little there was left of one who once was so manly , they held their breaths , and felt a strange choking in their throats . Blessed the meeting of mother and son ! He had come back from the grave . He was even then almost a corpse , but he was alive ! She had no words to utter ; her joy was silent and deep . She could only clasp him in her arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heaven , with streaming eyes , give silent thanks to God . The people bowed their heads and stood in silent reverence . Colonel Dare came with his carriage . Mr. Chrome took Paul in his arms , and lifted him into it as if he was but a child . The people came one after another and touched his hands . The children brought flowers and laid them in his arms . They all had words of welcome for Azalia . She had saved him . " God bless you , darling ! " said her father , kissing her cheeks , still round and fair , though watching , anxiety , care , and sorrow had robbed them of the bright bloom of other days . " The Lord sent you in the way , as he sent Joseph into Egypt , " said Father Surplice . Deep , tender , and hearty the love of friends ! Daphne came with choicest delicacies . How pleasant to hear her voice ! How cheery her laugh ! Mr. Noggin brought a box of his best honey . Mr. Chrome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pigeons . Even Miss Dobb sent up to know if there was not something that she could get for him . The birds came , the robins and swallows , singing and twittering and brimming over with joy . How enchanting the music which came swelling up the valley from the water by the mill , from the woods beyond the river , from the crickets in the fields , from the church-bell , blending with the night airs , and filling his soul with peace ! But more blessed than everything else on earth was the holy light which beamed upon him from Azalia 's eyes , which went down deep into his soul . " You have always been my angel of light and goodness , and nothing but death shall part us , " he said , as she sat by his side . " I am glad if I have helped you , Paul , " she said , laying her soft hand upon his brow , and kissing his lips . Pure and true the love which had deepened through many years , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then had never been spoken . Like a brook gushing from springs in distant mountains , so , far back in childhood , had been the beginning of their affection , and now it was a river . Day by day his strength returned , the flesh came again upon his wasted limbs , and health bloomed upon his cheeks . Then they walked together in the garden , talking of the dear old times , and looking onward to a future more golden than the sunniest day of all the past . ***
