To ADELAIDE RISTORI DEL GRILLO The Greatest Living Tragdienne This Drama is Dedicated By her Devoted Friend The Author PROLOGUE . For all who out of self an hour can go , Into another 's heart and feel its woe  --  Its burning wounds , its pains , its pangs unknown , Its hopes , its joys , its sorrows make their own  --  Whose spirits , softened in the school of Dole , Feel finest vibratings of a great soul , And all its solemn mysteries solve aright , We lift the curtain of the past to-night . Ye 're here . With simple mien and eyes aglow , And hearts of tempered fire , and souls of snow , I see you there mid beauty 's proud display , Like bright stars seated in the Milky Way . The present and its cares behind you cast , And live this evening in the classic past ! There face to face th ' immortal Lesbian meet , And hear her pulses throb , her great heart beat ; Now softly , joyous as a marriage bell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ken upon her spirit 's stormy sky , Reflections of the true divinity . Ages ere the star of Bethlehem arose , And shook for aye Olympian Jove 's repose . See proud Athen , like the Phoenix rise , And with her brazen temples prop the skies ; Gardens and groves , th ' Acropolis expand , Beneath the wise usurper'sfootnote : 12kb fostering hand ; Survey the Dionysia  --  king and sage , Poet and peasant in its sports engage . High , low , rich , poor , all to one level sunk , Pleasure and wit run mad , a nation drunk . Next , see before Olympian umpires throng The famed disputants for the wreath of song , Each holding in his hand a little scroll . Then hear old Solon 's lofty numbers roll , sop , Alcus , and Stesichorus sing ; Anacron , like the skylark on the wing , His dewy notes upon the mute air fling ; List to Erinna  --  thrill to Sappho 's lyre , As through your bosoms runs its quickening fire ; Follow her to Olympia  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound ; Then like a falling star , thorns in her crown , Into the pitiless Sea of Leucat go down .

Busts of Homer , Apollo , and the Muses in niches . Lyres , harps , and lutes around a table , centre . Enter Erinna , Athis , Unica , Gongyla , Anactoria , and Nasidica , right , with flowers , and take their places at the table . Sappho Sappho ( entering , left , with a branch of myrtle in her hand ) Good morn , dear pupils , each a sweet good morn , And many sweet thanks for these smiles of Flora , Which put to flight unwelcome melancholy , And shrive my heart . Ye have been to the concerts of the birds  --  Sweetest sopranos , tenors , and contraltos  --  Essay to weave their melody in verse For this day 's lesson : Bring me the soul of song in chastest garb , And not a corpse bedecked with gaudy tinsel : Now court the Muses with the poet 's ardour , Whilst I go forth to watch the eagle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at left door . Athis Athis These lessons are not worth the time they kill . Unica Unica My thoughts are not obedient to my will . Gongyla Gongyla Before I came to Sappho 's school my thoughts Ran into poetry as naturally As music flows from lark 's mellifluent throat ; Now with a hesitating step they come , Like curbless coursers to receive the bit . Anactoria Anactoria Song never was and never can be taught . Think'st if Alcus had been Homer 's pupil He could create a second Iliad ? No more than I can write an Odyssey Because I 'm pupil of the Sapphic Muse . Athis Athis If Sappho be a Muse , I am a goddess . Anactoria Anactoria Tenth Muse the poets of the time have styled her . Athis Athis Her gold , and not her genius , bought that title . Before she wed the merchant prince of Andros The critics could not hear the Lesbian 's lyre ; Its golden strings then made such wondrous music , All Greece got drunk on joy , and cried ' Tenth Muse ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song . Athis Athis Alcus is a hoary doting fool , As old men always are when they 're in love . ' T is known when Sappho wedded Cercolas For gold  --  not love  --  Alcus went stark mad , Upset the tables , beat to death his servants , Spurred on his steeds till they fell dead beneath him , And played the devil till her husband left her , And Pittacus , to save her reputation , Sent him to Egypt . Erinna Erinna Silence ! her name is written on the stars In letters that will live as long as they . Athis Athis List to the champion of the Lesbian 's fame ! She pleads her case like lawyer double-fee 'd . All Mitylene swear that Sappho 's mad : What good can rumour of a woman say Who writes more love-songs than Anacron ; Spends half her nights in babbling with the stars , And gives the other half to clamorous lovers ? Erinna Erinna I 'll hear no more against our noble Sappho , Who is as chaste as Dian  --  great as Homer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knows no more than I : She writes no better poetry than I ; Yet , yesterday , she cut and slashed my poem Until beginning had it none , nor ending . nasidica Nasidica So slashed she mine . Unica Unica She tore mine into pieces . Gongyla Gongyla She struck mine out with one dash of her pen . Anactoria Anactoria A day agone I wrote an ode to Love The which she ground to powder twixt her fingers . Athis Athis She is an envious pedagogue . I hate her . Erinna Erinna ( rising ) Silence , ungrateful maids ! Poor half-fledged bardlings , Whose lyres will ne'er be heard in Fame 's proud temple . Posterity will only know you as The pupils Lesbian Sappho loved and taught . Doth she not shelter , feed you , teach you gratis ? Toil like a slave to purge your minds of darkness , And fill them with th ' eternal light of Zeus ? Great , high-souled Sappho ! envied , slandered , and Misunderstood by those who ought to know Thee best , and prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a reverential love That I can only feel for one who wears The mantle of Divinity . Sappho Sappho ( rushing forward ) Erinna , guardian angel of my fame , I honour , love thee for thy sense of justice ! To her pupils . My generous pupils , I will not detain you , Retire , and bring me each an ode on slander . Exeunt pupils . Erinna , let me weep upon thy bosom : I heard that colocution  --  let it pass . It cut into my soul  --  but let it pass ; It is the price of fame . I have stood face to face with Death  --  but Slander , Ingratitude , are foes more terrible : Death strikes and leaves us conscious of no ill  --  They deeper stab , and stab , but do not kill . Sobs . Erinna Erinna Sappho , Apollo 's darling , do not weep , An army of such babblers could not harm thee . Sappho Sappho Erinna , purest , best Erinna , I Am not impervious to the beggar 's frown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the higher harmonies of being , The sting of Zeus 's smallest , creeping thing Can shake my soul into its very centre . Erinna Erinna Methought the poet 's world revolved so far Above this world he heard nor felt its motion . Sappho Sappho The poet fills the largest human orbit . As is the ocean to the streams that form it , So is the poet to his fellow-kind  --  His nature holds a myriad of smaller beings . Was not old Homer mightier far than Troy , And all the Grecian hosts that girt her round ? Combined , they could not lift the grand old bard , But in his mighty mind he took them up And , battling , set them on the heights of Fame For centuries unborn to gaze upon . Erinna Erinna What is this power that overreaches Jove 's ? Sappho Sappho Poetry is the lightning of great souls , Which Jove-appointed poets chain in words And set unto the music of the spheres . Erinna Erinna Then is the Lesbian happy  --  Sappho Sappho O Erinna ! Erinna Erinna What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jove 's chosen chainer of immortal fires ? Sappho Sappho Food for my famished heart  --  undying love . Erinna Erinna Thou art Apollo 's darling  --  heiress of Jove . Sappho Sappho Alas ! I starve upon such pabulum . Erinna Erinna Hellas adores thee . Sappho Sappho That is adoration Which stimulates , but does not satisfy . Erinna Erinna Erinna loves thee  --  is not this enough ? Sappho Sappho Sweet , artless child ! Thy love to Sappho 's heart Comes like the perfume of a vernal flower  --  It soothes and calms , but does not nourish it . Erinna Erinna Alcus loves the Lesbian more than life . Sappho Sappho Alcus doth not understand love 's meaning Within my heart 's interpretation of it . A pretty face , a soft bewitching smile . A fairy hand bewilder him an hour , Then lie upon his memory like dead perfume : I seek a deep and all-abiding love , That could not see a hump upon my back Though it were large as Atlas : love whose eyes Would vest me with the charms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; A love whose fires shall burn as wild as tna 's ; A love whose light shall warm and thrill like Sol 's ; A love whose power shall hold my soul at anchor , And leave me nought in heaven or earth to crave . Erinna Erinna Such love is but for gods . Sappho Sappho Such is for mortals . Last night I dreamed I sat beside the sea Gazing upon the full round moon above me , When twixt me and her face a youth appeared With form and features radiant as a god 's . His golden hair , luxuriant as a woman 's , Flowed backward from his Adonan brow , And from the liquid azure of his eyes Flashed fires that burned into my soul . Approaching , With matchless grace he dropped upon his knee , And in a voice that was all music , said  --  ' Immortal Sappho ! at thy feet I lay The adoration that thy songs inspire . To Athens come , and I will be thy slave . ' My future 's interwoven with that youth  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To-day from Athens I await Alcsus , Who shall depeint me all the Athenian youths  --  What if he prove the young Anacron With whom I am already half in love ? Erinna Erinna The youth is but the phantom of thy dream . Sappho Sappho When Reason nods the spirit oft steals forth To try its pinions on the soul 's highways : This was some mighty soul of fire unsphered , That in its meteor flight flashed on my vision . Erinna Erinna Thou wert asleep , and therefore couldst not see it . Sappho Sappho My spirit from its prison-house had stolen In quest of larger spheres of thought and feeling . Erinna Erinna Dost thou believe the soul can leave its temple Ere that Jove send revokeless summons for it ? Sappho Sappho High , restless souls that long to look beyond Narrow horizons of their bounded visions , Will from their tabernacles find egress , And , spanning space , confront omniscient Jove . Erinna Erinna Dost think the spirits of the dead return ? Sappho Sappho The air , from heaven to earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erinna Erinna Where ? I nothing see ! Sappho Sappho As the blind see not the visitants who come To minister unto their needs , but through The ear take in the finest shades of meaning , Through , sense auricular we viewless hold Communion with the spirits of the air  --  O father ! Mother ! Child ! I hear your pinions , And feel your love descend into my heart As dew into the parched lips of the flower ! Erinna Erinna I nothing hear , and fear that thou art mad . Sappho Sappho If this be madness , then is madness bliss , Jove 's wisest disposition of our wits When Fate hath driven our bark upon the quicksands , And all our household gods are lost . Erinna ! If I could put a tongue into my woes , And make them speak , they 'd break thy gentle heart ; If I could turn thine eyes into this bosom , And make them see the wreck and ruin there  --  The lonely wastes , the herbless tracts of sorrow , The desolation wrought by ruthless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hell  --  Thy life would flow away in piteous tears . But for one star to me this world were starless  --  Falls on her knees and points to an aureola . Behold ! ' T is Peace descending in my heart ! My soul , wide-lipped , imbibes its holy light  --  It is the star that will eclipse the night ! Rhodope Rhodope ( entering ) Sapphie , Alcus is arrived  --  Sappho Sappho ( rising ) Alcus ! Rhodope Rhodope Ay , ay , Alcsus , smiling like a boy ; Methinks at sight of thee he 'll die of joy . Dusty , and travel-worn right from the sea , Like prisoned bird uncaged , he flew to thee . Sappho Sappho Swift let the dear old eagle perch before me . Exit Rhodope . How much I 've suffered since I saw Alcus ! How many sorrows and misfortunes known Since Pittacus thrust half the earth betwixt us ! Enter Alcus . She flies into his arms . Alcus ! dearest ! Alcus Alcus My divinity ! My star amid the storm on land and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is this the Lesbian I hold against my wildly beating heart ? Or some fair phantom of a cruel dream ? Let me look in thy face  --  thy love-lit eyes . And taste the rosy nectar of thy lips . It is indeed my Muse !  --  sun , moon , and stars Put out your lamps ! Her smile illumes the world . Erinna ! How thou'st grown since last I saw thee ? Sappho Sappho ( sobbing ) In thy long absence she has been my friend  --  My sweet condoler in the vale of tears . Alcus Alcus The gods propitious to Erinna be ! Sappho Sappho Now on sweet restful couch recline , Alcus , And glad my ears with wildest tales of travel ; Depeint old Nile , and Egypt 's dusky daughters  --  Sicily , Athens , and the Athenian court  --  My soul 's athirst for something new and strange . Alcus Alcus ( reclining ) Thou dost ask much of one so travel-weary . Sappho Sappho Erinna , dearest , order wine and fruit . Exit Erinna . A little wine will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as nimble as of yore . Alcus Alcus The sweetest wine that Hebe ever poured To please the palates of Olympian gods Would equal not the nectar of thy presence  --  The balmy , breathing incense of thy smile  --  The inebriating music of thy voice . I only ask to sit , and look at thee , And dream of love  --  and love 's divinity Till envy , wrong , dissension , strife depart , And leave the sweet millennium of the heart . O violet-crowned , pure , sweetly-smiling maid ! The glory of the lyre ! by Jove arrayed In all that fascinates , allures , inspires , Fling not back on my heart its deathless fires That shut up in my bosom through long years , Like tna 's flames , have fed and throve on tears ; But unto me thy priceless heart-wealth give , And in thy hallowed presence let me live , The happiest man that Hymen ever knew , Or sweet food from the shrine of Venus drew ! Re-enter Erinna , followed by a Slave with wine and fruit . Sappho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alcus , drink . Alcus Alcus ( drinking ) May Venus to the Lesbian be propitious , And twine her second nuptial knot with myrtle ! Sappho Sappho ( drinking ) Upon Alcus may the goddess smile , And strew his path with Hymen 's sweetest flowers ! Now , for old Nile . Alcus Alcus With Egypt I was charmed  --  With Isis and Osiris all enchanted . Half way to Heaven I scaled the Pyramids , And from the pinnacles of demigods Surveyed the wonders of Sesostris ' Land . Beneath me gazed upon the horrid Sphynx  --  Fell shaper of the fate of Oedipus  --  But Theba , with her hundred brazen gates , And troops of black-eyed beauties took me captive ; And had my heart been free from Sapphic spell , With Theba I had been content to dwell . Sappho Sappho Enough of Egypt 's sirens . Paint the tempest That cast thee on the coast of Sicily  --  I like the grandeur of a storm at sea . Alcus Alcus With , prosperous sail and hearts elate with joy , We fast were making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thunder ; Wrapt the blue heaven in intermittent flame , And rocked the ocean like an infant-cradle ; Shook from the yards the pallid mariners , And swept away the mizzen like a straw . A little while the staunch ship braved the tempest , Parried its blows like skilful duellist , Then , staggered , reared , and pitched , like frighted steed , Rolled on her beam-ends , like a vanquished wrestler , And , with a wail that startled hell , went down . Sappho Sappho O wondrous picture ! Living , breathing , speaking , Loud as the seahounds howled above her grave !  --  I 'd barter half the sweetest life to see The death of such a ship in such a sea  --  To fight a duel with such enemy , ' T would woof my song with realistic beams  --  Nerve , sinew , daring , never born of dreams . Why is old Homer greatest of all poets ? Because he mingled in the battle 's din , And trod the sheaf-strown harvest-fields of Death ; Measured the statures of full-blooded passions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell  --  Go on , Alcus , Pegasus I 've tied . Alcus Alcus Upon a spar , at last , I reached the shore , And found me in the palace of Phalaris , Who , though a savage , proved a sovereign friend : Fed me and clothed me ; watched my fevered couch ; And when the gods restored to me sweet health , Showed me his bull wherein he roasts his victims , Read me his letters , models of high art , Led me up loftiest towers at eve to view Mad tna vomit fire : And with true princely hospitality , Sent me to Athens in his royal galley . Sappho Sappho Go on ; I 'm hungry for Athenian news . Discourse of Athens and Pisistratus , And all the handsome gallants at his court . Alcus Alcus Athens is growing ' neath the Tyrant 's hand : Gardens he 's built beyond th ' Acropolis Wherein the youths of Athens fence and wrestle ; A temple to Olympian Jove commenced ; One to Apollo ; one to Dionysus ; A library collected ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to light . Sappho Sappho The gods protect the Poet 's royal friend ! Alcus Alcus The Tyrant is beset by many foes : Old Solon and his laws he has adopted , But old Megacles is his enemy , Because he will not share his daughter 's couch , And rear up kings from that accursed stock : Anon he 'll join the party of Lycurgus , And hurl the Tyrant from th ' Athenian throne . Sappho Sappho Now , let us have a portrait of the man . Alcus Alcus Pisistratus is neither tall nor short , Heavy nor lithesome , handsome , nor ill-favoured , But full broad-browed , broad-chested , like a Spartan , And looks the warrior twice more than the king . Sappho Sappho A portrait capitally drawn . Go on , Old bard . Alcus Alcus The tyrant is ambitious To make his court the cynosure of Greece , And in his diadem of glory set The brightest stars of art and poetry . Now , dwelling at his court are painters , poets ; The young Anacron  --  Sappho Sappho Anacron ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crook 'd hunched , Azure-eyed , golden-haired , Apollo-like ? Alcus Alcus He 's straight when he 's not drunk , which being often , He 's often crook 'd . His hair and eyes are dusky ; His nose large , pugged , and winey  --  Sappho Sappho Draw the others . Alcus Alcus Stesichorus is handsome , tall , and stately ; Theognis hoary ; sop short and hunched ; Solon stout ; Thespis withered ; Ibycus Young , nectar-lipped ; Minerams Adonan . Sappho Sappho Go on ! I 'm dying ! Alcus Alcus Agrigentum 's stern , Stoic , and savage-looking as his deeds . Hath a high brow , lantern jaws , hooked nose , wide mouth , Teeth long , thick , yellow , like a cannibal 's , And always has his bull upon his lips . Sappho Sappho ( aside to Erinna ) My phantom 's not among the portraitures . Alcus Alcus But I forget Pisistratus ' commands . I am the bearer of his royal summons For Sappho to attend the Dionysia , And with the bards of Greece contest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Alcus Alcus His royal galley waits thee in the bay ; Eolus willing , we 'll depart to-day . Sappho Sappho Now am I happy ! Now will see Athen ! The Court , Pisistratus , Theognis , Solon , Stesichorus , the famed Anacron , And with , them at the games contest the laurel  --  What if I win it , dear Alcus , what ? Alcus Alcus Why , kneeling in the temple of Olympia , The umpire on thy brow shall set the crown Of glory , and amid the acclamations Of Greece assembled I will lead thee forth . Sappho Sappho Erinna must go too . Alcus Alcus And so she shall . Sappho Sappho O gods ! receive my thanks , and bless Alcus For this most unexpected happiness ! Erinna , sweetest , hasten to Charaxus , And warn him to come hither for leave-taking : Apprise my pupils of my swift departure , And bid my slaves be ready at the tide To follow me to Athens in my galley : Then , tell my soothsayer I 'd speak with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . You know Charaxus , youngest of our house , And of my brothers dearest to my heart : With one Doricha , an Egyptian slave , Whom recently he purchased on the Nile , He is in love , and wills , I fear , to wed : Dissuade him from an act so blemishing . Alcus Alcus I 'd try to swim old Styx if Sappho bade it ; But if Charaxus will to wed Doricha , Olympian Jove can not avert the act . I know the fatal spell of her dark beauty Upon man 's heart : within her coil she 's held Half royal Egypt . Love will brook no curb , Else had I put it on him long ago . I 'm not Alcus  --  I am Sappho , or A thing so chained to her I seem the same . My slumbering lyre wakes only to her bidding ; My heart , my pulse beat not for me , but her ; ' T is not my soul that holds this house of clay , But hers that rules it with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in battle ; Long years of exile ; rovings in strange lands O'er pathless seas , confronting death and dangers , Were streams wherein I sought to slake the fires That , gnawing burned into my heart of heart ; But time , tide , ocean failed to quench the flame : If to the stars I looked , there were thine eyes : If on the flowers I gazed , there were thy smiles : If in my heart I turned my tearful glance , There was thine image sitting at the altar . O glorious Sappho ! matchless Muse divine ! Now end my sorrows at the nuptial shrine ! Sappho Sappho Alcus , dear , my fathers friend , and mine , Without thy smile the world would lampless be  --  Alcus Alcus Then thou dost love me ? Oh ! at last , at last , I 've won the prize of Greece . The youngest Muse , Apollo 's darling , heiress of Olympus . Oh ! let me kneel to thee : let me adore thee , My light , my life , my soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love thee , ' and my heart Shall set it to the music of thy voice , And sing it in the concerts of the angels . Sappho Sappho I love thee best of mortals . Alcus Alcus O ye gods , Let me not die of joy upon joy 's brink ! And thou wilt wed me ? Sappho Sappho If I ever wed Again , my father 's friend shall be my bridegroom . Alcus Alcus Omnipotent ruler of both heaven and earth , At last thou'st heard and answered my sole prayer . Accept my thanks and boundless gratitude For this thy greatest and most precious gift . Sappho Sappho Alcus , good Alcus , bear with me : Be patient with my foibles and my fancies : I am a wayward child  --  ill understood Of men , and oft a stranger to myself ; But , wherewithal , endowed with love of justice And duty , Jove alone can comprehend . I would not wrong thee for the wealth of Croesus , Nor trifle with thy great heart 's noble passion ; But , urge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so heavy in my younger days ; So galling wore into my soul 's fine quick , I fear I could not wear it with meet grace Ere friendly Time have medicined its wounds : Meantime , let me lean on thy generous love , And look up to thee as my demigod . I am so lonely in this world of woe ; So many faithless reeds have broke beneath me , That I could worship one firm , faultless staff . Alcus Alcus I will not urge thee to the nuptial altar : I have thy promise , and will wait thy time . Lean on my love , mine honour , all thy weight . It would be light , though fifty times as great . Henceofrth , on land or sea , whate'er the weather , The desert of this life we 'll walk together . Exit . Sappho Sappho ( kneeling ) Hear me , almighty Jove ! This is a moment Upon whose dizzy pinnacle I tremble , And heavenward stretch my suppliant hands to thee ! Steady my footsteps , and around me fling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new-trimmed lamps of wisdom That I may see the dangers lurking there , And how to walk in harmony with thee ! Thrust thy strong arm ' twixt me and secret foes  --  Envy and hate , and all their horrid brood , That at each upward step , like hungry wolves , Bound from their hiding-places to devour And tear in shreds the bold and daring climber ! Sooth . Soothsayer ( entering ) Lady , I 'm here in answer to thy bidding . Sappho Sappho Dost thou foresee the end of all these things ? Sooth . Soothsayer With these old time-dimmed eyes I nothing see ; But to my spirit 's vision all is clear . Aside . Would that I could not see , or she were wise ! Sappho Sappho Why then , old seer , dost hesitate ? Go on ! Sooth . Soothsayer At the Athenian court awaits thee homage Such as the Queen of Sheba ne'er received .

Was beauty e'er a slave ? She had her birth in heaven , and is as free To shed her quickening light abroad as Sol . My heart was dead until Doricha smiled On it ; then , as the Phoenix from its ashes , It leaped up , quivering with eternal life .

Charaxus Charaxus Doricha 's more to me than worlds of Sapphos ! Sappho Sappho ( to her pupils ) Doubtless ye bring me each a noble poem . Pupils Pupils We could not write upon the theme you gave us . Sappho Sappho ' T is strange ! You talked exceeding well upon it ! With good Alcus I depart to-day , In answer to a summons from Pisistratus To tend the Dionysia at Olympia , And with the bards of Greece contest the laurel .

Of poesy I little more can say : Who hath within his soul most poetry Is highest , greatest , nearest unto Jove ; And who hath none is an oblivious being , Not worth a place in Nature 's harmony .

Swift from thy myrtle-wreathd throne descend , And medicine a heart diseased , Dying of famine in the sight of plenty .

The greatest kings and queens , profoundest sages The world has known , have never worn the laurel . Not all the titles potentates confer ; Not all the gold that gilds the fields of Ophir ; Not all the treasures of the earth could buy it . It is reserved for the elect of Jove , The highest gift on mortals he bestows For highest virtues , linked with highest works . Who win th ' immortal wreath must banish pleasure ; Turn from the pathways of seductive ease : Gird up their loins to battle with the Gorgons ; Ascend Parnassus over fiery thorns , Mid galling showers of Envy 's barbd darts , And break their souls upon the Olympian lyre .

Phaon Phaon Then art thou mine , by all th ' Olympian gods ! The myrtle , Hymen 's holiest emblem there Shall seal , and sanctify my love , unfathomed , Unfathomable as eternity ! To-morrow , dost thou say , immortal Muse ? Sappho Sappho I dare not look to-morrow in the face , So big to-morrow is with destiny . Phaon Phaon To-morrow holds eternity of bliss  --  To-morrow ? Sappho Sappho At Olympia to-morrow . Exeunt Phaon by garden . Sappho by door Alcus Alcus ( staggering forward ) Where am I ? Whence this sable pall , Whose inky folds around me fall , Shutting the day-god from my sight ? Just now the world was full of light , And now to me ' t is starless night . What have I done , ye gods ! Oh , say ! That ye should shut from me the day , And from my life its beacon bright ? Just now the world was full of light , And now to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth like the blind , And only empty darkness find  --  Sun , moon , and stars have taken their flight  --  Just now the world was full of light , And now to me ' t is starless night . Must I thus grope along the stream Of life without a beacon-beam To guide my lonely steps aright ? Just now the world was full of light , And now to me ' t is starless night . Pitying , O Jove ! take me from earth ; Allay this bosom 's gnawing dearth ; Translate to heaven my beacon bright : Just now the world was full of light , And now to me ' t is starless night . Falls on his knees , and hides his face in his hands . Sappho re-enters , and lays her hands softly on his brow . He springs up with a shudder . Basilisk , off ! Thy touch , though soft as love 's , Is venomous as the aspic 's sting ! From thee The mantle of divinity hath fallen . And left thee standing in polution 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quake . Sappho Sappho Alcus ! for the love of sacred things Let not thy tongue unsheathe heart-slaying daggers . Alcus Alcus Heart ! Thine is food for carrion birds ; I saw an unfledged buzzard pecking on it ! There is no Sappho now ; Her funeral knell is ringing in my heart . Sappho Sappho Alcus , my dead father 's friend and mine , Forgive , and be forgiven . I have lost The helm of reason . Passion 's turbulent sea Tosses my helpless life-bark towards Charybdis : Help me to steer it wide of Scylla 's hounds , And moor it in the haven of thy love ! In Phaon 's glance there is a sorcerer 's spell , That holds and draws me like a serpent 's charm ; An tna in his touch whose red-lipped lavas Sow in my blood delicious agonies Of death . Alcus Alcus I 'll kill him ! Sappho Sappho No , that would kill me , His life 's my life  --  his death sure death to me . Alcus Alcus O jealous , damnd Venus , that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the garden , love , and let sweet zephyr Fan thy hot brow . Come , lean on me as erst ; The reed shall break beneath thee never more . Exeunt by garden . SCENE V. Olympia . Interior of the Temple of Zeus . A statue of Zeus on the altar . An estrade , centre . A great crowd of people enter , and fill up the background . Royal trains enter , and take up their p'aces . Pisistratus , Phalaris , Princes , and Umpires enter to seats on estrade . The poets to places , left . Sappho , attired in white skirt and purple mantle , trimmed with gold , and her arms and ankles twined with laurel , enters with Erinna , right . Umpire An umpire ( rising ) With meet respect and honour for these poets , Who bravely have contended for the prize , To Lesbian Sappho we award the laurel , Sappho , approach . She kneels on first step of estrade . In presence of the gods , Poets and kings , and Greece assembled here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muse ! Sappho Sappho ( rising ) To these wise umpires and assembled Greece Be all my thanks . People People Speak on , thy voice is music Sweeter than ever rapt Olympian ears . Sappho Sappho I am a poet , not an orator . People People The poet 's both . His words are fire ; his songs The beacons burning on the heights of time . Sappho Sappho Came Sappho hither on the wings of ease ? Cheered by the smiles of older , stronger climbers ? Were there who , pitying , gave a hand to help Her up the treacherous steeps ? Were there who paused To list her cries , and to her aid descend When footholds failed , and reeds beneath her broke ? Look down the thorny path up which she clomb All crimson with the blood of her scarred feet , And learn at what a price she wears the laurel . People People Thy future way with diamonds shall be paved . Sappho Sappho Few are the gems that strew the poet 's path ; Few are the cups of bliss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however great their worth , Or broad be their possessions on the earth , Are martyrs to their mission , heirs of wrong , Sad immolations on the shrine of song . Their natal orbits lie as far above The paths of common souls as realms of Jove ; They walk with men but are not of mankind ; They hold discourse with worlds to which they 're blind , And with rapt visions gaze beyond the skies , While on the things of earth men keep their eyes . Phaon dashes through the parting crowd , and thrusts a myrtle crown in Sappho 's hand just as Alcus and the other poets approach with theirs . ALCUS springs at him with vengeance in his eye ; then starts back , flings away his myrtle crown , and rushes out , crying . No , no ! I will not be a murderer ! Phaon leads her out amid the applause of the multitude . The Curtain . ACT III . SCENE I. Athens . A hall in Sappho 's palace . Slaves docorating it with laurel . Clitus wreathing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garland at a table near him . Clitus Clitus ( aside ) Now all is ready for the Queen of Song , And her young husband , Phaon . Poor Alcus ! Illusions football , Cupid 's shuttlecock ! Kicked here , knocked there , and twice drove to the wall . Since her tenth year he has adored the Muse , And now she 's six-and-thirty , he quite fifty . When Sappho wed the merchant prince of Andros The hard went mad as Agamemnon 's son , And rested not until he bred a rupture In Hymen 's realm . He 'll kick at heaven again . I 'll do my best to match him with Erinna : Though she have less than half his years , her love Will prove an anchor to his drifting life-bark , And keep his soul from leaping overboard ; Rhodope , what art doing there so long ? Rhodope Rhodope Weaving a garland for my little Sapphie . Clitus Clitus Go , get the dancers ready . Tell Cleon To look her prettiest : she 's to play the Hebe , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her garb . Let there be nothing in it That can impede the poetry of motion : Let fleecy skirts just dally with her knees , And silken gaiters case her twinkling feet : Down to her slender waist , as free as air , Let fall the clusters of her raven hair , And in the sable threads weave amber roses ; But not another ornament or gem ; Youth , unadorned , is beauty 's diadem . Exit Rhodope . A slave A slave Where wilt thou seat the kings and poets ? Clitus Clitus Nowhere : We 'll have no kings and poets here to-night , Except Alcus and Erinna who , In fee , are chattels of the Sapphic Muse . This festival is ours . It is our right To fte our mistress on her nuptial night . Hark ye ! swift chariot-wheels straight from Olympia . Looks out . Ho ! they come ! summon the dancers . Quick ! they come ! Looks out again . How beautifully looks the Queen of Song ! With what majestic grace she wears the laurel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But for that dough-faced shepherd at her side , She 'd be Astarte and Diana twined By the immortal laurel . But down from The summit of Olympus she has stooped To lift an idiot to the poet 's height . There , ashen-lipped as death , Alcus comes , Leading Erinna . Poor old jilted bard , I pity him ! Enter a crowd of slaves with flowers and brandies of laurel , preceded by Cleon , whom he turns to regard . Oh ! she is lovely as wine-pouring Hebe ! Pray Jove she may not captivate the bridegroom , And set her tiny foot on Sappho 's heart ! She 's dark , he 's light , and opposites attract . Looks out again . Ho ! here they come ! down on your knees and make A floral carpet for the Muse 's feet ! Slaves kneel and lay their flowers on the ground . At first sight of Phaon , Cleon faints in the arms of a slave . Clitus and other slaves cheer and cry , ' Welcome Muse ! welcome adored mistress ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads Erinna to seats forward . Cleon fetches wine to Sappho and Phaon , Alcus and Erinna . Sappho Sappho ( rising ) Kind friends , I thank you for this generous greeting And lavish overflowing of your hearts . These decorations , interwove with smiles Brighter than Sol 's , bespeak your sweet contentment With this young master I 've imposed upon you ; Love only can repay the debt of love . Count on my heart for twice what ye 've invested . Slaves Slaves We only seek the Muse 's happiness ! Sappho Sappho After long weary years of toiling , climbing Up thorny steeps mid envy 's barbd arrows , To-day I reached the summit of Olympus , And on my brow received the laurel-crown . Slaves Slaves Thy brow is worthy of th ' immortal laurel ! Sappho Sappho ( holding up the myrtle-crown ) Help me to twine with it this myrtle-wreath In deathless union . Slaves Slaves Oh ! we will ! we will ! They twine the myrtle-wreath with her laurel crown Sappho Sappho Cleon , dearest , where 's thy greeting kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cleon , glancing timidly at Phaon , comes forward and kisses her . Thou art as fresh as spring , as summer sweet , Now let us list the music of thy feet . As Cleon floats through the dance , Phaon follows her with loving eyes , and flings her roses from Sappho 's bouquet , which the Muse pleasantly resents . Pisistratus , Phalaris , and the Poets enter disguised , and mingle among the dancers . All exeunt but Alcus and Erinna . Alcus Alcus Erinna , did'st thou mark that brainless shepherd Follow Cleone with enamoured eyes , And fling her roses mid the dizzy dance ? Already he is smit , and Sappho jealous . Ill-fated Muse ! deluded Queen of Song My fallen angel ! my lost star ! my death ! Gazes on a fixed point . Oh ! horrid , horrid , damnd thing , that dost Appal my soul and prompt it to take flight From this ungenial and tempestuous sphere ! Oh ! oh ! oh ! it is hideous and brain-splitting , Erinna ! Erinna Erinna What , Alcus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusion 's mantle Affrights me , and I will have done with it ! Erinna Erinna ( grasping his dagger ) Aleus ! madman ! stay thine impious hand : Self-murder is the action of a coward ; Calm durance of life 's ills true bravery ; Gird up thy soul to battle with the Fates , Conquer by moral arms , not murderous steel . Come forth , and let the stars restore thy senses ; I do compassionate thy wondrous woe , And with my blood would bathe thy burning wounds , If blood , could heal the rents of Cupid 's darts . Alcus Alcus Angelic girl ! would there were more like thee . Take me , my life is thine , since thou did'st save it . Exeunt . SCENE II . The garden of Sappho 's palace . A parterre of flowers and shrubs , centre . Enter Cleon , right , plucks some flowers , and sings in a low voice ; Phaon follows , and pauses a little behind her . Alcus enters and stands behind a myrtle , watching them . Cleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My bosom knew no sigh ; There Sappho told me tales , And sang me lullaby ; But here no loving word , No smiles illume my breast , And like an unfledged bird Hurled from , its happy nest , In the folds of some dear bosom Nestling , I 'd hush my woes , As bee within the blossom Folds its wings in soft repose . Phaon Phaon ( aside ) And in this bosom thou shalt fold thy wings , Sweet , homeless dove Cleon Cleon ( looking up ) Methought I heard a voice ! ' T was only some enamoured bird love-prating . Sings . Were I a bird his cooing I 'd list with heart elate , Leave him not long a-wooing , But be at once his mate : With him soar on the ether Into the eye of day . Or , nestling ' mong the heather , Bill and coo with him for aye . Phaon Phaon ( aside ) How beautiful is love when first awaking Within a young maid 's breast ? How potent and How wonderful its spell upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lesbos Sappho loved me , My bosom filled with blisses , A gentle mother proved me , Here Phaon only kisses . From morn to even she Enchains him with caresses Or , smiling lovingly , Plays with his golden tresses . I gaze ; they see not me , Hear not my heart 's wild throbbing , And swift as dart I flee , Lest they should hear me sobbing . Weeps . Why should I weep and pine , The gods our hearts dissever ! Alas ! he should be mine ! Our hearts be one for ever ! Phaon Phaon ( darting forward ) And by the gods , they shall be one for ever ! Cleon Cleon I am her slave ! She 'll kill me ! oh , she 'll kill me ! Phaon Phaon Fear not , sweet trembling dove ; she shall not touch thee . Cleon Cleon Thou'rt Sappho 's husband , I her little slave . Phaon Phaon ( opening his arms ) Come to this bosom , and thou shalt be free . She flies into his arms and hides her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the flowers , regards them , and disappears . Sappho , radiant with smiles , enters , left , plucks some flowers , and kisses them . Sappho Sappho Ye are the smiles that angels leave behind them When they have ended their nocturnal vigils . Sweet benedictions to the loved bequeathed By unseen guardians from her earthly weal . Walks about , caressing the flowers , and contemplating the scene with ecstacy . How bright the god of day ! How fair the morn ! And jubilant the nuptial choirs of nature ; The very air is drunk on marriage-music . O love ! O joy ! O sweet connubial bliss ! O happiness ! for which Jove hath no name ! My heart hath found such thrift in your pure light ; My soul attained to such full , lofty stature ; My thoughts so deep , so high , so broad have grown , And drawn around them such unearthly beauty ; My head seems circled by celestial spheres , And in arial paths my feet are treading . The serpent lifts half its length above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her face . With a shriek she starts back , and falls . Cleon darts away , and Phaon flies to her , followed by Alcus , unperceived . Phaon Pha on ( raising her from the ground ) Sappho ! What evil hath befallen thee ? Sappho Sappho Is it gone ? is it gone ? Phaon Phaon What , dearest , what ? Sappho Sappho That serpent ! Phaon Phaon Serpent ! Sappho Sappho Ay , a serpent ! Phaon Phaon Where ? SAPPHO Sappho There from those flowers a serpent , long and black , And with Satanic triumph in its eyes , Stretched forth its sable length with tongue extant , And hissed into my face as but the devil , Or his most perfect tutored imp could hiss . I was so happy  --  lost in such sweet dream Of nuptial bliss ; it seemed that heaven was pouring Into my soul all her divine elixir . O Phaon ! Phaon ! keep guard on thy heart ! Be true  --  be faithful to thy nuptial vow . This serpent is the devil who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phaon Phaon ( with a , forced laugh ) O Lesbian Sappho ! thou a poet art , And to this serpent dost apply thine art ; Investst him with the majesty of devil Sappho Sappho ( mournfully ) Phaon , dost love me now as at Olympia ? Phaon Phaon Ay , more ; but why dost question thus thy Phaon ? Sappho Sappho All things have their ascent and their descent ; And , therefore , have their culminating points Whereon they poise , and tremble in their fulness . At morn the sun casts forth a temperate glance ; At noon he burns ; at even languishes . ' T is thus with love : its morn is temperate ; Its noon is fire ; its evening ashes . Phaon Phaon Beautiful . Sappho Sappho A month agone thy love was in its zenith . Dost wonder if I fear it 's crossed the line ? Phaon Phaon When thou dost hear what gauntlets Phaon ran To reach Olympia at the crowning moment , And proffer thee the first the myrtle-wreath , Thou'lt swear his love can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my courser , I found my portal double-barred against me . I cried for help  --  none dared to heed my cries . Lashed by the Furies to a Hercules , I flung my soul against the yielding door , Flew to the royal stables , slew the groom , Led forth the prancing courser , mounted him , And sunk my spurs into his quivering flanks . The way half won , a visored cavalier , Wearing upon his arm a myrtle crown , Upon a flying charger overtook me , And , lifeless , struck my steed from under me . I rose , unhorsed my foe , sprang in his saddle , And . with the speed of lightning , gained Olympia . It was the emissary of the Tyrant  --  Sappho Sappho Pisistratus ! Forgive ! ' T was not a doubt Of thee that crossed my Eden , but doubt 's shadow  --  ' T is gone , and all love 's heaven , is bright again . Phaon , dear Phaon , if I sometimes seem Like one smote by the plague of jealousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it , As Sol upon the crazy cloud that beards him I love thee with such strength , such fine perception Of all the subtle meanings of love 's language . Lay my soul 's ear so close up to thy soul ; I hear the footsteps of thy thoughts ere born . Phaon Phaon ( startled ) Art thou magician , too , as well as poet ? Sappho Sappho As oracles unlock the book of Fate , And bare her sealed intents to mortal eyes ; So doth the poet oft unclasp man 's heart , And drag its inmost secrets to the light . Phaon Phaon The poet 's powers above Olympus soar  --  I swear to love the Lesbian evermore . Exeunt , lovingly . Alcus Alcus Perfidious liar ! Sweet , smooth-tongued serpent ! he Just swore to love her slave eternally . Exit . SCENE III . A cabinet in the palace of Pisistratus . Enter Pisistratus and Confio . Pisistratus Pisistratus When wert thou last at Sappho 's ? Confio Confio Yestereve . I saw Cleon dance before the Lesbian . Pisistratus Pisistratus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confio Trembling and flashed , he watched her twinkling feet , Then proffered her a rose which Sappho clutched , And ground to powder ' twixt her dainty fingers . Pisistratus Pisistratus What spoke this action to thy mind ? Confio Confio Rank jealousy . Pisistratus Pisistratus Think'st Phaon of Cleon is enamoured ? Confio Confio If Phaon of Cleon be not smitten , Pisistratus is not the king of Athens . Pisistratus Pis istratus The Lesbian 's honeymoon is not all honey  --  ' T is little past a month . Confio Confio It is not that , My liege ; ' t is scarce three weeks of cloud and shine . Pisistratus Pisistratus Nor heaven nor earth can legislate for Cupid . He will slip through the finest of their meshes , Pilfer his neighbours ' flowers before their eyes , And laugh defiance in their tearful faces . Confio Confio ' T is true , my liege . Pisistratus Pisistratus And what is true is right ; And what is right is true . If Phaon find The Lesbian 's floweret sweeter than the Lesbian , Sure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , liege . Pisistratus Pisistratus ' T is strange , a woman of such fine perception , Such breadth and depth of mental penetration , Of such high soaring genius as the Lesbian , Should stake her happiness on such a man : Inconstancy upon his face is stamped As plainly as his nose . Confio Confio It is , my liege , And proves that love is blind . Pisistratus Pisistratus It does , by Jove ! And shows that poets are the worst of tailors : They measure human by ideal forms , And by the error make the illest fits  --  Is th ' Appius at anchor in the bay ? Confio Confio Thy galley 's there , my liege . Pisistratus Pisistratus Is the wind fair ? Confio Confio ' T is . Pisistratus Pisistratus Bid the sails be set for Sicily , And send the lovers on a pleasure trip . Dost understand me ? Confio Confio Ay . Pisistratus Pisistratus Then act upon Thy knowledge . Thou dost know I love the Lesbian , And am resolved to make her queen of Athens . Confio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liege . Pisistratus Pis istratus Hadst thou slain Phaon on the Olympian plain Instead the royal courser he bestrode , And twined my myrtle with the Lesbian 's laurel , The Queen of Song had been my queen that day . Confio Confio It was a piece of damnd luck , my liege , And proves how difficult ' t is to shoot game flying . Pisistratus Pisistratus I now will tell thee how to mend thy luck . The music of Cleon 's little feet Is promised me this hour ; bid Phaon to me . She will not take ten steps ere he 'll go mad , And , bounding forward , clasp her in his arms  --  See that the Lesbian gaze upon the picture ! Mind , no mistake this time ! Confio Confio I 'll mend my luck . Exit . Pisistratus Pis istratus Why Jove hath in a female temple placed A mind like Sappho 's is anomalous . In Homer only can we find her equal , And on her brow I 'd rather set my crown Than on the head of Sheba 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And won . I 've thrown for Sappho , and will win . Enter Phaon with roses . Roses again ? Thou'lt pluck my gardens bare To deck thy mistress . Lov'st Cleon well ? Phaon Phaon More than my life , my liege . Pisistratus Pisistratus Thou wert a fool To throw thyself away upon the Lesbian , Who might thy mother be . Phaon Phaon There is a time In life when all must play the fool , my liege ; And I have done it in my twentieth year . Awakened reason tells me I can know No bliss but with Cleon . Pisistratus Pisistratus Thou shalt have her . Get thee behind that screen : the charmer comes ! He steps behind the screen . Cleon enters timidly , trips up to Pisistratus , and kneels . Welcome , my little black-eyed sylph , welcome  --  Tears oozing through the curtains of thine eyes ! What 's sprung the fountain of Cleon 's heart ? Cleon Cleon Alas ! thou hast discoursed too much of Phaon ! Pisistratus Pisistratus Cleon is in love ? Cleon Cleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Sicily with Phaon ? Cleon Cleon More than to go to Heaven it would rejoice me . Pisistratus Pisistratus Then dry thine eyes , my girl , and trust to me For Phaon and a trip to Sicily . Now let me list the music of thy feet , And see the smiles of Hebe on thy lips . Cleon dances with a step light as air . Phaon watches her with enamoured eyes , bounds from behind the screen , clasps her in his arms , and places his roses in her hair and bosom . Sappho enters , starts back , and rushes away . SCENE IV . The piazza , as in Act II . Scenes II . and IV . Sappho , pale and dishevelled , rushes in from the garden , and falls forward . Alcus follows , and pauses near her .

The knowledge of our presence may prove fatal . She has a dagger , and may turn it on Herself . These two hours through the woods I 've followed Close on her steps to save her from self-murder . Now flew she like the wind , a-crying ' Off ! Wild , laughing fiends ! pull me not by the hair ! ' Then on her face wept till the stones dissolved .

Alas ! such sleep will never more be mine ! The blissful slumbers of the nuptial pillow , The golden-pinioned dreams that hover round The marriage couch with love have flown for ever . Whilome , I closed the portal of my heart , Upon its fires piled ashes of dead dreams , So high they could not stir beneath the weight ; Then with this smouldering tna in my bosom , I struggled up the rugged steep of fame , And from the summit plucked the deathless laurel : How proud was I upon that festive day ! How calm ! how self-possessed ! how great ! My soul had conquered , the world lay at my feet , And to the gods I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed a thousand lives that day , I 'd given them all to save thee from thy fate .

The shipwrecked mariner sometimes finds escape By swimming , floating on a plank , or hanging Upon a rock amid the howling waves Until some unexpected vessel , driven Hither by friendly fortune , plucks him off : Sometimes the shepherd under shady beech , Sounding his pipe , beholds , affrighted but Not hurt , the lightning split the tree behind him .

A lawn near a cottage , lighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a shepherdess , her throat clasped by a rich diamond necklet , dancing with shepherds and shepherdesses to the music of Phaon 's pipe and other pastoral instruments . Clitus and Rhodope enter , disguised , and mingle among the dancers . Clitus Clitus ( drawing Rhodope forward ) In yonder little cottage dwell the lovers . It is alone , and all the portals wide . Fly to the galley ; bid the Lesbian hither To clutch the jewels Phaon stole from her To deck the dusky beauty of her slave : They all are there , locked in the golden casket , Except the diamond necklet that now clasps The tawny throat of yon muse-killing aspic . That hoary shepherd , leaning on his crook , Like a sieve , let all run through him at one tap . So straight he led my thoughts into the cottage , I there could lay my hand upon the jewels . Put thy nose in a cachette in the wall  --  Understandest ? Now , quick upon thy legs , While I enchain the revellers here with harping . Exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And by the cunning of mine art I 'll hold them Until the Lesbian trip their stolen joys . Sets his harp down , and gazes fixedly at Cleon . Behold yon swarthy snake ! her little feet Now twinkling on the very heart of Sappho  --  The greatest heart Olympus ever launched . Is she a thing to pull the eagle down , And trail his heaven-fledged pinions in the dust ? O perfidy ! O base ingratitude ! Hell has no name that 's black enough to fit thee ! He plays . Shepherds gather around him , examine his harp , then dance to its music . SCENE II . The sea shore , lighted by tna . Sappho , closely wrapped in a long black mantle , and wearing a helmet and visor enters from the galley , and walks to and fro . Sappho Sappho This is Sicilia ! Theme of Homer 's lyre , And all so seeming fair one might not deem She holds an tna in her heart : Scylla And dread Charybdis rend her ears ! It tells How fair a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips art oft Reflections of volcanic fires beneath . Pauses . Sicilia ! Thou art my sister , born to burning woes , To speechless sorrows , and volcanic throes . Walks to and fro with her eyes bent on an open letter , drops it , and gazes on the volcano . O hell of fires ! O burning soul that vomitst Thy molten woes fall in the face of heaven ! Thou dost so stir the lava lakes locked in me , Dashest such seething currents through my veins , That to dwell with thee much would make me mad ! Could I so ope my heart , and strike space blind With its red agony , how well were it For me . Enter Rhodope . Rhodope What news , Rhodope , bringst thy Sappho ? Rhodope Rhodope Why , baby , that in yonder little cottage Thou seest nestling ' mong the loving vines Thy faithless Phaon and Cleon dwell . Sappho Sappho O all ye gods , uphold my reeling senses !

If ever thou hast kindly heard A song in deep distress preferred , Hear this ! and from the realms of air , Propitious to my tuneful prayer , Descend , thou bright immortal guest , In all thy radiant charms confess 'd . Twice thou didst leave Almighty Jove , And all the golden roofs above , In answer to my Paphian prayer ; Thy quivering sparrows clove the air , And as they earthward winged their way Like harps I heard their pinions play . Celestial visitant ! once more Thy needful presence I implore ; In pity come , and ease my grief , Bring my distempered soul relief ; Quench in this bosom Cupid 's fires , Or give me all my heart desires .

Rhodope Rhodope ( pulling her mantle ) O Sapphie ! Sapphie ! pray no more to Venus , The cruel , jealous , unrelenting goddess , But haste with me to yonder little cottage , Whose open doors invite thee to walk in And take possession of the stolen casket . A shepherd at the dance upon the lawn Where , now , Cleon 's little feet keep time To Phaon 's pipe , told Clitus where to touch it . Sappho Sappho Mysterious powers that stand behind the veil Pending between the present and the future , Seeing , unseen , speak out ! and tell me if There be in store for me a happy greeting , Or if the arrow shall strike deeper home ?

' Oh ! couldst thou know the burning pain That wrings my heart , and sears my brain ! ' ' T is Sappho 's hand ! the Lesbian 's burning words ; Kisses it . O precious jewel that dost tell me I Am close upon the footsteps of the Muse ! Here are her tiny footprints in the sand ! Here has she stood , here told her woes to tna , And from her red eyes drawn a sea of tears . Throws himself on the sand , and kisses the footprints . O sweet impressions ! O angelic imprints ! Ye have removed whole mountains from my heart ; It leaps again , ha ! ha ! its fountains play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mad , yet am I something like it , This frenzied joyance might have birth in Bedlam ; What ignis-fatuus lures me o'er the sea , Following the flight of an inconstant star . What is this potent spell that holds me down Here like a giant arm ? alas ! Love is My conqueror ; these twenty years I 've vainly Battled with him . Yon crimson hell whose breath Blows out the stars , and strikes heaven blind , turns pale Before the tna burning in my heart . Exit . SCENE III . The interior of the cottage . Phaon 's casquette and gloves lying on a table  --  his sword hanging on the wall  --  music and sounds of merriment heard without . Enter Sappho leaning on Rhodope . Sappho .

Sappho rushes in dishevelled and bleeding , followed by Clitus and Rhodope . SapphoSappho O mighty Gods ! avengers of the wronged ! Where are your lightnings ? Where your thunder-bolts ? Have love , humanity , gallantry fled the earth , And men put on the shapes of brutish beasts ?

Enter officers with Cleon in chains and Phaon in custody , followed by a crowd of shepherds . Phaon Phaon ( throwing his arms round Cleon ) To touch this angel let none venture more ! Although disarmed , not without arms am I ; Each limb in her defence becomes an arm , And every arm a giant . Tremble not Belov 'd ; while Phaon breathes no ill shall touch thee !

I then an humble , unknown shepherd-boy , Untutored in the art of witchery , Rose up and listened  --  worshipped with the rest . The music of thy lyre entranced my soul , And kindled in my bosom unknown fires , The Athenian tyrant lured thee to his court , Thee I beheld  --  inexplicable joy ! I told to thee my love . Thy smiles inflamed And wove insidious charms around my brain . I prayed for Hymen 's chains  --  thou boundst them on me . Awhile their charmd weight intoxicated , Then brought my heart a vague uneasy thirst The ocean of thy love refused to slake .

When first I looked upon this lovely child  --  Sweet lily in the valley of my life  --  Lifting her modest head no higher than Her native vales , the fountains of my heart Burst forth .

If , with a mind confiding in them wholly , Unwavering and undoubting , thou dost leap , Thou mayst expect a most auspicious exit . Sappho Sappho Attend me to the brink of yonder rock ; Thy holy presence will inspire me strength . High priest High Priest This are the servants of the gods forbidden . Shut the door of reason , cast out fear and doubt , Gird up the sinews of thy soul with faith , Ascend the rock , fly to the brink , and leap , While on my knees I 'll supplicate the gods To bring thee from the waters healed and cooled As from salubrious bath in summer time . Going . Sappho Sappho Stay , holy man . Leave me not yet ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sea I leap , And Fate decree I never issue thence , Whither shall I go ? In what strange world abode ? What shape assume ? What likeness there put on ? High priest High Priest Such knowledge gods withhold . Sappho Sappho Then do we need A higher godhead ! Thunder . High priest High Priest Impious woman , list ! The anger of the gods ! Sappho Sappho I bide their wrath . Unfold to me the mysteries of that world To which all go , and from which none return . The grave  --  is it a couch of dreamless sleep , Or one on which some future morn will break ? High priest High Priest Seek not to know the secrets of the gods Lest with just wrath they strike thee from this world . Exit . Sappho Sappho Woe ! woe ! O woe is me ! None give the key That opes the portal of eternity ; And , like the blind , I hence must grope my way With rayless eyeballs , feeling for the day ! Exit , followed by Clitus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sea seen beyond . A tablet near the brink of the rock on which is writ , ' Deucalion , Cephalus , and Phobus leaped from this rock to cure themselves of love , and came forth healed . ' Sappho enters with a timid step , followed at a distance by Clitus and Rhodope . She pauses an instant before the tablet . Approaches the brink , looks over , and starts back with a shriek . Sappho Sappho Horror ! O horror of the world of horrors ! The flames of Tartarus flashed in mine eyes ! Demoniac visions , writhing souls stretched out On lakes of fire with crimson eyeballs stared Me blind , and rent my ears with horrid shrieks . When reason reels how vast 's imagination , How wonderful the worlds it conjures up , It rolls the ocean from his coral bed , And bears the flaming heart of hell beneath . She approaches the brink again , and starts back . Woe ! woe ! O woe is me ! O woe is me ! I can not of myself let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know nought of ; Yet must I do it ! It is Fate 's decree ! Ionian hills , and blue-eyed heavens , give ear ; Hearken , O hearken to my dying plaint ! I stand alone upon the shores of time A pendulum vibrating twixt two worlds That know me not . Bards who sued at my feet , Monarchs who paved my way with diadems , With love and glory turned their faces from me ; Olympian smiles that wreathed my path whilome Are in the hour of my dread need withheld : The courage that spurned giants from its way , As if they had been overweening pigmies ; The faithless currents of my veins have flown , My very pulses have forsaken me , And left me like a fallen leaf adrift Upon the river of oblivion . The sorrows I have known have found no tongue , The raptures I have felt I 've faintly sung : Words were too weak to hold the inspiration With which the chalice of my soul o'errun . And like sweet dew it back to heaven exhaled ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name Beyond the power of wrong to stamp it out , Or envy to obliterate its glory ; Ages unborn shall laud the Lesbian lyre . Sages and children lisp the songs of Sappho , While leaning from some star I 'll list their praises . Mine error speaks : of the gods I asked too much : I asked the laurel and the myrtle twined : They gave the laurel , but refused the myrtle , And to their will submissively I bow , Forgiving mortals and immortals now . A halo of light encircles her as she walks backward towards the brink . Eternity is opening on my vision , Millions of white hands beckoning me away  --  Adieu ! Adieu ! This is the last of earth ! She turns , and leaps into the sea . Clitus rushes over after her . Rhodope , tearing her hair , hobbles to the brink . Alcus , crying ' Sappho ' comes running up the rock , followed by his sailors . Alcus Alcus Where 's Sappho ? where the prize of Greece ? Rhodope Rhodope There , drowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lesbian drowned ? Millions of Leucat 's could drown her not ! The Lesbian dead ! that Sappho can not die Is written in the book of destiny . Struggles with sailors . Avaunt ! all mortal presence now is odious ! Hold off your hands ! What now is life to me ? My lamp 's gone out , my beacon set for aye ! Rhodope Rhodope Let us embalm her memory with sweet tears ! Alcus Alcus Had I an ocean I would pour them out ! I loved the Lesbian more than Jove , than life ; Weep mother earth ! weep thy most gifted child ! Weep , O ye rocks ! Ionian hills lament ! And all ye heavens put on the weeds of woe . Withered is the laurel , shattered is the lyre : But as the living lightnings light the sky , Its deathless fires shall lume eternity ! Upon the earth there was no home for Sappho , And with the angels she has gone to dwell . Sappho 's spirit , on angel 's wings , appears above the brink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Heaven-pinioned , winging its immortal flight ! Open the windows of this house of clay ! And give my soul egress ! None will obey ! ( Stabs himself . ) ' T is done ! O gods ! and I am on my way To join the Lesbian in the realms of day . Dies . Tableau . Solemn music . The Curtain . Back matter EPILOGUE . The Muse , whose tale ye 'd learned from classic pages , And only seen through mists of distant ages , So dim and far she seemed a fabled sprite , Moving upon life 's stage ye 've seen to-night ; A creature like yourselves of flesh and blood , With the same passions , hopes , and fears imbued . The queen of song , ye 've seen the poets greet Her as their peer , kings suing at her feet . Upon Olympus highest summit stand , Amid applauding Greece serene and bland , And to a brainless shepherd give her hand ; Then roving down the vales of dark despair , A moaning maniac , tearing her long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling on the god whom heaven had not yet given . Ye 've seen her stand amid the pitiless storm Of fate , encircled by no loving arm , By height and depth of soul removed as far From human sympathy as some lone star , Or comet burning its mysterious way , And mid it all have only heard her pray For light to guide her toward Olympian day ; Then turn deaf ears to envy 's classic lies , And judge her by the senses of your eyes . Matrons and maids ! All who have truly loved ! Whose lovers , husbands , all have faithful proved , Whose watchful cares , and smiles , and godlike worth , Have made your homes the Edens of the earth , Think of the wife desert , the loved one flown , And make the ill-starred Lesbian 's case your own : Freely and tenderly let your heart founts flow , And help her as you can to bear her woe . Drive slander from your doors , it is a thief That brings its thousands every day to grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with true hearts a sister 's cause defend . Remember Sappho lived in other times , When Jove rewarded virtue , punished crimes ; When woman had no friend to take her part , And calm the troubled waters of her heart , To lend a patient ear to all her woe . If wrong assail you now to Christ ye go ; Who turns you not away on any grounds , But pours the balm of Gilead in your wounds .
