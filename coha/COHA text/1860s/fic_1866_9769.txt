Appleton 398 The Man without a Country Edward Everett Hale 448 Main text A RAFT THAT NO MAN MADE . I AM a soldier : but my tale , this time , is not of war . The man of whom the Muse talked to the blind bard of old had grown wise in wayfaring . He had seen such men and cities as the sun shines on , and the great wonders of land and sea ; and he had visited the farther countries , whose indwellers , having been once at home in the green fields and under the sky and roofs of the cheery earth , were now gone forth and forward into a dim and shadowed land , from which they found no backward path to these old haunts , and their old loves :  --  . Od . XI . At the Charter-House I learned the story of the King of Ithaca , and read it for something better than a task ; and since , though I have never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so wise , yet have heard and seen and remembered , for myself , words and things from crowded streets and fairs and shows and wave-washed quays and murmurous market-places , in many lands ; and for his ,  --  his people wrapt in cloud and vapor , whom " no glad sun finds with his beams , "  --  have been borne along a perilous path through thick mists , among the crashing ice of the Upper Atlantic , as well as sweltered upon a Southern sea , and have learned something of men and something of God . I was in Newfoundland , a lieutenant of Royal Engineers , in Major Gore 's time , and went about a good deal among the people , in surveying for Government . One of my old friends there was Skipper Benjie Westham of Brigus , a shortish , stout , bald man , with a cheerful , honest face and a kind voice ; and he , mending a caplin-seine one day , told me this story , which I will try to tell after him . We were upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Prudence , the fisherman 's daughter , and Ralph Barrows , her husband , were with Skipper Benjie when he began ; and I had an hour by the watch to spend . The neighborhood , all about , was still ; the only men who were in sight were so far off that we heard nothing from them ; no wind was stirring near us , and a slow sail could be seen outside . Everything was right for listening and telling . " I can tell ' ee what I sid* myself , sir , " said Skipper Benjie . " It is n ' like a story that ' s put down in books : it ' s on'y like what we planters tells of a winter 's night or sech ; but it ' s feelun , mubbe , an ' ' ee wo n't expect much off a man as could n ' never read ,  --  not so much as Bible or Prayer-Book , even . " Skipper Benjie looked just like what he was thought : a true-hearted , healthy man , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need of any one 's saying it . So I only waited till he went on speaking . " ' T was one time I goed to th ' Ice , sir . I never goed but once , an ' ' t was a'most the first v'yage ever was , ef ' t was n ' the very first ; an ' ' t was the last for me , an ' worse agen for the rest-part o ' that crew , that never goed no more ! ' T was tarrible sad douns wi ' they ! " This preface was accompanied by some preliminary handling of the caplin-seine , also , to find out the broken places and get them about him . Ralph and Prudence deftly helped him . Then , making his story wait , after this opening , he took one hole to begin at in mending , chose his seat , and drew the seine up to his knee . At the same time I got nearer to the fellowship of the family by persuading the planter ( who yielded with a pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ netting . Prudence quietly took to herself a share of the work , and Ralph alone was unbusied . " They calls th ' Ice a wicked place ,  --  Sundays an ' weekin days all alike ; an ' to my seemun it ' s a cruel , bloody place , jes ' so well ,  --  but not all thinks alike , surely .  --  Rafe , lad , mubbe ' ee ' d ruther go down cove-ways , an ' overhaul the punt a bit . " Ralph , who perhaps had stood waiting for the very dismissal that he now got , assented and left us three . Prudence , to be sure , looked after him as if she would a good deal rather go with him than stay ; but she stayed , nevertheless , and worked at the seine . I interpreted to myself Skipper Benjie 's sending away of one of his hearers by supposing that his son-in-law had often heard his tales ; but the planter explained himself :  --  " ' Ee sees , sir , I knocked off goun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel place , to my seemun . They swiles* be so knowun like ,  --  as knowun as a dog , in a manner , an ' lovun to their own , like Christens , a'most , more than bastes ; an ' they ' m got red blood , for all they lives most-partly in water ; an ' then I found ' em so friendly , when I was wantun friends badly . But I s'pose the swilefishery ' s needful ; an ' I knows , in course , that even Christens ' blood ' s got to be taken sometimes , when it ' s bad blood , an ' I would n ' be childish about they things ; on'y ,  --  ef it ' s me ,  --  when I can live by fishun , I don ' want to go an ' club an ' shoot an ' cut an ' slash among poor harmless things that ' ould never harm man or ' oman , an ' ' ould cry great tears down for pity-sake , an got a sound like a Christen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for gain ,  --  not after beun among ' em , way I was , anyways . " This apology made it plain that Skipper Benjie was large hearted enough , or indulgent enough , not to seek to strain others , even his own family , up to his own way in everything ; and it might easily be thought that the young fisherman had different feelings about sealing from those that the planter 's story was meant to bring out . All being ready , he began his tale again :  --  " I shipped wi ' Skipper Isra'l Gooden , from Carbonear : the schooner was the Baccaloue , wi ' forty men , all told . ' T was of a Sunday morn'n ' e ' ould sail , twel'th day o ' March , wi ' another schooner in company ,  --  the Sparrow . There was a many of us was n ' too good , but we thowt wrong of ' e 's takun the Lord 's Day to ' e'sself.  --  Wull , sir , afore I comed ' ome , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea wi ' a monstrous great raft that no man never made , creakun an ' crashun an ' groanun an ' tumblun an ' wastun an ' goun to pieces , an ' no man on her but me , an ' full o ' livun things ,  --  dreadful ! " About a five hours out , ' t was , we first sid the blink , * an ' comed up wi ' th ' Ice about off Cape Bonavis ' . We fell in wi , it south , an worked up nothe along : but we did n ' see swiles for two or three days yet ; on'y we was workun along ; pokun the cakes of ice away , an ' haulun through wi ' main strength sometimes , holdun on wi ' bights o ' ropes out o ' the bow ; an ' more times , agen , in clear water : sometimes mist all round us , ' ee could n ' see the ship 's len'th , sca'ce ; an ' more times snow , jes ' so thick ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would a'most blow all the spars out of her , seemunly . " We kep ' sight o ' th ' other schooner , most-partly ; an ' when we did n ' keep it , we ' d get it agen . So one night ' t was a beautiful moonlight night : I think I never sid a moon so bright as that moon was ; an ' such lovely sights a body ' ould n ' think could be ! Little islands , an ' bigger , agen , there was , on every hand , shinun so bright , wi ' great , awful-lookun shadows ! an ' then the sea all black , between ! They did look so beautiful as ef a body could go an ' bide on em , in a manner ; an ' the sky was jes ' so blue , an ' the stars all shinun out , an ' the moon all so bright ! I never looked upon the like . An ' so I stood in the bows ; an ' I do n't know ef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinkun o ' my girl that I was troth-plight wi ' then , an ' a many things , when all of a sudden we comed upon the hardest ice we ' d a-had ; an ' into it ; an ' then , wi ' pokun an ' haulun , workun along . An ' there was a cry goed up ,  --  like the cry of a babby , ' t was , an ' I thowt mubbe ' t was a somethun had got upon one o ' they islands ; but I said , agen , How could it ? ' an ' one John Harris said ' e thowt ' t was a bird . Then another man ( Moffis ' e 's name was ) started off wi ' what they calls a gaff , ( ' t is somethun like a short boat-hook , ) over the bows , an ' run ; an ' we sid un strike , an ' strike , an ' we hard it go wump ! wump ! an ' the cry goun up so tarrible feelun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inden child ' e ' d a-found , ( on'y mubbe ' e would n ' do so bad as that : but there ' ve a-been tarrible bloody , cruel work wi ' Indens in my time , ) an ' then ' e comed back wi ' a white-coat* over ' e 's shoulder ; an ' the poor thing was n ' dead , but cried an ' soughed like any poor little babby . " The young wife was very restless at this point , and , though she did not look up , I saw her tears . The stout fisherman smoothed out the net a little upon his knee , and drew it in closer , and heaved a great sigh : he did not look at his hearers . " When ' e throwed it down , it walloped , an ' cried , an ' soughed ,  --  an ' its poor eyes blinded wi ' blood ! ( ' Ee sees , sir , " said the planter , by way of excusing his tenderness , " they swiles were friends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n ' stand it ; for ' e might ha ' killed un ; an ' so ' e goes for a quart o ' rum , for fetchun first swile , an ' I went an ' put the poor thing out o ' pain . I did n ' want to look at they beautiful islands no more , somehow . Bumby it comed on thick , an ' then snow . " Nex ' day swiles bawlun every way , poor things ! ( I knowed their voice , now , ) but ' t was blowun a gale o ' wind , an ' we under bare poles , an ' snow comun agen , so fast as ever it could come : but out the men ' ould go , all mad like , an ' my watch goed , an ' so I mus ' go . ( I did n ' think what I was goun to ! ) The skipper never said no ; but to keep near the schooner , an ' fetch in first we could , close by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we got abroad , an ' the men that was wi ' me jes began to knock right an ' left : ' t was heartless to see an ' hear it . They laved two old uns an ' a young whelp to me , as they runned by . The mother did cry like a Christen , in a manner , an ' the big tears ' ould run down , an ' they ' ould both be so brave for the poor whelp that ' ould cuddle up an ' cry ; an ' the mother looked this way an ' that way , wi ' big , pooty , black eyes , to see what was the manun of it , when they ' d never doned any harm in God 's world that ' E made , an ' would n ' , even ef you killed ' em : on'y the poor mother baste ketched my gaff , that I was goun to strike wi ' , betwixt her teeth , an ' I could n ' get it away . ' T was n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I s'pose ' t was wi ' what was comun that I did n ' know . ) Then comed a hail , all of a sudden , from the schooner ; ( we had n ' been gone mor n ' a five minutes , ef ' t was so much ,  --  no , not mor ' n a three : ) but I was glad to hear it come then , however : an ' so every man ran , one afore t ' other . There the schooner was , tearun through all , an ' we runnun for dear life . I falled among the slob , * and got out agen . ' T was another man pushun agen me doned it . I could n ' ' elp myself from goun in , an ' when I got out I was astarn of all , an ' there was the schooner carryun on , right through to clear water ! So , hold of a bight o ' line , or anything ! an ' they swung up in over bows an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' was out o ' sight in a minute an ' the snow drivun as ef ' t would bury her , an ' a man laved behind on a pan of ice , an ' the great black say two fathom ahead , an ' the storm-wind blowun ' im into it ! " The planter stopped speaking . We had all gone along so with the story , that the stout seafarer , as he wrought the whole scene up about us , seemed instinctively to lean back and brace his feet against the ground , and clutch his net . The young woman looked up , this time ; and the cold snow-blast seemed to howl through that still summer 's noon , and the terrific ice-fields and hills to be crashing against the solid earth that we sat upon , and all things round changed to the far-off stormy ocean and boundless frozen wastes . The planter began to speak again :  --  " So I falled right down upon th ' ice , sayun , Lard , help me ! Lard , help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow in my face , ( I was afeard , a'most , to stand , ) Lard , help me ! Lard , help me ! ' " ' T was n ' all hard ice , but many places lolly ; * an ' once I goed right down wi ' my hand-wrists an ' my arms in cold water , part-ways to the bottom o ' th ' ocean ; and a'most head-first into un , as I ' d a-been in wi ' my legs afore : but , thanks be to God ! ' E helped me out of un , but colder an ' wetter agen . " In course I wanted to folly the schooner ; so I runned up along , a little ways from the edge , an ' then I runned down along ; but ' t was all great black ocean outside , an ' she gone miles an ' miles away ; an ' by two hours ' time , even ef she ' d come to , itself , an ' all clear weather , I could n ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , she could n ' never find me , more ' n I could find any one o ' the flakes o ' snow . The schooner was gone , an ' I was laved out o ' the world ! " Bumby , when I got on the big field agen , I stood up on my feet , an ' I sid that was my ship ! She had n ' e'er a sail , an ' she had n ' e'er a spar , an ' she had n ' e'er a compass , an ' she had n ' e'er a helm , an ' she had n ' no hold , an ' she had n ' no cabin . I could n ' sail her , nor I could n ' steer her , nor I could n ' anchor her , nor bring her to , but she would go , wind or calm , an ' she ' d never come to port , but out in th ' ocean she ' d go to pieces ! I sid ' t was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' do my best wi ' it . ' T was jest a great , white , frozen raft , driftun bodily away , wi ' storm blowun over , an ' current runnun under , an ' snow comun down so thick , an ' a poor Christen laved all alone wi ' it . ' T would drift as long as anything was of it , an ' ' t was n ' likely there ' d be any life in the poor man by time th ' ice goed to nawthun ; an ' the swiles ' ould swim back agen up to the Nothe ! " I was th ' only one , seemunly , to be cast out alive , an ' wi ' the dearest maid in the world ( so I thought ) waitun for me . I s'pose ' ee might ha ' knowed somethun better , sir ; but I was n ' larned , an ' I ran so fast as ever I could up the way I thowt home was , an ' I groaned , an ' groaned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thowt , Mubbe I may be goun wrong way . ' So I groaned to the Lard to stop the snow . Then I on'y ran this way an ' that way , an ' groaned for snow to knock off. * I knowed we was driftun mubbe a twenty leagues a day , and anyways I wanted to be doun what I could , keepun up over th ' Ice so well as I could , Noofoundland-ways , an ' I might come to somethun ,  --  to a schooner or somethun ; anyways I ' d get up so near as I could . So I looked for a lee . I s'pose ' ee ' d ha ' knowed better what to do , sir , " said the planter , here again appealing to me , and showing by his question that he understood me , in spite of my pea-jacket . I had been so carried along with his story that I had felt as if I were the man on the Ice myself , and assured him that , though I could get along pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ netting , I should have been very awkward in his place . " Wull , sir , I looked for a lee . ( ' T would n ' ha ' been so cold , to say cold , ef it had n ' a-blowed so tarrible hard . ) First step , I stumbled upon somethun in the snow , seemed soft , like a body ! Then I comed all together , hopun an ' fearun an ' all together . Down I goed upon my knees to un , an ' I smoothed away the snow , all tremblun , an ' there was a moan , as ef ' t was a-livun . " O Lard ! ' I said , who ' s this ? Be this one of our men ? ' " But how could it ? So I scraped the snow away , but ' t was easy to see ' t was smaller than a man . There was n ' no man on that dreadful place but me ! Wull , sir , ' t was a poor swile , wi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cuffs* an ' sleeves all red wi ' it . It looked like a fellow-creatur 's blood , a'most , an ' I was a lost man , left to die away out there in th ' Ice , an ' I said , Poor thing ! poor thing ! ' an ' I did n ' mind about the wind , or th ' ice , or the schooner goun away from me afore a gale ( I would n ' mind about ' em ) , an ' a poor lost Christen may show a good turn to a hurt thing , ef ' t was on'y a baste . So I smoothed away the snow wi ' my cuffs , an ' I sid ' t was a poor thing wi ' her whelp close by her , an ' her tongue out , as ef she ' d a-died fondlun an ' lickun it ; an ' a great puddle o ' blood ,  --  it looked tarrible heartless , when I was so nigh to death , an ' was n ' hungry . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thowt , It may be a help to me , ' an ' so I pulled an , an ' it would n ' come , an ' I found she was lyun on it so I hauled agen , an ' , when it comed , ' t was my gaff the poor baste had got away from me , an ' got it under her , an ' she was a-lyun on it . Some o ' the men , when they was runnun for dear life , must ha ' struck ' em , out o ' madness like , an ' laved ' em to die where they was . ' T was the whelp was n ' quite dead . ' Ee ' ll think ' t was foolish , sir , but it seemed as though they was somethun to me , an ' I ' d a-lost the last friendly thing there was . " I found a big hummock an ' sheltered under it , standun on my feet , wi ' nawthun to do but think , an ' think , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could n ' help feelun to God then , surely . Nawthun to do , an ' no place to go , tull snow cleared away ; but jes ' drift wi ' the great Ice down from the Nothe , away down over the say , a sixty mile a day , mubbe . I was n ' a good Christen , an ' I could n ' help a-thinkun o ' home an ' she I was troth-plight wi ' , an ' I doubled over myself an ' groaned ,  --  I could n ' help it : but bumby it comed into me to say my prayers , an ' it seemed as thof she was askun me to pray , ( an ' she was good , sir , al'ays , ) an ' I seemed all opened , somehow , an ' I knowed how to pray . " While the words were coming tenderly from the weather-beaten fisherman , I could not help being moved , and glanced over toward the daughter 's seat ; but she was gone , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealthily , and very quickly , toward the cove . The father gave no heed to her leaving , but went on with his tale :  --  " Then the wind began to fall down , an ' the snow knocked off altogether , an ' the sun comed out ; an ' I sid th ' Ice , field-ice an ' icebargs , an ' every one of ' em flashun up as ef they ' d kendled up a bonfire , but no sign of a schooner ! no sign of a schooner ! nor no sign o ' man 's douns , but on'y ice , every way , high an ' low , an ' some places black water , in-among ; an ' on'y the poor swiles bawlun all over , an ' I standun amongst ' em . " While I was lookun out , I sid a great icebarg ( they calls ' em ) a quarter of a mile away , or thereabouts , standun up ,  --  one end a twenty fathom out o ' water , an ' about a forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses ,  --  an ' then , jest as ef ' e was alive an ' had tooked a notion in ' e'sself , seemunly , all of a sudden ' e rared up , an ' turned over an ' over , wi ' a tarrible thunderun noise , an ' comed right on , breakun everything an ' throwun up great seas : ' t was frightsome for a lone body away out among ' em ! I stood an ' looked at un , but then agen I thowt I may jes ' so well be goun to thick ice an ' over Noofoundland-ways a piece , so well as I could . So I said my bit of a prayer , an ' told Un I could n ' help myself ; an ' I made my confession how bad I ' d been , an ' I was sorry , an ' ef ' E ' d be so pitiful an ' forgive me ; an ' ef I mus ' loss my life , ef ' E ' d be so good as make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy , in course . " So then I started ; an ' first I goed to where my gaff was , by the mother-swile an ' her whelp . There was swiles every two or three yards a'most , old uns an ' young uns , all round , everywhere ; an ' I feeled shamed in a manner : but I got my gaff , an ' cleaned un , an ' then , in God 's name , I took the big swile , that was dead by its dead whelp , an ' hauled it away , where the t ' other poor things could n ' si ' me , an ' I sculped* it , an ' took the pelt ;  --  for I thowt I ' d wear un , now the poor dead thing did n ' want to make oose of un no more ,  --  an ' partly because ' t was sech a lovun thing . An ' so I set out , walkun this way , for a spurt , an ' then t ' other way , keepun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : sometimes away round th ' open , an ' more times round a lump of ice , an ' more times , agen , off from one an ' on to another , every minute . I did n ' feel hungry , for I drinked fresh water off th ' ice . No schooner ! no schooner ! " Bumby the sun was goun down : ' t was slow work feelun my way along , an ' I did n ' want to look about : but then agen I thowt God ' ad made it to be sid ; an ' so I come to , an ' turned all round , an ' looked ; an ' surely it seemed like another world , some way , ' t was so beautiful ,  --  yellow , an ' different sorts o ' red , like the sky itself in a manner , an ' flashun like glass . So then it comed night : an ' I thowt I should n ' go to bed , an ' I may forget my prayers , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em right away ; an ' so I doned : Lighten our darkness , ' and others we was oosed to say : an ' it comed into my mind the Lard said to Saint Peter , Why did n ' ' ee have faith ? ' when there was nawthun on the water for un to go on ; an ' I had ice under foot ,  --  ' t was but frozen water , but ' t was frozen ,  --  an ' I thanked Un . " I could n ' help thinkun o ' Brigus an ' them I ' d laved in it , an ' then I prayed for ' em ; an ' I could n ' help cryun , a'most : but then I give over agen , an ' would n ' think , ef I could help it ; on'y tryun to say an odd psalm , all through singun-psalms an ' other , for I knowed a many of ' em by singun wi ' Patience , on'y now I cared more about ' em : I said that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Into the seas descend , Their merchantun , through fearful floods , To compass an ' to end : They men are force-put to behold The Lard 's works , what they be ; An ' in the dreadful deep the same Most marvellous they see . ' An ' I said a many more , ( I ca n't be accountable how many I said , ) an ' same uns many times over : for I would keep on ; an ' ' ould sometimes sing ' em very loud in my poor way . " A poor baste ( a silver fox ' e was ) comed an ' looked at me ; an ' when I turned round , he walked away a piece , an ' then ' e comed back , an ' looked . " So I found a high piece , wi ' a wall of ice atop for shelter , ef it comed on to blow ; an ' so I stood , an ' said , an ' sung . I knowed well I was on'y driftun away . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it ' s no use ! ' T was tarrible lonely : but I ' ould n ' think , ef I could help it ; an ' I prayed a bit , an ' kep ' up my psalms , an ' varses out o ' the Bible , I ' d a-larned . I had n ' a-prayed for sleep , but for wakun all night , an ' there I was standun . " The moon was out agen , so bright ; an ' all the hills of ice shinun up to her ; an ' stars twinklun , so busy , all over ; an ' No'ther ' Lights goun up wi ' a faint blaze , seemunly , from th ' ice , an ' meetun up aloft ; an ' sometimes a great groanun , an ' more times tarrible loud shriekun ! There was great white fields , an ' great white hills , like countries , comun down to be destroyed ; an ' some great bargs a-goun faster , an ' tearun through , breakun others to pieces ; an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead that ever was , wi ' their white cloths  --  But no ! " said the stout fisherman , recalling himself from gazing , as he seemed to be , on the far-off ghastly scene , in memory . " No !  --  an ' thank ' E 's marcy , I ' m sittun by my own room . ' E took me off : but ' t was a dreadful sight ,  --  it ' s no use ,  --  ef a body ' d let ' e'sself think ! I sid a great black bear , an ' hard un growl ; an ' ' t was feelun , like , to hear un so bold an ' so stout , among all they dreadful things , an ' bumby the time ' ould come when ' e could n ' save ' e'sself , do what ' e woul ' . " An ' more times ' t was all still : on'y swiles bawlun , all over . Ef it had n ' a-been for they poor swiles , how could I stan ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a-ketched , day-time , an ' talked to un , an ' patted un on the head , as ef they ' d a-been dogs by the door , like ; an ' they ' d oose to shut their eyes , an ' draw their poor foolish faces together . It seemed neighbor-like to have some live thing . " So I kep ' awake , sayun an ' singun , an ' it was n ' very cold ; an ' so  --  first thing I knowed , I started , an there I was lyun in a heap ; an ' I must have been asleep , an ' did n ' know how ' t was , nor how long I ' d a-been so : an ' some sort o ' baste started away , an ' ' e must have waked me up ; I could n ' rightly see what ' t was , wi ' sleepiness : an ' then I hard a sound , sounded like breakers ; an ' that waked me fairly . ' T was like a lee-shore ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' land , ef ' t was on'y to be wrecked on itself ; but I did n ' go , an ' I stood an ' listened to un ; an ' now an ' agen I ' d walk a piece , back an ' forth , an ' back an ' forth ; an ' so I passed a many , many longsome hours , seemunly , tull night goed down tarrible slowly , an ' it comed up day o ' t ' other side : an ' there was n ' no land ; nawthun but great mountains meltun an ' breakun up , an ' fields wastun away . I sid ' t was a rollun barg made the noise like breakers , throwun up great seas o ' both sides of un ; no sight nor sign o ' shore , nor ship , but dazun white ,  --  enough to blind a body ,  --  an ' I knowed ' t was all floatun away , over the say . Then I said my prayers , an ' tooked a drink o ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t was all I could do . Sometimes snow , an ' more times fair agen ; but no sign o ' man 's things , an ' no sign o ' land , on'y white ice an ' black water ; an ' ef a schooner was n ' into un a'ready , ' t was n ' likely they woul ' , for we was gettun furder an ' furder away . Tired I was wi ' goun , though I had n ' walked more n ' a twenty or thirty mile , mubbe , an ' it all comun down so fast as I could go up , an ' faster , an ' never stoppun ! ' T was a tarrible long journey up over the driftun ice , at sea ! So , then I went on a high bit to wait tull all was done : I thowt ' t would be last to melt , an ' mubbe , I thowt , ' e may capsize wi ' me , when I did n ' know ( for I do n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take care o ' them I loved ; an ' the tears comed . Then I felt somethun tryun to turn me round like , an ' it seemed as ef she was doun it , somehow , an ' she seemed to be very nigh , somehow , an ' I did n ' look . " After a bit , I got up to look out where most swiles was , for company , while I was livun : an ' the first look struck me a'most like a bullet ! There I sid a sail ! ' T was a sail , an ' ' t was like heaven openun , an ' God settun her down there . About three mile away she was , to nothe'ard , in th ' Ice . " I could ha ' sid , at first look , what schooner ' t was ; but I did n ' want to look hard at her . I kep ' my peace , a spurt , an ' then I runned an ' bawled out . Glory be to God ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks to Un . An ' there she was , same as ef I ' d a-walked off from her an hour ago ! It felt so long as ef I ' d been livun years , an ' they would n ' know me , sca'ce . Somehow I did n ' think I could come up wi ' her . " I started , in the name o ' God , wi ' all my might , an ' went , an ' went ,  --  ' t was a five mile , wi ' goun round ,  --  an ' got her , thank God ! ' T was n ' the Baccaloue , ( I sid that long before , ) ' t was t ' other schooner , the Sparrow , repairun damages they ' d got day before . So that kep ' ' em there , an ' I ' d a-been took from one an ' brought to t ' other . " I could n ' do a hand 's turn tull we got into the Bay agen ,  --  I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , an ' fotch home about thirty-eight hundred swiles , an ' a poor man off th ' Ice : but they , poor fellows , that I went out wi ' never comed no more ; an ' I never went agen . " I kep ' the skin o ' the poor baste , sir : that ' s ' e on my cap . " When the planter had fairly finished his tale , it was a little while before I could teach my eyes to see the things about me in their places . The slow-going sail , outside , I at first saw as the schooner that brought away the lost man from the Ice ; the green of the earth would not , at first , show itself through the white with which the fancy covered it ; and at first I could not quite feel that the ground was fast under my feet . I even mistook one of my own men ( the sight of whom was to warn me that I was wanted elsewhere ) for one of the crew of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tale and its scene gathered away , presently , inside my mind , and shook myself into a present association with surrounding things , and took my leave . I went away the more gratified that I had a chance of lifting my cap to a matron , dark-haired and comely , ( who , I was sure , at a glance , had once been the maiden of Benjie Westham 's " troth-plight , " ) and receiving a handsome courtesy in return . * Saw .
