ARTICLE IX. - CHURCII- GOING . EvERY now and then somebody gives us the church-going statistics , from which it appears that the people do not go universally , not even extensively . Indeed , it is not unfrequently remarked : " People do n't go to church as much as they used to . " How do you account for it 3 we asked of a friend who made this remark , not many days ago . " Oh , they are carried elsewhere by the isms of the day ,  - -  Adventism , Mormonism , Spiritualism , and every other new thing . " Bnt delusions are not peculiar to our day ; they have always existed , in every age . Do you mean to pronounce the people more foolish now than they have been in any former age ? " Well , no , probably not . I rather think there was more talent in the pulpit , in former days , than there is now . If by talent you mean learning , and skill to use it , in accordance with the canons of logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't agree with you . The evidence all points the other way . Our schools , colleges , and seminaries have unquestionably made long strides in advance of the attainments of former days . The scholarship of the men of mark was on the whole never so comprehensive , nor so accurate , as now . So far , then , as scholarship has to do with filling our churches , the argument is in favor of our contemporaries . And yet the fact is hardly to be questioned ,  --  the people take less interest in church-going than formerly . Can there be any doubt that church services are a boon to man ? or that they stand closely related to his best intellectual , moral , and spiritual condition ? Surely not . Is the tendency of the age downward ? We think not . Certainly the history of the past fifty years is a history of unparalleled progress . And no doubt the church attendance is numerically greater now than at any former time ; and yet , it may be true , and probably is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the increase of interest in other departments of thought and instruction . Here is surely an evil , and " For every evil under the sun , There is a cure , or there is none ; If there be one , find it ; If there be none , do n't mind it . " If absence from church , or infrequent and uninterested attendance on church , be an evil , there is a remedy , and it is worth while to find it . If it be true , as is very often affirmed , that the loss of reverence is so general with us as to have become a national characteristic ; that reverence for office , for wisdom , for years , for man , and even for God , has sadly decreased among us , then it is plain that every philanthropist should , to the utmost of his ability , encourage the public reverence and worship of God ; the obligation is recognized in churches of every name . Moreover , if the instructiou given in our churches is fitted to the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evil , and a great evil , that , on any pretext , the people fail to receive it . But , it is said , by both clergy and laity , less deference is given to the instructions of the pulpit than formerly . What then ? Are the clergy prepared to abandon the ground ? Has a decree of destiny gone forth against them ? " No , but the people have lost their interest in religious truth . They are less patient of any demands upon their close attention and serious thought than formerly . " It is true that the people are less tolerant of indirection than formerly . Their necessities have constrained them so to be . But it may well be doubted if the best books ever had more readers , the best teachers in every department of science ever had more attentive listeners , than now . If , then , the pulpit has less power to affect the public than formerly , it seems inevitable to conclude that somewhere there is a fault , or an oversight , that should be discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to no class of men , to inquire after errors . " Who can understand his errors ? " is a very ancient exclamation ; and as timely to-day as when first uttered . It // wells up like a natural spring out of the depths of conscious imperfection : out of the consciousness of the man who is supremely solicitous to be a perfect man . It owns that the best intentioned man maybe misled ; that he maybe warped by unnoticed influences , by agencies which he sees no reason to distrust , which have the almost inviolable sanction of long usage and of tradition from some of the best of men . Such tradition and usage h. we sometimes made it heresy even to glance at elements of influence freely placed at our disposal . Fully recognizing that our religions teachers , as a body , are right-minded , intelligent , conscientious , and intent on benefiting their fellow-men , we propose to show that the ordinary hindrances to the accomplishment of their desire are much increased by the net-work of circumstances in which they are successively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest influence arises from an exaggerated estimate of the worth of unusual knowledge . How far will a bright boy get on in the Latin grammar , think you , before he will begin to thank God that he is not as other boys , or even as these high-school boys , at the other end of the building ? Thenceforth , the summit of hum an greatness , and of human excellence , in his view , is eminence in some department of science which will distinguish and separate him from-not unite him to-his fellow-men . And yet , Latin grammar , thoroughly studied , offers a preparation for usefulness in any department of life , the worth of which it would hardly be possible to exaggerate . If the boy is made to understand that the exact analysis of a dead language is of great value in giving him the most perfect freedom and mastery of his own living language , and that the command of this latter is the condition of deepest sympathy and largest influence with his fellow-men , and especially of the largest ability to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that poison of vanity and pedantry which is so often imbibed in the very milk of a liberal education . There are evils incident to every profession in life , and one of the evils incident to that of the pi*ofessional educator is , that eminent excellence in his own particular science is for him the // ultima ratio . He can not well view it as a means to an end ,  - -  not if he loves it , as it is presumed he does . He has little or no time allowed him to show his pupils the worth of what they are upon , as it stands related to the demands of fahire life . There is a certain mechanical exactitude of recitations which can be seen , and heard , and handled , up to which , with or without ponies , a respectable fraction of each class can be urged , and a proper concern for his own reputation compels each teacher to see to it , that he delivers his class , in due time , to the teacher who is to follow him , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so our young men go through our schools of learning , and emerge into the real world , as any aspiring collegian will tell you , with an awakened sense of having somehow lost their identity , and all its fancied consequence . Then commences the struggle to mate the life that was , with the life that is * to disabuse the mind of mistaken estimates , of exaggerated estimates of the student world , and of derogatory estimates of the real world . Then it is discovered that the greatest possible acquisitions in some one science , and that , an unusual science-unusual , in that it is removed from the experience of the million-is peculiarly suited to separate the teacher and his pupil from their kind . IDominie Sampson is discovered to be a representative man ; and happy for young Harry Bertram if he escapes growing into the image and likeness of his master and so becoming unfit for companionship with the world he is to live in . The necessity of thorough mental training is not to be questioned . The adaptation of Latin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finest powers of man , will never be doubted by those who have wisely used their proffered aid . But the youth who is fed on this diet from ten to twenty-three , his appetite stimulated by all the condiments known to the schools , will be in danger of graduating with no stomach for common food , and with little relish for the society , on equal terms , of the human brotherhood to which he is predestined . Our educated men , as they are commonly termed , ought to be the men of the age . The men of the age , are the men of most worth to the age they live in . To be this , they must be // heartily in and of their age ; must thoroughly know and deeply sympathize with it . Each age has its own characteristics . Former ages have been characterized by a reverence for individual minds , of which , in our age , we can *lnd no illustration . The age of hero-worship has perhaps gone by . Will any man venture to assert that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of reverence is also an age 9 of superstition , * and of vassalage to the few superior minds . Our age is an age of fraternity , of sympathy , and of cooperative energy in every good work . Meanwhile our educational system , in no inconsiderable degree , is the system of an obsolete age ; not wholly unaffected by the spirit of our age , in that it has caught the idea of progress , but not harmonizing with it , in its application of thEY idea ; for its voice is , give us more Latin , more Greek ; raise the standard of scholarship , and what ? Commend the sphere of scholarship so as to ensure the sympathy of all ? Nay , but rather widen the breach between the learned and the unlearned , and maintain the high prerogatives of the men of letters . Such is its interpretation of the exigencies of the present age . It is an error in any age , and in any land , and most emphatically an error in this land , in which the brotherhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which no amount of exact science will bring worthy fame to the man who does not love and mingle with his fellow-men as fellow-men . Our educational system has blinded the *. yes of not a few of our preachers to this truth . And many of them are finding their labors increasingly unsatisfactory , just because of their failure to appreliend it . We shall indulge in no suppositions statements in support of this assertion ; but confine ourselves to the confirmatory statements of living witnesses . In a body of clergymen recently convened in a neighboring commonwealth , the following question was discnssed : " May improvements be made in the prevalent method of sermonizing , so as better to meet the present religious wants of the community ? " " The IRev . N. G. , D. D. , found preaching to be a more difficult task every succeeding year . It was // a grave , practical question , whether sound Christian doctrine could be so preached as to edify , to meet the modes of thought at the present day . There was talent enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the pews moved in different planes of thought . " " The Rev. Mr. C. inquired whether it could be said of ministers now , as of those of olden time , that the people heard them gladly ? More sympathy is needed between pastors and people ; a greater development of our humanity . " " Dr. V. thought there was a great lack of doctrinal preaching . " " Rev. Mr. P. deprecated the monotony so prevalent , the monotonous tones of the uncultivated , and no less the Boston style of refined intonations . " " Rev. Mr. B. said that the ministers who succeeded at the West , were those who entered heartily into the feelings and lives of the people , their joys , trials , and difficulties . " " Rev. Mr. A. said he had been taught to sermonize , and not to preach . " " Dr. G. thought the war offered great opportunity for overthrowing the rosewater ' and watergruel ' style of preaching ' . " " Dr. B. thought a clear biblical conception of the end of preaching essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that end could never be reached without the aid of the Holy Spirit . " " Rev. Mr. Q. considered a deep personal experience on the part of the preacher vitally necessary , in order to reach the hearts of the people ; the path can not be pointed out unless we ourselves have traveled it . " From this debate it appears that . the current preaching is increasingly difficult and unsatisfactory to the clergy ; that they doubt if the people hear them gladly ; that they discover a want of sympathy between pastors and people ; that the end of preaching is not clearly discerned , or earnestly taught , in all cases ; and finally that there is a want of deep personal experience , and of conscious dependence upon the Holy Spirit . These avowals are frank and wholesome . They are the confessions of men who earnestly desire to do better ; to discover , if possible , and to remove the impediments to the largest usefulness under which they find themselves laboring . These experiences are by no means peculiar to this commonwealth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London Record // expresses his belief that " the large majority of sermon-hearers are bored , rather than interested , by the discourses they hear . " We maintain that this melancholy result is in no inconsiderable degree to be referred to a vicious educational system ; a system which constantly tempts its pupils to make scholarship , and not the redemption and amelioration of the race , the chief end of life . It is the vice of selfishness ; a subtle form of that very self-seeking and self-aggrandizement which has stained our whole nation ; which even more than the southern monster evil , slavery , has drawn down the displeasure of heaven upon this hitherto happy and prospered land . The direct object of the most thorough education is not to bring honor to the student , to his professor , or to his Alma Mater ; but to produce a man qualified and disposed to be , in the highest possible degree , useful to his fellow-men ; a man thoroughly furnished unto all good works , and full of the heart to use his furniture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd for any man to think of preaching the gospel of Christ who has not pledged himself to God and his own soul , to exterminate every root of selfishness from his own heart . We want a stalwart ministry , able to rend the shackles of the schools , and prompt to use that method of discourse which will accomplish the work of the ministry and persuade men . How a great nation of the old world can endure the control of a sovereign whose only title is succession , has always seemed strange and inexplicable . But while thus intolerant of a civil despotism without merit , we have bowed our necks in unreasoning submission to the merciless yoke of an educational system which exists only by our permission , and which it is in our power to rend any day . The pulpit can not lose what it does not possess , and the miiiistry will never be trampled on , for addressing themselves to that which they are best able to do well . Unquestionably , there is a limited number of men who were designed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compositions , whose design is , in a scholarly way , to prove or illustrate // some Bible truth , in accordance with the sermons of the masters in logic and rhetoric . Their triumphant success vindicates their use of this method ; they attract large congregations ; they hold every eye and ear in charmed attention ; their words sink down into the soul ; their lessons are never forgotten . There are not enough of these men to supply all the pulpits in the land , even were all the congregations able to profit by such a ministry . But there are congregations enough to take many aspirants for this eminence , who never attain it ; congregations who mistake the aspiration for the attainment ; and who are ever offering a bounty to young ministers to persevere on the wrong track . There are men , well fitted to be very useful men , who were never designed to affect others by written discourse ; there is not heat enough in their souls to animate abstract ideas ; a sheet of paper may kindle pine wood , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that giant in laborious writing , declares that " time successes of intellectual effort are never so great as when aided by the affections that animate social converse . " The men of whom we speak can not dispense with the animating influence of the attentive eye and ear , demanding the sentiments which only that visible demand will call into being . Whether for better or for worse , we see not how it can be denied that the peculiar power the pulpit once possessed is much abated . This is , in fact , the not unfrequent complaint of the clergy . It is wise to inquire for the reason . It may prove not to be an occasion of unqualified regret . It may turn to the advantage of both preacher and people , that we have come to distinguish between the office and the man ; between the pulpit and what is said from it . It may necessitate the discovery and use of each man 's own gift . And how many men in a hundred , think you , will discover the gift to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit of the majority of their congregations ? Undoubtedly there are difficulties to be overcome in attaining ability in extemporaneous and in expository discourse . We have not been unwarned of the danger of sinking into mere common-place . But to make the argument convincing , it must // be shown that those who can not be enkindled to the most usefiti , intellectual and emotional life , when in the focus of some hundreds of intelligent eyes and ardent hearts , can more surely acquire this fervor , in the isolation of the study . But were the argument in favor of extemporaneous discourse , derived from the necessities of adults , insufficient , the almost total failure of written discourses to secure the intere*st of the young , appears to us to be unanswerable . A wise mother in Israel , across the water , has written " An Appeal to the Ministers of Christ in behalf of the Little Ones . " She will be heard in time ; not yet , perhaps ; for the majority will say , we ca n't extemporize ; we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourse . And many will own that " they can not talk to children . " Then you can not talk to the majority of your congregations , and we much fear that you have mistaken your vocation . But the truth of the matter is , if you were in your proper vocation , you could and would talk to children , and that successfully , had you not been in some way persuaded of the paramount importance of excelling in a kind of preaching which you find incompatible with this . Highly intellectual and scholarly discourse doubtless has its proper sphere , but we do n't want Blair or Butler to edify our children . " The little ones , " whether in years or in development , were made to be reached through the heart , heart throbbing against heart , glimmering in the eyes , trembling on the tongue , soliciting and winning an immediate assent , and enlisting the enkindled affections for God and holiness . Hear that mother : " Are the discourses delivered from our pulpits fitted to be a help in training young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when will it be done , and the look of relief when it is done , awaken anxious thoughts in a mother 's heart ; and while she leads them homeward , painful questions stir within her as to the practical effect of their regular attendance at church . Is it not really teaching them to call the Sabbath a weariness , to sit before the Lord as his people sit , while the ever busy mind is far away , seeking relief from its own bright imaginings ? " But hear this witness further : " The loud tone of declamation conveys to a young child the idea of anger ; and the image von . xxi. 36 // of an angry minister becomes associated with that of an angry God . This is one reason why the religion of children is often one of fear ; hence often arise those vague and terrif*ying thoughts which darken their bright and confiding spirits , and scare them from the tender arms of the good shepherd . What a blessing it would be to mothers and children , aye , to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their firesides to the pulpit the simple , friendly tone of conversation on spiritual things . " A blessing indeed ! but alas , both the pulpit and the pew , acting and reacting upon each other , have come to an agreement that the dignity of the minister , and not less the dignity of the congregation , demands an intellectual , scholastic , and eloquent presentation , such as shall authorize the people to glory in their minister . Because of this bad anibition , some of our churches are weak and sickly , and some sleep . " We have been told , " says that mother , " by an aged minister , that he had taken great pains to ascertain what kind of preaching was most used of God in converting and edifying men ; and the inquiries of a long life , among Christians of different denominations , had brought him to this conclusion , namely , that most good is done by conversational preaching . " Of course it would be so . And this kind of preaching has the sanction of our Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traditional persuasion , such the self-perpetuating influence of scholastic usage , and of esprit du corps , that the great majority of preachers will go through life reiterating their melancholy confessions of dissatisfaction with their ministry , sacrificing both good sense and usefulness , rather than break away from the established order of reading the old to sleep and the young into hatred of the day and house of God . Now there are not a few ministers , good men and true , who seem to have no suspicion that this is not an inevitable and unchangeable order of things . They will tell you , and tell you truly , that they can not preach to children , and there they rest-nay , there 's little rest in it  --  but there they stick fast . " It would almost seem , " says the mother I have quoted , " that the King 's ambassadors are acting in the belief that his rule // has been reversed ; that it has now become God 's method to reveal these things to the wise and prudent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often characterized as an intelligent age ; it would , perhaps , be more just to speak of it as an age of remarkable mental activity ; but in all that pertains to religious instruction , the common , not to say constant mistake , is to assume a correctness of apprehension that does not exist . We are not sufficiently mindful that as the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God , so every degenerate man is slow of heart , both to understand and to believe all the prophets , apostles and our Lord himself have spoken ; and the large majority of all our congregations require , not necessarily monosyllables , but truth in that form , easy of apprehension , which animated conversation offers . " Tn former days , " says the writer quoted , " nothing was brought down to the capacity of childhood ; the week-day task and the Sabbath sermon were alike unintelligible . But now the sermon stands in contrast with all the other means of instruction provided . " Lessons in everything but in religion are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tones , gestures , figures , illustrations , all spring into life spontaneously , offering the utmost power of persuasion , when an earnest man converses with those whom he desires to influence . The consciousness of getting hold of them unlocks his own fountains of feeling , and asks , and receives a corresponding outgoing of sympathy from them . Such were Christ 's conversation sermons ; and they are our model . And why should any of our preachers hesitate to accept them as such * Because it is not the fashion of our day . Because hardly a man , in or out of the pulpit , is able to believe that the ministry could sustain itself if divested of the flowing robes and embroidered garments of scholastic rhetoric . Because men are afraid to risk a style of sermonizing that has nothing to recommend it but its fitness to convince , convert , and persuade to holy living . We can put our finger at this moment upon a prominent church , past the incipient stage of dissolution , muortally stricken with this disease ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great shepherd could send them one clothed in the beauty of holiness , and apt // to teach ; but they must have a change of raiment ; not silk and muslin-they reject that , but are not less tenacious of what better deserves to be rejected as " millinery . " They can not venture their interests in the hands of one who is simply " strong in the Lord , and in the power of his might . " They are slow to believe that a shepherd 's sling and smooth stones out of the brook could be any match for the ponderous armor of the Philistine . Only those who , in their love and deference for our Lord 's teaching , have become as little children , are willing to throw themselves upon the simplest forms of speech as best adapted to convey the weightiest lessons in religions truth ; only those who have forgotten themselves in their tender concern for " the little ones , " and who are content to be esteemed fools for their sake and for Christ 's sake ; only these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can and will teach those who rely on him , how to converse with man about the things of God . Practically , many a preacher , many a church , too , are in the condition of those Ephesians who had not so munch as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost . No one will deny the superiority of written discourse in those characteristics , which commend such discourse to the admiration of the critical hearer ; for example in breadth of view ; in the comprehension of many particulars ; in scholastic method , in careful elaboration , in completeness , in finish and polish . But to meet the wishes of such hearers is very fhr from being the first duty , or the legitimate province of the preacher . When John sent two of his disciples to learn if Jesus were the Christ , one of the vouchers adduced was this : " To the poor the gospel is preached . " The poor are unlearned and uncritical . In that sense they constitute the majority of our congregations to-day . Christ 's method was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of preachers , keeping near to Christ , would be singular to-day , and for the same reason ; the supreme concern to persuade men to be reconciled to God , would put them upon that us of language which would get the ear and understanding of the multitude . And though a man here and there may be so endowed of God that his natural and proper line of things is to effect men most powerfully and usefully // by elaborate written discourse , the men who can do this are exceptions to the general rule . Where one is capable of doing this , and of so doing it as to rise superior to the natural inaptitude of most men to be swayed by such discours* , there are hundreds who can do nothing of the kind ; and whose attempts to do it can result in nothing but loss and detriment to their hearers , and disappointment and discouragement to themselves . The attainment of a decent mediocrity in this direction will be secured only by the sacrifice of nearly all the elements of power which belong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those who are addressed . Do we not all know that there are many men who converse well , who are very acceptable speakers in offhand discourse , who can contribute their full quota to the interest of any informal gathering , for almost any purpose , who no sooner enter the pulpit than the breath of common life forsakes them ; they have got above fruits and flowers , above animal life , away up in the region of dwarf shrubs and stunted pines , and near to perpetual frost . It is a transition from the walking-dress of prompt , animated , agreeable conversation , in which the speaker was entirely at home , and able to meet any demand made upon him , to the heavy armor of formal prelections , and the supposed necessity of marshaling platoons of unaccustomed polysyllables into active service , under a weight of dignity much more in accordance with a dress-parade , than with real work to be done . Immediate favor for the views now urged we do not expect ; and that for several reasons . The work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a different course . Teachers and preachers from time immemorial have accepted as the highest and almost only models , intellectual labors designed to win applause for their originality , imagination , logic , rhetoric , or learning . They are unable to believe that a departure from these models can be anything but a grievous loss to both speaker and hearer . It is in this view of the case that *e find some of them protesting that " the modes of thought and feeling in the pews ought to be raised to those of the pulpit , rather than the reverse . " They can not think it right to yield // to the growing demand for a less dignified and less scholastic presentation of truth ; they can not pander-so they esteem itto a depraved appetite for something stimulating . They feel sure that in so doing they should lower the standard and lessen the influence of preaching . Kow all such objections have a foundation , in part , in truth . There are undoubtedly men in every congregation , more or fewer , who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not go to church for religious instruction and improvement . But these objections are in part without foundation , because of assuming that the demand for a more animating style of preaching than sufficed our forefathers , necessarily involves the sacrifice of dignity , sound wisdom , and deep piety , and that this demand comes only from those who have itching ears . They have never witnessed , say the objectors , an instance of marked success in the conversational line ; they doubt if such a thing could be ; the nearest approaches to it they have ever seen were accompanied by such infelicities as made them cling to the old method with more tenacity than ever . They find no warrant in any conscious ability to accomplish much by pulpit conversation , to infer that the rising generation are likely to effect more . Why not be content with the old method which is safe , rather than attempt new ways , which are uncertain , and known to be attended with some risk ? Every department of life is filled with illustrations of a like unwillingness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have not forgotten the resistance steamboats and locomotives encountered , when it was proposed to substitute these for stage coaches and sailing vessels . We are all creatures of habit , and most unwilling to surrender the vantage ground and confidence which habit and use supply . There is a weighty reason for not being content with the old method of preaching ; it does not accomplish the work ; it does not persuade men . The preachers themselves being witnesses , our congregations are falling oil ' . There is reason to believe that the fault is with the pastors and churches ; we have no right to be content with the indifference to religious instruction which prevails . We all know that intelligent , animated conversation , on any topic , easily se // cures the attention of all within hearing , who are able to coinprehend the matter of it ; while preaching is almost a synonym for something which , though respectable for its origin and ostensible purpose , is hard to be endured , and , when possible , is to be assiduously avoided . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endure sermons with martyr resignation , as an inevitable evil , that religious teachings to be eagerly anticipated , and lovingly desired , are something seldom or never realized , and often regarded as without the pale of probability . There is no obligation to be longer resigned to this state of things . On the part of the people it would be an unworthy and censurable resignation , as implying an indifference to religious truth , whether it were made interesting and available or not ; making church-going significant of superstition , formalism , or hypocrisy . On the part of the preacher it would be the extreme of cowardice and inhumanity ; of supineness and of disloyalty to God . Such was not the resignation of the Apostle Paul , who says , " I am made all things to all men , that I might by all means save some . " We do not mean , for an instant , to deny that existing methods have done much for the limited number who have come under their best influences ; but we do mean to assert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arresting the attention , and of engaging the interest of the very large majority of men , women , and children . They are not won by them , and never will be won by them , to the knowledge and love of God . To indulge a vague belief that God will some day miraculously interpose to impart an irresistible efficacy to a kind of preaching which is at present so nearly powerless , is not the part of faith , but rather of presumption and of indolence ; it is to take a sleeping potion in place of shaking off dull sloth and girding on the whole armor of God . Resignation to an indifferent and apathetic audience , Christ and eternal life being the theme , when it rests with the preacher to rouse them to the highest condition of animated life , is worse than oriental fatalism . It is being resigned to have God 's work suffer in our hands ; resigned to the dishonor of God 's draughts on us for treasures placed in our hands for // their use . But , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest with me thus to rouse men to a sense of the worth of eternal things . No , nor will you be likely to become so , so long as you hang back and stand behind your written discourse , and fear to trust to the inspiration of the Spirit , even when you have done your utmost to penetrate and to be penetrated by truth . You pray , " Lord , increase my faith , " but refuse to venture in the strength of all his promises , to give the message entrusted to you its best chance to be heard and to win its way to the heart . It is a hopeful indication that some of our preachers are becoming alive to this ; that they are beginning to recognize the necessity of a change ; to realize the absurdity of entering the arena of strife for the souls of men , with a manuscript sermon , to read men out of confirmed habits of disobedience to God , and of neglect of their own souls , by a logical disquisition on the disadvantages of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly escapes , and which very few , with all the wear and tear of unnatural earnestness , can free from an irresistible soporific influence . God 's truth deserves to have every advantage of a living advocacy . God 's demand upon man is for his heart ; and whoever heard of winning love by reading ! Just conceive of human intercourse with all its thousand persuasive and winning ways of looks , tones , gestures , illustrations , and arguments , supplied by the spontaneity of exuberant life , put into the straight jacket of formal reading ! Men are called in the Scriptures " the children of the Most High ; " and God speaks of himself as a most tenderly affectionate Father . His messengers are sent to his obedient and also to his disobedient children ; with instructions to commend and encourage the one , and to reprove and reclaim the other . No instructions are given to read them disquisitional essays , but they are commanded to warn , and entreat , and instruct in word , in conversation , in charity , in spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course to read for their own profit and to store their minds and hearts , too , with matter for exhortation and for doctrine ; but being thus thoroughly furnished to every good work , they were to give the truth in such manner and form as would ensure // its doing its errand . Every friend of virtue knows the power of lively , animated conversation , in the hands of wicked men , to corrupt our youth ; but it is hard to convince those who have not made full proof of conversation for good purposes , how great a power is lying unused in their hands . We often hear it stated that preaching is God 's appointed method of saving the world ; and the passage is quoted , " It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe ; " but no evidence has been adduced to vindicate the assumption that the reading of written sermons is the preaching here intended . The reasonable presumption is that written sermons were wholly unknown when the Apostle recorded that fact . His charge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out of season , " harmonizes well with the supposition that he talked , talked earnestly , and as the Spirit gave him utterance . When Christ commanded his disciples , " Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature , " had he any intention that a line or two from that gospel should suffice as a mere motto to some long disquisition on the nature of true virtue , interspersed with hints of Christ and his salvation as remote from the apprehension of the common hearer as the fixed stars ? We have , it is true , a great many discourses that are not so bad as this ; but we have a great many that fail of establishing an inevitable conviction , this i8 the very word of God . We have many a prayer after a sermon , that God would bless his truth now presented , which starts the question , Has his truth been presented ? We had a good text ; but the long discourse failed of establishing any close and living relation to that text ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not resist the conviction that the Lord is of our mind , in demurring to recognize what has now been spoken , as his message to that congregation . We came to the house of prayer hoping to meet a messenger from God , speaking the truth in love ; not love in a figure , or on stilts ; not love " in linked sweetness long drawn out ; " or in wcIl rounded periods , in the full costume of pulpit rhetoric and logic ; but love unrestrained and overflowing from an inexhaustible foun // tam of divine and human tenderness , from the very life of God in the soul of man . In place of that we get an essay , a disquisition , a homily . We asked for bread , and received a stone . Take the ministerial account of existing failures ; here it is : " There is talent enough , thought enough , but lack of adaptation . " Could there be a greater lack than this ? Why a stone has weight , and form , and color , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nourish . The preaching which so extensively prevails may have a form of sacred words , but what if it fails to get the ear and the interest of the majority of the congregation ? Is it successful preaching ? * it is said , " preaching is different from anything else ; it has the peculiar disadvantage of offering an unwelcome theme ; for the majority of the people , like Gallio , care for none of these things . " It is not to be denied that " the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God ; " but the attempt to derive from this a full account of the want of interest in our Sabbath services , comes of an unwillingness to convict ourselves of failure in duty . The assertion , these are spiritual truths , which only the spiritual man can discern , is hastily , and most unwarrantably , assumed to be equivalent to the declaration , that faithful preaching must necessarily be uninteresting to the majority of any cougregation . This assumption , if allowed , would certainly offer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect uninteresting and unproductive discourses from rebuke and censure ; but it can not be allowed , for it is utterly untrue . The real account of the matter has been perhaps inadvertently , but truly given ; the sermons which fail to get the ear and interest of our congregations , " fail through lack of adaptation . " " What ! " it will perhaps be demanded , with flushed cheek and perturbed mind , " do you mean to assert that I do not preach that gospel which Si . Paul declares to be the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth " ' ? We assert nothing . We simply assent to what you have affirmed , as a truth confirmed by our own observation , that there is in most preaching a lack of adaptation . It is adapted to weary and to alienate , not to interest and to enlist in the service of // Christ . It seems in yonr hands to lack the manliness and the heartiness of the Apostle whom you have quoted . The man who gloried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and affliction , who declared , " None of these things move me , neither count I my life dear unto myself so that I might finish my course with joy and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus , to testify the gospel of the grace of God . " Think you this man ever contented himself with reading his message to an uninterested congregation , consoling himself under his unproductive labor with the assertion that the gospel must needs be dull to the unspiritual ? No indeed ! that did not the Apostle Paul . He had experience of congregations of all sorts ; believing and unbelieving ; decorous and riotous ; assenting and dissenting ; but uninterested ! - never . " Well , what would you have ? He that finds fault with our existing order of things is bound to point out the remedy . How shall we amend ? " We answer , get a deeper experience of the love of God in your own soul . Give yourself to Christ in a far more comprehensive consecration than you have ever yet attained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you shall dare to tell it , naturally , earnestly , with a single eye and heart to the weal of your hearer ; in sublime indifference to all that the schools and the schoolmen have to say against untramineled conversational preaching . You want nothing but a greatly increased knowledge , and fearless love of Christ , and of his love to man , to supply all your lack of adaptation . Get this and you will need no argument in favor of a natural and most effective manner of preaching . And do not fail to rememuber that you can have what you need for the asking ; for your Heavenly Father is more willing to give his Spirit to them that ask him , than parents to give good gifts to their children .
