ATLANTIC MONTHLY . A Magazz*ze of Lileralure , An , and Po/ilics . VOL . XV . - JUNE , 1865. - NO . XCII . A LETTER ABOUT ENGLAND . DEAR MR . EDITOR ,  --  The name of your magazine shall not deter me from sending you my slight reflections . But you have been across , and will agree with me that it is the great misfortune of this earth that so much salt-water is still lying around between its various countries . The steam-condenser is supposed to diminish its bulk by shortening the transit from one point to another ; but a delicate conscience must aver that there is a good deal left . The ocean is chiefly remarkable as the element out of which the dry land came . It is only when the land and sea combine to frame the mighty coast-line of a continent , and to fringe it with weed which the tide uncovers twice a day , that the mind is saluted with health and beauty . The fine instinct of Mr. Thoreau furnished him with a truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toss with the mysterious element ; for he says ,  --  " The middle sea contains no crimson dulse , Its deeper waves cast up no pearls to view , Along the shore my hand is on its pulse , And I converse with many a shipwrecked crew . " On the broad Atlantic there is no smell of the sea . That comes from the brown rocks whence iodine is exhaled to brace the nerves and the fancy , while summer woods chasten all the air . At best , the ocean is austere and unsympathetic ; and a sensible , that is , a sensitive , stomach understands it to be demoralized by the monstrous krakens which are viciously brooding in its depths . ( If the pronoun " it , " in the last sentence , should refer to stomach , the sense will still be clear . ) In fact , this water has been left over from the making of the earth : like the Dodo and the Moa , it should have evaporated . How pleasant it is to be assured by Sir Charles Lyell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the globe ! for we may anticipate that millennial epoch when there shall be " no more sea. ** However , the old impression which great spaces used to make upon the imagination gives way to the new sensation of annihilating spaces . It would be more correct now to speak of differences than of distances . The difference between one country and another is all that now makes the distance between them . For man is now overcoming space faster than he is obliterating national peculiarities . And when one goes abroad , the universal humanity in whose interest all material and political tri Entered according to Act of Congress , in the year 5865 , by TICKNOR AND FIELDS , in the Clerk 's Office of the District Court of the District of Massachusetts . // umphs are gained is not felt by him so s&amp;on as the specific divergence which makes the character of lands and people . Oaks and elms , hawthorn and beeches , are on either side the ocean ; but you measure the voyage by their unlikeness to each other , and wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripens with a different flavor and texture . The sun is less racy in all the common garden-stuff whose names we know . Pears and peaches we are disappointed in recognizing ; they seem as if ripened by the sun 's proxy , the moon ; and our boys would hardly pick up the apples in the fields . But England undulates with grass that seems to fix the fluent color of the greenest waves on either hand . And our eagleeyed blue sky droops its lid over the island , as the moisture gathers , with a more equable compassion than we know for all shrubs and blades and grazing cattle . Both , the pain and the tonic in being absent from your home and country are administered by difference . In gulping that three thousand miles the taste is austere , but the stimulus is wholesome . We learn to appreciate , but also to correct , the fare we have at home . The difference is twofold between England and America . England differs , first ; in the inveterate way in which the people hold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gradual , but equally inveterate , way in which they labor to improve their inheritance . The future is gained by the same temper in which the past is held ; so that , if the past is secure , the future is also : none the less because the past seems so irrevocably built , but rather in consequence of that , because it betrays the method of the builders . These two characteristics , apparently irreconcilable , are really organic , and come of position , climate , diet , and slowly amalgamated races of men . Herne 's oak in Windsor Forest and the monarchy in Windsor Castle grew on the same terms . Branch after branch the oak has fallen , till on the last day of the summer of 1863 the wind brought the shattered remnant to the , ground . Whether the monarchy decay like this or not , it has served to shelter a great people ; and the English people is still vital with its slow robustness , and is good for depositing its annual rings these thousand years . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The superficial view of England breeds a kind of hopelessness in the mind of the observer . He says to himself , - " All these stereotyped habits and opinions , these ways of thinkinb , writing , building , living , and dying , seem irrepealable ; and the worst fault of their comparative excellence is , that they appear determined not to yield another inch to improvement . " The Englishman says that America is forever bullying with her restlessness and innovation . The , American might at first say that England bullied by never budging , - bullied the future , and every rational or humane suggestion , by planting a portly attitude to challenge the New Jerusalem in an overbearing chest voice , through which the timid clarion of the angels is not heard . If an observer knows anything of the history of England , he can not deny that vast changes have been made in every department of life : domestic habits , social economics , the courts of law , the Church , the liberty of the press and of speech , in short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which mankind travels to its ultimate purpose , have been graded , widened , solidly equipped and built . A thousand years have converted three or four races into one people ,  --  and all that time and weather have made upon it such strong imprints that you can not see the difference between a pyramid and a cathedral sooner than you can the distinctive nationality of England . But for that very reason you despair of it , just as you do of a cathedral which can not be adapted to the wants of a new religious age . At the same time that you venerate the history of England , and are thankful for the great expansion which she gave to human rights , you almost quarrel // 1865.1 with it , because at first it seems like an old stratum with its men and women imbedded ; its institutions , once so softly and lightly deposited , now become a tough clay ; its structures , once so curiously devised for living tenants , now crusts and shells ; its tracks of warm and bleeding feet now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression . All this is due to the first glance you get at the hard , realistic England of today . You have noticed a machine clutch its raw material and twist and turn it through its relentless bowels . That is the way the habits of England seize you when you land , and begin to appropriate your personality . This is the first offence of England in the eyes of an American , whose favorite phrase , " the largest liberty , " is too synonymous with the absence of any settled habits . Prescribed ways of doing everything are the scum which a traveller first gathers in England . Perhaps he thinks that he has caught the English nationality in his skimmer ; and as he rather contemptuously examines these topmost and handiest traits , he grumbles to himself that these are the habits of a very old nation , that lives on an island , and keeps up a fleet , not to bridge , but to widen narrow seas . Such respect for routine and observance can nowhere else beperceived . An American is so little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it even in railway-stations , where it is most excellent . But it penetrates all forms and institutions ; the Established Church itself is a specimen of complete arranging and engineering ; the worshippers are classified , ticketed , and despatched safely rolling on the broad gauge of the Liturgy , in confidence of being set down at last where the conductors have contracted to take them . How accurately everybody in England knows his own place ! - and he accepts it , however humble , with a determined feeling that it is inevitable . The audience is so packed that everybody remains quiet . The demeanor of the servants is as settled and universally deferential as Westminster Abbey is Gothic . Mr. Lindsay or Mr. 643 Roebuck might forget to revile America , or Lord Palmerston , England 's right hand , forget his cunning , as soon as a servant might forget his place . A thousand years have settled him in it ; and you are supposed by him to have had the benefit of as many years in determining your own position and relation to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hat to you ; it is as if he had discharged something into you by the gesture , which is likely to exhaust him , and you expect to have to offer him a chair . But his deference is an integral part of the stability of England . When he forgets it , look for a panic in the Exchange , the collapse of credit , and the assassination of the Queen . This mutual deference in a country that is so strictly apportioned into castes becomes an unconscious toadyism , which is saved from being very repulsive only by the frank and childlike ways of the people . If it is carried too far , they are the first to see it . The " Times " could not report a case of murder without remarking , as it described the direction of the fatal shot , " - What was a very singular fact , a part of the charge , after crossing the apartment , entered a picture of her Majesty the Queen on the opposite wall " ; - that is , in committing the murder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have stuck to its busin*ss , instead of violating one of the chief proprieties of a limited monarchy . But when the Queen went down to Greenwich summer before last to embark for Belgium , an over-zealous official issued an order that no person should be admitted into the yard of the dock , no workman should cross the yard while she was in it , and no one should look out of a window until she had gone . This was his British sense of the behavior due to a Queen who was in mourning for her husband , and might dislike to be observed . But the whole press derided this order , and subjected it to indignant criticism ; the officer was styled *unky and tyrant , and the Queen herself was obliged to rebuke and disavow it . // In doing everything in England , there is so little excitement , because it is felt to be irregular . The temper of ' the people is well kept by the smooth and even island air ; the moist southwestern winds come and soothe with calm lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows its place ; and when once it succeeded in passing through twenty degrees in the course of a day , the oldest inhabitant of London grew anxious ; it was feared that stocks , too , would fall . The thunderstorms understand propriety , and simply growl , like the dissatisfied Englishman . Vivid effects , sharp contrasts , violent exertions , can not be sustained in that insular atmosphere . It seems as if London , like a lover of the weed , were pacified by its own smoke . I saw two huge wagons turn from opposite quarters into a narrow lane . The drivers kept their horses moving till the heads of the leaders touched ; then they sat still and looked at each other . Both were determined that it was a point of honor to stay where they were . After a few words of rather* substantial English had passed between them , both subsided into a dogs e d equanimity . A crowd gathered instantly , but with as little tumult as ants make ; it regarded the occurrence as a milder form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policeman passed blandly from one wagon to the other , represented the necessities of the public traffic , hoped they would settle it shortly , urged the matter as an intimate friend of the parties , till at length the man who was conscious that he turned into the lane the last gathered up his reins and backed out of it . It was a little index of the popular disposition ; and I expected that as soon as the country became convinced that it had driven rashly into our civil strait , it would deliberately back out of it . And this it is now slowly engaged in doing . The two great parties of the Church and Liberalism are blocking each other in the same manner ; but in this case Liberalism has turned into the great thoroughfare of the world 's movement , June , and finds the Church , like a disabled omnibus , disputing the passage by simply lying across it . Dr. Temple and one hundred liberal Fellows of Oxford sent up to Parliament a petition which prayed for the abolition of the subscription test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for academic degrees : one to the Thirty-Nine Articles , and one to the third article of the thirty-sixth Canon . Liberal clergymen and members of the Church of England find this test odious , because it constrains the conscience to accept ancient formulas of belief without the benefit of private interpretation . The conservatives desire to maintain the test , thinking that it will be a barrier to the tide of private interpretation which is just now mounting so high . The petitioners perceive that no test can prevent a man from having his own thoughts ; that it is therefore obsolete ; that it drives out of the Church the best men , - those , namely , who think with independent vigor , and whose activity would put a new soul into the old Establishment . When this petition came up for debate in the House of Commons , the conservative speakers accused the petitioners of wishing to set up a new school of theological belief and criticism . Mr. Gladstone made a speech , full of grace and an even vigor , to the effect that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as those which the Church possessed ; the idea was to his mind as absurd as to conceive of manifestations of life without a body . Mr. Goschen , the new member from London , made his maiden speech on this occasion . It was very earnest and liberal , and reminded one of American styles of speaking , being less even and conversational than the style which Englishmen admire . His opinion was , that all tests should be abolished , and that inclusion was safer than exclusion : meaning that the Church ought to keep herself so organized as to absorb the best vitality of every generation , instead of turning it out to become cold and hos A Let/er about England . // tile . The phrase which he used is the very essence of a republican policy . It represents the tendency of the people of England , as distinguished from its ministers and the traditions of its government . That phrase will one day be safely driven clear through the highway where the omnibus is now lying ; hut for the present , the abolition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every shade of dissent , and the graver political reformation which waits behind all these are held in check by the vis jizer/ice of an Establishment that lies across the road . During the exciting anti-church-rate contests of 1840 , the Church party in Rochdale , which had been defeated in an attempt to levy a church-rate where for several years none had been collected , held a meeting to try the matter over again . It was adjourned from the church to the graveyard . The vicar , as chairman , occupied one tombstone , and John Bright stood upon another to make one of his- strong defences of the rights of Voluntaryism . In the course of the discussion , the vicar 's warden rendered an account of the dilapidations of the building which the proposed rate was to repair , and stated , with great simplicity , that " the foundations were giving way , " - a significant remark , which the meeting , though held in a grave place , received with shouts of laughter . Such a statement may well be taken as symbolical of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented by Colenso , Stanley , Jowett , Baden Powell , and a respectable minority , is silently crumbling the underpinning , while the full service is intoned above and the pampered ceremonial swells the aisles . If the opponents of liberal thinking ever bring an action against a prominent dissenter from their views , the Privy Council gets rid of the case by deciding it upon the purely technical position of the Church , - as in the case of Dr. Williams , whose offence was the publication of his Essay on Bunsen , and Mr. Wilson , whose essay was entitled " S6ances Ilistoriques de 645 Gen*ve - The National Church . " The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council decide that they have no power to define what is true and what is false doctrine , but only what has been established to be the law of the Church upon the true and legal construction of her Articles and Formularies . I. The Church does not require her clergy to believe in the inspiration of all portions of the Scriptures . II . Nor that the Atonement operates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III . Nor that the phrase " everlasting fire , " in the Athanasian Creed , is to be received as a final and hopeless statement . As a specimen of the popular element which is at work among the un* educated classes to make the people itself of England its real church , it is worth while to observe what Mr. Spurgeon is doing . His chapel stands on the southern side of the Thames , between the Victoria and Surrey Theatres , where the British subject is served with the domestic and nautical drama . On those stages the language struts and aspirates , and the effects are borrowed from Vauxhall and Cremorne for plays which are constructed to hold the greatest possible amount of cockneyism and grotesqueness , with the - principal object of showing how villany and murder are uniformly overcome by virtue , whose kettle sings upon the hob -* above a pile of buttered muffins at last ; , and the pit , which came in for a shilling , pays the extra tribute of a tear . These . shop-keepers of the Surrey side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early preaching betrayed the proximity of the theatres , but was for that very reason admirably seasoned to attract his listeners . If he ev-. er did slide down the rail of his pulpit-stairs , as reported , in order to dramatize the swift descent of the soul into iniquity , and then painfully climb up again to show its difficult return , the action was received , doubtless , in its . full ethical import , and shook the ' sub- . urban heart . His . blunt and ordinary . ' A Let/er about England . // language , sinning frequently against taste , and stooping sometimes to be coarse , was the very vehicle to take his hearers up at the pit-door , theatrical or theolo5 ical , and send them in wholesomer directions . It was a fortunate - his co-religionists would say providential - adaptation of an earnest and religious man to the field of his labor . For , as time passed , the phrases and demeanor of his preaching improved , - their absurdities have , no doubt , been caricatured by the London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more plainly observed to be sincere , fervent , and devoted to a certain set of religious preconceptions . The want of culture and of general intelligence was not so lamentable in such a neighborhood . He led , by many lengths , the Victoria and Surrey stage . If he had more deeply reflected upon the subjects which he handled like a simple-hearted boy , he would have failed to keep four thousand men and women warm in the hollow of his hand from Sunday to Sunday , for a dozen years , and to organize their whole moral and religious activity in forms that are admirably adapted to carry on the work of popular dissent . His audience represents the district , and is an advertisement of the kind of spiritual instruction which it needs and gets . Not many large heads sit in the pews ; narrowness , unreflecting earnestness , and healthy desires are imprinted upon the faces upturned towards his clear and level delivery . He is never exactly vapid , and he never soars . His theology is full of British beer ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piety is a lucid interval by which the hearers profit . They follow his textual allusions in their little Bibles , and devoutly receive the crude and amusing interpretations as utterances of the highest exegetical skill . But their faces shine when the discourse moralizes ; it seems to take them by the button , so friendly it is , - hut it looks them closely in the eye , without heat and distant zeal , with great , manly expostulation , rather , and *half- humorous - argument , that sometimes make the tears stand upon the lids . The florid countenances become a shade paler with listening , the dark complexions glow with a brooding religiosity . It is plain that he has a hungry people , and feeds them with what suits their frames the best . His clear voice , well fuelled by a full , though rather flabby frame , rolls into all the galleries and corners of the vast building without effort ; his gestures are even and well balanced ; and you are , in fact , surprised to see how good a natural orator he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find some justification for the stories which impute to him a low and egotistic presence , and a delivery that depends upon broadness for its effects . But he appears unpretending , in spite of the satisfied look which he casts around the congregation when he first steps to the railing of the platform . He is evidently conscious that he owns the building and the audience ; but , content with that , he makes no attempt to put them in his pocket ; on the contrary , he almost instantly becomes seriously engaged in transferring into them his lesson for the day . His style of extemporaneous speaking is conversational , - the better English suspect all other styles , - and this of itself shows what improvement has taken place in the Surrey region . If at first he indulged in rant , he has now subsided into an even vein ; he puts things plumply , and tells his feelings gravely , and makes his points without quackery . So it is plain that when he gives notice of a contribution for his college , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply , in justification , that one hundred and fifty have already left it , and are now engaged in preaching the dissenting word , he is to be regarded as one of the decided influences which are now at work to bring the people up to self-consciousness , self-respect , and political importance . - It is very characteristic that the National Church is called an Establishment , - in other words , something that stays where it was put some time ago . // The thing which ought to move first , and move continually through all the avenues of the public life , to keep them clear of the obstructions of ignorance and superstition , and prevent the great travel and intercourse of thought from stagnating , is the thing in England which is most unwilling to stir . Already a fearful accumulation of passengers and vehicles , whose patience is nearly exhausted , is anxious to be let through in time to keep appointment with the world 's grave business . Young thoughts are hurrying tobe indorsed ; mature paper dreads to be protested ; the hour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depend upon it , at the critical moment , when the pressure in the rear becomes the most emphatic , the people in the omnibus will have to get out and assist the passengers in drawing it to one side , where it will remain a long time unmolested . But the first thing which you say concerning the men and institutions of England is , that they are established . In America some things are finished before they are done ; but there are no tottering trestle-bridges on the routes of English enterprise to let the travellers through . When a business firm becomes fairly built up , it lasts a hundred years or more . Shop-signs are not taken down except by the weather ; new fronts grow so slowly , along the ancient streets that they appear to be deposited by secretion , like corals and shells . I took a book to a printer , and found he was the grandson of the man who published " Junius " in 1769 , doing business in the same dingy court and office , with the old regularity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time , I should have to risk formidable errata and print at the rate of sixtyfour pages a day , he plainly suspected me of derangement and of a desire to impart my condition to his machinery . On repeating it with calmness , he set it down for Yankee braggadocio , and assured me that not an author in England could print at that rate . Then he went to work . They detest being hurried , but their latent momentum is very great . Limited suffrage and many administrative abuses will feel it soon , as similar things have felt it before . But you are deceived at first , and anticipate deterioration rather than improvement for the people of England . The city of London , with its two and a half millions of inhabitants , looks like a huge stone that has been pried over a sweet well ; nobody need expect to draw water there any more ; fresh ones must be dug , we say , in America , in Russia , to reach primitive human nature again , and set it free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had slowly grown from the soil and the climate , like a lichen that clings closely to its rocky site . The heavy , many - storied buildings of Portland stone are blackened by the smoke till they appear more like quarries than habitations ; the swarms of human beings look ephemeral as moths . The finest architecture becomes in a few years undistinguishable , and delicate ornamentation is as much superfluous as among the weather-stained cliffs and boulders of the coast . Monumental inscriptions are smutted and half-obliterated , but the scurf protects the monument . Under the huge pile of St. Paul 's the ceaseless traffic of human passions passes as through a defile of the hills . When the lights spring forth towards evening , and *parkle on the great dull masses , it seems as if the buildings had been there forever , and forever would be , endowed with some elemental process which puts forth the lighting . Newgate itself , without windows towards the street , a huge angle of dead walls , with heavy iron fetters suspended over the gateways , and statues so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ever did or could suggest humanity , is a settled gloom in the midst of the city , like the thought of a discouraged and defeated man . It has a terrible suggestion that crime itself is established in London , - immutable methods of being guilty and of being condemned , - all old , old , and irrepealable . From Primrose Hill , beyond Regent 's Park , and towards the open country , // the profile of the city can be seen at one view , as it emerges from the smoke , is heavily described athwart it , and plunges into it again , like a great , silent feature of the earth itself , lifted in an atmosphere whose density seems to be a part of the antiquity . Hidden in that smoke the streets roll ' night and day , like great arteries , to feed , replace , repair , business , pleasure , and misery , but to change it no more than the blood changes the tricks of an old brain or the settled beating of a stubborn heart . These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impression that the vigor and glory of Ery , land have culminated , and would fall apart sooner than take on new forms or yield to the moulding power of popular ideas . The impression is deepened by the feeling of hostility to American institutions , and by the special dislike of the North , which the past four years have betrayed . The commercial and ruling classes had been skilfully prepared , by applications of Southern sentiment , for the declaration of neutrality , which was supposed to contain the triple chance of destroying a dangerous republic , of securing unlimited supplies of cotton by free-trade , and of erecting in the South an oligarchic form of government . Under the circumstances , they felt that neutrality was a kind ot merit in them , and a magnanimity which the declining North ought to have hailed with enthusiasm , as it showed that England scorned to take a more deadly advantage of our perilous position . This antiNorthern feeling is , and always has been , confined to the Tory classes , in and out of the Government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High-Churchmen . Even an American resident , if he was wealthy , and liked the Church of England , and had settled down into a British country-seat with British ways of living , would be sure to misrepresent the North , to be pleased at its defeats and annoyed by its successes , partly from commercial and partly from pro-slavery considerations . The America which he remembered , and re gretted that he could not still be proud of , was the America where Pierce and Buchanan were Presidents , where Jefferson Davis and John B. Floyd were Secretaries of War . He had , in short , become a Tory ; for Toryism is regard for usages at the expense of men . He and the English Tory desired the triumph of Slavery , because it was the best thing for the negro , and the quietest thing for trade and government . The only difference between them is , that he would own slaves , if he had an opportunity , while the Englishman would not , partly because his own servants are so excellent . But both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The English Tory hates to have the poor classes of London use the railways on the Lord 's Day , to go and find God 's beauty in the Crystal Palace and the daisy-haunted fields . One of the most striking spectacles in London is found on Sunday , by standing on some bridge that spans the Thames , to watch the little riversteamers , black with human beings , that shoot like big water-bugs from the piers every five minutes , and fussily elbow their way down-stream to various places of resort . On that day people cluster like bees all over the omnibuses , till the vehicle looks like a mere bill of humanity stuck together , rolling down to some excursion - train . This is a bitter sight to an old-fashioned Churchman. * The American Tory will * Mr. Holynake , in an article upon the condition of the lead-miners of Middlesborough , says , while urging the nced of excursions and some forms of recreation , - " The rough , uncultivated workman is driven to seek in heer and licentiotisness that recreation which a wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nature . If excursionswere possible and encouraged , the wife must go as well as the husband ; and if the mother went , the children would go ; and if the children went , it would be impossible to take them in rags and dirt . The pride of the father would he awakened . His pipe and pot would often be laid upon the shelf , and the proceeds spent in Sunday clothes for the children . The steamboat and excursion-train are as great moralizers in their way as the chureb and the preacher . We call the at-tention of the British Association to this osatter , for here their influence would bring about an improvement . They will send a board of geologists to examine the condition of the earth of Cleveland , which can very well take care of itself . Let them send a board of their eminent physicians to look after the condition of the people . " 648 June , // hate any day that releases the poor and the oppressed into God 's glorious liberty . One of the most worthy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tory of this description : worthy , because honest and clean and free from vice ; offensive , because totally destitute of republican principle . If stripped of his wealth , he might become a rich man 's invaluable flunky , and carry the decorous prayer - book to church , bringing up the rear of the family with formalism . Toryism has a profound respect for external godliness , and remembers that the Southerner sympathizes with bishops , who , like Meade of Virginia , preach from the text , " Servants , obey your masters , " and , like Polk of Louisiana , convert old sermons upon the divine sanction of Slavery into cartridge-paper . We must recollect , too , that a good many educated Englishmen dislike republican institutions because they have identified the phrase with all the atrocious things which successive pro-slavery administrations have conceived and perpetrated ; for the Englishman is dull at understanding foreign politics , and reads the " Times , " though he strongly avers that he is not influenced by it . An administration appears to an Englishman to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of republicanism , for a Washington cabinet has not till lately spoken the mind of the common people . But when he understands us better he will dread us all the more , because the people in all countries speak the same language in expressin* the same wants ; and when universal suffrage puts universal justice on its throne in America , injustice will everywhere uneasily await the ballot which shall place it in the minority . The dislike of the English Tory is already passing into this second stage , when his hope of a dissolved Union gives place to his dread of a regenerated country that hastens to propagate its best ideas . There were three elements in this anti-Northern feeling . First , a sympathy with the smaller and feebler party . This 649 is a trait which puts the English people by the side of the Turk in the Crimea , the Circassian in the Caucasus , the Pole , the Dane , - which inspired Milton 's famous letter , in the name of Cromwell , that espoused the cause of the Waldenses . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with England , the country hurries to protect it . But where , as in the case of the Irish , the Sepoy , the NewZealander , the Caffre , and the Chinese , England 's interest is touched by the objections of people to her own harsh and inveterate rule , she has no magnanimity , and forgets the sentiments of her nobler minds . The same Cromwell who threatened Europe in behalf of the Waldenses contrived the massacre of the Irish at Drogheda . So when sympathy with the distant South harmonized with dread of the North , she was willingly misled by Southern agents to see a war of conquest and aggression . The second element is a fear of the ultimate consequences of a Union reconstructed without Slavery ; for then Mr. Bright may argue in favor of universal suffrage , uninterrupted by allusions to the arrogance and coarseness , the boastful and aggressive spirit belonging to a pro-slavery America . " Why do you desire the dissolution of the Union ? " asked one Englishman of another . " Oh , I have no reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them humbled . " But we were the weakest when Slavery made us so loud-mouthed and vaporing ; we shall be strongest when the cause of our boasting has disappeared . When a country is fully conscious of the print ciples that belong to it , and sees them cleansed with her children 's blood through eyes that stand full with tears , she will invite , but no longer threaten ; and the flag which she once waved in the face of all mankind to exasperate will rain persuasion as often as it is unfurled . But it will he a long time before the Englishman appreciates the altered condition of this country and resigns his prejudices , in consequence of another // element in this un-American feeling , namely , insular ignorance . Among the contraband articles which are with difficulty smuggled into any point of the English coast is an accurate knowledge of the polity and condition of another country . Indifference is the coastguard which protects , without moving , every inlet and harbor . The Englishman is surprised , if all the world is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a written document , hut a practical result that appears in all the administrative forms of the country , and can be studied only on the spot ; but he will not take the trouble to inquire into the relation which the separate States bear to the Federal government ; and he seems prevented by some congenital deficiency from understanding how the latter is the direct result of the independence of the former . The question he asks most frequently is , " Why has not an independent State the right to secede ? " He is infected by nature with Mr. Calhoun 's fallacy . You can not make a Tory understand that powers are derived from the consent of the governed , and that the consent is itself an institution . " What becomes of State rights ? he asks . And when you reply , that the concentred function of each State is contained within a diffused popular will whose centre is at Washington , and that thirty-four concentrations of this kind are nothing more than thirty-four general conveniences , he takes you slowly by the button , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is a Northern crotchet , which this civil war has come to cure , ** and then he leaves you . It is in vain that you shout after him , " That is a Northern principle , which this war has come to confirm " : he was out of hearing before he left . You feel that you are a stranger in the house of your own mother . You walk about among these slow , good - natured men , with plump boys ' faces and men 's chests , and hear them speak your language without your sense . They have a limited one , like their monarchy . How admirably it keeps the square miles of their own island ! how shockingly it tends the acres of Ireland I how haughtily it ignored and trampled upon the instincts of the Hindoo ! how unwilling it is to see a difference between the circumstances of Australia and those of England ! How it blundered into a neutrality which was a recognition of infamy ! This is the distance which Toryism spreads between the mother country and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a final statement of the prospects of England , or of its relation to America . There is , in the first place , a breat popular sympathy with the North , and it prophesies the future condition of England . When you use the phrase , " people of England , " understand that the Toryism which governs England is left out . Bigoted Churchmen , who are afraid that the island will drag its anchor because Bishop Colenso notices some errors in the Pentateuch , - shifty politicians , like Russell and Palmerston , - sour ones , like Roebuck , - scandalous ones , like Lindsay , - and conservatives , like Cecil and Gladstone , now make all the political blunders which they call governing England . Their constituents are two thirds of the merchants , nearly all the literary men , nearly all the clergymen , half the University fellows and professors . But the people of England have not yet been mentioned . They govern England at this moment , and yet John Bright sits almost alone for them in Parliament ; John Stuart Mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost their only powerful writers . The people of England put the broad arrow of their Queen upon the Rebel rams . They stay at home , and by taking the penny papers slowly undermine the " Times . " They have defeated every attempt to organize a party for Southern recognition , by simply staying away from the public meetings which the sympathizers called . Once they uttered their opinion by the lips of starving operatives , when the distress in the manufacturing districts was deepest , and capitalists were chary of their aid . The Southern agent was busy then , in all the towns and villages where the // misery dwelt . " You are starving . " - " Yes . " - " And it is for want of cotton . " - " So it seems . " - " Well , do you mean to sit here ? Come out in great force , as in the old Chartist times ; tell the manufacturer and the minister to break that blockade and let bread into the mouths of your little ones . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starve . " Again and again , the answer was , " We would rather starve . " And this haggard patience was saving the manufacturer himself from ruin , who had been engaged in over-manufacturing , till his warehouses groaned with an enormous stock which the cotton blockade enabled him to work off Great fortunes have been . m*tde in this way , while the operative slowly went to rags , road-mending , and the poor-rates . In London , hard upon midnight , I have often been attracted by the sound of street - music to a little group , in the centre of which stood half a dozen pallid and threadbare men , playing gentle tunes upon the faithful instruments which clung to their sad fortunes . And on a square of canvas , lighted by a lantern , or set in the flaring gas , I have read , to the sound of these paupers music , the story of America : " Lancashire Weavers out of Work , " " Poor Operatives ' Band , - a penny , if you please . " That music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is the pulse of the people of England , responding in the faint distance to the throb of victory . Another sight which can be seen by day in London streets belongs also to the people of England . When there was a dearth of troops during the Crimean War , the coast forts were stripped of their garrisons , and there was a call made by Government for volunteers to fill their places . Citizens came forward and manned the forts . This was the origin of the volunteer force of England , which has grown to be very formidable , - since jealousy of France , dread of invasion , and the need of troops for India have always deterred the Government from recalling the arms which it first put into the hands of the people . The force now comprises infantry , cavalry , light and heavy artillery , organized like the regular army , and under the control of the Horse Guards . Rifle-corps and target-practice have become a mania . The Government encourages it by magnificent reviews and prizes for the best shooting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target . But a bloody revolution can hardly occur again in England . It will only be necessary , at some critical moment , for the London volunteers to march as far as Charing-Cross on their way towards Parliament and the Palace . The concession would be there before them . Mr. Holyoake , who is one of the most vigorous champions of free thought and popular rights in England , says ,  --  " Revolution is no longer necessary in English politics . Our wise and noble forefathers , of those old times of which ntodern radicals in many towns know too little , laid broad foundations of freedom in our midst . It only needs that we build upon these , and the English educated classes , who always move in the grooves of precedent , will acquiesce with a reasonable readiness . " * The feeling of the radical class of English workmen is elsewhere illustrated by Mr. Holyoake with a story from the Allendale mining district . " Four miners published a volume of poems . One of these four in his poem talks of tyranny falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a hurry . A voice of thunder ' is to proclaim its doom . Alas , it is the voice of steady intelligent purpose , much more difficult to elicit , and not that of'thunder , ' which is to accomplish that . The poet of course has a vision about the equal share ' which the fall of tyranny is to end in . The equal share ' system would not last a day , as everybQdy who reflects knows , and would give endless trouble to renew it every morning . " t * From an admirable oration , delivered at Rochdale , Feb. 2 , 2864 , upon the political services and career of the late Alderman Livesey . From a very lively and instructive report of a visit of the British Association , in 2863 , to Mr. Beaumont 's lead mines at Allenbeads , fifty miles from Newcastle . // It is a striking characteristic of English Toryism , that it gives way just in time . Every reform has hitherto been granted as it was on the point of being extorted . Official carriages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-willed head ; Lady Macbeth might wash her hands as soon as the En lish people their memories of the civil bloodstain . Toryism knows one thing well : that no water-pipes can be made strong enough to withstand the sudden stoppage of a long column of water . They will burst and overflow . No matter what material maybe in motion , if the motion be suddenly arrested , heat , in a direct ratio to the motion , is developed . A decided popular tendency will never be peremptorily stopped in England . It is therefore a grand sight to an American , when the well-appointed companies of London riflemen march up Fleet Street and the Strand , through Temple-Bar , that bars nothing any longer , and stands there a decaying symbol of Toryism itself . The brass bands may play , " Britannia rules the Waves , " or " God save the Queen , " but to the American ear they sound , " The Waves rule Britannia , " " God save the Common People ! " Every shouldered musket shall be a vote the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhythm of the living column is the march of England 's steady justice into coalmines and factories , Church and State . For this reason we ought to cultivate pacific relations with the Government of England . Beware lest the question of the Alabama break loose to prey upon the true commerce of mankind ! A war would put back the people of England for fifty years . When England is at war , the people are apt to rally to the Government . The island is so small , that , when a feeling once gets started , it sweeps all men away into an inconsiderate and almost savage support of the public honor . If Toryism can not secure to itself the benefit of a war upon some point that involves an English prejudice or interest , it can not prevent the rising strenbth of the people from going into opposition . Dissenters of every class are emptying the pews of the Establishment ; liberal thinkers now hold University fellowships only to avoid surrendering all the ground to a reactionary party . The abolition of the stamp-tax has freed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little cliques , but belong to the people of England , who take their pennyworth of honest criticism every morning ; and the best of these newspapers have been for three years on the side of Northern republicanism . This is the instinct of human nature , which knows its rights and hungers to possess them . We are maintaining half a million of men in the field , half a million outlets of our heart 's blood , because we believe that inclusion is better than exclusion . The nation 's instinct for that truth has gone into camp . It is a belief that the life of the Republic depends upon including every State , and including every citizen , and including every emigrant , and including every slave , in the right to live , labor , and be happy , and excluding none . We feel that the blood we lose in fighting for that plain maxim of republican economy will make again fast enough when the maxim has prevailed . The weaver of Lancashire , who plays out his hunger in London streets , and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand miles of seaboard , are both listening to . the rote of the same great truth , as it dashes on the shores of Time , and brings bracing air to the people who are sick with waiting . If we are gaining battles because we love the rights of the common people , our success will include the English weaver , Dissenters will build churches on our corner-stone of Liberty , the taxed will borrow our ballot-boxes to contain their votes , and none shall be excluded but the betrayers of mankind .
