txt The good people of St. Mark 's Episcopal Church were treated yesterday to a novel and startling sensation , caused by the unexpected and evioently most unwelcome appearance in their pulpit of Rev. Dr. WILMER , formerly the Rector of St. Mark 's . Owing to the peculiar structure of the church , Dr. WILMER 'S presence in the chancel was not generally known until he ascended the pulpit to preach the sermon . Now the congregation of St. Mark 's is composed in the main of staunchly loyal men and women , and the vestry of the church have been chosen upon the distinct issue of their strong Union sentiments . It was not , therefore , to be wondered at that the sudden apparition of a man of Dr. WILMER 'S political record in a loyal Noithern pulpit should be received with tokens of marked disapprobation , and accordingly several families in different parts of the church rose and left the building . We only regret that the whole congregation did not follow their example . It will be remembered that Dr. WILMER , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is sometimes claimed , but a JerSeylilan , left this city in the Fall of 1861 , and was captured while crossing the Potomac in a small boat , under circumstances which would have brought a common layman under the category of blockaderunners. smugglers and rebel mail-carriers . The reverend gentleman was released after a short confinement , and went on his way rejoicing . He has been heard of occasionally during the war , as officiating in the rebel camps . During the months that Dr. WILMER remained at the North , after the breaking out of the rebellion , he made strong professions of Unionism , declaring that lie held secession against the State to be as great a sin as seism against the Church . His practice , however , did not tally exactly with his profession . Much curiosity has been expressed as to how this Reverend ex-blockade-runner obtained entrance to the pulpit of St. Mark 's , as it is believed none of the vestry have extended any such invitation to him , and the church is without a Rector . Rev. JO1IN P. LUNDY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that gentleman , who we are told is a staunch Union man , would have assumed such a questionable responsibility .
