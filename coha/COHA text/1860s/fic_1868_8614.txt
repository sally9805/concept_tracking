In the hushed cloister 's solitude , I taught him That bond and baron had one sire , and all Were brethren , equal all , all noble , save Those whom their vice debased ; and that the law Of our blest faith is violate by the force That makes the feeble bond . He caught the light That flinty , high philosophy I taught him , Which makes cold , hunger , suffering in the cause Of a crushed people , luxuries sweeter far Than ease and honour on their silken couch , Tended by wan-eyed homage .

For which offence , as a born serf , he was Condemned and scourged to death . Aylmere . Jack Cade A most foul murder ! Lacy . Lacy His father 's fate , Rooted , like nightshade , in the stripling 's heart , And angered o'er his brow with sterner thoughts Than early life should know . Aylmere . Jack Cade You 're wrong , you 're wrong ! Wormlike and worthy spurning had he been , Had not the memory of that wrong been food , And drink and sleep , and life to him , until It was avenged !

Lacy It made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud Say , when a hunting , happed to enter The cot of her whom he had made a widow ; And spoke as tyrant power to weakness speaks , In scorn and wrong .

Lacy The proud lord would have spurned him , but young Cade  --  Aylmere . Jack Cade I struck him to my feet ! ( laughs . ) I 've not forgot it ! How kissed his scarlet doublet the mean earth , Beneath a bondsman 's blow , and he a lord ! That memory hath made my exile green ! ( Widow Cade gives a scream of recognition .

Thine own , Cade , Would give thee up  --  so runs our feudal code  --  As bondman unto Say . Aylmere . Jack Cade When I left Kent , A pallid fugitive , I took the name Of Aylmere .

Aylmere . Jack Cade One night , Racked by these memories , methought a voice Summoned me from my couch . I rose  --  went forth .
