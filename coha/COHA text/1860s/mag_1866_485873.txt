AT a Republican Senatorial caucus in Washington on Friday the nomination of President pro tempore of the Senate was unanimously tendered to John A. Logan , but he declined it , and the caucus thereupon adjourned . The refusal of Logan was not a surprise to his friends . He stated to them privately at the outset that he did not wish the office , that it was not adapted to his tastes , and that he preferred his position in committees and on the floor . Logan , like many ambitious men , has often regarded the Vice-Presidency as the limbo from which a politician may never hope to reach the Presidency . There is a strong sentiment among Congressmen of both parties for the early passage of the Hoar Presidential Succession Bill , which puts the members of the Cabinet in the line of succession . At a caucus on Saturday the Republican Senators nominated Mr. Sherman , of Ohio , for President pro tempore . There was no opposition , Senator Edmunds having declined to run . It was determined that the bills relating to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winch had passed the Senate during the last Congress , should be introduced as soon as practicable and , after a proper reference and consideration , should be promptly passed . The Democratic Senators gave the complimentary nomination to Mr. Harris , of Tennessee . The first session of the Forty-ninth Congress was opened in Washington at noon on Monday . Mr. Sherman was elected President pro tempore of the Senate , and Mr. Carlisle Speaker of the House . After some routine business , both houses adjourned out of respect to the memory of Vice-President Hendricks . President Cleveland 's first annual message is a very long document . It was read before both houses of Congress on Tuesday , and is summarized in our editorial columns . The annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury embraces fifty-eight pages of printed matter , and is accompanied by a special report of fifty-six pages on the collection of customs duties . The ordinary revenues of the Government for the fiscal year 1885 were $323,690,706 , and the ordinary expenditures ( including sinking fund , $45,604,035 ) were $305,830,970 , leasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 1886 are $315,000,000 , and the estimated expenditures , including sinking fund , $290,750,000 . For the year 1887 , however , the Secretary estimates that there will be a deficit of $24,589,552 , the revenue remaining at $315,000,000 and the expenditures reaching $339,589,552 . Of this estimated increase of $49,000,000 in expenditures , $19,000,000 is for pensions , $15,000,000 for the navy , and $4,000,000 for fortifications . The interest-bearing debt has been reduced during the fiscal year $10,369,750 , and now stands at $1,260,778,162 , including the Pacific Railroad bonds ( $64,623,512 ) . The balance in the Treasury of assets over liabilities has been increased $58,053,702 since March 1 , 1885 , of which $36,000,000 is silver coin , $16,000,000 gold coin , and $9,000,000 legal-tender notes . On the subject of reform in taxation Secretary Manning says : " Besides the reforms which are desirable for the effective administration of any system of taxation levied through imported merchandise , and are indispensable for the administration of customs laws which , like our own , are a chaos rather than a system , I venture to hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress to consider some other reforms , upon which , as is requisite , all parties may agree and that are of a different scope . Like our currency laws , our tariff laws are a legacy of war . If exigencies excuse their origin , their defects are unnecessary after twenty years of peace . They have been retabled without sifting and discrimination , although enacted without legislative debate , criticism , or examination . ' ' The annual report of Mr. C. N. Jordan , Treasurer of the United States , shows that the net revenue of the Government during the last fiscal year was $323,690 ; 706 , or $24,829,163 less than the preceding year , while the expenditure wits $260,220,935 , or $16,100,690 greater than in the preceding year . During the same period there has been an increase of $33,463 , - 633 in the gold assets , of $22,095,016 in the silver assets , $6,776,423 in the legal-tender assets , $171,284 in national-bank notes , and $1,147,107 in national-bank deposits . Secretary Lamar 's report is long and elaborate . Ile goes over the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I now have the satisfaction to state that the reservation is entirely free from cattle men and their herds . " To advance the interests of the Indians , the Secretary recommends that a part of every reservation be divicled into separate tracts of suitable size for farms , to be allotted to each individual as his sole and separate estate . Provision should be made against the power ( until after a time limited ) of selling or mortgaging the same , or even leasing it to any but Indians living within the same reservation . Provision should be made that the Indian accepting a patent for his land shall not thereby forfeit any of his rights as a member of his tribe , nor the protection and benefit which the laws of the United States extend to the Indians generally . General Atkins , Commissioner of Indian Affairs , in his annual report recommends the following plan for civilizing the red man : " It should be industriously and gravely impressed upon them that they must abandon their tribal relations and take lands in severalty , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which means self-support , personal independence , and material thrift . The Government should , however , in order to protect them , retain the right to their lands in trust for twenty-five years or longer , but issue trust patents at once to such Indians as have taken individual holdings . When the Indians have taken their lands in severalty in sufficient quantities ( and the number of acres in each holding may and and should vary in different localities according to fertility , productiveness , climatic , and other advantages ) , then , having due regard to the immediate and early future needs of the Indians , the remaining lands of their reservations should be purchased by the Government and opened to homstead entry at 50 or 75 cents per acre . The money paid by the Government for their lands should be held in trust in 5 per cent . bonds , to be invested as Congress may provide , for the education , civilization , and material development and advancement of the red race , reserving for each tribe its own money . If this policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange if in five years from its inauguration and establishment there should be an Indian of any tribe in the whole country who would refuse to accept so favorable and advantageous a measure . " The first annual report of the Secretary of the Navy differs essentially from those of his recent predecessors in the fact that much space is devoted to an argument urging the necessity of the reorganization of the Navy Department upon a basis of business principles . Fully one-third of the long report is given up to this subject . Secretary Whitney says : " My brief experience in this Department has satisfied me that , whatever changes in its organization may be desired , it is of first necessity to separate , as much as practicable , the work of direction and deliberation from the details of execution ; in other words , that there should be in the construction of a navy , as in every other kind of business , a proper distribution of labor . " From the report of the Secretary of War appears that the total expenditures of the War Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including river and harbor improvements . For the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1886 , the appropriations are $31,762,413 40 , the large reductions being due to the fact that there was no appropriation for rivers and harbors . The Secretary has reduced the estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1887 , from $81,782,324 97 to $48,204,183 48 . The army consists of 2,154 officers and 24,705 men . The condition of affairs at the Military Academy is highly satisfactory . The militia should be armed in uniformity with the regular army . The Secretary recommends the appointment of a judge-Advocate-General , or legislation to meet the present difficulty , the office beimg practically vacant . Major- General Schofield , commanding the Division of the Missouri , in his annual report , says " I beg least to submit that , in a country of 50,000,000 of people , 50,000 men would be a small army to be maintained with sole reference to possible foreign wars . But when the country has constant daily use for nine-tenths of that force to protect its people and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is extremely unwise to limit the army to its present strength . As well might the great cities of the country limit their police force to one-half that which experience has shown to be necessary for daily service , with no reserve for great emergencies . " The President has appointed Mr. A. A , Wilson to be Marshal of the District of Columbia , in place of Colonel Clayton McMichael , resigned . Mr. Wilson is a prominent Democrat , President of the Columbia Club , a director in railway , insurance , and other business corporations , and possessed of a fortune of about $200,000 .

The President specifically announces , in making the appointment , that Mr. Wilson will not be called upon to perform any social duties at the White House . The President on Thursday appointed John A. Sullivan to be Collector of Internal Revenue for the Second District of New York . Mr. Sullivan is a well-known business man of New York city , and has been a prominent member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday afternoon suspended Judge E. J. Dawn , of the District of Alaska , and appointed Lafayette Dawson , of Missouri , in his place . It is asserted that it was Dawn 's appointment in June last which led to the writing of a letter to the President by one of the men who had endorsed him , in which he was declared to be wholly unfit for the place . The letter and the President 's reply , published on August 5 , were widely quoted . James W. Porch , of Missouri , has been appointed United States Consul-General to Mexico .

The will of Mr. Hendricks leaves all his property to his wife . William H. Vanderbilt died suddenly on Tuesday at 2:20 P. m. , in his house in Fifth Avenue . He was talking in his library- with Robert Garrett , President of the Baltimore and Ohio , when stricken with apoplexy , and fell at Mr. Garrett 's feet , where he expired instantly . William H. Vanderbilt was the eldest son of ? Commodore Vanderbilt , and was born on May 8 , 1821 . His father had a poor opinion of his capabilities , and gave him no financial start in his early life . He worked hard as a bank clerk , and afterward as a farmer on Staten Island . His skill in managing his farm finally attracted his father 's attention , and the latter gave him $6,000 with which to pay off a mortgage . His first experience as a railway manager was as receiver of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son with him in the management of the Harlem Road , and from that time on began to repose confidence in him . On the Commodore 's death in 1877 , William H. succeeded to the bulk of the estate , and has ever since been the controlling power of the great New York Central system , every year adding to his wealth and increasing his power as a railway manager . The details of his well-known schemes can not be summarized here . He died worth about $200,000,000 . It is believed that about $50,000,000 will be divided among his heirs , and the bulk of his estate will be managed by trustees ; Cornelius Vanderbilt and Chauncey M. Depew being two of them . Mr. Vanderbilt left a widow and eight children , four of them sons . FOREIGN . The tide in the British Parliamentary elections began to turn on Wednesday , and the Liberals were jubilant .

The Loudon Standard on Monday morning , iu an article evidently inspired , insisted that Lord Salisbury should not resign , and said that his failure to secure a majority did not prove that a mandate should be given to any other coherent body of statesmen . The Standard depends upon the Whigs to support Lord Salisbury . Mr. Gladstone wrote a letter on Saturday in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much weaker than the Liberals in the next , as in the past , Parliament . It will be impossible for the Tories to conduct the Government on their own strength , or to hold a position of dignity and independence . The Liberal party will outnumber the Tories and Parnellites combined , and will be the only party independent of unworthy motives to court the Parnellites for support . Mr. Chamberlain , the Radical leader , in a speech at Leicester on Thursday , said the defeats of the Liberals in the boroughs were due to five Ps ? Priests , Publicans , Parsons , Parnellites , and Protectionists . He thought that such a combination was unlikely to recur . Mr. Parnell boasted that he bad throttled the Liberal party .
