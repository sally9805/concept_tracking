txt SOUTHERN HATE OF NEW ENGLAND . T**r these days of strange and startling events , of rapid and fundamental changes , of curious and unexpected developments ; these days , , tremulous with the vibrations of the political atmosphere , and quaking with the fierce earthquake of national war ; these days , that are filling up a web of history with more fearful rapidity , more complete , important , and decisive results than any previous epoch in the world 's annals ,  --  a history which , if ever truly and worthily penned , will demand a deeper search into moral causes and effects , a closer scrutiny of the philosophy of mind , and a more careful balancing of political judgments , than any drama ever before played on the great world 's stage ,  --  in such days as these , I say , it is curious and profitable to subject each new moral phase that presents itself to a rigid analysis , and trace every effect , moral , political , governmental , or popular , to the cause or causes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced it .

Iv. - lZ convictions of educated reason and conscience , thereby dishonors himself , and abdicates the right he possesses of acting for the best interests of himself and all . Especially is this true under a democratic form of government-where every citizen is a legislator , virtually ,  - -  where opinion leads to political action , and is consequently responsible for the course that action may take , and where each one helps to swell the numbers of those great parties that in their planflings and counterplannings make or mar the general good fortune .

These have not , necessarily , always been in the wrong . The contrary has been often true , though their fall , and the opprobrium cast upon them have been none the less // sure . It is only when these have arisen during the progress of a war involving great moral and humanitarian principles in its successful prosecutiop , that the whole force of such an opposing influence is felt , the whole evil apparent .

I have called these men few , for it can not *e that the great and time-honored organization of which I hope these men are but the calumniators , boasting the grand old names of Jefferson and Jackson as founders , and enrolling in its ranks so many thousands of . the substantial yeomanry and solid men of the country , will really prove false to its name and trust , and be willing to descend into history in the robe of horror and infamy which , like the fabled shirt of Nessus , would cling to it forever as the country 's betrayer , if it shall not shake itself free from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the foul imputation of putting barriers in the way of this war , which , we firmly believe , though terrible and bloody while it lasts , is to end by giving a fresh and vigorous i*npulse to the cause of human redemption and advancement - an impulse that nothing thereafter shall be able to check materially . // Although one only comprehensive principle lies at the bottom of the anomalous condition of things which preceded , and at last culminated in , the tremendous civil contest through which the country is now passing-a fierce baptism of fire and blood necessary to purge and reinstate her in pristine purity and grandeur , whose end is certainly not yet-still it is constantly assuming new disguises , and has been aptly likened to a virulent and incurable cancer in the body politic , which , driven in in one place , instantly breaks out with redoubled fierceness in another . Its latest and favorite form is that of hatred to New England . I have called it Southern hatred of New England . By this I do not mean to denote any geographical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sections , but a war of ideas ; and the terms Southern and Northern are to be limited to this ideal meaning . The two sections , as such , are not arrayed against each other , but the two antagonistic principles represented by these sections are , in sad truth , at deadly warfare . We see Union men at the South , and secessionists at the North ; but there is this difference in the position of those who oppose the Government North , and those who favor is South . The former are would-be leaders , who assume to act for the outraged people ; the latter are merely the people , or a portion of them , lacking organization and leadership , and consequently obliged to submit to the tyranny that has laid its iron hand upon them . I do not believe , and never have believed , in the asserted unanimity of the Southern people . Recalling my eight years ' residence among , and *scquaintance with , the people of the South , of two of the cotton States principally , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lost their respect and love for the national banner and authority , and , rather than submit to it again , would prefer to be English Colonists , ' French vassals , ' or Russian serfs ! ' No ; their leaders first grossly cajole and deceive them , and then basely slander them . That there is an apparent oneness , I admit ; but I think the time is not far off when , if the Federal Government but does its duty , and uses its authority and strength wisely , crippling the rebel faction in every possible way , thousands of liberated arms will spring forth to seize the sword in its defence , and as many liberated voices swell the All hail I that will burst out for its welcome . For , so long tutored to the repression of any independent ideas , any sentiments that do not tally with the doctrines to full belief in which these leaders have aimed to educate the men of the last generation , viz. , the divine origin and purpose of slavery , and the other mischievous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery and its inperative demands , would never have seen the light , but have perished stillborn-they have no idea of the freedom of opinion and expression permitted among us , and their minds and consciences have become nerveless and supine to an astonishing degree ; or , if thinking and feeling , as very many do , they suffer in silence , not daring to resist the oppressive faction that has ruled them so long . Moral force and courage is not the fruit of subserviency to the principles and ideas that have gradually filled the Southern mind . No wonder that the Union sentiment that showed itself so plainly at the outbreak of the rebellion became , ere long , like one of those streams that , starting impetuously from its mountain source , flows on awhile clearly and rapidly , and then begins to wander and slacken its pace , till finally it is lost in the dreariness and desolation of some marshy wilderness , and so never reaches its destination , the open sea . There is no people in the world so abused and defrauded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oppressed of another race , then pity still more those of your own blood who are suffering a worse slavery , and who yet do not know it , but hug fondly the chains of their // servitude . Then , too , consider the thousands of Northern men and women scattered all over the South , and say if you think *hey are linked , heart and hand , with the destroyers of the Government . But with all this as en offset , still there is an undeniably strong and unscrupulous faction there , composed of the leading minds of the South , acute , imperious , sophistical , used to political and social rule , and backed by a small but cunning minority here at the North , so vile and contemptible that , in comparison with its adherents , they , these slave oligarchs , are Hyperion to a satyr . ' These , with the thousands both North and South , misled and befooled by them , form the formidable opposition with which tie Government is even now closing in a life-or-death encounter . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a decisive struggle on this North American Continent , after the numberless petty skirmishes , reconnoissances , and lesser conflicts which have stained the battle fields of the world with the best blood of humanity during so many thousand years . No child 's play now-no diplomatic dissembling-no sword thrusts intended to be parried , no machiavelian hits nor disguises . The fight is close , desperate , deadly ; it is yard arm to yard arm ; it is heart seeking for naked heart , flashing eye to eye , visor down , and hot breath mingling with hot breath , as the foes close in the last grapple . The other idea is embodied in the principles of the Constitution and the Dedaration of Independence , and is represented by the Federal authority . The South , then , is taken to mean the one , and the North , its opposite . On one side barbarism , slavery , inj u*tice , ignorance , despotism , the woes and maledictions of oppressed races , the carnival of fiends ; on the other , civilization , freedom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of redeemed humanity , the jubilee of joy among angels . On the side of disunion , endless bickerings , intestine wars , standing armies , crushing debts , languishing commerce , all improvement at a stand still , tyranny settling darkly down over the liberties of the people and of individulals , and national influence gone forever . On the side of Union , honorable peace , legitimate expansion , social order and improvement , increasing commerce , the education and elevation of the masses , the path of success open to all , the freedom and rights of all , even the least and poorest secured and the nation occupying a front rank among nations , her flag loved no less than feared , her government the model one of the world , and the great experiment of self-government safe beyond the peradventure of failure . Who doubts the issue of such a struggle-who would cheat himself of being one with God and good men in the glory of a triumph so possible and certain ? But why is it that the hate of all rebels , North and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What has she done more than New York or Illinois ? Again I reply , it is not geographical New England that is so feared and hated , but the ideas she represents . I have called these , already , the Northern idea . But if the nature of our political philosophy be closely scanned , if we exactly analyze the genius of our institutions in their proper and unbiased action , we shall be forced to acknowledge that it was the Puritan idea which predominated ; that it is , in fact , the saving clause in the gospel of our national salvation . And New England was the first home of the Puritans  --  the focus from which have radiated the myriad beams of the light of which they were the repositories to the remotest corners of the land . Let no one be alarmed at the mention of the word Puritan . There are some people who have no other notion of a Puritan than that of a close-cropped , saturnine personage , having a nasal twang , who is forevermore indulging an ( // insane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witches . These are the people who can never see into the profound deep of a great truth , but are quite ready to laugh at its travesty or caricature . And what high or holy truth has not been caricatured ? For one , I envy not the head or the heart of him who can think the name of Puritan a badge of shame or reproach , and who has no sympathy nor admiration for the s'ern resolution , the wondrous fortitude* the deep enthusiasm for freedom , the unwavering faith , and the high religious devotion of those men and women who first lit a torch in the wilderness , soon to become the beacon light of the world . Nor would I be understood to mean a wholesale and indiscriminate adoration of the Puritans as a sect . The appellation , which was bestowed upon them in opprobrium , and which they certainly wore in no meek manner , but evidently gloried in as a word of highest praise and honor , I use as a convenient one to characterize the idea I would represent . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him who no doubt has ever ordered the course of affairs in the world , to open up a new epoch in its history . The time was ripe - the men had been moulded  --  and through them the free principles which had been culminating through the ages , which had stirred the souls , animated the imaginations , and quickened the desires of the best and noblest of the race from its birth till now , were at last to find a resistless voice , a limitless scope , an unrepressed expansion , on a new and magnificent theatre . For freedom is of no time , nor clime , nor color , nor sect , nor nationality . She is the primal gift of God to his intelligent creatures , and is the kingly dower of every human soul . She was not born with the Puritans , nor did she die with them . In no age or land , among no sect or people , has she been without her priesthood , her altar , her ritual , her heart worship . Nor is she to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ideas and principles the Puritans were ordained to carry out and embody in a great political structure were of the noblest , rarest , most enduring and beneficent ; the faults that malTed the beauty and consistency of their own character , were the exaggerations of their virtues , and arose from the frailty and instability of the human heart , even when most governed and inspired by the highest motives . The principles remain steadfast , immovable , immortal ; the defects we can hut grieve over and forgive for the sake of the grandeur they only marred but could not destroy . Through the weakness of our nature , through the deceitfulness of the heart , the zeal which , in its proper exercise , is admirable , as inciting us to a grand enthusiasm in a cause believed to be true and holy , ofttimes degenerates into a blind and bitter bigotry , as unreasoning as reprehensible ; the faith which pierces the unseen and eternal , and fixes its calm eye on One who sits changeless amid infinite series of changes , all-wise amid infinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amid the hate and opposition of weak , finite hearts , becomes a gloomy asceticism , or a fierce inquisitorial despotism , perverting Him-this glorious and loving God - into a cold , selfish , unreasonable Being , as far removed from our sympathies and love as He is from caring for us , an ( I only existing to receive the hateful homage of fearful and enslaved souls ; and what was a high , disinterested fearless devotion to truth and duty becomes a narrow , selfish , insane thirst for the ascendency of sect or party , or the propagation of some pet dogmas , which , so far from touching practically the happiness , duty , or destiny of the soul , are mere stumbling stones , strewing the dark mountains of vain , egotistic , arrogant human specu* lation . As there is no power so relentless as a theological or spiritual despot- qwq home , the pure principles they have learned around the home firesides in their native New England  --  the industry , the thrift , the obedience to law , the superior intelligence , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England communities , generally , possess a higher standard of morals , a more intelligent adhesion to what is regarded as duty , a more simple social intercourse , and purer social manners and customs , with fewer dissipations and derelictions , than perhaps any other people in the world can boast . Nor is there claimed for the New England Puritan a perfect character . On the contrary , there are some traits which , in their excess , we could wish were omitted in his composition . These , however , will be found to be but exaggerations of his virtues for the most part , and for the sake of those virtues can easily be tolerated , though they have been sufficiently inveighed against from time to time . From this high state of morals there results a very high degree of 80cud order , which , in its result , again , gives large social and individual liberty . Nowhere will there be found a freer people , and yet one more observant of law . Indeed , the former is only the effect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more perfectly law is observed , the more absolute does freedom become ; that the highest personal and social freedom is only attainable through a perfect obedience to the laws by which persons and societies are bound . Again , it is no doubt true , and may be stated as a characteristic correlated to the one above mentioned , that nowhere else is a purer gospel preached than in New England . The piety of the New England heart is deep and strong , if not demonstrative and fervent . It is not like the sweep of the winds , nor the rush of the torrents ; its faith may be burning , but it is the steady burning of the hidden fire , a vestal flame , not the glare of the conflagration . It rather reminds me , in its depth and strength and purity , of the ocean , calm , uniform , and monotonous outwardly , but concealing under its surface many a swift current and strong countercurrent , many a fair expanse , many a lovely secret of life , beauty , and glory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those sublime doctrines of Christianity which were given as good news , indeed , to the race ; not to a favored few , but to the individual man and woman of the race . It credits in a real and literal sense the declaration of Paul that God hath made of one blood all the nationa of the earth ; ' and the opening sentence of the Declaration of Rights is something more to them than a glittering generality . ' A deep , intelligent religious faith may be said to underlie all the institutions of New England , political and social . For what i. * that genius of Christianity that has ever found its truest exponent in the teachings of the New England theology , and in the lives and practice of her people ? Is it not the liberty of every person , without respect to color or condition , but simply in consideration of his humanity , to learn and to obey every law of his being , physical , moral , intellectual , social , and religious ? To be untrammelled in following out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitution and laws of his being , his duty to himself , his fellow man , and his Creator , and his destiny , which he himself is to determine ? The Christian religion may be comprehensively defined as the golden circlet which includes all the complex duties , interests , and affections of the most complex being , man , and lifts him up , and binds him back , with all his capacities , hopes , and sympathies , to the throne of the Infinite , from which , in his low , fettered , and sinful estate , he is an alien ; and all this through the love and mercy of the Infinite One Himself . This I conceive to be the true intent and glorious result of Christianity , when allowed to have // free and unimpeded action on the soul of man . It will be seen to be weilnigh limitless  --  a power adequate to the work to be accomplished , and in this sense is truly the power of God and the wisdom of God . ' This power is dominant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New England , being interwoven in the very life of her institutions . I believe this secret , quiet , yet active , allpervading influence is very little understood , and yet it will explain much in the Puritan character that no other key will unlock . I have mentioned a pure morality , which is the effect , before a pure Christianity , which is the cause , simply because the effect is more obvious at first glance . The third great characteristic of the Puritan idea is a pure repul3licitnism . In the largest sense , I hold this also to be the effect of the one just mentioned for , if tested , the whole spirit and tone of Christianity are republican . On New England soil , from the hour when the little band of pilgrim heroes first set foot on an inhospitable shore , by their footprints upon it making a barren rock a holy shrine for the world 's love and veneration , has ever been a sure refuge , a very palladium of republican institutions , of human liberties . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Puritanism in the Old World which gave impulse to the resolution to transplant themselves to a land where freedom , if nothing else , was to be found . It was equally as much its republican and democratic theories . Souls made free by the spirit of the Lord , as the souls of those grand old Puritans were , could no more brook the tyranny of the Charleses and Georges of Britain , and so , through blood and fire and sword and chains , was the germ of liberty borne across the watery waste , to be sown anew , as they thought and proposed , in the genial soil of the region bordering on the Hudson , but , as God willed it , in the perverse and barren soil of rockbound , sea-washed New England . Truly this was a novel spectacle . Never in the history of peoples before was it seen that a bare idea was strong enough to lay the foundations of a great state , through persecution , exile , and death , and untold privations worse than death . 0 you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Puritans , recall this noblest era of time ; rise for one hour , if your souls have any wings , to the height of this grandeur , and bid calumny and defamation be dumb ! This germ of republican freedom took deep root , and acquired an ineradicable hold of their civil polity , and the whole machinery of their civil government ; andy spreading from New England to the adjoining colonies , and from these to others , soon permeated the whole confederation , at length forming the basis of a national government , a national condition which has heretofore represented the highest civilization of the world . Is it not plain , then , why they do so , who oppose and hate the influence and ideas of New England ? If anything could measure the utter vileness of slavery and its degrading effect on the mind , it would be the consideration of the unblushing assurance with which its lovers defend it , and at the same time assail those sacred principles which lie at the root of our national life , and without which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trust certain principles , for the successful carrying out of which the nations of the earth wait in hushed and anguished expectancy , and in the failure of which we should be no better than any of the effete , defunct peoples of buried ages ; or , rather , in the failure to bring them to a triumphant vindication , we had far better be as Sodom and Gomorrah . These principles are now the stake for which the loyal men of the land are gladly offering up life , treasure , cliildren , all , so they but win . I // We hear a great deal , nowadays , from rebel sources , of the different race which settled Virginia and Carolina from that which peopled New England , and the immeasurable superiority of the former . If the mouthpiece of the confederacy , Mr. Jefferson Davis , may be believed , the latter and their descendants are not worthy even to be the 8laves of the former , and are a degree lower in the scale of creation than the hyena8 ! Differing in language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a peaceable union , say the confederate organs . In fine , language is exhausted of epithets expressive of their scorn , contempt , and hatred of the Yankees , as they are opprobriously nicknamed . But do these men ignore the fact that the original settlers of both New England and Virginia were purely English ? They were from the same stock precisely . As to the character of each , I can not do better than to quote from a work of which Americans may well be both glad and proud , a work that has set us and our institutions in a truer and juster light than any before it . I allude to the work of M. Dc Tocqueville on Democracy in America . ' In volume first chapter fifth , he says : The men sent to Virginia were seekers of gold , adventurers without resources and without character , whose turbulent and restless spirits endangered the infant colony , and rendered its progress uncertain . The artisans and agriculturists arrived afterward ; and although they were a more moral and orderly race of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inferior classes in England . No lofty conceptions , no intellectual system , directed the foundation of these new settlements . ' He adds , in a note : It was not till some time later , that a certain number of rich English capitalists came to fix themselves in the colony . ' It is true that in the course of time some men of high character and position were attracted to the genial climate and virgin resources of the new Southern colonies , and , buying up large tracts of land , fixed themselves permanently , sensibly modifying the condition of affairs . The descendants of such men as these afterward became the most famous leaders of the Revolution which Puritan principles effected . They were men of whom descendants may well be proud , but it is certain that they have had very few descendants ; therefore , the great body of the slaveholders , each one of whom would fain believe himself and try to make others believe him , a scion of this renowned stock , must have had a ' very different origin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he says of the first settlers of the Northern colonies : The settlers who established themselves on the shores of New England all belonged to the more independent classes of their native country . Their union on the soil of America at once presented the singular phenomenon of a society containing neither lords nor common people , neither rich nor poor . These men possessed , in proportion to their number , a greater mass of intelligence than is to be found in any European nation of our own time . All , without a single exception , had received a good education , and many of them were known in Europe for their talents and their acquirements . The other colonies had been founded by adventurers without family ; the emigrants of New England brought with them the best elements of order and morality ; they landed in the desert , accompanied by their wives and children . But what most especially distinguished them was the aim of their undertaking . They had not been obliged by necessity to leave their country ; the social position they abandoned was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were certain . Nor did they cross the Atlantic to improve their situation , or to increase their wealth : the call which summoned them from the comforts of their homes was purely intellectual ; and in facing the inevitable sufferings of exile , their object was the triumph of an idea . ' Let the world judge between the Puritan and the so-called Cavalier I // As the same author remarks- ' The influence of slavery , united to the English character , explains the manners and the social condition of the Southern States ; ' so it is no less true , that the influence of an almost unlimited democracy , the product of widespread intelligence and pure religion , united to the English character , explains the peculiar civilization of New England . It is nothing strange , certainly , that , after the wide and continued divergence of two aggressive principles for more than two hundred years , they should at last come to stand in the position of giant antagonisms , and close in a deadly grapple for the ascendency . It is perfectly natural that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should fear and hate above all things the light of knowledge that streams from New England ; it is natural that the unquestioned immorality and laxity of principle engendered by slavery should shrink from the contrast with a state of morals unsurpassed for purity in the world ; and that an obsequious church and clergy , which , in the holy name of religion , and using the livery of heaven to serve the devil in , ' had dared by the thinnest sophistries and most palpable perversions to garble the true teachings of the Bible , and been willing to brave the anathemas denounced against those who add to or subtract from aught written therein , should accede willingly to a separation which could relieve them somewhat from an odious comparison , to say the least . Compare the vigorous , consistent , and sublime theology of New England , the widely spread influence of her cultivated and philanthropic clergy , with that part of the clergy and church of the South which , in sustaining slavery , has lost all hold upon human sympathies , all influence , save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a matter of interest , of sordid speculation . Alas ! what sadder spectacle could be seen than the ministers of Christ using Southern Hate of New England . their talents to lead their people ml wrong , mocking religion , trailing its snowy wings in the mire of the most corrupt political dogmas , doing their utmost to upheave that grand corner stone set by Christ himself in the primal temple of Christianity and humanity : All things whatsoever you would that men should do to you , do ye even so to them : for this is the law and the prophets . ' That men and women , taught from infancy to look upon slavery as a moral and political as well as a material good ; whose ideas , manners , habits have become interwoven with its existence in their midst , and who , no matter how falsely , as those may think who look ' upon it from a comparatively disinterested standpoint , conceive that it lies at the base of their social prosperity and happiness ; who have been accustomed from forum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution that appeals to so many selfish instincts and principles in the human heart , lauded and defended , and made to be the Ultima Thule of Southern hope , pride , and ambition ; that they should view with displeasure and anger such an influence as the institutions of New England must always wield , is not so surprising . But that men can be found here in the free North , yea , more , in New England itselg to sympathize with them , to echo their degraded sentimt , nts , and to wish to see the slave power supreme in the land , is what surpasses wonder , and almost belief . Yet a portion of a large , old , and venerated party have come to be their miserable allies and cIa queurs . The truth is , we may say and believe that slavery is a dire wrong , a foul injustice , done to a whole race , and therefore ought to die , but that does not tell one half of the damning story : the worst is this , that it gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitality of the nation that allows it ; that it has done so in our own nation to an alarming extent is the great , the fear-impelling cause // why it should be rooted out , abolished , as an influence in the Government . Ah , but , ' says the Northern traitor , that very alolition has done the whole mischief . If there had been no Abolitionists , there would have been no war . The Abolitionists are responsible for it all . ' Softly , poor , weak-minded man ! Does not any man 's common sense tell him that wherever a wrong exists , it is in the nature of things that somebody should oppose it-that a desire should arise to get rid of it ? It is the chief mercy of God to the world , next to His providing salvation for it , that this conscience is left to it , this sense of wrong , and the will and struggle to abolish the wrong . For such remonstrance the Abolitionists are indeed re-sponsible ! There are certain words that have come to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that they have no meaning at all , or , at least , a meaning very deceptive . These words represent bugbears to unthinking people , and unscrupulous men do not fail to pervert this fact to their own or party ends . Such are some of the terms which have been applied to New England , both South and North . She is called radical , and a most absurd and mischievous ide* of New England radicalism is rife , especially in the South . Said a Southern gentleman to me on one occasion ( he was a physician , was one of the most intelligent slaveholders I ever met , and was an occasional contributor to IDe Bow 's Review ) : You New Englanders do not believe anything ; you are all . freethinkers - is it not so ? ' Par 9arenthese , that word freethinker is another of the terms conventionally abused . This gentleman had just been speaking of this very thing , New England radicalism , and in his query showed an evident idea that it involved that species of unbelief ; that discarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as freethinking . It also includes , in the minds of many of the Southern people , the exercise of a kind of personal license , an abandoning of the good old established landmarks of thought and action , and a strong-minded striking out into new paths of experiment , regardless of form or law . A Northern woman going to the South is assumed to be strongminded , especially , till she has proved herself feminine . There is nothing so absurd as this idea , when one considers that there is no people on earth as free , independent , and original , intellectually , as they are , who possess so deep and abiding a respect and veneration for those same laws and institutions . New England is the prolific hive whence swarm all the isms that infest the country , say they . They do not understand that in a state of society where education is universal , where mind is constantly mecting mind , and thought clashing with thought , the restless and heaving mass must be always throwing up something to the surface , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough stones , or plain shells , or it may be curious and valuable gems fit to glitter in a coronet , or shells of dazzling colors and manifcld convolutions fit to shine in rare cabinets . The waveless and stagnant calm of the mass of the Southern mind can have no conception of the intellectual movement that is ever going on in such a community as New England . But this radicalism especially bears on its horrid front ' that bugbear of all conservatism , the world over-alolition . There is no word so abused as that . The thing itself is as old and inevitable as the relation of cause and effect , j*s the existence of sin and righteousness , as the contest between God and Satan . Just as if there could help being an abolition sentiment where there existed the aggressive , hateful principle of slavery ! Then that peculiar and valuable trait of Yankee character , which the French so aptly call savoir faire , and which they themselves term faculty , the power // of accomplishing , the knowing how to do , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Yankee so useful and versatile , and consequently a valuable acquisition to societyhas received its full share of Southern abuse and ridicule . They palm off upon us their inventions , half of which are worthless , ' say they . They cheat us with their wares , their manufactures , their patents , and nostrums . They grow rich on our necessities , and take the world 's trade from our harbors , so superior to theirs , and they are always busy , and intermeddling in everybody 's affairs ; and we hate them-ah , how we do hate them I ' In short , a certain leading class at the South , that which moulds and leads the hollow , shrinking , scared thing they called public opinion , have come to hate and detest everything distinctively New English , and finally to make the wicked , traitorous attempt to overturn the Government , which they know received its highest and controlling impulse from the Puritan ideas of that portion of the country . In the material world , nothing is plainer than the fact embodied in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blows . ' In the realm of moral and social law , however , the indications , just as palpable , of the direction in which the current of public sentiment is setting , are usually ignored or pass unobserved at the time being ; and not till great events have called attention to the causes that produced them , do these indications take all the prominence due to them . These minor symptoms I have noticed , of the dislike of New England in the Southern mind , have been plainly to be seen in all the doings and sayings of their public men of this generation at least , to go no further back , and in the utterances of the press throughout the South . Flings , innuendoes , sarcasms , condescensions , insults , have been heaped upon the Yankees , by the representatives of the slave power , in the National Congress , in the State Legis latures , in their public speeches , and by the minions of the press , until it would seem as if they must have fallen on dead ears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North . Still , if any one supposes that the ostensible causes of dislike are the real ones , he is mistaken . iDoes any man of them all , of these le*sders , I mean , suppose for one instant that the Yankee negrotrader , overseer , peddler , lucre-loving tradesman , slaver , slave catcher , subservient politician , or mouthing , dirt*wallowing pulpit huckster , is a true representative of the influence and ideas of New England ? Or that the present Copperhead Democracy of that section is the real exponent of the genuine spirit of the Puritan Democracy ? Certainly not . They are shrewd men , of great discernment , and in their way brave and chivalrous , and I verily do not wonder if they would not have these renegade Yankees even as slaves . No ! the actual cause of their hatred is the silent , all-pervading influence of the free institutions of New England , which derive their power and efficacy from the universal means of education there enjoyed . Shut up the schoolhouses , and burn the schoolbooks in New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead letter thereby , and the Yankees would be as good as anybody in their eyes , Lecause the sword which their intelligence keeps ever suspended over the head of slavery would be effectually laid to rust in its scabbard . Is it not a pitiful , a disgusting sight , that men are found , Northern men , New-England Yankees even , to kneel before the slaveocrats still , after the load of scorn and contumely already heaped upon them , and humbly cry , More-give us more contempt-our backs are made to bear the burden ! ' God pity such creatures ! And these are the men who advocate a confederation of States with New England left out to shift for herself I New England left out ? Fools ! to // think it possible . Knaves ! to deem it desirable , if it were possible . As well banish the Creator from the universe He has made  --  the sun from the system he warms and enlightens ! Not until you have destroyed the essence , the inner spirit of the Government which of all the governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number ; ' not until Freedom is dead and laid in her final grave ; not until the temple of knowledge is barred and double barred ; not until all your common schools are closed , your free presses manacled , your free Bible suppressed , your right of free speech and free inquiry smothered to death ; not until your ships have gone down in the waters , aud the hammer rests in your shipyards , and your railroads cease to open a way in the wilderness made straight for the entrance of the most advanced civilization ; not until the race of Yankee capitalists is extinct , and enterprise , thrift , industry , nerve , moral courage , the intellectual conquest of the material world become traditional , will that be possible . No ! I thank God that the record of New England is so sure and indelible that nothing can root her out of this land , not even if her whole geographical area were forever submerged by the waters of the ocean that girts her round in barren majesty . Ideas , principles , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wreck of matter , and the final catastrophe of the universe . And her empire is that of ideas . Small as she is , she wields the power of the very foremost ideas of the highest civilization of the world . These ideas have at last held at bay the so long encroaching slave principles which were so strangely left to grow alongside with them by the early framers of the Government , and who doubts which is to conquer I The struggle may be a long one , a costly one , and freedom may at last barely escape with her life . But so sure as humanity sweeps onward ; so sure as the average progress of the race is never retrograde ; so sure as right bears in its bosom the seeds of eternal life , and wrong the seeds of eternal death ; so sure as God sits on His throne and the heavens do rule , ' the free ideas of New England will yet bear sway over this continent , and , in their moral force at least , mould and remodel the governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of this generation , then by others will this ultimate result be reached . God is not confined in His agencies . He sets up one , and puts down another , and the generation that is found worthy to build the temple for Him to dwell in , to preserve and perfect the beautiful heritage He has provided for His freedmen , His redeemed and enfranchised people out of all the nations in which they have been held in mental and political bondage , shall have the honor and privilege , be sure . And think not , o ye men to whom is committed this high trust , that it will be a small thing to leave this birthright unto others ; for as no people were ever before so dis tinguished in having this holiest ark of the covenant of freedom in their midst , so the grave of infamy into which ye shall be cast , if the Philistines dispossess you of it , shall be bottomless . There is no resurrection for the people who should betray such a cause , freighted as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth . And 0 ye other men ( would ye were men ! ) who are in league with traitors , ay , who are even worse than they , to do this accursed thing , know that this pit is yawning for you . Down-down - deeper - deeper - pressed to perdition by the curses of those who are to come after you , whom you wronged so remorsely . In that terrific vision of hell , seen by the poet Dante , those who had betrayed country , freedom , were visited by the most awful sufferings , pursued by the most vengeful fiends , and pushed to the most dire extremity of woe . // Among the pale , haunted , shrieking shades flitting through that limbo of horrors , they were conspicuous in punishment . And if remorse is in reality the undying worm , the quenchless fire of that future state which recompenses for the deeds of this , surely the traitor to this good , free Government will be made to experience its unmeasured horrors . The salvation of our country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family of nations , depend on its return to , and . its enforcing of those fundamental principles of freedom , moral right , and justice which underlie our system , and for the most part form our superstructure . Ours is the moral lever that is to move the world , if we will have it so . If we lose our moral prestige we are nothing . We have the best Government in the world , but it has , since the time of the fathers , for the most part , been the worst administered . Instead of being made to work in the interest of freedom , the opposite has been the fact , and the whole influence and patronage of the Government for years have been in favor of the slave element . Prior to the incoming of the present Administration , this gradual deterioration in the animus of the Federal Government had culminated in a condition so disgraceful and shameful , that it is enough to dye the cheek of any honest man with red , only to think of it . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put upon it all , and now it will be a thing to give endless thanks for , if enough virtue and manliness and true patriotism are left in the loyal States to bring the nation , under God , safely through the troubles and disasters into which its supineness , its temporizing and subserviency to wrong have led it . Oh , could I speak with the convincing tones of a prophet or an angel , instead of the weak voice of a woman , I would make myself heard throughout the length and breadth of the land by every man , of whatever caste or color , whatever birth or tongue , whatever nationality or political creed , North , East , West , South , and especially this great West , of which I am so proud and confident , and would say to them : Rise ! quit you like men-be strong ! Upon you the ends of the world have come . If you have manhood , assert it now ! If you are worthy the name of American , make it now to be honored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glory of the career that would open to the accelerated progress of a Union at last free and redeemed , without a tyrant or a slave , let it nerve your hearts and inspire your exertions now . If you do not desire the selfgratulations of the crowned despots of the world , and the despair and lamentation of their subject millions , see to it that this great experiment of self-government fail not now . If you would gladden the hearts of our friends in other lands , the Brights and Cobdens , the Gasparins and Laboulayes , liberal men , who love truth , justice , right , freedom , who are one with their kind , ' be ambitious of co*5perating with them in the work of human elevation and amelioration . ' Those who seize upon great opportunities are the men whom History rescues from oblivion , and sets in the memory of mankind forever , whether with blessings or cursings , with glory or shame , as the benefactors or the enemies of their kind . A rare opportunity is passing before this nation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall see .
