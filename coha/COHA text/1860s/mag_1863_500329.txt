CONTINENTAL MONTHLY : DEVOTED TO LITERATURE AND NATIONAL POLICY . VoL . PA-AUGUST , 1863. - No . II . OUR FUTURE . Ix these exciting times , when our country is enduring the throes of political convulsion , and every time-honored institution , every well-regulated law of society seems tottering from the broad foundation of the past , how few are there who ask themselves the question , What is to be our future I For the past two years we have lived in a state of extraordinary and unnatural excitement , beside which the jog-trot existence of the former days , with all its periodical excitements , its hebdomadal heavings of the waves of society , pales into insignificance . Like the grave , with its eternal Give ! give ! ' our appetites , stimulated to a morbid degree by their daily food of marvels , cry constantly for more ; and a lull of but a few *ricf months in the storm whose angry pinions are constantly bringing new wonders to our view , begets an almost insupportable ennui in the public mind , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never before shown . Nor will the craving be satiated so long as the war shall last ; for the stirring events , following so closely upon each other , and filling every hour of our national life , will keep up the unnatural excitement , even as the stimulating effect of alcoVOL. iv. -9 holic drinks is prolonged by repeated draughts . Only when the source is entirely cut off will the stimulus pass away ; and then , when peace is established , and we drop again into the ruts and grooves of the olden days , the reaction will set in , and happy shall we be if it is not followed by a political delirium tremens . To-day we are living in and for the present alone . Men 's minds are so completely absorbed in the wonderful events that are constantly passing around them , in the startling denouements that each day brings forth , that their attention is entirely distracted from that future to which we are inevitably tending . And this not because that future is of little importance , but because nearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which it is involved , and upon which it depends  --  a nearer and more portentous future , which we must ourselves control and shape , else the farther state will be utterly beyond our influence , fixed in the channel of a malignant and ever-grovelling fate . The great question now is , how soonest to end the war prosperously to ourselves ; and until this problem , involving our very existence , is solved , the future , with all its prospects , good // or bad , is left to take care of itself and rightly , too ; for in the event of our present success , our future will be in our own hands , while , if we fail , it will be fixed and irrevocable , without the slightest reference to our interests or our exertions . And yet , natural as this fact may seem , it is a little singular that , while thousands of minds are eagerly searching for light upon the question of the future of the American negro , few are found to inquire what is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fill men 's minds and monopolize their sympathies as to entirely exclude other questions of greater importance , and bearing more directly upon our present and vital interests . Yet so it is , and so it has been in all ages of the world , though , happily , the hallucination does not last for any very extended period ; for there is a compensation in human as well as in inanimate nature , which , in its own good time , brings mind to its proper balance by the harsh remedy of severe and present necessity , and so retrieves the errors of a blind past . Yet , absorbed as is the popular mind in the stirring events of the war , and dull as all other themes may seem in comparison , it may not be without interest to examine , in connection with our future , some of those facts which are now floating about at random on the surface of society , waiting for some hand to gather and arrange them in the treasure house of prophecy . And in so doing , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every truly loyal mind is already an established truth-of the ultimate success and complete triumph of the North in the present contest . For in any other event all these facts are dumb , and the inferences to be drawn from them vague and unsatisfactory , absolutely no better than mere random conjecture . And as the war has now become the great fact in our history , and its effects must modify our whole social life for many years to come , its results must not be neglected in an in vestigation of this kind , but , on the contrary , claim our first attention . First and foremost , then , among the lasting results of the war , will be the arousing *f our nationalit*y . To the majority of readers it will seem the climax of heresy to assert that hitherto we have not known a pure and lofty nationality . What ! you will ask , did not our ancestors , by their sufferings and strivings in that war which first made our land famous throughout the civilized world , bestow upon us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not twice humbled the pride of the most powerful nation upon earth ? Have we not covered the seas with our commerce , and brought all nations to pay tribute to our great staples ? Have we not taken the lead in all adventurous and eminently practical enterprises , and is not our land the home of invention and the foster mother of the useful arts ? Has not the whole world gazed with admiring wonder at our miraculous advancement in the scale of national existence ? In a word , have we not long since become a great , established fact , as well in physical history as in the sublime record of that intellectual progress whereby humanity draws constantly nearer to the divine ? And as for patriotic feeling , do we not yearly burn tons of powder on the all-glorious Fourth of July , and crack our throats with huzzas for the star-spangled banner ' and the American eagle ? And a caviller might perhaps go farther , and ask the significant question , Are we not known all over the world as a race of arrant brag-garts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far from that true , firm , self-relying , high-toned nationality which alone is worthy of the name , as when the Pilgrims landed upon Plymouth rock . Our patriotism has hitherto been too utterly heartless-too much a thing of sounding words and meaningless phrases-too much of the sounding , // brass and tinkling cymbal . ' We have built too much upon the exploits of ou ! * ancestors , reposed too long upon their laurels , Torgetting that their efforts were but the initiatory step in the great contest that was to be carried on by succeeding generations ; forgetting that we have still a destiny to work out for ourselves , a niche to secure in the great temple of humanity , obstacles to surmount , difficulties to overcome , bitter and deadly foes to vanquish . And how totally devoid of heart have been even our celebrations of our great national birthday and holiday ! While we have amused ourselves with the explosion of crackers and blowing off of our neighbors ' arms by premature discharges of rusty cannon , while we have rent the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the periodical and hackneyed outbursts of oratorical gas , how few of us have remembered the deep significance of the day , and felt our hearts swell with genuine patriotic emotion ! How few of us have realized that we were celebrating not merely the establishing of a form of government , the severing of galling bonds which bound us to the servitude of the old world , not merely the birthday of independence and of a nation , but the birthday of an immortal principle , whose beneficent effects were not more for us than for the generations of all succeeding time I The masses saw in that day but an universalftte , a day of national relaxation and enjoyment , and neither thought or cared much about its deep meaning ; while to the few , the thinking men alone , appeared the principle which underlay all this festivity and vociferation . Henceforth this will not be so . We have lived so long and so undisturbed in the enjoyment of our political blessings , that we have not appreciated our favored lot ; but now , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted its head , and traitors have endeavored to deprive us of all our most cherished blessings-to strike at the very root of all that is good and pure in our political system - now for the first time do we see those blessings in their true light , and realize their inestimable value . Now that the prestige of our greatness threatens to depart from us , do we first see the glorious destiny which the great God of nature has marked out for us . Now for the first time do we realize that we have a purpose in life-that we are the exponents of one of the great truths of the universe itself and appreciate the awful responsibility that rests upon us in the development of our great principle , as well as in protecting it from the inroads of error and corruption . And herein lies the great secret of all true national life . For no nation was ever yet truly great that had not constantly before it some lofty and ennobling object to direct all its strivings , some great central truths at its very core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society , keeping up a brisk and healthy circulation by the force of its own eternal energy . Lack of a noble purpose , in nations as well as individuals , begets a vacillating policy , which is inevitably followed by degeneration and corruption . The soldier , who has passed many a weary month in the monotony of the camp , enduring all the hardships of rigorous winters and scorching summers , of fatigue and privation , and who has shed his blood upon many a hardfought field , will learn to appreciate as he never has before the true value of that Government for which he has suffered so much , and , with the return of our armies to their homes , this sentiment will be diffused among the masses , and the lessons they have learned will be taught to their fellows : and this , together with the recognition of our true end and aim in existence-of the part which our country is destined to play in the great drama of life , will beget a noble , self-relying national pride , the very opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much characterized us in the days // gone by . The boaster betrays the conSciousness of the very weakness he wishes to conceal ; while still waters run deep , ' and the man of true courage and strength is the man of few words and great deeds . So that arrant bragging which has hitherto been our besetting sin , and which , so long as our real importance in the affairs of the world was unacknowledged , was somewhat excusable , and perhaps even necessary to sustain a yet unestablished cause , will be necessary no longer when we have proved ourselves worthy of the position we claim , and will , with the newborn consciousness of our power and strength , pass away forever , and we shall work steadily on in our appointed course , leaving it to others to recognize and proclaim our worth , to sound the trumpet which we have so long been industriously blowing for ourselves , content to let our reputation bide its time and rest upon sterling deeds rather than upon pompous declamations and empty oratorical phrases . The deeds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-sacrificing devotion to a noble cause beyond a parallel : but even those will pale beside the present struggle of a full-grown nation at the very crisis of its fate ; and the results which followed their efforts will be as nothing to those which shall flow from our battle of to-day . For while it was theirs to initiate , it is ours to develop and firmly establish ; theirs to deliver the nation from the womb of centuries , ours to educate , to guard from danger through childhood and youth , to nurse through disease , to tone down the crudities of national hobble-de-hoy-dom , to fix and strengthen by judicious training the iron constitution , both mental and physical , which shall resist the ravages of disease and error for all time to come . How much more important , then , appears our mission than theirs ! how much greater the responsibility which rests upon us to faithfully fulfil that mission ! And this will be the feeling of every true American . This will be the knowledge , gained by the bitterest experience , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And not a little conducive to the development of that new-found nationality will be the respect and admiration , not to say applause , which the display of our latent power and resources , the prosperous conduct and successful close of this the most gigantic struggle of history , will win for us from the nations of the Old World . And this brings me to the second beneficial effect of this war upon our future , namely , the establishment of our position among the great powers of the earth , and our relief from all future aggressions , encroachments , and annoyances of the mother country . From the day when our independence was declared , America has been an eyesore to all the leading Governments of Europe  --  the object of detraction and bitter hostility , of envy , hatred , and malice , and all uncharitableness . And though these feelings have been partially concealed under the cloak of studied politeness and false , hollow-hearted friendship , occasions enough have been given for them to break fortli in sufficient intensity to establish beyond a question the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have suffered no opportunity to escape of dealing a blow at our national existence : even the low and disreputable weapon of slander has been brought to bear against us , and we have been held up to mankind as a race of visionaries , of fanatical reformers , whose efforts have ever been to destroy all the honored landmarks of the past , and lead humanity back over the track of ages to the socialism of primitive existence . And it was but natural for us to expect little sympathy from their hands , for in our success lay the triumph of a principle which was deadly to all their cherished institutions-a principle which , once firmly established , must in time inevitably // spread beyond the waters , to the utter and eternal downfall of aristocracies and dynasties , since it is founded in one of the very first truths of universal human nature-in the recognition of the rights of the individual , and of the total dependence of the governing upon the governed . And yet they could not withhold their admiration of the indomitable energy and perseverance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miraculous growth in enlightenment and power . Taught wisdom by the past , they dared not combine to crush us by brute force , and so they have waited and hoped for the downfall which they sincerely believed would , sooner or later , overtake us . England and France have ever hung about us like hungry wolves around the dying buffalo , waiting patiently for the hour when they might safely step in and claim the lion 's sbare of the spoil . The crisis of our fate which they have so long awaited , they now fondly believe to be upon us ; and old England , false , treacherous , cowardly , piratical England , fearful lest our native resources may enable us to weather the storm , has at last dropped the mask of a century , and openly encourages and al ) ets the rebels and traitors who are desperately striving for our dismemberment , even furnishing them with the very bone and sinews of war , that they may compass their unholy ends , and effect the ruin which will give to her another fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking to our possible success , and anxious for a subterfuge beneath which he may skulk in that event , and so escape the retribution which will assuredly fall upon his head , has really outwitted his island rival , in his Mexican expedition , whereby he hoped to kill two birds with one stone , ' securing , in either event , the richest portion of the American continent , and thereby establishing a foothold , that , in case of our ruin , he may be first in at the death , ' and carry off the larger share of the booty . And what will be theresult* Checked , defeated , disgraced on the very threshold of his undertaking , his chosen and hitherto invincible legions , furnished with all the appliances of warlike invention , and perfected in the boasted French skill and discipline , baffled and routed by the half-civilized Mexicans , to whose very capital our own raw volunteers marched in a single season , he will be by no means anxious to measure his strength with ours when we shall have emerged from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hard experience , have been widely diffused among our hitherto peaceful people , and when we shall have nearly a million of trained troops ready to spring to arms at an hour 's call ; troops who will fight a foreign foe with double the courage and desperation which has characterized the present war . If he can not subdue the rude Mexicans , can he conquer us ? The development of those latent resources of which even ourselves were ignorant , the display of wealth and power at which we are astonished no less than foreign nations , the energetic prosecution of more than two years of war on such a magnificently extended and expensive scale , without even feeling the drain upon either our population or treasure , have taught Great Britain a lesson which she will not soon forget , and of which she will not fail to avail herself . What nation ever before , without even the nucleus of a standing army , raised , equipped , and put into the field , within a brief six months , an army of half a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time , at the cost of a million dollars per day , while scarcely increasing the burden of taxation upon the people ? And yet this was done by a portion only of our country  --  the Northern States ; and that , too , by a people totally of and hitherto unaccustomed to warlike pursuits . If such are our strength and resources when divided , what will they be united and against a // foreign foe ? England can not fail to see the question in this light , and in the future she will find her interest in courting our friendship and alliance , rather than in continual encroachment and exasperation . We shall hear no more of Bay Islands or northwestern boundaries , of San Juan or rights of search ; and the Monroe doctrine will perforce receive from her a recognition which she has never yet accorded to it . She will recognize as the fiat of destiny our supremacy on the western hemisphere . Foreign nations have respected us in the past ; they must fear us in the future . And while they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs of the Old World , they will be cautious of tampering with a power which has proved itself one of the first , if not the very first , on the face of the earth . For  --  and this is another effect of the war which may be noticed in this connection-for many years to come we shall be a military nation . The necessity of guarding against a similar outbreak in the future will prompt the increase of our standing army ; while the same cause , as well as the taste for military pursuits which our people will have acquired during this war , will keep the great mass of the people prepared to respond to the first call in the hour of danger . The militia laws will be revived , revised , and established on a firmer basis than ever before , and the antiquated militia musters and June trainings ' will again become our most cherished holidays . Independent military organizations will spring up and flourish all over the land , and he who aforetime wore his gorgeous uniform at the heavy cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a holiday soldier , will now be honored in enrolling his name among the Independent Rifles ' of his native village . The youth will labor to acquire the elements of military knowledge and reduce them to practice , not with a view to holiday parades. but with an eye to the possible exigencies of the future , knowing that when the hour of trial shall come , the post of honor and of fame will be open to all , and that he who has most cultivated the military art in time of peace will bid fair to win in the race for preferment . Military schools will derive a new importance in our country ; they will be patronized by high and tow , and most of our institutions of learning will , ere many years , have a military as well as a scientific and classical department . And thus will the knowledge of the art of war bec'ome so universally diffused among the people , that in the event of another great struggle , we shall not be left , as heretofore , to depend upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops will spring like magic to the field , ready to march at once to victory , without the necessity of camps of instruction ' and twelve months ' delays . And when that day does come , woe to that potentate who shall have the temerity to provoke a war with our race of soldiers : his legions will be swept away like chaff before the whirlwind , and only defeat and disgrace will settle upon his banners . Again , the stimulus which this contest has applied to warlike invention has already placed us in that respect far ahead of the most warlike nation on earth . France has hitherto been known as the great originator in all military science : probably she will yet , for many years , retain the palm in the province of tactics and executive skill . But as an originator and perfecter of the engines and defences of war , America has already robbed her of her crown , and stands to-day unsurpassed . No greater proof is needed of our superiority in this respect than the fact that in two short years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war as it has existed for ages , rendering absurd the maxims and useless the experience of the olden days , while filling their places with systems and theories whose // practical results are so clear as to overwhelmingly sustain the new order of things , and compel not only the admiration but the support and adoption of the onlooking world . The antiquated weapons of warfare are harmless to-day , and their places are supplied by new and more destructive engines , which Europe must perforce adopt in self-defence , and thus bow to the genius of American invention , whereby the old is so entirely and radically supplanted by the new , that the Napoleons and Wellingtons of a past age would be but tyros in our battles of to-day . The lesson of the Monitors is not the only one Europe has learned from us within the last two years . And we have more to teach her yet , more marvels yet to be evolved from that inexhaustible mine of invention-the Yankee brain . For as long as the war shall last , furnishing not only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a present and substantial support to inventive genius , at the same time that a new stimulus is being constantly supplied by the events and experience of each succeeding day , the work will go on , and weapon after weapon , engine after engine , will be thrown into the world 's great market , constantly approaching nearer to the perfection of destructive power . And as there is no poison without its antidote , so the originating faculties of the American mind will be as fully exerted in the creation of defences against those very engines of destruction . Armed thus at all points , and containing within ourselves not only a source of future supply , but even the very fount of originating faculty in this speciality , we shall be a power with which it is dangerous to trifle  --  a power with which others will not care to come in collision in any other form than that of an overwhelming combination , which , thank God ! has become in these days one of the impossibilities of political maneuvring . Nor will they be anxious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty which furnishes us with material of war far in advance of the rest of the world . We have within ourselves every element of strength , every quality necessary to inspire and compel respect from all nations . In our own God-given faculties lie both the Procul , procul , este profcenil ' and the Tread not on me , or I bite , ' which in all ages have constituted so-called national honor and pride , and which will be to us the broad *gis of protection when the storm-cloud of war darkens the horizon of the world . If this fail , the fault will be our own ; we shall be unworthy custodians of the treasure ; our downfall will be merited as it is sudden and sure , and few will S be found to mourn over us . As the effervescence of new wine brings all impurities to the surface , casting off those noxious superfluities whose presence is pollution to the liquid and disease and death to the partaker , so the present war is but the effervescence of our as yet new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown to the surface of society , ready to be skimmed off by the hand of the people , who are themselves the vintners and the rectifiers . No system of government is without radical defects , and it was not to be expected that our own would be free from error , found ed as it is upon a principle new to the world , or only known as having totally failed in the past through the clumsiness of its originators and subsequent custodians-a system which had little aid from the experiences of the past , and must necessarily grope in the darkness which surrounds all new experiments of this kind , lighted only by the few , meagre , * priori truths of deductive reasoning . Our ancestors , hampered as they were by the lack of this great experience of social life , legislated for the men and circumstances of their time ; and though they had ever an eye to the future , yet , conscious of the fallibility of human wisdom and foresight , they themselves did not expect their work to stand // unclianged for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves would change with time , and with them must necessarily change the laws that govern their actions . Law and government must keep pace with the progress of humanity , else the nation itself becomes effete , superannuated , deteriorated . Many errors there doubtless are in our system , taking their rise as well in the very commencement of our existence as from the fluctuations of society Of these , some have hitherto lain inert and concealed , from the very lack of circumstances to induce their development , and from the lack of a field of action . Others have worked so slowly and insidious*y as to have remained totally concealed from our view , as well from the fact of their never having as yet been productive of any decided and palpable evil effect , as from our becoming gradually accustomed to them and their workings , and from the preoccupation of the public mind with more exciting questions . But in all times of popular excitement and tumult , of revolutionary ideas and attempted violent reform , errors spring forth in dazzling brightness from the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jove , armed with the full panoply of destructive war , clothed in the garb of maturity , and endowed with gigantic strength . Such has been the case in our day . As the early spring sun , warming the long-frozen soil and heating the foul moistures of the earth , brings to life and to the surface of the ground swarming myriads of noxious insects and reptiles , who , during the long winter months , have slept silent and torpid far down within the oozy depths , and hatches the thrice-told myriads of eggs deposited in seasons passed away , and which have long waited for his life-giving influence to pour forth their swarming millions to the upper air ; even so this war has hatched the eggs of error , and brought forth the torpid defects of long goneby decades , affording them a broad field of operation in their work of destruction ; while it has at the same time torn away the veil which has hitherto blinded our eyes , and shown us , in the disasters of to-day , the culmination of the evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretly at the very core of the body politic . But not alone has it brought forth error and corruption ; for the same harsh influence has also revivified the seeds of virtue and awakened the sleeping lion of justice , uprightness , and national honor , which shall act as healthful counterbalances to all the evil , and supplant the monsters of destructive error . For in the yvco*1 a*avrov of the Greek philosopher lies the secret of all reform . To know one 's faults is already one half the battle to correct them . He who becomes conscious that health of body and mind are steadily yielding to the inroads of an insidious foe , is worse than a fool if he do not at once apply the knife to the seat of disease , however painful may be the operation . And though to-day we hear but little of reform , and all parties seem striving which shall display the most devotion to the cause of the past , the most affection for the unchanged and unchangeable 8tatu8 quo ante lellum in all things , yet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today we have a task which occupies all our attention , absorbs all our powers and resources , and there is no time for reform : the all-absorbing and vital question being the establishing of things upon the old footing . But , peace restored , and the deathblow given to treason , the work of reform will commence . Then will become manifest the workings of the great mind of the nation during all this trying and bloody war . To acknowledge our defects and miscomings now , is but to give a handle to the enemies of our cause : but , this danger removed , the axe will at once be laid at the root of those evils which have come nigh to working our destruction ; all the unsightly excrescen. // ces which have for years been accumulating upon the trunk of our goodly tree will be carefully pruned away , and the result will be a healthier and more abundant fruit in the days to come . And these reforms will be brought about quietly , yet with a firm and vigorous hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination henceforth to leave no loophole for the entrance of the destroyer . No race of thinkers can ever be enslaved . Hitherto we have been too unreflecting , too much governed by momentary impulses , too much carried away by party cries and unhealthy enthusiasm , and hence completely beneath the sway of designing demagogues . We have left the politicians to do our thinking for us , and accepted too unhesitatingly their interested dicta as our rules of political action . The press has hitherto led the people , and so mighty an engine of political power has been eagerly seized and controlled by party leaders as a means of accomplishing their ends . All this will be done away with . We shall do our thinking for ourselves , and those who shall hereafter be put forward as the prominent actors upon the great stage of politics will become , what they have never before been save in name , the servants of the people . The press of America , like that of England , must hereafter follow , not lead , the sentiments of the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religiously conserved , that unrestrained license which has always too much characterized it will be restrained and brought within its true limits , not by statutes or brute force , but by the much more powerful agency of public opinion-by the danger of tampering with the cherished and elevated sentiments of the reading masses . And as a result of this newborn faculty of thought , we shall see the disappearance of extreme views and the birth of charity in our midst . Men will give due weight to the opinions and respect more the natural prejudices of their 129 fellows . While ultra conservatism is the rust which eats away the nation 's life , radicalism is the oxygen in which it consumes itself too rapidly away . Or perhaps* a better simile would be found in the components of atmospheric airnitrogen and oxygen ; the one a nonsupporter of combustion , the other giving it a too dazzling brilliancy at the expense of the material upon which it feeds ; yet both , properly combined , so as in a measure to neutralize each other , supporting the steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and heat , neither dazzling nor scorching . So conservatism and radicalism , properly intermingled and exercising a restraining influence upon each other , are the very life of a great and free people . And never , in the history of the world , have these principles been more thoroughly demonstrated , more clearly manifested to the eyes of even the unlearned and humble , than in the present war , in which one or the other of these two great mental phases has been the originator of every great movement to make no mention of the palpable effect , now appearing upon the face of society , of their action in the past . And hence , in the future , we shall see in a noble , far-reaching , broadly spreading , heaven-aspiring conservative radicalism the prevailing characteristic of American life and progress . Hitherto the very prime principle of self-government , an intelligent cognizance of public affairs and a reflective insight into the fundamental principles of liberty , has been totally neglected in our land . And if the events of these years shall really teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the very exercise of the Godgiven faculty will soon teach us to discriminate between true and false deductions , and restore Thought to her native empire ,  --  then the blood and treasure we have so lavishly poured out , the trembling and the mourning , the trials , the toils , and the privations // qwq who , consequently , if not the originators , are at least the aggravators , of all our misfortunes , need expect no mercy at the hands of the people . They must share the fate of their doctrines , and consent to be quietly shelved , buried beyond the hope of a resurrection : and it is to be hoped that their places will he filled by good , earnest , and true men , who have proved themselves devoted to the cause of our country 's advancement rather than to that of personal preferment . In this war , the men of the future must make their record , and whenever they shall come before the people for the posts of honor and distinction , they will be judged according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the altar of unity and freedom . For years to come the first question concerning a candidate will be , Was he loyal in the troublous times ? was he earnest and true ? There will be no distinction between the truly loyal Democrat and the earnest Republican . Those who have to-day stood shoulder to shoulder in the common cause will , whatever may be their difference in shades of opinion , be sworn friends in the future ; while he who has in these times been only noted for a carping , cavilling spirit , for activity in endeavors to hamper and thwart the constituted authorities in their efforts to restore and maintain the integrity of the Government , will to their dying day wear the damning mark of Cain upon their brows : their record will bear a stain which no subsequent effort can wipe away . And though in the days to come other exciting questions will arise to divide the people into strongly opposing parties , which , indeed , are necessary to all true national life , preserving the balance of political power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , above all , evolving truths by the very attrition of conflicting ideas , yet the intimate association of the past , bringing about a thorough acquaintance with the virtues and patriotism of the great mass of those who profess radically different ideas and opinions , as well as the wearing off of the sharp corners of those ideas themselves by a closer and more impartial observation , will tend to smooth away the asperities of partisan conflict , and beget greater charity and more respect for the opposing opinions of others , based upon a knowledge of the purity of intention and loftiness of purpose of political opponents . The evils of sectional feeling and sectional legislation , so clearly manifested in present events , will be avoided in the future , as the Maelstrom current which sucks in the stoutest bark to inevitable destruction : and while we shall still retain that natural love of home which binds us most closely to the place of our abode , the principle will be recognized that the well-being of the whole can only lie in the soundness and prosperity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines in our love of country , but all become members of one great brotherhood , citizens of one common and united country . The experience of the past will teach us to religiously avoid the snares and pitfalls that beset our path , the hidden rocks and shoals upon which our bark had wellnigh stranded ; and the science of politics will henceforward have a broader sweep , a loftier appreciation of national responsibility , a purer benevolence , a sublimer philanthropy . Among the influences which will greatly modify the future of American politics , not the least is the lately enacted banking law . Hitherto we have been divided in our finances as no nation ever was before . Every individual State has had not only its own system of banking , but its own separate and distinct currency ; a currency oftentimes based upon an insufficient security , and possessing only a local par value . The traveller who would journey from one portion of the country to another was driven to the alternative of converting his funds into bills of ex // change , or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the particular localities which he proposed to visit . Not to mention the inconvenience of such a state of things , it is productive of many dire evils , which it is not my purpose to enumerate , since they are already familiar to the majority of my readers . Suffice it to say that such a diversity in a point so vital to all enlightened nations , is antagonistic to the very spirit of our institutions , under a government whose existence depends upon the principle of unity , in a land whose prosperity depends upon the consolidation of all its constituent parts into one homogeneous whole . Not only is this diversity in the money market forever destroyed by the establishment of a uniform currency , but from the peculiar nature of the law , the stability of the Government is made a matter of direct self-interest to every individual citizen , than which no surer or more enduring bond of union can be devised . For self-interest , the Archimedean lever that moves the world , loses no jot of its influence when even honor and patriotism have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the currency is based must be deposited in the treasury vaults : in other words , the wealth of every individual citizen is under Government lock and key . Should , then , in the future , any misguided portion of our peo-. plc see fit to withdraw from our communion , irretrievable ruin not only stares them in the face , but is actually upon them from the moment the bond is severed . On the one side is devotion to the country , and a firm , secure currency , which at any moment will bring its full value in gold ; on the other , secession , with the inevitable attendant of a circulation , not depreciated , but utterly worthless , and that , too , with no other to fill its place , since the operation of the law must soon drive out of existence every dollar of the present local bank circulation : patriotism and prosperity arrayed against rebellion and ruin . The business men all see this , and in the event of any threatened disruption , they , the most influential part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all value , will be found firm and unwavering on the side of the duly constituted authority . Thus we shall have all the benefits of a funded national debt , with none of its attendant evils . And what a bond of union is this !  --  a bond which involves our very meat and drink , a bond which there can be no possible motive to sever so powerful as the incentive to union and mutual cooperation . Again , the financial crises with which our country has been afflicted at regular periods of her existence , lowering thousands at one moment from a condition of ease and comfort to one of the most pinching want , changing merchant princes to beggars , and spreading ruin far and wide , have owed their origin , not to a wild spirit of speculation , but to the over inflation of bank issues , which is itself the cause of that reckless speculation . This evil , too , will be done away with in the future , for the issue must and will be regulated by the demands of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securities , and who furnish the circulation based thereon , will control this matter and restrain the issue to its proper bounds . And even if it should run beyond that point , there will be less danger , since there can be no spurious basis , every dollar being secured by a tangible deposit in the Government vaults . The only escape from this view is in open and barefaced fraud , which will be easy of conviction , and no more to be feared than the ordinary operations of counterfeiters , and which will be effectually provided against . So carefull-y drawn are the provisions of the bill that no loophole is left for speculation ; and he who shall hereafter succeed in flooding the country with a wildcat ' currency , will be a shrewder financier and a more accomplished vil // lain than the world has yet seen . The people , too , will repose such a confidence in the banks as they have never done before . We shall hear little hereafter of ' runs upon the banks ; ' for the currency holders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherewithal to redeem the greater portion of the circulation of every bank in the land in the event of the closing of its doors , the only runs ' will be upon the deposits , and this only in cases of the grossest and most patent fraud and mismanagement on the part of the banks themselves . Hence , in times of financial peril we shall see the people combining to sustain the banks of their own locality , rather than , as is the case to-day , hastening to accelerate the ruin of perfectly solvent institutions which , but for tl ) eir ill-timed fright , might weather the storm . Again I say , there could be no greater element of union and strength than this , which has grown out of our necessities and tribulations . In spite of all the confusion and ruin and bloodshed , in spite of all the mourning , and suffering , and sundering of ties , and upheaving of the very foundations and apparent total disruption of American society , no greater blessing could have befallen us than this same war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consciousness of defects and determination of reform , thereby planting us firmly on the true road to prosperity and happiness and power . The wonderful display of our power and resources has given a reputationcall it notoriety , if you will-among the middle and lower classes of the old world , which in long years of peace we could not have attained . And our success in withstanding the terrible tempest which has assailed us , in maintaining the integrity of our political system , will spread that reputation far and wide , and give us a prestige whose effect will be seen in the increased tide of immigration that will flow in upon us upon the reestablishment of peace . The teeming soil and salubrious climate of the far West , together with the prospect it affords , not only of wealth , but of social advancement , both of which are forever denied them in their own country , and extremely difficult of attainment even in our own Eastern States , where the population is denso and every branch of industry crowded to repletion , will allure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the prairie land . In the immense unsettled tracts west of the Mississippi there is room for the action of men inured to toil , and promise of quick and abundant returns for their labor . There they will be free from the disastrous competition of their superiors in education and enlightenment , and have opportunities such as no other portion of the earth presents , for the founding of communities of their own , and the practical realization of their own ideas of social progress . Comparatively few years will pass after the restoration of peace before the West will be peopled by the very bone and sinew of all civilized nations . And these men will come to our shores imbued with the bitterest hatred of monarchical institutions , and an unbounded admiration and love of our own . Hence the new country will be intensely republican in its tendencies , and this will be another strong bond of union-another mighty element of strength and perpetuity to republicanism . For , as the movement goes steadily on , in time the balance of political power will rest with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strong bias in favor of antiquated customs , laws , and usages , the result of centuries of unopposed tyranny , is eradicated from the minds of these men . They must be properly instructed in the principles of true liberty and selfgovernment . They must be familiarized with the workings of free institutions and put to school in the experience of our century of experimcnt . Our very safety requires it ; for so great is the // field and so quickly will it be filled , that if we are not alive to the work , a mighty nation will soon have sprung up on our borders , and almost in our midst , which will be entirely beyond our control , and threaten the very existence of our race , and of the principles we most cherish . For the danger is that , suddenly released from all the restrictions of their o'v*n feudal climes , they will fly to the other extreme , and become lawless , reckless , and turbulent . For many years to come all legislation must have an eye to the possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West , and to the exigencies arising from causes which at present we know not of save by conjecture . We have a future before us such as the past has never known , and an incentive , nay , rather a necessity , for more vigorous action than we have yet been called upon to display , and for a deeper and more far-sighted wisdom than has ever yet pervaded our councils . The religious future of i ; his portion of our country is veiled in the deepest obscurity . Here we shall have the freethinking German , the bigoted Roman Catholic , the atheistic Frenchman , and the latitudinarian Yankee , in one grand heterogeneous conglomeration of nations and ideas such as the world has never seen . Whether these diverse peculiarities will by close contact and mutual attrition* by the advancing light of education and refinement as well as by the progress of intellect , be in . time softened down , assimilated , and fused into a pure , elevating religion , or aggravated till they result in a godless , materialistic race , God only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prognosticate of religion , or prophecy with the remotest degree of its future action . For it is a thing of God , under his exclusive care , and subject to none of the influences of human action . In His hands we must leave it , in the earnest hope and belief that He will not suffer His divine purposes to be thwarted , and this people , to whom He has in. trusted the task of the world 's regeneration , to forget and deny their God , who has led them on to power and prosperity and happiness , to go back upon the scale of the soul 's eternal progress , and become a race of wicked , corrupt , and God-defying sensualists . Yet there is no maxim more true than that the gods help those who help themselves , ' and in this great work of religious advancement we have nevertheless a part to act , a duty to perform . And the day is not far distant when the work of the missionary in our own land will overshadow that of the teacher in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our exertions , all our contributions ; and if we do our duty by our own people , we shall be forced , for a time at least , to leave the task of instructing the heathen of foreign lands to the Christian nations of the Old World . Our greatest responsibility is here , and it behooves us to look well to the religious culture of our own rapidly increasing population , that in after times they may be fitted for the task of Christianizing the worid . Every nation has its crisis , when its existence trembles in the balance , and through which it must safely pass before it can be firmly established as a great fact in history , a tangible landmark of progress , a controlling influence in the affairs of humanity . Nor is this crisis ever a mere fortuitous circumstance , but the necessary consequence of conflicting ideas and of untried systems . It is that point in the great process of assimilation when different and hitherto almost discordant elements tremble on the verge either of a harmonious blending for all time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence it was not to be imagined that we could escape the common lot : our crisis was to be expected , and now that it has come upon us it is to be manfully met , and so controlled by an iron will , a loftiness of determination , and a purity of aim , that / // it leave us not stranded among the breakers of disunion and political death . And if we shall succeed in so controlling the mighty current of affairs , we may rcst assured that we shall be purified by the trial , and shall have established a position on earth that no subsequent events can shake , until God , in His own good time , shall bid us give way to some higher development of mankind , ' if such shall be His will . With a noble and worthy nationality ; with an incontestable position of strength and political influence , a widely diffused skill and experience in military affairs , a fund of warlike invention , and unbounded physical resources , which shall free us from all annoyances and intermeddlings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the errors of the past , and a deeper insight into the capabilities as well as the exigencies of the present and the future ; with a regenerated and highertoned press ; with an ctnctthemct maranathct for treason , in whatever shape it may assume ; with a purer charity for the opinions of others , and a more graceful yielding of the obnoxious characteristics of our own ; with a firmly established and health-giving system of finance ; with a rapidly increasing 135 population , bringing with it an increase of responsibility , and furnishing a broader field for the development of our energies and resources ; with a glorious past behind and a golden future before us , we shall sweep majestically on upon the waves of time , an object of admiration to the world and of justifiable pride to ourselves  --  a great , and glorious , and , above all , a free , happy , united , and prosperous people . God grant it may be so ! God grant that we may be true to the trust reposed in us , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are bound up the hopes of the whole world-may not again fall to the earth through the blindness and weakness and incompetence of us , who are to-day its only exponents . May we of this day and generation live to see the crowning of all these hopes ; and when our sun goes down in the shadows of eternity , may we be able to look back and thank God for the trials and sufferings and losses and mournings of to-day , as the refining fire through which we have come strong and bright , the sharp knife whereby the gnawing worms of error . and corruption and inevitable death have been cut from the heart of our goodly tree .
