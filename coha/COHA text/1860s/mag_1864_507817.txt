destruction . At this portentous moment , Farmers-Brother interposed . He replied riot to his brother chief , but , with a sagacity truly aboriginal , he caused a cessation of the council , introduced good cheer , commended the eloquence of Red-Jacket , and , before the meeting had re-assembled , with the aid of other prudent chiefs , he had moderated the fury of his nation to a more salutary review of the question before them . Suffice it to say , the treaty was concluded , and the Western district , at this day , owes no small portion of its power and influence to the counsels of a savage , in comparison with whom , for genius , heroism , virtue , or any other quality that can adorn the bawble of a diadem , not only George the Fourth and Louis le D6sir6 , hut the German Emperor and Czar of Muscovy , alike dwindle into insignificance .

II . - S'ylva . flmericana ; or a Description of the Forest Trees indigenous to the United States , Practically and Botanically considered . Illustrated by more than One Hundred Engravings . By DANIEL J. BROWNE . Boston . 1832 . Svo. pp. 408 . THE subject of American Forest Trees is one which has long engaged the attention of enlightened European naturalists , and has more especially given rise to the splendid " Sylva " of Francis Andrew Michaux . To this accomplished and liberalminded Frenchman this country certainly owes a heavy debt of gratitude . If our people , or our rulers , should become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our forests , before we feel it to our cost by their destruction or serious diminution , it will be owing directly or indirectly more to the // publication of the " Sylva Americana , " than to all other causes together . This work has been faithfully and elegantly translated by our accomplished countryman , Augustus L. Hillhouse . But tbe style in which the book is printed , both in the original and the translation , and more especially the number and beauty of its colored plates , have rendered it of necessity very expensive , and it consequently has found but few purchasers ; a fact the more to be regretted as it was published at the cost of the author , who , we are informed by Mr. Hillhouse , has executed this work at a price ill becoming the modest fortune of a man of letters . Its descriptions nay be found in a much cheaper form in the valuable work , by our fellow-citizen , Daniel J. Browne , the title of which we have placed at the head of this article . Mr. Browne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatness and in a type easily read , and containing , within a very reasonable compass , much authentic information on a most interesting subject . Much originality could not be expected , at the present day , in any treatise on such topics ; but Mr. Browne certainly deserves great credit for the extensive research and sound judgment with which he has selected his materials from the best sources , and the agreeable manner in which he has disposed them . The work is divided into three parts . The first is a treatise on Dendrology , or the structure and growth of trees generally . This portion of the work is of a more scientific and less popular cast than the rest , and may seem at the first view little likely to interest the mere general reader . It is , however , succinct and clear , and will well repay an attentive perusal . The anatomy and physiology of trees are subjects which have been till lately very imperfectly developed , and which we fear receive even now little attention from any class of persons except professed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in most others , would require the labor of years , but some knowledge of their leading general principles must be deemed essential to any well-educated American , by all who reflect for a moment on the extent and importance of our forests ; and we know not where such knowledge could be more cheaply and conveniently procured than from our author . - The next and longest portion of the volume consists in descriptions of the different species of the forest trees of this country , accompanied by neat and distinct // engravings . These descriptions are taken principally , if not wholly , from the Sylva of Michaux ; but Mr. Browne has certainly rendered an important public service by placing the valuable information , contained in that rare and splendid book , within the reach of the community generally . The work concludes with a treatise on the rearing and management of trees . This part abounds in minute and practical directions , which are for the most part sanctioned , to the best of our knowledge , by the precepts and practice of the highest authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best horticultural publications which has issued from the American press ; and we can not but regard its appearance , and that of other valuable productions on the same topics , as highly seasonable at the present period . If this country has been highly distinguished in any respect by the bounty of nature , it is in the number and variety of its trees . If we were compelled to describe the territory of the United States in a few words , we could not do it more philosophically than in the language of Volney , who represents it as one vast forest , diversified by occasional cultivated intervals . With the exception of some of the prairies of the Valley of the Mississippi , we are not aware that there is any considerable section within our present States , which was originally destitute of wood . Beyond the immediate vicinity of our large towns , we find every stream thickly shaded by overhanging branches , and every mountain , with the exception of a few of the highest , covered with a leafy screen of all varieties of shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of population and of improvement , astonishing as it has been , has been insufficient to efface to any degree this distinguishing feature of American scenery ; and the striking picture , drawn by one of our own poets , of the native aspect of the country , has not yet lost its general resemblance . " Then all this youthful paradise around , And all the broad and boundless mainland lay Cooled by the interminable wood , that frowned O'er mount and vale , where never summer ray Glanced , till the strong tornado broke its way , Through the gray giants of the sylvan wild ; Yet many a sheltered glade , with blossoms gay Beneath the showering sky and sunshine mild . Within the shaggy arms of that dark forest smiled . " // The extent of our woods is not more remarkable , than the various kinds of trees which compose them . It is stated by Michaux , that in the United States there are one hundred and forty species of forest trees , which attain to a greater height than thirty feet , while in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of the solid advantages which we derive from this abundant variety , we shall say nothing at present . It needs only a cursory glance , to perceive how much it enhances the beauty of our natural scenery . " I was never tired , " says an intelligent English traveller , " of the forest scenery of America , although I passed through it from day to day . The endless diversity of foliage always prevents it from being monotonous . " The variety of shape and tints in their green foliage is not , however , the chief distinction of our woods over those of the old world . They surpass them far more in the rich and various hues of their autumnal leaves . This , if not the most striking , is certainly the most unique feature of an American landscape . What natural scenery can surpass in beauty that presented by one of our forests to our view , in one of the brilliant and serene afternoons of our Indian summer , when the trees are clothed with a tapestry of the richest gold and purple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hues of our autumnal sunsets It is not the mere variety of coloring , which is the peculiar characteristic of our fading leaves . This variety exists also in European woods , though to a less extent ; for , as has been already stated , their catalogue of forest trees is far more scanty than ours . But their leaves , in divesting themselves of their summer green , lay aside also all their brilliancy , and assume a complexion proverbially dull and faded . It is a peculiarity , on the contrary , of many of our forest trees , that their leaves , in changing their hue , lose little or nothing of their brightness , and that their autumnal dress is not only far richer , but scarcely less lively , than their freshest June liveries . This circumstance is generally ascribed to some peculiarity in our climate , and especially to the manner in which the cold weather makes its first approaches . But this manner varies almost every year , and yet our trees exhibit annually the same splendid changes . For this , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , that the peculiarity is not in the climate , but in the trees themselves , and that it is one of those shades // of difference , which distinguish in almost every instance the plants of ' America from their kindred species in the old world . A transplanted American maple , for instance , would probably undergo the same splendid transmutations in an English park as in its native forest . This supposition has been formed on much consideration , and is besides sanctioned by the opinion of an eminent English botanist , who has resided in this country for several years . We have observed that scarcely any considerable portion of this country is entirely devoid of magnificent forest trees . But whatever striking instances of the truth of this remark we may find in New England , and more especially in Vermont and Maine , it must be admitted that he who would behold sylvan scenery on its most magnificent scale , should cross the Alleghanies , and visit the great Valley of the Mississippi . Here he will find vast tracts , into which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with a coat of vegetable mould , exceeding in many places the depth of our richest soils . We find accordingly a luxuriance of vegetation , to which nothing in our own State affords a parallel . It is true that with us there is here and there a gigantic elm or buttonwood , which might take rank with the noblest specimens of western growth . But in travelling in Kentucky or Indiana , we find trees , at every step , of six or seven feet in diameter ; so that most of our woods , compared as a whole with theirs , seem to he but as the product of yesterday . Every plant appears to partake of this gigantic character . Thus the wild grape vine , which with us rarely grows larger than a stout walking-stick , in our Western States sometimes surpasses in diameter the body of a full-grown man . This fact we have verified by actual ad measurenient . The majesty of our western forests is not a little increased by the circumstance that they are generally free from undergrowth . The banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest size , shooting up to a lofty height from the smooth levels or gentle swells of the green prairies beneath , like the oaks in the finest parks of England . So tastefully are these trees grouped by the hand of nature , and so entirely clear is the green prairie grass from undergrowth , that the spectator can hardly avoid imagining , that he is looking not at a new country , but at one which was once // peopled by a highly-cultivated community , who have been long since swept away with every vestige of their wealth and refinement , except their stately groves and verdant lawns . We have thus far spoken of our forests merely as a predominant and magnificent feature of American scenery . But it is scarcely necessary to say , that they have other claims to our attention , of a far more solid character . It is to our forests that we have heen indebted for two hundred years for our fuel and our shelter . How much of the progress of New England at least , since its first settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nature in this particular ! Whatever were the calamities , in other respects , of those much-enduring men , they were at least exempted from the extreme and probably fatal suffering , to which they would have been suhjected in a thinly-wooded region . Had the aborigines possessed that determined and unsparing hostility to large trees , which seems to have actuated many of their successors , it is probable that these northern settlements would never have had a being . One of the most remarkable of the forest trees of the United States is the White Pine , called in England the Weymouth pine , and known by botanists as the Pinus *Strobus . This tree must he familiar to many of our readers in various ways , as it abounds in our neighbourhood , and as its branches are more frequently employed than those of any other tree , for the decoration of our Catholic and Episcopal churches . It may be distinguished at first sight from every other evergreen growing in this State , hy the lightness and delicacy of its foliage , as well as by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , it is found to differ from all other pines or spruces here or elsewhere , in being what is called five-leaved , that is , in putting forth its leaves in sheaths each containing five . The leaves of all evergreen trees , except the pine family , are without a sheath , and those of other pines grow in sheaths containing two or three . This tree is certainly the most majestic in the country , when it reaches its full growth in our forests . Though it does not spread in a graceful sheaf like the elm , nor rise up in a regular spire like the fir , it more than coixipensates for the *ant of these beauties , by its loftiness . None of the productions of this country approach it in this particular . It is sometimes said to reach the height of more than two hundred feet , and Michaux actually measured one which had been felled , and which exceeded one hundred and fifty ; // and the trunk is singularly smooth and straight . A magnificent appearance is far from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England are equally indebted to any other production of our forests ; not even to the oak . Michaux remarks , that throughout the Northern States , except in the larger capitals , seven tenths of the houses are of wood , of which seven tenths , three quarters , estimated at half a million , ( this estimate was made nearly thirty years ago , ) are of white pine . In the first part of this statement , there is a mistake quite remarkable , in a writer of such singular research and accuracy . If we except the larger capitals , we ought to say not that seven tenths , but nine tenths at least , of houses in the northern States , are wooden ; indeed the number of those of a different description may he considered as too small to deserve notice ; and of these nine tenths the great mass are of white pine . This tree owes its selection for this most important purpose to one quality in particular , the small expense of labor at which it can he fashioned and put together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear exposure to the fierce temperature and sudden changes of our climate , than any other pine which abounds in New England , it is also lighter , softer , and more free from knots . In favorable situations the diameter of the trunk varies from three to seven feet ; and thus it furnishes planks for building of ample dimensions . This tree has also one important quality in common with the locust , which is denied to many other of our best timber trees . We mean the great proportion which the heart , or perfect wood , bears even in young trees to the alburnum or sap wood , being not less than eleven to one in trees of a foot in diameter . In all timber after felling , it is the sap wood which is the first to decay , and which is as unfit for any useful purpose , as the unripened products of nature generally . Hence it is an important element in the value of the white pine , that it ripens its wood at so early a period . It is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely exposed to the elements , or when set in the ground , its timber can not compete with many of the harder woods ; but if well seasoned and kept carefully painted , it will endure for centuries , without any symptoms of decay , as we find attested by many wooden houses , more especially in our large towns . Where entirely covered , it seems to be incorruptible . But , were its durability less , the other qualities // to which we have adverted , namely , its lightness and softness , would form a most liberal equivalent . It is not easy to estimate , how much the rapid advancement of New England may have been owing to the abundance of this valuable tree . The importance of shelter is a point which it requires few lessons from our winter climate to set forth ; and by no tree with which we are acquainted , could this want be supplied so rapidly and easily , as by the white pine . At the value which human labor has always maintained among us , the difference of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general employment of the oak , for instance , instead of the pine , for our houses , would be enormous . In many parts of the Valley of the Mississippi , this pine , as well as almost every other species of pine , is exceedingly rare . The settlers are in consequence obliged to substitute the oak , both for their houses and their furniture . Their dwellings , ( we speak of the new settlers , ) are generally of oak filled in with earth , and are quite inferior , both in appearance and comfort , to those which we find in the newly-cleared lands of Maine . We are scarcely less indebted to the white pine , for our commercial and naval , than for our civil , architecture . It is this tree , which gives us , not indeed the frames , but the masts of our vessels , for which it is admirably fitted , by the degree in which it comhines the qualities of durability and lightness , as well as by the straightness of its trunk . Its place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hardly be supplied . During our colonial existence , its value was fully appreciated by the mother country ; and , more than one hundred years ago , some statutes were passed , restricting the cutting of trees proper for masts . We have found no evidence , however , that these statutes were ever enforced ; and , however useful in their design , they would interfere quite too much with private liberty , to render their renewal desirable , so far as respects the land of individuals . But it is certainly well worthy the consideration of the legislature of Maine , whether effectual measures should not be taken , for the preser* vation , and perhaps the propagation of valuable timber on the public lands , within her jurisdiction ; and the deep interest which our own commonwealth has in those lands , might render a respectful interposition on her part advisable . The fame of the white pine has long since extended to // Europe , principally by means of the stocks which have been exported to England , to supply in part her immense demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been introduced into that country , but is not highly appreciated , and we have found no English writer who does it full justice . The truth is , however , that the climate of England is not fitted to its developement . The limits within which it flourishes in this country , are the 43d and 47th degrees of latitude . Now no part of the Island of Great Britain has a climate which answers to that of this region . The northern extremity of Scotland , which lies in about the 58th or 59th degree of latitude , is visited with winters far less rigorous than the great majority of our own . Besides , there are few situations in Great Britain , which furnish the soil in which this tree chiefly delights . The most magnificent specimens of the white pine in this country are found in the depths of our forests , in a virgin soil covered with the accumulated mould of centuries , and above all on the banks of rivers , or in the beds of large cedar swamps . In pleasure grounds , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires a longer time to do so , than has yet been allowed in any instance within our knowledge . It grows , however , with considerable rapidity , and soon acquires a loftiness and bulk equal to that of most cultivated trees ; and its highly polished bark and light silvery foliage , render it , from the time it springs from the soil , a desirable accession to every shrubbery . The next of our principal forest trees , which we shall notice , is the White Oak . The general appearance of oaks is more familiar to us of this region , than that of any other class of forest trees , except the elm and the plane tree . The oak is far less lofty than the pine , and has no pretensions to the elegance of the elm ; but as an emblem of robust vigor , it stands , both in the old and new world , at the head of all the sons of the forest . In short , a full-grown oak can be considered as occupying the same place among fine trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be described in the terms applied to that magnificent work of art by an English poet , as " strength embodied . " Such has been its character in all ages . It is also supposed to be a tree of slower growth and longer life than any other , though its superiority in this last respect over the chestnut , is far from incontestable . The useful qualities of its wood have also been // appreciated from time immemorial , in every country in the temperate zone . For these reasons probably , the oak has been regarded with a degree of veneration , from the earliest ages of mankind . The first funereal monument on record was an oak tree . But in no country has it been more valued , more honored or cherished , than in that of our forefathers , and with abundant reason , as forming the chief material of those wooden walls , to which they have more than once owed their national existence . Hence it has long been recommended to us by many historical and poetical associations , and the achievements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits , which we have derived from our commerce , have given it a new and far stronger claim to our veneration . Of all the species of this genus , which grow in the latitude of New England , the most valued is the white oak , ( Quercus . fIlba . ) This is easily distinguished from every other tree of the same kind in our vicinity by the whiteness of its bark , and by the persisting , or holding on , of a few of the dried leaves , in the winter season . Its leaves are also without prickles or bristles at the end of their lobes , a quality in which it agrees with no large oak in this State except the swamp white oak , ( Quercus prinus discolor . ) It bears a greater analogy than any other oaks , to the celebrated oak of England , European white oak , or Qucrcus pedunculata . Which of the two trees furnishes the finer timber , is a question which has been investigated with great care . It is stated by high authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more elastic , and more flexible , than that of the English , but that it is on the whole weaker and less durable ; and this opinion is sanctioned by a large number of English writers . We are inclined however to doubt , whether the question has been fully settled by facts ; for some of those who have expressed such an opinion in strong terms , conclude by admitting , that , after all , American vessels might be no less durable than English , were their timber equally well seasoned . The white oak was largely employed in the frame of our favorite frigate , which was built forty years ago . In the course of the very thorough repair to which that vessel was lately subjected , many of the white oak timbers of her frame were found in excellent condition ; and it was stated on the best authority , that in several instances , timbers of this description were sound , while others by their side , of the southern live oak , // had decayed . Now the superiority of the live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other country , has never yet been questioned . The English oak , however , if really superior , could he easily multiplied in our Northern and Middle States . It has been already introduced , and some fine specimens of more than twenty years ' growth may be seen in our neighbourhood . The timber generally selected for ship-building is what is called the pasture oak . This is greatly preferred to that which grows in crowded forests , where the trees , from their vicinity to each other , are robbed of much of the nutriment which they derive from the soil , as well as of the genial influence of the sun and air . Hence the building of a single large vessel requires the timber of many acres , and as the white oak is constantly felled in great quantities , both for home consumption and for exportation , the period can not be distant when serious difficulty will be experienced in procuring a supply of this valuable wood . In this connexion , it may be proper to make one or two remarks on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the durability of timber depends materially on the season when this operation is performed ; but what that season is , is a question on which directly opposite opinions are held by the ablest writers . The principal cause of the decay of wood of all descriptions , is thought to be the sap , which remains after felling ; and hence the desired object is , to procure timber as free as possible from this ingredient . To this end , it has been recommended to fell the tree in the winter season , as it is then deemed to contain the smallest quantity of sap ; and such we believe is the general practice . This doctrine , however , has been opposed with great ability , by the late Colonel Pickering , who states , and with truth , that trees are not devoid of sap in winter , but that it exists in abundance , though greatly thickened by the cold . He maintains , therefore , that it is much more difficult to expel than in summer , when in a more liquid form , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not when it contains least sap , but when the sap which it does contain , may most easily escape or be expelled . This opinion certainly seems to be the better one , though the winter season is so much more convenient on many accounts than any other for the procuring of timber , that the old practice will probably maintain its ground . But whatever may be thought // of the correctness of Colonel Pickering 's theory , no one will question the propriety of the suggestion , with which he concludes his remarks , that the point should he determined by actual experiments , under the direction of our Navy Board , or some other high scientific authority . - Besides the white oak , there are four other species in our vicinity , which grow to a large size . Of these the most valuable are the Swamp White , and the Black Oak . The swamp white oak is not abundant , and grows only in moist soils . It has been less used than the white oak , partly on account of its rarity ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it may be found , on accurate examination , to be superior . The black oak is valued not for its timber , which is of an inferior quality , but for its hark , for it is this , which furnishes the quercitron , so much used for imparting a beautiful yellow die to wool , paper , &amp;c. * Next to the pines and oaks , there seems to be no tree in the country , of more extensive celebrity than the Sugar . lJIaple . The extraordinary neatness of its appearance , and the beauty of its foliage , which in summer is of the liveliest green , and in autumn assumes the richest and most glowing red , are sufficient to recommend it as a beautiful ornament , in our gardens and avenues . The bark is remarkably smooth , and the tree is infested , we believe , by no insect , nor subject to any maladies . The branches are disposed with much regularity , though without stiffimss , and so arranged , that their usual outline is an elegant oval . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curled and bird's-eye maple , employed in cabinet work , which rivals , if it be not admitted to * In a communication in the 4th volume of " The New England Farmer , " made several years ago by one of our most distinguished fellow-citizens , mention is made of the trunks of several large oaks in Dorchester , in one of which he had counted upwards of two hundred annual rings . The largest oak , and indeed the largest tree which we have seen in this country , is a white oak , on the estate of James Wadsworth , Esq . of Genesee . The tree is from twenty-four to twenty-seven feet in circumference at the smallest part of the trunk . Its age can not be less than five hundred years , and it must , therefore , have been a majestic tree at the time when Columbus discovered the western world . It appears to be still in a vigorous and healthy condition , and bears in its exterior no marks whatever of decay . It is by no means improbable that this tree exceeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are recorded as of greater diameter . For in the measurement of large trees , it is of great importance to ascertain at what part of the trunk the measurement was taken . Every one must have remarked the difference between the bulk of such trees at the surface of the ground , and at a few feet above . // surpass in brilliancy and richness , the finest woods of tropical climates . But the sugar maple derives its chief reputation , as well as its name , from the qualities of its sap . A large portion of the sugar used in many parts of the country , the western districts of Vermont and New York for instance , is derived from the maple . Michaux remarked , nearly thirty years since , that at least ten millions of pounds of this sugar were then annually made in the United States . This quantity is far less than might be procured , from the same source , in case of necessity . According to Dr. Rush , the northern part of New York and Pennsylvania alone , contained at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , if we suppose each tree to yield on an average from two to four pounds of sugar annually , the product would go far towards supplying the whole consumption of the country . The maple sugar can be made of a quality equal to the best imported . We have seen it formed into very good loaf sugar . It is , however , in a brown state that it is generally used ; and , except in the districts where it is produced , it is less agreeable to the palate of consumers generally , than the product of the cane . To manufacture it , requires a great expense not only of labor , but of fuel ; and hence it probably can not he sold , at a distance , for a price which will enable it to compete with the imported article . The sap of the tree , or maple juice , as it is called , is greedily coveted by wild and domestic animals , who break through enclosures for the sake of obtaining it , and is generally an agreeable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one instance , in which it proved to be of a highly intoxicating quality . rrhi circurnstance occurred , about thirty years since , in the western part of the State of New York . All the sap procured from the maple trees of an extensive district , was found to have undergone a vinous fermentation ; and children who drank it freely were in some cases rendered delirious , for two or three days . We have heard of no other instance of this phenomenon , nor have we learned that any probable explanation has been given of its cause . The last of our forest trees which we shall notice , is one of which we need say hut little , either in the way of description or recommendation . We mean our American Elm . In a strictly economical point of view , this tree is of little value , as neither its wood nor its bark is employed to any extent in the // useful arts . It is subject to the disadvantage of being more attacked by the cankerworm , than any other of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed its foliage in autumn . It is a tree also , which proves rather a troublesome inmate in small gardens and enclosures , as it spreads its roots far and wide , and frequently protrudes them above the surface of the ground , so that it completely monopolizes a large extent of soil . But where a proper space can be allotted to it , there is no tree which rivals it in grace and majesty . Michaux pronounces it to be decidedly the most magnificent vegetable production of the temperate zone . Few , who have seen this tree in favorable situations , will question its right to this preeminence . Happily we need not go far to find this remark splendidly illustrated . We refer to the triple row of elms which adorns the Boston Mall . What is there in the finest specimens of architecture in that city , public or private , to which a Bostonian can turn with nore pleasure or more exultation ? Who has ever contemplated those solid colonnades and shady arches , without grateful feelings to the unknown individual to whose taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , had he chosen to record it , would have been far better perpetuated by such a memorial , than by the proudest monument of brass or marble ? We have seen nothing of the same description in any part of the country , to be compared to this magnificent avenue ; but every one must have observed single elms , of equal or superior magnitude and beauty to any of the trees of which it is composed . These are generally the relics of our original forests ; and the care with which they are now preserved and protected , furnishes a striking and gratifying evidence of an improving taste for sylvan scenery . We have thus called the attention of our readers to a very few of the forest trees of this country . It might be gratifying to speak also of several of those of the old world ; but we could not do so without extending this article beyond its proper limits . We have already observed that the list of European forest trees is far more scanty than ours , and there are very few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ botanical treasures . Many of the most important classes or genera of forest trees are common to both continents , such as the oak , ash , elm , &amp;c . Those trees of the old world and the new , which bear the same name , generally resemble each // other to a great degree ; but in almost every instance , the resemblance stops short of complete exactness . Thus we find that the elms , willows , and larches of Europe and America , though manifestly belonging to the same class of vegetable productions , differ from each other materially either in their size , their beauty , or the value of their timber . This seems merely an application of the general law of nature , which leads her to avoid , in all her productions , any thing like mathematical resemblance ; a rule , of which we have a familiar proof , in the fact that no two leaves can be found on any tree , which do not manifestly differ in shape or size . There is , however , one tree of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our imaginations , by early associations both of a poetical and sacred character , that we can not forbear to speak of it more particularly ; we mean the Cedar of Lebanon . This tree was for a long time supposed to be indigenous only on the mountains of Palestine , whence it derives its name . The researches of later botanists have discovered it on other high ridges , and it has been said to have been found more especially in the northern part of Russia . It is classed with the larches , a place to which it is entitled , among other reasons , by the shape and size of its leaves , and the manner in which they are disposed on its branches . These branches extend themselves to an uncommonly wide distance , are arranged in stages one above another , and are horizontal or rather slightly inclining to the earth , and thus form an irregular penthouse . In the opinion of the best judges , this tree owes its beauty partly to this arrangement of its limbs , and partly to the density and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in its native mountains , that we can find any magnificent specimens of this renowned plant , and of these specimens the number is small , and constantly diminishing . We are told , that , in 1789 there were only seven cedars on Mount Lebanon , of a very large size , one or two of which were found by measurement to be thirty feet in circumference These noble trees are probably the growth of several centuries , but we should give ourselves up quite too far to the guidance of our fancies , if we supposed , as many writers seem inclined to do , that they were coeval with the days of Solomon . The whole number of cedars on this spot , large and small , is about a hundred ; and they are said to be annually // honored by a *0**0Li5 religious ceremony , attended by several thousand devotees . But however magnificent the appearance of this tree , and however numerous and interesting the associations with which it is connected , we are compelled by the testimony of the best authorities , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has long been invested in popular estimation . It has been called , for instance , a lofty tree . To this title it has no pretension , as we have no well-authenticated account of its exceeding the height of a hundred feet , and it seldom rises to much more than half that elevation . There is also a popular impression , that its wood is distinguished by durability . This opinion is derived partly from the representations of the ancients , * and partly from the fact , that the timber of its namesakes , the cedars of our own country , is remarkable for this quality . According to the great majority of botanists , the wood of the cedar of Lebanon is an inferior kind of deal , resembling so me descriptions of pine , but less durable . For the purposes of timber , therefore , this tree is unworthy of cultivation . Whether its beauty , and its historical and poetical celebtity , are sufficient recommendations for its introduction , is a question unfortunately of little interest to us , as there is probably no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised to advantage in the open air . It is true that , in its native locality , it is subjected to a high degree of cold , as it grows immediately below the covering of eternal snow , which rests on the summit of Lebanon . But the atmosphere even of England is unsuited to its full developement , on account of its want of sufficient moisture , and therefore it must be entirely out of the question , to suppose that it could flourish in our proverbially bright and dry climate . It seems to partake of the nature of what are called Alpine plants , and every gardener knows , that such plants are of all others the most difficult to rear , and that it is next to impossible to supply them with a * It is well known that the ancients were far from accurate in their botanical knowledge , and that , even in our day , nothing is more common or mote vexatious , than the great confusion and numerous mistakes , which result from describing vegetable productions merely by their popular names . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cedar was not often given by ancient writers to some species of pine or cypress . // proper equivalent , for the constant shade and moisture , which they enjoy on the cloud-capped tops of their native hills . It was our intention to have submitted , in this place , a few practical hints on the subject of planting . But as complete directions may be found in books easily accessible , we have concluded rather to occupy the space with an account of the mode in which the business of procuring timber and boards , commonly called lumbering or logging , is carried on in the principal timber regions in Maine . This account was furnished us by a highly intelligent friend residing in Bangor ; and we trust may be interesting , from its own merit , as well as from the importance of the branch of industry which it describes . " When a lumberer has concluded to log on a particular tract , the first step is to go with a part of his bands , and select suitable situations for building his camps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as near as possible to the best clumps of timber he intends to haul , and to the streams into which he intends to haul it . He then proceeds to build his camps , and to cut out and clear out his principal roads . The camps are built of logs , being a kind of log houses . They are made about three feet high on one side and eight or nine on the other , with a roof slanting one way . The roof is made of shingles , split out of green wood , and laid upon rafters . The door is made of such boards as can be manufactured out of a log with an axe . Against the tallest side of the camp is built the chimney ; the back being formed by the wall of the camp , and the sides made by green logs , piled up for jams , about eight feet apart . The chimney seldom rises above the roof of the camp ; though some , who are nice in their architectural notions , sometimes carry it up two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction , that nothing but the greenness of the timber prevents the camp from being burnt up immediately . Yet the great fires that are kept up , make but little impression , in the course of the winter , upon the back or sides of the chimney . A case , however , happened within a year or two , where a camp took fire in the night , and was consumed , and the lumberers in it were burnt to death . Probably the shingle roof had become dry , in which case a spark would kindle it , and the flames would spread over it in a moment . " Parallel to the lower side of the building , and about six feet from it , a stick of timber runs on the ground across the camp . The space between this and the lower wall is appropriated to the bedding ; the stick of timber serving to confine it in its // place . The bedding consists of a layer of hemlock boughs spread upon the ground , and covered with such old quilts and blankets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The men camp down together , with their heads to the lower wall and their feet towards the fire . Before going to bed , they replenish their fire ; some two or more of them being employed in putting on such logs , as with their handspikes they can manage to pile into the chimney . As the walls of the building are not very tight , the cool air plays freely round the head of the sleeper , making a difference of temperature between the head and the feet not altogether agreeable to one unused to sleep in camps . A rough bench and table complete the furniture of the establishmerit . A camp very similar , though not so large in its dimensions , is built near for the oxen . On the top of this the hay is piled up , giving it some warmth , while it is convenient for feeding . " A large logging concern will require a number of camps , which will be distributed over the tract , so as best to accommodate the timber . One camp serves generally for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlance , expresses , not only the set of four or six oxen that draw the logs , but likewise a gang of men employed to tend them . It takes from three or four to seven or eight men , to keep one team employed ; one man being employed in driving the cattle , and the others in cutting down the trees , cutting them into logs , barking them , and cutting and clearing the way to each tree . The number of hands required , depends upon the distance to be hauled inversely . That is , most hands are required when the distance is shortest ; because the oxen , returning more frequently , require their loads to be prepared more expeditiously . " Having built their camps , or while building them , the main roads are to be cut out . These run from the camps to the landing places , or some stream of sufficient size to float down the logs on the spring freshet . Other roads are cut to other clumps of timber . They are made by cutting and clearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as may be in the way , to a sufficient width for the team of oxen , with the bob sled and timber on it , to pass conveniently . The bob sled is made to carry one end of the timber only ; the other drags upon the ground . And the bark is chipped off that the log may slip along more easily . The teams proceed to the woods when the first snows come , with the hands who are not already there , and the supplies . The supplies consist principally of pork and flour for the men , and Indian meal for the oxen . Some beans , tea , and molasses , // 352 April , are added . Formerly hogsheads of rum were considered indispensable , and I have before me a bill of supplies for a logging concern of three teams in 1827- 28 , in which I find one hundred and eighty gallons of rum charged . But of late , very few respectable lumberers take any spirits with them . And the logging business is consequently carried on with much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour must be of the best quality . Lumberers are seldom content to take any of an inferior sort ; and even now , when flour is twelve dollars a barrel , they are not to be satisfied with the coarser bread stuffs . " Hay is J ) rocured as near to the camps as possible . But as most of the timber lands are remote from settlements , it is generally necessary to haul it a considerable distance . And as it must be purchased of the nearest settlers , they are enabled to obtain very high prices . From twelve to twenty dollars per ton is usually paid . When the expense of hauling it to the camp is added , the whole cost is frequently as high as thirty dollars a ton , and sometimes much higher . Owners of timber lands at a distance from settlements , may make a great saving , by clearing up a piece of their land , and raising their own hay . " Some one of the hands , who has not so much efficiency in getting timber , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the office of cook . Salt pork , flour , bread and tea , constitute the regular routine of the meals , varied sometimes with salt fish or salt beef . Potatoes are used when they can be had . Now and then , perhaps , when the snow is deep , they catch a deer and live on venison . " The men are employed through the day , in cutting the timber and driving the teams . In the evening some take care of the oxen ; some cut wood for the fire ; then they amuse themselves with stories and singing , or in other ways , until they feel inclined to turn in upon the universal bed . On Sundays the employer claims no control over their time , beyond the taking care of the cattle , the fire and the cooking . On this day , they do their washing and mending ; some employ themselves besides , in seeking timber and some in hunting partridges ; whilst some remain in the camp and read the Bible . " They remain in the woods from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until some time in March ; in the course of which month , their labors are usually brought to a close , either by the snow 's getting too shallow or too deep . If there are heavy thaws , the snow runs off , not leaving enough to make good hauling . If , on the other hand , it gets to be four or five feet deep , the oxen can not break through it , to make the path which it is necessary to form , in order to get at each individual // tree . The men and teams then leave the woods . Sometimes one or two remain , to be at hand , when the streams open . I know one , who last winter stayed by himself in the woods , fifteen or twenty miles from the nearest habitation , for the space of twenty-eight days ; during which time he earned $203 by getting in timber with his axe alone , being allowed for it at the same rate per thousand that the lumberers were , in getting it in with their teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream , where all that was necessary was to fell the tree so that it should fall directly upon the water , and there cut it into logs to be ready for running . " When the streams are opened , and there is a sufficient freshet to float the timber , another gang , called " river drivers , " take charge of it . It is their business to start it from the banks , and follow it down the river , clearing off what lodges against rocks , pursuing and bringing back the sticks that run wild among the bushes and trees , that cover the low lands adjoining the river , and breaking up jams that form in narrow or shallow places . Ajarn is caused by obstacles in the river catching some of the sticks , which in their turn catch others coming down , and so the mass increases until a solid dam is formed , which entirely stops up the river , and prevents the further passage of any logs . These dams are most frequently formed at the top of some fall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boldness , and is attended with much danger , to break them up . The persons who undertake it must go on to the mass of logs , work some out with their pickpoles , cut some to pieces , attach ropes to others to be hauled out by the hands on shore , and they must he on the alert to watch the moment of the starting of the timber , and exercise all their activity to get clear of it , before they are carried off in its tumultuous rush . " Some weeks , more or less , according to the distance , spent in this way , brings the timber to the neighbourhood of the saw mills . A short distance above Oldtown , on the Penobscot , there is a boom established , extending across the river , for the purpose of stopping all the logs that come down . It is made by a floating chain of logs connected by iron links , and supported at suitable distances , by solid piers built in the river ; without this it would be impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be carried on the freshet down the river , and out to sea . The boom is owned by an individual , who derives a large profit from the boomage , which is thirty-five cents per thousand on all logs coming into it . The boom cost the present owner about $40,000. lie has offered it for sale for $45,000 . It is said the net income from it last year , was $15,000. // " Here all the logs that come down the Penobscot , are collected in one immense mass , covering many acres , where is intermingled the property of all the owners of timber lands , in all the broad region that is watered by the Penobscot and its branches , from the east line of Canada above Moosehead Lake , on the one side , to the west line of New Brunswick , on the other . Here the timber remains , till the logs can be sorted out for each owner , and rafted together to be floated to the mills , or other places below . Rafting is the connecting the logs together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into each log , forming them into bands , like the ranks of a regiment . This operation is performed by the owner of the hoom . The ownership of the timber is ascertained by the marks which have been chopped into each log before it left the woods ; each owner having a mark , or combination of marks , of his own . When the boom is full , only the logs lowest down can be got at , and the proprietors of other logs must wait weeks , sometimes months , before they can get them out , to their great inconvenience and damage . " After the logs are rafted , and out of the boom , a great part of them are lodged for convenience , in a place called Pen Cove , which is a large and secure basin in the river , about two miles below the boom . From this cove they can be taken out as they are wanted for the mills below . While in the hoom , and at other places on the river , they are liable to great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will frequently smuggle all that come in their way , without regard to marks . The owners or conductors of some of the mills on the river are said to be not above encouraging and practising this species of piracy . Indeed timber , in all its stages , seems to be considered a fair object for plunderers , from the petty pilferer who steals into the woods , fells a tree , cuts it into shin* , les and carries it out on his back , to the comparatively rich owner of thousands of dollars . " When the logs have been sawn at the mills , there is another rafting of the boards , which are floated down the river to Bangor , to be embarked on board the coasters for Boston . In this process they are subject to much injury , first by the mode of catching them as they come from the mill sluices , the rafters making use of a picaroon , or pole with a spike in the end of it , which is repeatedly and unmercifully driven into the boards , taking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holes made by the pins driven into the boards in rafting ; and thirdly , by the rocks and rapids and shallows in the river , breaking the rafts to pieces , and splitting up the boards as they descend . These inconveniences will be partly remedied by the railroad now in // operation , unless other inconveniences in the use of it should be found to overbalance them . " The kinds of timber brought down our rivers are pine , spruce , hemlock , ash , birch , maple , cedar , and hackmatack . Far the greater part of it is pine . rrhe lumberers make about six kinds of pine ; though they do not agree exactly in the classification , or in the use of some of the names . The most common division is into pumpkin pine , timber pine , sapling , bull sapling , * Norway , and yellow or pitch pine . The pumpkin pine stands preeminent in the affections of the lumberers , because it is the largest tree , and makes fine large clear hoards . They are soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saplings are the most common . The former is generally preferred , as being larger and more likely to be sound . Yet the saplings are said to make the harder and more durable boards . The common sapling grows in low lands , generally very thick , but is apt to be much of it rotten . The bull sapling is larger and sounder , grows on higher land , and mixed with hard wood . The Norway pine * is a much harder kind of timber than the others . It is seldom sawed into boards , though it makes excellent floor boards . But it is generally hewed into square timber . In the Provinces it bears a higher price than the others . There is not much of it brought to market , and it is not very abundant in the woods . rrhe yellow pine is very scarce , if to be found at all in that region . " I will conclude with some remarks upon the different modes of operating , made use of by owners of timber . These are three . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the month , procure teams , and furnish them with equipments and supplies . A second is , to agree with some one or more individuals to cut and haul the timber , or cut , haul , and run it , at a certain price per thousand feet . The third way is to sell the stumpage outright ; that is , to sell the timber standing . " The first mode is seldom adopted , unless the owner of the timber is likewise a lumberer , and intends to superintend the business himself . The second mode is very common . It is considered the most saving to the owners , because the lumberer has no inducement to select the best timber , and leave all that is not of the first quality ; to cut down trees and take a log , and leave others to rot that are not quite so good , but which may be well worth hauling . Its inconveniences are , that as the object of the lumberer is to get as large a quantity as possible , he will * All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , are varieties of white pine . This pine is called also red pine , from the color of its bark . // take trees that are not worth as much as the cost of getting them to market , and which , besides being of little value themselves , render the whole lot less saleable by the had appearance they give it . The o'vner too is subject to all the losses that may happen , in running the logs down the river . Very frequently he is obliged to make one contract to have the timber cut and hauled to the landing places , and another to have it run down ; for the river drivers are a distinct class from the lumberers . Most of them are indeed luruberers . But it is but a small part of the lumberers , that are river drivers . A great part of the luinberers are farmers who must be on their farms at the season of driving , and therefore can not undertake any thing but the cutting and hauling . They are paid for the number of thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logs being surveyed , or sealed , as they are hauled , their object is to get as many thousand as possible on the landing places ; while the river drivers may be very careless about getting them all down , and the owner may never receive nearly the quantity he has paid for cutting and hauling . In operating in this mode , the owner usually furnishes the supplies , provisions , &amp;c. ; and the lumberer procures the teams and hires the men . The owner commonly does not bind himself to pay , before the logs get to market ; and he frequently makes a contract for his supplies on the same condition , in which case he has to pay from twenty-five to thirtythree per cent . more for his goods , than he would dealing on cash or common credit . Sometimes , when there is no freshet , the logs do not get down until the second year ; and then the trader and lumberer both suffer for want of their pay . " The third mode is the simplest and easiest for the owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the timber on the river , and of looking out for a market . But he must have a man of some capital to deal with , as he furnishes his own teams and supplies , and pays his men , receiving very heavy advances . The purchaser of it has no interest to cut the timber savingly , and he sometimes makes dreadful havock among the trees , leaving a great deal of valuable stuff on the ground to rot . And if he selects only the best trees in a berth , much of the timber left standing may be lost , because no one will afterwards want to go into that berth , from which all the best trees have been culled . It is common now , in all large concerns , for the owner to employ a man to pass the winter in the camps , living alternately at one or another , for the purpose of sealing the logs , keeping a correct account of them , and seeing that the timber is cut according to the contract . But , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between timber cut by the thousand , and that which is cut on stumpage . " Each mode has its troubles . But I think that owners at a distance will manage their concerns with least vexation by sell .. ing the stumpage , provided that they have honest men to deal with . " The public attention is , of late , we hope , more alive than it has been , to the value of our forests , and to the necessity of economizing what yet remains of these rich national treasures , and of replacing what has been so carelessly wasted . This necessity is every day making itself more manifest . Fuel has already become scarce in our seaports , or rather on our whole seacoast ; a fact worthy the serious consideration of those , who reflect that the sufferings of the poor , from the want of this article , are probably greater than from all other causes united . Our best timber also is becoming more and more costly , and our civil and naval architects are constantly driven to the employment of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States is already procured for our navy yards with great difficulty , and in fifty years will probably disappear from our soil ; and our own white oak , as well as our other most valuable timber trees , must follow at no very distant period . It is in the power of every one who possesses a few acres of land , to do much to arrest this mighty evil and what might not be anticipated from a simultaneous effort on the part of cultivators in our commonwealth , or even in a single county ? And all this , at the expense , on the part of each individual , of a few shillings of money and a few hours of interesting labor . If we owe any thing to posterity , in what way could we confer on them so great a benefit at so cheap a rate ? It is not , however , strictly true , or rather it is not the whole truth , to say with Virgil , that he who plants benefits his remote posterity . A friend of ours once observed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the student , who on hearing that a crow would live for a century , bought a young one , for the sake of watching the experiment . As a stroke of humor , this remark is privileged from criticism ; but as a statement of facts , it must be received with much qualification . It is no uncommon circumstance to find oaks of twenty years ' growth , of more than a foot in diameter , and of forty or fifty feet in height ; and we have seen an English willow of only // double that age , measuring , at several feet from the ground , more than seven yards in circumference . Were planting commenced at the time when our young men usually enter on their professions or their business , how many might live to enjoy the shade of majestic groves of their own raising These remarks may derive some additional interest from the fact , that a taste for rural occupations is rapidly springing up and extending itself in our large cities , and that objects of this description are gradually absorbing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of that portion of our community . Where indeed could they find a source of entertainment more pure , more copious , or more beneficial to themselves or their fellow citizens ? To say nothing of the value of forest trees for what are strictly denominated useful purposes , let us ask in what way any individual among us can do more to decorate and beautify the country . How many millions have been devoted in this , as well as in other communities , to architecture , and yet how little have the results corresponded to tim time , the effort , and the money so expended ! For one chaste and magnificent edifice , we have ten irregular and disproportioned piles , countenancing , and almost justifying , the sweeping remark of a French author , that the Genius of architecture had shed his malediction on America . But he who rears a stately grove or avenue , bestows an ornament on his native land , which none but a Vandal would wish to destroy . How much has been done in this city and its beautiful environs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals ! To pass over numerous other instances , we are indebted to one of former days as we have already observed , for the chief ornament of Boston , the triple colonnade of weeping elms in the Mall ; and it is owing to the good taste of another accomplished individual of the present day , that the majestic , or , as we may now call them , the sacred groves of Mount Auburn , were rescued from the woodman 's axe . It is not merely , however , to those who are or may be practically engaged in the propagation or preservation of forest trees , though these we hope are not few , that our remarks are directed . Though comparatively a small number may be the planters or the owners of groves or of gardens , all may be admirers of forest scenery . For the indulgence of such a taste we have the highest intellectual authority . " A tree in full leaf , " says Lord Bacon , " is a nobler object than a king // in his coronation robes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above all others , that a taste for the beauties of forest trees , as well as an acquaintance with their nature and uses , should be carefully cultivated . It is sufficient to recommend it , that it furnishes a never-failing source of occupation and amusement to those who travel in this country , and a strong additional inducement to the general adoption of this practice , so essential and at the same time so neglected . Is it not a fact that a large proportion of those among us , who enjoy the leisure and the means for visiting other regions , confine their researches exclusively to Europe ; and if it be so , is it altogether creditable to our good taste , to say nothing more ? How far the practice of travelling in other countries may be advisable , is a question we do not intend to agitate , though we are convinced , after some reflection and experience , that its advantages have been astonishingly overrated . But while years are frequently employed in exploring the European continent , a few months spent in visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered as any thing but wasted . Personal intercourse , if not the only , is certainly the chief means , by which the inhabitants of the different States of our widely-extended Union may be enabled to acquire a proper knowledge of the wants and the character of each other , and above all to cherish those feelings of regard , so essential to the prosperity , if not the existence of our nation . The press , however great the obligations we owe it , is of necessity always an imperfect , and sometimes an unfaithful mirror of public sentiment ; and it is to personal intercourse , and to the spirit of mutual fairness and friendship , which such intercourse will assuredly generate , that we must look to supply the deficiencies , and correct the aberrations , of that mighty engine of good and of evil . It were to be wished , indeed , that the practice of travelling extensively in our own country were often pursued , at least as a preliminary to an European tour . We should not find in that case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most incorrect representations of the character and manners of our population , proceeding from the pens of our own tourists in other countries . To many of our best-educated and most accomplished men , the interior of other States , if not of their own , is a Terra Incognita , and this too in spite of those facilities of communication , which exist in the United States , to a greater degree than in almost any portion of the old world . We need not state // how thinly this country is peopled in comparison with any other in an equal state of advancement , nor repeat , how large a portion of those wide spaces which separate our principal settlements from each other , is covered with magnificent forests . The traveller , who can relish the beauties of these splendid collections of vegetable wonders , can have few intervals of idleness or weariness . Yet however valuable we may consider a taste for these prominent beauties of our own scenery , merely as a neverfailing source of occupation and enjoyment , there are still other reasons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiously cherished ; we mean as one of the principal sources of an ardent and deep-felt patriotism . We trust that our country has , in the view of all of us , other qualities than the beauties of her natural scenery , to recommend her to her proper rank in our estimation . There is in her institutions , political , intellectual , and religious , more than enough to justify us in the preference which we give to our native land over all others . But patriotism , wherever it has existed in a high degree , has been , we apprehend , a sentiment , as well as a principle , and is something more than a cold feeling of preference . It is in truth an emotion of a complex character , and if we would cherish towards our country an enthusiastic attachment , we should not suffer ourselves to he hlind to those charms , whether of nature or of art , which may recommend her to our fancy , as well as our soher judgment . Why should not the mind of an American think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civilized world , with something of the feeling which stirs in the bosoms respectively of a patriotic Frenchman or Englishman , when their thoughts revert to the vine-covered hills and gay regions of France , or the spreading oaks and verdant lawns of merry England ? It is truly gratifying to reflect on the progress which has been made within a very few years , in the study and developement of the internal resources of this country . In former times , the political condition of Europe , and the embarrassments , in which we were involved by the conduct of the leading belligerents , formed not only the predominant , but the sole topics of deep public interest . Little time or thought could be spared , little at any rate was spared , for the examination and improvement of our internal condition . What , for instance , had heen done for the advancement of our agricul // ture and manufactures ; and what was known of our gold regions , our coal mines , or our quarries ? Such was the state of things from the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty of Ghent . It is one of the chief national blessings which have resulted from our present peaceful condition , that we have been enabled and induced to turn our thoughts inward ; that the vast natural riches of our land are no longer trodden under foot without the slightest investigation , nor its majestic and beautiful scenery passed by with a heedless glance . Whether we regard this spirit of investigation merely as political economists , or as moralists and patriots , whether we look to its effects on the wealth or on the happiness of our community , we are sure that to cultivate and to cherish it must be regarded as a sacred duty .

THE difference between the French and English schools of poetry is certainly much greater , than can be accounted for by the mere influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; its luxuriance of coloring , its marvellous union of things apparently inconsistent , and its blending of the visions of poetical fancy with the expectations of a higher destiny , are everywhere visible in the works of our poets . The French , on the other hand , have sought their materials of fiction chiefly in the past ; and the genius of the past , the spirit of classical antiquity , has been invoked and adopted by them .
