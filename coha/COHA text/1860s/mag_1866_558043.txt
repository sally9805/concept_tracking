txt 3- The J7icarious Sacrifice , grounded in Principles of Universal Obligation . By HORACE BUSHNELL . New York : Scribner. 1866 IF ' any of our readers would know exactly what is meant by the infatuation , sometimes charged upon men , of " putting new wine into // old bottles , " let him betake himself to Dr. Bushnell 's latest work , and lie will no longer confess to a shadow of doubt upon the practice . Dr. Bushnell has persuaded himself that the difficulty which so many men experience in crediting the dogma of Christ 's vicarious sacrifice is owing to the vicious habit theologians have of representing that sacrifice as a fact of history quite exceptional in its nature ; whereas , in truth , all love is vicarious in its own indefeasible right , and we have only to scrutinize our own hearts to discover that we ourselves - like the bourgeois gentilkomine who was surprised to find that he had been talking prose all his life without knowing it - are also , in our degree , vicarious lovers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that case , we must consent to let Dr. Bushnell manipulate the word " vicarious " to the extent of making it surrender its immemorial signification of " substitutionary , " and agree to convey henceforth the milder idea of " identification . " The good Doctor is at infinite pains to coerce and cajole his reluctant patient into making a wide mouth of it , and swallowing his plausible pill ; but , judging from our own experience , we should say without much result , for the Doctor 's medicine , even by his own showing , is the fruit of so very perfunctory a diagnosis on his part , that almost any patient of ordinary sane instincts will infallibly distrust his prognosis . Dr. Bushnell has the extreme bad taste , - if we may use so mild a term , -* in the initial chapter of his book , to interpose a caveat against adverse criticism , by ruling that , if any one see fit to dissent from " the profoundly earnest view of sacrifice " he advocates , the dissenter must be held to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows a good deal , hut the probability is that as to any living or heartfelt knowledge of the Divine ways he is densely ignorant . We do not remember a more naIve and diverting exhibition of the odium tlieologicum , coming forth as it ( loes at the very inception of the enterprise , and before a word of dissent has been hazarded ; and the reader who turns to pages 53-55 of the work will enjoy a fresh illustration of the invincible shabbiness of our dear old human nature , even under its most professedly regenerate disguises . We , for our part , protest in limine against these consecrated airs and grimaces , as unworthy " tricks of the trade " ; and there is far too much throughout Dr. Bushnell 's book of a factitious or calculated solemnity , addressed to purely controversial ends . We are going to criticise Dr. Bushnell 's ideas with great freedom , and intend to demonstrate their manifold unsoundness ; nor have we any fear that in so doing we shall jeopard , save to very stupid people , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be an end of all judgment if the // criminal at the bar should be allowed to lay down , himself ; the law by which he is to be tried . Dr. Bushnell proves himself a relentless critic , more solito , of the venerable church-philosophy of the atonement , and endeavors to substitute one more reasonable for it . A la bonne keure ! But he must not , hereupon , claim an immunity for his own notion , which he disallows to that of his antagonists . He justly derides their pretension to infallibility . How much more , then , shall we deride the contemptible deus ex mackind he himself invokes to bar out our honest intellectual differences ! No , our readers may rest assured that it is very far indeed from being any approximate Divine knowledge , or yet any admissible human knowledge , which we call in question when we refuse faith to Dr. Bushnell 's reasonings . What , then , is it ? Only and at best a specious hypothesis , baseless in point of fact to every one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great ratiocinative art and address , and set off with all that sacerdotal persuasiveness on the one hand , and sacerdotal pomp of phrase and vigor of denunciation on the other , which have long rendered Dr. Bushnell 's books alternatively seductive and overpowering to unstable imaginations . We feel no theologic interest either in Dr. Bushnell 's success or failure . We simply regard his speculation as a proffered contribution to philosophy , or at all events science , and shall deal with it exclusively in that point of view . The work before us , then , is the confession , on the one hand , of a state of intelh*ctual disease in the writer ; and an exposition , on the other , of an almost plenary relief he has found in a new interpretation of the Scripture history . On the question of the vicarious nature of Christ 's suffering , it is well known that he has for some years felt a divided mind , being more or less heterodox in heart , but more or less orthodox in head . He sits psychically upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carnal part refuses to budge from that consecrated by the Church 's gray fathers ; and the problem of his book is to prove this divided soul and body , this contentious heart and head , this discrepant form and substance , fairly reunited . As the proverb says , the author " runs with the hare and chases with the hounds " ; his resultant intellectual obligation being to fuse bare and hounds together eventually in such amicable fashion as that their apparent hopeless antagonism hitherto shall turn out henceforth a real agreement and sympathy . Thus , while he stoutly contends , with the Orthodox , that Christ 's sacrifice is unequivocally vicarious , he contends equally stoutly , with the Unitarian , that it is no way subst4tutionary . And the method he takes to efface the obvious grim contradiction is gradually to operate , by a process of alternate coaxing and coercion , or play of " fast and loose , " such a sheer demoralization of the word vicarious as at last to // make it confess that , when it habitually said substitution , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's part with the sinner . But really this will not do . And even if it should do , it would not help Dr. Bushnell 's general purpose . In the first place , the word vicarious will never consent to be either coerced or argued out of the precise meaning which orthodox and heretical usage alike , and its own etymology , conspire to give it , as always implying a deputed or delegated office ; so that Christ 's sacrifice , if it be vicarious , must be held to have taken place in lieu of that of somebody else . He acted as the deputy or delegate of a principal , and his act is valid , not as the act of a principal , but of an authorized deputy . Far be it from us tantas componere lites . We have no vocation indeed to express ourselves either pro or con in relation to the controverted nature of the atonement . We are not theologians , but philosophers , having no personal , but only an intellectual , interest in the particular issue got up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the learned Doctor to his logical engagements . If , then , as Dr. Bushnell contends , Christ 's sacrifice be " vicarious , " the plainest obligations of honesty and good faith in the use of language bind him to regard it as substitutionary in the broadest sense of that term . But , in the second place , suppose we allow the gloss which Dr. Bushnell put* upon the word to go unchallenged , what benefit accrues therefrom to his philosophy of the Gospel ? His philosophy of the Gospel is , that Christ is the " moral power of God " addressing itself to the redemption and salvation of sinners , by motives congruous with their fallen mental habitudes . How are the needs of this philosophy met by the view he takes of Christ 's sacrifice as vicarious , yet not substitutionary ? According to Dr. Bushnell , Christ 's sacrifice is vicarious and efficient , not as being offered and accepted in lieu of any other sacrifice , but as being the expression of his own love for God and man , inasmuch as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotion to the beloved object . And the illustrations which he gives of this latter proposition in the mother 's love for her child , the friend 's love for his friend , the patriot 's love for his country , are well selected with a view to conciliate prejudice . No doubt , all these lovers take on the joys and sorrows of their beloved as their own . But then Dr. Bushnell leaves out one most important characteristic of all these loves , which is completely nugatory of their pretension to be in any sense vicarious , and that is , that they are all alike instinctual loves , or express the heart 's delight of the subje*ct , his natural , unconstrained life , and hence disown all voluntary or moral quality . It is implied in being a mother , // a friend , a patriot , that the loving subject freely identifies himself with the loved object to the extent of vacating any divided interest , and refuting by anticipation , therefore , the imputation of any meritorious or meretricious relation on his part towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , *of the friend is in his friend , of the patriot is in his country ; and each and all of them accordingly would scorn the idea of their love imposing any obligation upon child or friend or country . It is in truth excessively absurd to insist upon calling love like this " vicarious " ; but since Dr. Bushnell fancies the word , and takes good care to disembowel it of its real contents , and fill it out with a strictly Pickwickiau substance , let him e'en have his way . But now that he has got his way , let us inquire what comes of it . Love indeed is truly sympathetic with its object ,  --  spontaneously identifies itself with the joys and sorrows of its object , so as to laugh evermore at the suggestion of divided interests between them . And supposing that Christ 's love for the sinner is of this quality , making him feel the sinner 's joys and sorrows as his own , and claim personal identi-. fication with the sinner 's interests through life and death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Dr. Bushnell says , in principles of universal obligation , or , what is the same thing , in the most ordinary laws of human nature . But what " moral power " does the sacrifice in question become hereby entitled to exert upon the sinner ? Not a whit . If God condescend to reveal himself as acting according to the principles and methods of action acknowledged among men , with a view thereby to gain some purchase upon our present sensual and ultimate spiritual acknowledgment , we can perfectly appreciate such condescension , and shall take extreme good care not to push the revelation beyond its legitimate scope as a revelation , by insisting also upon its absolute truth as a fact of the Divine nature . For revealed truth is never absolute truth , but truth accommodated to a finite intelligence , and mercifully disguising itself in the forms of that intelligence ; and we must carefully shun , therefore , Dr. Bushnell 's error in running the one into the other . For if God should not merely reveal himself as acting , but really act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and methods of our ordinary human nature , then of course his action becomes valid only to the extent in which ours is valid , or loses its distinctive Divine and puts on distinctively human quality . That is to say , it prefers exactly the same claim to our respect that ordinary human action does . Ii it be good action , it will attract our admiration and sympathy ; if it be evil action , our detestation and antipathy . In any case it will lose all flavor of infinitude or perfectness , and become rightfully amenable to the criticism that waits on ordinary finite action . // How , then , shall we prove God 's moral power over the race enhanced , by proving him to have acted in Christ upon principles of action identical with those upon which the mother acts in devoting herself to her child , the friend in devoting himself to his friend , the patriot in devoting himself to his country ? All these are strictly natural loves , claiming purely natural sanctions . If , then , God really be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at an utter loss to see what logical right any one has to claim for his action essentially higher sanctions , or call it any longer Divine , and not human action . But here a preliminary obligation devolves upon Dr. Bushnell , which is to account for the bare existence of this alleged love of Christ for the sinner , under the ordinary rules and maxims of love . If Dr. Bushnell takes Christ 's love for the sinner for granted , as being the same in quality ( however superior in quantity ) with that of the mother for the child , the friend for the friend , the patriot for the country , it is of course competent to him to run it out into all of its normal activities . But where we want light first of all is upon this assumed passionate love of Christ for the sinner ; Dr. Bushnell having somehow utterly failed to reason that point out . We can perfectly understand maternity , friendship , and patriotism , for these are thoroughly natural loves , and we all are mothers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of a good man for a bad man , - how shall we ever be able to bring that under any natural category ? How shall we conceive of Christ loving the sinner as the mother loves her child , and identifying himself living and dying with the sinner 's lot , on the hypothesis of the one being in absolute accord with the Divine name , and the other in absolute antagonism with it ? Speaking as a theologian , Dr. Bushnell holds the sinner to be personally or morally obnoxious to the Divine condemnation ; all God 's attributes being arrayed in deathless hostility to the sinner 's character . But speaking as a philosopher , he reverses this judgment , and shows good and evil , God and fallen man , lovingly blent in eternal amity in the person of Christ . What we want is light upon this contradiction . How are we to take Dr. Bushnell henceforth , - as a theologian or as a philosopher ? As the latter , it is ixicumbent upon him to show us the ground of that sympathy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he declares to be destitute of all ground , amounting as it does to complete antipathy . How , in a word , shall Christ be found naturally , or on principles of universal obligation , loving what all his alleged instincts of the Divine name tell him is essentially unlovable ? Love always responds to a real or seeming worth in its object . It never goes forth , at all events , to what seems evil , to what is manifestly repugnant to its own sympathies , to what is in // palpable contradiction to its own tendencies . How , then , shall Christ , being perfect in sympathy with all Divine good , he attracted , and not repelled , by what is in inveterate contrariety to such good ? He whose mind is one with God 's must partake the attitude of God 's mind towards the sinner ; and this attitude ( if Dr. Bushnell 's theology , which makes God to be an essentially moral being , be true ) can only be one of ' righteous aversion and displeasure . How then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any natural , unforced , unsophisticated sense of the word love * Obviously the question is insoluble , and Dr. Bushnell quietly slurs it over by putting an adroit mystification upon the meaning of Love , which reminds one of nothing so much as those devices of legislation whereby some ticklish financial scheme is incorporated in a bill for repairing highways , to which no one listens , and so it gets fastened upon the country . Vicarious sacrifice , says Dr. Bushnell , is nothing peculiar to Christ , being a function of daily and universal recurrence , incident in fact to all love , human and Divine , inasmuch as love is essentially vicarious , or disposes its subject to self-sacrifice in behalf , not only of worthy , but of most unworthy objects . " It is the nature of love universally to insert itself into the miseries and take upon its feeling the burdens of others . Love does not consider the ill-desert of the subject object ; he may be even a cruel and relentless enemy . " ( p. 42. j* There is here a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a very mountain of zeal for free access to the state treasury ; and it is intolerable that so small a mole-hill should be expected to hide so huge a mountain from our sight . What , then , is the exact truth of the case ? Dr. Bushnell wishes to justify his private opinion of Christ 's sacrifice as being at the same time vicarious and not substitutionary . To this end he needs to vacate the word vicarious of the idea of substitution invariably associated with it , and fill it out with the idea of identification ; for then he may hold to the vicarious sacrifice in the most orthodox manner , and yet put to rout every orthodox idea involved in the word ; for no one can deny that Christ at least identified himself with sinners . Let identification then - no longer substitution - be the dominant idea of the word , and we shall be able to make Christ 's love as strictly natural and credible as the mother 's love for her child , friend 's love for friend , patriot 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally vicarious , consisting in the subject 's identifying himself in every case with the object . So far substitution seems rapidly collapsing under the Doctor 's nimble fingers into identification . But Christ 's love is of a very difficult sort to naturalize ; obstinately re // fuses to fall within the ordinary bosom categories ; disowns all community with maternity , or friendship , or patriotism , save in so far as the shadow may claim community with the substance ; and yet , unless he can somehow eompel it into the traces , his thesis that it is a strictly vicarious love on recognized natural principles will nevcr get justified . What does our resolute disputant do hereupon ? Recoil before the insuperable difficulty ? Not a bit . He simply enlarges love itself to the dimensions of the exigency , and coolly tells you , as if he were reciting truisms , that love universally has no regard to the worthiness of its object , but embraces the most unworthy , and so forth . Is what is here alleged of love , then , universally true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , rather ? Does the mother still identify herself with the child who at maturity becomes her cruel enemy ? Does the friend any longer love the friend whom events have turned into his relentless foe ? Does the patriot continue to identify himself with the country which deliberately rejects his counsels , derides his devotion ; condemns his person to infamy ? All these truly would be a new thing under the sun ! But no , Dr. Bushnell may say , the probabilities I here speak of are inherent in God 's love , which alone is true love , and not in man 's , which at bottom is self-love . But he did say that these things were true of love universally , and with no attempt to discriminate between Divine and human love . Besides , it is only in highly figurative moods that we permit ourselves to say such things eveif of the Divine love ; and we should always revolt from being construed literally . We say , on occasion , that God forgives his enemies , loves his enemies , does good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on . But surely we use these natural images of the truth , not as positive , but as purely negative expressions of God 's spiritual or infinite perfection , which refuses to be conceived of by minds of a gross culture , save under these finite forms . We use them only in accommodation to persons whose spiritual understanding is still dense enough to allow them to conceive of themselves as being so strictly commensurate with God in being and character as to be personally agreeable or personally offensive to hirti . Surely Dr. Bushnell must aspire to a livelier parish erelong than this ! Whose friendship , then , or whose enmity , is felt so acutely by God , that he experiences in one case an emotion of personal complacency , in the other an emotion of personal indignation ? And if God 's infinite superiority to us exempt his love from the limitations and vicissitudes that characterize ours , we have clearly no shadow of right to argue from the stammering figures of speech by which we attempt to do bare negative justice to his ineffable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the truth . It // is plainly untrue , then , of all love , Divine as well as human , that the object of it is ever in any sense out of proportion to , or in any sense disunited with , its subject . It is an outrage upon all love , Divine as well as human , to suppose that its subject is ever in normal discord , and not in fulness of accord , with its object ; for in its supreme sense love means marriage , and marriage is such a complete union of subject and object as forbids the conception of subsequent divorce as possible . Thus Dr. Bushnell 's preliminary statement of fact , upon which his total philosophic edifice is reared , is a palpable falsification of fact , being discountenanced by all traditional and all living experience . Dr. Bushnell will be prompt hereupon , by himself or attorney , to ask us what we suppose Christ to have meant when he bade us love our enemies . We suppose he meant precisely what the face of his language imports ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he bade us love our enemies , be conceived himself to be laying a literal , and not an exclusively spiritual , injunction upon us . Love will hardly be commanded ; and Christ at all events was not a man of such thin , pedantic make as to mistake the nature of love 's obligations . Surely we are not called upon to remind a respected " master in Israel " that Christ 's words , by his own interpretation , are " spirit " and " life " ; and that whenever we attempt , accordingly , to fulfil them literally , we bury ourselves only the more deeply in nature and death . In the great final spfritual assize which he himself sketches to our wondering imagination , his literal or servile and interested follower , the man who invokes his name with scrupulous respect , and does every literal thing he has commanded , finds himself to his astonishment arrayed among the goats , or rejected ; while his spiritual or disinterested disciple , the man who has never invoked his name at all , nor observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his equal astonishment among the sheep , or accepted . What is the inference ? Not merely the fair , but indeed the necessary inference ? It is that Christ 's words address something deeper than the intellect in us , or appeal for ratification to the heart alone , contemplating no voluntary or professional obedience , but a purely spontaneous or living one ; ' so that he who thinks to compass a ritual instead of a spiritual conformity to the command in question , or expects to fulfil it by some slavish outward routine in place of a free inward death to selfishness , is caught in the snare of his own cupidity . There can he no more dangerous trifling in this state of things with Christ 's words , than to use them as the habitual weapons of our controversial and partisan necessities . Whoever else may go unharmed of them in that case , our own fingers will hardly escape a salutary scanfication. // Our readers have now seen that the foundation stone of Dr. Bushnell 's gospel , the statement of fact upon which its entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact ; and hence they may reasonably conclude that its philosophic justification will be found void also of all warrant in philosophy : for a philosophy which has no sanction in our actual experience is no more a veritable philosophy , than a house without nny basis in the earth is a veritable house . Here then we might fairly dismiss the book without further investigation , expressing our deliberate conviction that , on the main question at issue between the author and his theological antagonist as to the true , unforced sense of the term vicarious sacrifice , the latter has a manifest advantage both logically and linguistically . But we wish to push our examination of the book a little further in order to show the reader in vivid outline , not merely the wrong done to practical facts of nature , but the higher wrong done to the interests of speculative thought among us , by these pertinacious , ever-recurring efforts to swathe the immortal form of truth in the grave-clothes of a perishing sectarian dogmatism . Dr. Bushnell 's philosophy of the Gospel - stated always with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glib redundancy of verbiage , which really hinders while it seems to promote insight - is this in brief . God 's " attribute-power " - by which Dr. Bushnell means his unqu*lifled excellence - is ample for all his needs so long as his creatures remain in harmony with his perfection ; but when once they have lapsed out of sympathy with Him , it grows pale and thin and ineffectual , and so requires to be supplemented by a " moral power " bearing stricter relations to their lapsed intelligence and debased instiz*cts . In Christ , accordingly , God realizes this requisite complement of his ability , and becomes a " moral power " adequate to the effectual handling of his creature and the disciplining him by the alternate methods of law and grace , or fear and hope , out of temporary rebellion into permanent submission . One does willing justice here to the general purpose which Dr. Bushnell has in view , and which is to ventilate his hereditary theology by a faint breath of scientific reason ; but he must not be allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratuitously perverting our honest human thought and speech . For example , it is all-important to understand at this juncture just what Dr. Bushnell means by this " new moral power over men achieved by God in Christ ; and when you ask him the question , you find that he means " the power which a man finally gets , through self-culture , to impress and sway other men . " By the moral power which God obtains in Christ , then , is to be understood a power which he had not // previously enjoyed of governing his own absolute creatures with honor to himself and advantage to them . The conception is indeed in a philosophic point of view eminently opprobrious to the Divine name ; but what is incumbent upon us just now is to listen attentively to Dr. Bushnell 's further exposition of his topic . " Moral power , then , " he continues , " is what a man once had not , but now has , having been conquered by the conduct of his life . And this is exactly what we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gospel of his own Son . It is a new kind of power - the grentest and most sovereign we know - which God undertakes to have by obtaining it under human laws and methods . Hence the incarnation . God had a certain kind of power before , " namely , " attribute power . " But now , from the manifold insufficiency of this sort of power , " He is constrained to institute a new movement on the world , and obtain through Christ , and the facts and processes of Christ 's life , a new kind of power , namely , moral power ; the same that is obtained by human conduct under human methods . It will be Divine power still , only it will not be attribute-power . " This last-named power characterizes the absolute ideal we form of God . But " this new power is to be the power cumulative gained by Him among men as truly as they gain it with each other . Only it will turn out in the end to be the grandest , closest to feeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ever obtained ir this or any other world . " ( pp. 85-88 . ) When Mr. - , the famous auctioneer , has an undoubted Raphael to dispose of , no man has less to say in commendation of his goods . He is proudly reticent , confining himself to a bare recital of the outward fortunes of his picture , without a word upon the merits . Raphaels speak for themselves , and if Mr. - should undertake to kelp them along , his customers would reasonably suspect the genuineness of the article . So now we ca n't help feeling a dire suspicion that this very tall talk of Dr. Bushnell disguises some desperate shallows of thought . Let us see . In the first place , it is no definition of moral power to call it the power " men have to impress and sway other men . " No doubt this effect is incidental to moral power , since we each of us , if we please , may to some small extent influence other persons to their advantage or undoing . And if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind while it abounded in us his creatures , surely our instinctive reverence for his perfection would forbid us to regard that circumstance as evincing any real deficiency of executive ability in him , and dispose us rather to see in it the proof of his thoroughly creative relation to us ; a relation which keeps him forever free of all those petty personal designs upon // his creatures which they cherish towards each other , and makes him content simply to bless them , without a possible thought of personal gain accruing therefrom to himself . What we want to know , then , is , not what is merely incidental to moral power , or what it does , but what is characteristic of it , or what it in itself is . Here Dr. Bushnell gives us no glimmer of light. * Indeed , if he had once fairly attempted to do so , he would have found how vain and futile an imagination it is to attribute such power to God . For what does morality mean ? What is it that to our imagination makes moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to differ from mere physical power ? In short , what is the scientific dsfferentia between man and animal , between human nature and all other natures ? It is this . Every mineral , every plant , every animal , is under law exclusively to its own nature , or what it possesses in common with all other minerals , all other plants , all other animals . Man , on the other hand , is under law exclusively to what he calls conscience , which is a sentiment he feels in his own bosom of his profound individuality or difference from all other men , and at the same time of his profound identity or community with them . Conscience is always the explicit attestation of a conflict , and the implicit attestation of a harmony , of interests between man and man . It is thus an essentially social force ; being , indeed , the invincible Divine pledge and germ of a frank and lustrous society , fellowship , or equality which is eventually to gather all men of all races in all the earth into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his utmost possible identification with his particular race or kind ; man is truly man only by his utmost possible differentiation with his particular kind , or the expansion of his sympathies into the broadest human fellowship . The animal , in other words , is whatsoever he distinctively is by passive natural generation or inheritance ; that is , by so much as he derives from , or is made by , his ancestors . Man is whatsoever he distinctively is by active social regeneration , or so much as he becomes in himself . In short , while the animal is animal only by birth and never by culture , man is never man by birth but always by culture ; so that the law of life in the animal is inevitable descent or decrease , - in man , infallible ascent or increase . * Further on in his book , where he is discoursing ( in utter oblivion of the logical obligation be has contracted here ) of God 's essential in opposition to his acquired morality , - as if an essentially moral being could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define it as " obedience to right . " But what is explicit obedience to right , but implicit aversion to wrong l And how could God ever he so tempted to wrong as to make his obedience to right a literal fact , and not a mere figuranivo expression of our shallow spiritual thought l // Only the past can ever be sure to the animal ; the whole realm of the future attributes itself exclusively to man . If , then , to be a moral being is to disavow one 's mere animate consciousness , made up of the pleasurable and painful relations one is under to his own body , and put on a veritably human consciousness , made up of the relations of good and evil one is under to his fellow-man , then evidently morality is a mere negative sign , or inverse attestation of our essentially social origin and destiny . And if morality be a strictly social phenomenon , or argue a profound but unsuspected fellowship or equality among all its subjects , with what propriety can we ascribe moral characteristics to Deity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual thought ? That God allows himself to be cogitated by us in our own finite lineaments , or conceived of as having the same personal sensibility to good and evil that we have , to the extent of ordaining a hea:ven for those who please him and a hell for those who displease him , is one thing , and a very benignant one , since otherwise we should not have had even a traditional knowledge of his name along the infancy of human development . But that he really is in himself the finite being he allows himself to be thought by us , instinct with all moral infirmity and devoid of all spiritual perfection ,  - -  this is a very different thing , and one which no truly reverent mind can think of without shuddering disavowal . Who is God 's socius or fellow , to whom he is under an obligation of equality ? And how can God be a moral being in any literal , and not a mere figurative sense of the word , unless he be in relations of essential equality or fellowship with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his speculative interests here , and he takes care now and then to slip in a parenthetic justification of his use of the word , by making moralit*y mean " obedience to right . " But this is a paltry quibble , unworthy of a good cause . For what can right mean to any rational being but conformity to his social obligations ? Is right an essentially abstract thing in Dr. Bushnell 's estimation , or an essentially practical thing ? If the latter , then it must relate its subject to some object external to himself , that is to say , must be of a strictly moral , not of a spiritual quality . Will Dr. Bushnell point out then some object eternally external to the Divine mind , and compelling his homage ? Dr. Bushnell indulges himself ever and anon in an ominous amount of windy talk about some " absolute law of right " which is equally binding upon God and man . But what absolute law of right can exist either for God or man , but the law of his own nature as God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applause for obeying the law of his own nature ? Man is a moral form , and susceptible to praise or blame , only // because he is born ignorant of ' his true nature as a social being , and comes very slowly into its recognition . But surely God is always in the amplest possession and exercise of ' his own nature , not indeed as a social being , which would be absurd , but as a creative one , and can never by any possibility prove recreant to its law . How , then , shall you ascribe morality to a being for obeying what he ca n't help obeying , - what he can no more deny than he can deny his own existence ? Can you imagine any law to be a moral law , in short , or obligatory on moral natures , which is not wholly addressed to the pronouncing its subjects good or evil , exactly as they stand justly or unjustly affected towards other beings ? And now we appeal to Dr. Bushnell again , and ask what other beings exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' fellowship , and who have a right , therefore , to deem him good or evil as he observes or violates the rule of their equality with Him ? From this point onward , accordingly , Dr. Bushnell 's book is a mass of almost unredeemed sophistical argumentation , painful to contemplate , and addressed apparently to the pacification of his somewhat distempered ecclesiastical conscience . And here accordingly the volume ceases to be of any further public or intellectual interest . When Dr. Bushnell wrote " Nature and the Supernatural , " he would not have felt so keenly the logical straits into which he has now drifted . For then , in order to vindicate the supernatural claims of morality in us , he was intei* up8n inflaming or aggravating the moral consciousness of Deity to such a pagan pitch as to make any degree of personal enmity and antipathy between him and his creature both logical and inevitable . And then , besides , he was not prepared to take the very decided stand he now takes in opposition to the orthodox view of Christ 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance of its predecessor in point of feeling , as it would assuredly have been also in point of thought , if he had not been afraid of too openly justifying the serious criticism his former book provoked . The beneficent effects of that criticism are so apparent in the softened tone of the moral temper he ascribes to Deity , that one would hardly think it was the same stout dogmatist that indited both books . We have certainly no complaint to make of this modification in Dr. Bushnell 's theology , but rather rejoice in it . We only refer to it in the interest of his own present philosophic position , which it fatally complicates . For , in order to undermine the doctrine of Christ 's vicarious sacrifice as held by the Church , Dr. Bushnell obliges himself to show that the sinner has in God no vindictive , but a truly generous enemy , and that Christ consequently was never called upon to save the sinner from objective , but only from subjective peril and damage . But in that case , in case the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where any longer is the need which Dr. Bushnell alleges of Christ 's overpowering , self-sacrificing sympathy with the sinner ? If , as Dr. Bushnell now argues , the Divine hostility to sin be not absolute , as possessing that proud or direful personal quality it claimed in his former book , - if the regard with which God contemplates it be now a gracious , forgiving , or sympathetic regard , as it must be to permit us to see in all things a strict consonance between the mind of Christand the heart of God , - why should the sinner 's condition have so challenged his sympathy as to make him on the one hand renounce , according to Dr. Bushnell , the delights of his Father 's house and society , and the constant sense of the Divine complacency in him , and come down to earth , on the other hand , for no other purpose than to encounter the hiding of his Father 's face , to endure years of cheerless anguish , to identify himself with all that was vile and opprobrious in human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a death so little appreciated or requited , that learned theologians , like Dr. Bushnell , after two thousand years nearly of discussion about it , have not yet ascertained what it meant , or what exact good it wrought ? Surely the lot of the sinner , whose sin had no power to exclude him from the active Divine sympathy and compassion , could never have been forlorn enough in this or any other world to call for a sacrifice so costly . Such is the philosophic weakness of Dr. Bushnell 's book . It is a systematic attempt - and this is literally all it amounts to - to put " new wine into old bottles " ; and nothing is effected but the dispersion of the bottles . It is an attempt to eke out " an old garment with new cloth " ; the sole result being to make the garment even more unwearable than it was before . It would be very unjust to Dr. Bushnell to insinuate that he himself is not profoundly cognizant of the cat-and-dog life which his theology and his philosophy thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great personal sagacity , - no man in New England of more ; and he feels his personal relations to the thought of the time with unexampled sensitiveness . He makes an heroic struggle , consequently , to clear himself of the obvious inconsistency he practises in attempting to reconcile Orthodox forms with Unitarian substance ; but the end of the struggle is defeat , not victory , and this of necessity : assuredly not because the combatant is himself deficient in any force requisite to sustain a good cause , but simply for the reason that the cause he here devotes himself to is a purely personal and wilful one , disowned of common sense or right reason . Dr. Bushnell 's sympathies are all with the scientific rationalism of the day . But he is a man of such commanding moral force in his own connection , so head-and-ears uplifted in all intellectual // regards above the majority of his ecclesiastical brethren , and so entitled therefore to their docile following , that it would be a sheer dereliction in him both of duty and affection to go over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry these along with him . Hence the assiduous and fruitless labor recorded in this volume . Dr. Bushnell , we have no need to say to any one familiar with his books , is a writer of very remarkable gifts , possessing a most subtile scope of thought , and a pictorial power of phrase which rises at times to a sustained and dignified eloquence bordering on poetry . But these are Dr. Bushnell 's happiest moments . His ordinary literary aspect is that of a trained gymnast or athlete , whose muscles are strained out of all symmetry in habitual contention for a prize ; and the rhetorical tours de force he thus displays - his alternate feats of persuasive , derisive , coaxing , menacing , expository , and damnatory logic and herrueneutics - stamp him beyond dispute the grimmest , sturdiest , most remorseless and formidable candidate for public honors ever stripped for our Olympia . We know no man whose powers command more legitimate admiration in the arena ; we wish we could say that his performances were equally fruitful in the sphere of private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
