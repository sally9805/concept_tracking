Stoddard , Richard Henry , 1825-1903 : THE FIRST GREETING . from The first greeting ( 1868 ) Editorial note : 1Kb Then when their early gold the leaves Put on , and through October 's sheaves The warm winds rustling blew  --  Two paths , which till that time had run Apart , though near , were thenceforth one , And one , till death  --  the Two , Who , led by love , from neighbor lands , Did walk therein with wedded hands . Past what fair bowers and fairy streams , What sweeter world of secret dreams , And through what glooms unknown . Their pathway winds , I can but guess , But , surely , through much happiness , For they are not alone ; But , dearer grown , each other see , Or at the breast , or on the knee ! The house which God with children fills , Like this , is blest , whatever ills Its doors may darken after : How sweet to watch them day by day , To wipe their little tears away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aught on earth A merry brood about the hearth ! Yours , good and fair , ye good old pair , Are grown , and scattered here and there , With children of their own ; Yet , once more gathered as of old , Their happy faces you behold , And are no more alone ; And , as your lips are pressed to theirs , Gone are your griefs and your gray hairs ! The smiles and tears of fifty years Have passed away  --  Age disappears : You 're in your May of life , And , comelier than your children now , Repeat to-day the holy vow That made ye Man and Wife ! Sound ! and , the bridal measure treading . We older folk will keep your Golden Wedding . R. H. Stoddard.
