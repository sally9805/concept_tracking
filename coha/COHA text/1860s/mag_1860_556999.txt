American Journal of Science and Arts for July , 1860 . T*n* scientific world and a large surrounding district , including many who , without being investigators themselves , take a deep interest in the results of investigation into the laws of nature , have been thoroughly aroused and excited by **the publication of Mr. Darwin 's speculations . Many are dazzled by the ingenuity which he displays , and do not at once see that facts are wanting for a sufficient basis of so broad a theory ; and not only so , but that facts inconsistent with his theory are carefully kept out of sight , and are left to be brought forward by others , who discern the difference between the actual laws of nature and those processes which Mr. Darwin has so ingeniously proposed to substitute for them , and for the creative action of a Supreme Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his constant assump // tion that what may have been has been , and his frequent errors in statements of fact , are distinctly pointed out in the brief extract from the coming volume of Agassiz , which has appeared in Silliman 's Journal ; and we congratulate ourselves that the views we have heretofore expressed have been so much confirmed by this high authority . Mr. Parsons 's article is designed to point out the difference between the statements and arguments of the new theory of the origin of species , and the arguments of those who would derive all things from chance or accident , and to show that Mr. Darwin 's theories are reconcilable with a belief in an Almighty Creator . We willingly accept the conclusion without deeming it necessary to arrive at it by this precise path . We think Mr. Darwin 's treatise has little or no bearing upon that question ; as a creator is necessarily presupposed in every theory of creation , except the utterly untenable one of chance , which is no theory at all . Mr. Darwin became very favorably known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the islands of the South Seas , in which he discovered the powers of a diligent , careful inquirer , with as little disposition to speculate or theorize upon newly discovered facts as could be expected of the most prudent investigator into the operations of nature . This wise caution gave immediate authority to the results of his more recent studies , and procured for his new work , " On the Origin of Species , " the most favorable reception among scientific men . The language of the work , too , is so unassuming , so full of the modest tone of an inquirer , as to make the book quite a model , in this respect , for all scientific investigators . The style of the work , we say , is thus diffident ; but in the substance of the language , in the ideas expressed , we think there is as much confidence of tone , and as much security as to the accuracy and weight of the thought , as in the terms used by any of the more obviously confident inquirers . We perpetually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend that the facts given in this chapter strengthen in any degree my theory ; but none of the cases of difficulty , to the best of my judgment , annihilate iL " " Fi // nally , it may not be a logical deduction , but to my imagination it is far more satisfactory . " ( The Italics are ours . ) Now , if the facts given in any chapter do not strengthen in any degree his theory , why are they inserted in the book at all ? They must be irrelevant . And if a deduction be not a logical one , why is it made or suggested in a professedly philosophical work ? We should not urge this criticism , if the phrases quoted , or similar ones , did not abound ill a book in which it is claimed that everything is proved which is necessary for establishing the probability of the theory . It appears to us that there are many facts mentioned which not only do not strengthen the theory of Mr. Darwin , but are , in truth , inconsistent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight other facts , familiar and innumerable , which are not only inconsistent with it , but absolutely and entirely opposed to it , and subversive of it , so far as we know at present . For instance , in a state of nature , how much can we discover of hybridism ? It is frequently a result of human contrivance and arrangement , and can be practised only to a limited extent between animals or plants that are by nature somewhat allied . Species often differ so extremely in formation and habits , that no idea of intermixture between them can be entertained ; and there exist no gradations by the intervention of which such intermixture can be even conjectured to be brought about . Between a geranium and an oak , a mole and an elephant , we can not conceive of a series of gradual changes by which they could be traced back to a common ancestor , even through an endless series of years . They are different , - utterly , irreconcilably different , - and no amount of time or arrangement of circumstances can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one original stock . Hybridism is possible only between related stocks , and the new varieties produced by it die out , if left without human care to perpetuate them . Hybrids are not natural productions , but artificial ones , and require the constant exercise of intellect , not only to produce them , but to continue their existence . " Naturam expelles furefi , tamen usque recurret. " // another , in an infinite series , seems to us utterly inconsistent with all that is known of either . Because numerous and great varieties of pigeons can be produced from one original stock , does it follow that hawks and pigeons were of one blood originally ? Because a bear can swim , and pursue insects in the water , does it follow that he might become a whale , or " something very like a whale , " or , as Mr. Darwin phrases it , " as monstrous as a whale " ? * In order to bring these speculations within the compass of possible belief , Mr. Darwin has recourse to the by no means novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless term of past ages ; and small variations at a time , he thinks , may have been propagated by the superior vigor of some of the early specimens of a particular species . Perhaps they may , and perhaps they may not . The negation is just as probable as the assertion , in a world where we see daily so many proofs of those words of Wisdom , " The race is not always to the swift , nor the battle to the strong . " It can not be considered an axiom in natural history , that the stronger animal of a race survives the weaker in the struggle for existence . Yet this is taken for granted in Mr. Darwin 's work , and must be , in order to sustain his theory at all . As far as our observation extends , there are always specimens of the stronger and weaker individuals of every species coexisting , and always specimens of weaker and stronger hostile races coexisting . There are races too which are forever enemies , yet never gain a decided or overwhelming victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with great minuteness the order of the appearance , by deposit or eruption , of the rocks and earths of which the superficies of the globe consists ; and we do not call in question the accuracy of the results to which they have attained . It does not seem to us necessary to infer that the changes which have taken place upon the surface occurred at a given time all over the globe at once . The imagination is active in drawing pictures of general convulsions , when it may just as easily be conceived that great changes were partial , and * This sug* e stion , by the way , would reverse the commonly adopted order of creation , and supposes the superior organization to have been first created , and then to have degenerated into one of a lower order . // that an alteration of level was gradual and various , as it is at the present moment . In one part of the earth the sandstone may have subsided , at the same time that , in another locality , the chalk was elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atolls of the South Sea are supposed by Mr. Darwin to be subsiding , while it is believed that the shores of the Baltic are rising . This process may go on for a while , and then be reversed ; the insect formation of coral may be discovered , in future ages , in the marble quarries of southern lands , and the Baltic may again be a sea of deep waters . Convulsions do not appear to be necessary for these changes , but simply a few of those ages upon which Mr. Darwin draws as upon an inexhaustible fund of eternities . The varieties of surface and deposit tend to the same conclusion . Nowhere do we find an unbroken series of deposits , from the lowest to the highest , from the first to the last . It would seem that deluges have , for the most part , been partial , and earthquakes local , and that they have produced changes which , however grand and striking , have not been universal . Animals have existed of which no living specimen can be found ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extermination going on , as in the case of the beaver , or accomplished within a brief period , as is shown by the loss of the dodo . We have not witnessed any universal convulsion , yet we see vast changes brought about . We infer , therefore , that other equal changes may have been produced in past ages , with which we are not familiar , in the same quiet manner . The extermination of animals we have known and witnessed ourselves . The creation of them we have not witnessed . We consequently know , and can know , nothing of the manner in which it is accomplished . Modification of the animal creation is all that has been effected by man , - as in the case of the pigeons , on which Mr. Darwin lays so much stress ; that is limited , of course , by the nature of the animal , and the progeny of pigeons , however curiously various , are still pigeons , and not eagles . Nor can we , by any effort of the imagination or the understanding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or into anything else than pigeons and eagles , however great might be the differences of the organization of each as transmitted froni* // parent to offspring . Pigeons are Mr. Darwin 's cheval de bataille , and till he has made it evident not only that great changes in appearance , but great changes in organization , are effected , so that pigeons cease to be pigeons , and become crows or humming-birds , or something as different from their progenitors as humming-birds or crows , we do not see that he has taken the first step toward demonstrating his theory . Pigeons are pigeons still , though there may be hundreds of ? ry different varieties of them . Bears will continue to be bears , whether they swim after insects or not ; and men will continue to be what they always have been , notwithstanding the theories and conjectures of all the philosophers from Monboddo to Darwin . At least , these are our present opinions , which we shall be ready to renounce upon the first proof that man has degenerated into the monkey , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a bear has been converted into a whale , or a whale into a bear . It may be true that these , or equally wonderful transformatior*s , have taken place ; but the mere conjecture that they have occurred is not exactly the natural history or philosophy that we desire . We want not the possible , but the actual history of the formation and descent of animals and races of animals . It is not enough that we can suppose gradual changes by which one animal might be converted into another . We must witness the process , we must see one animal changed into another , or see the history of such transformation carefully proved , before we can believe any such thing , or can assent to any hypothesis by which all varieties of animals are represented as produced from one original animal , or a few primary patterns . But this kind of evidence is admitted to be impossible . The changes of nature are so slow and minute as to escape detection by any one generation , or even by all generations , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what proof are these changes susceptible ? If they can not be proved , why should they be suggested ? Does it in any degree facilitate our conception of creation , and of the infinite variety of living forms , to trace them all back to one or a few original types existing an inconceivable number of ages ago ? We must confess to as great readiness to believe , and to as great facility in comprehending , the creation of many types as of 45* // one , and to their being brought into existence at once as successively . The growth of all animals from one or a few original prototypes is in itself as great a marvel as a multitudinous creation at the same time . We venture to think that not the slightest proof , nor anything that really amounts to a tendency to prove that the process of creation has been such as is contended for , has been produced as yet by Mr. Darwin . Is it sufficient to show that a few varieties and hybrids of plants and animals have existed , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact hybrids of two or three original species ? Is it philosophical to rely on a theory which requires an infinite length of time to produce a single one of the prodigious changes of structure which are the subject of investigation ? Even granting the infinite length of time , how can it be shown that it is otherwise probable that one race of animals has been derived from another ? Who can overcome the obvious , the inherent incredibility of such a theory ? Does it not seem probable that the great diversities of form and character among animals and plants , amounting to absolute immiscibility , were designed to show , and is it not clear that they do show , that they were not derived from any common ancestor ? Between the most ferocious animals of the same species , there is no such hostility as between them and other beasts . Lions do not contend with lions , but with animals of other blood . Can it be supposed , is it philosophical to suppose , that the lion and the lamb are of one common ancestry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being an intimation of miracle , would only be acknowledging their relationship , and giving up , at last , a family quarrel . If all the animals of the world were derived from a common ancestry , would such an infinite diversity be a natural result ? We see the constant care which is necessary to preserx*e the distinguishing traits of a particular breed of pigeons , or of cattle . Pouters and shorthorns can not be left to the chance consequences of natural selection . They would soon lose their characteristics . They have been produced within a short period , and a shorter period would suffice to mix them up again with the general blood of pigeons and cattle . But all animals of a particular race have remained substantially the same ever since any historical ref // erences to them were written and transmitted . The lions of the Roman amphitheatre , the elephants of the army of Pyrrhus , the flocks and the herds of Lot and Abraham , and the horses of the army of Pharaoh that perished in the iRed Sea , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , elephants , cattle , and horses . It is obvious that for any modification of races , on the theory of Mr. Darwin , we must go back beyond historical times , into the world of conjecture and the- - ory ; and when there , we are tempted to ask the old , but not worn-out question , " Ciii bono ? " One theory may be as sound and rational as another ; and we may conjecture all animals to have been drawn from one stock , or to have been derived from different originals , as we find most consonant with reason and judgment . One man 's conjecture is just as probable as another 's ; Mr. Darwin 's frequent phrase , " It may be , " is a good introduction to an infinite diversity of schemes of creation . " Of God above , or man below , What can we reason , but from what we know ? " The argument from our ignorance , namely , that we do not know the contrary of what is asserted , is hardly sufficient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and we confess to some surprise that any ingenuity , however great , could so turn men 's eyes from broad facts , to dwell upon fanciful theories , as Mr. Darwin has succeeded in doing . The diversity of form and character in plants and animals is very great at the present day ; and at the same time the resemblance of individuals of the same species , and in many cases of allied species , is so great as to be instantly recognized by the student of nature . If all are derived from a common ancestor , how has the diversity been produced ? The ancestors of each existing species , so far as we know , had at least a general resemblance to their descendants . Flocks and herds , bears and lions , were the same creatures , with the same differences , five thousand years ago as to-day . We have reason to infer that other animals were also the same then as now ; and we are led to inquire how far back the similarity , which is the evidence of consanguinity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace the history of man and animals , we find no symptom of any change in races ; nor do we perceive that the difficulty of understanding the work of creation is in the least diminished by reducing the number of original and distinct formations , from which all others have been derived , to one pattern or a half-dozen patterns of animals . The difficulty of creating , or rather of imagining the creation , of one , is as great as that of imagining the creation of many . The same power and wisdom which could create a race or an individual , could create many such* and a creator is as necessary for one as for many , unless we suppose the unphilosophical absurdity of self-creation . There is one animal about whose origin Mr. Darwin has said little or nothing ; leaving his readers to infer for themselves how far his theory extends , and whether man is one of the many races derived from a remote ancestry of beastly structure or not . We should like to know precisely how he would span the gap between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merge the human race also , with tho bears and the whales , in a primeval archetype ? Or does he suppose a separate creation , a peculiar origin for this peculiar race ? He has given us scarcely a hint upon this point , the most interesting , of course , to us ; and we must wait for the further development of his theory in the complete work of which we have now only a sketch and outline , for any extended view of this part of the subject . In the mean time we will venture the confession that the speculations of Mr. Darwin and others upon the origin of species do not materially change our oldfashioned belief . We do not , as yet , see the slightest approach toward proof that animals , numerous and various as we see them , are all descended from one or half a dozen archetypes . There are certain broad distinctions between animals , as well as certain resemblances , and the resemblances must be shown to a much greater extent than they have yet been proved , before anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does not follow that , because we can not discern the differences between the germs of different animals in the ova of very various species , there are no differences . It is certam that differences exist , and that the ova of one animal can not be made to develop into an animal of another species . // Moreover , the differences remain to be accounted for , if we adopt the theory of a common origin . A fin is not a leg , nor a wino ' however much the three may resemble one another ; 0 , and the cortatus of the animal to change one into another , according as it finds itself in the air or the water , is not generally considered an explanation of their origin . There are , also , differences for which the slender resource of instinctive effort is not even offered as an explanation . There are many animals , for instance , with the bones on the outside of their bodies , instead of having them protected by the more elastic material of flesh . Some have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some have the breathing apparatus carefully protected by thicker or thinner masses of bone , gristle , and flesh ; others have these delicate organs on the exterior of their frames . Some have air-bladders adapted to one element , some to another , and some to both . There are flying fish , and diving birds . The eggs of all these creatures are so much alike in their intimate structure , that we can not discern the differences in their earliest development ; but that there is some essential and original difference is proved by the fact that they can not be interchanged . No egg of a duck ever produced a chicken ; and we think it requires a peculiar , as well as a philosophical , constitution of mind , to suppose that , while this apparently slight change in the order of nature can not be produced by successive efforts during long periods , still others of an infinitely greater amount may have been prpduced by natural selection , " in the course of time . We know not how long ago the experiment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but we do know that there seems to be no tendency , in a considerable number of years , and of experiments , to diminish the instinctive aversion of the hen to the water , or the instinctive love of it in the ducklings . It is of no consequence how much the germ of the one may resemble the germ of the other in the egg . Essential differences are , at some time , developed ; and to all appearance-aye , and to all sound philosophy - must have existed in the first births of the two animals as strongly as in those born yesterday . Generation after generation , so far as human knowledge goes back , has developed no change , no gradation of instinct // or of form , in so many animals as to justify a theory that would derive all from one primeval form , or from a very few original patterns . The diversities are apparently insuperable , and , as far as our knowledge extends , always have been so . That the fact may have been otherwise in antecedent ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits of no proof , but which , we think , requires proof of the most distinct and positive kind to render it at all admissible . Finally , of what possible use or value , except as an exercise of mind , can it be to speculate upon the origin of species , in the absence of a sufficient number of acknowledged facts to render a theory tenable ? In many cases , the smaller the array of facts upon which a theory is founded , the greater the ingenuity and skill of the founder ; and in this sense we can not but congratulate the author of the great theory we have been considering . We think , however , his task is but just begun . We look , hereafter , for a more complete development of the idea , in which we shall expect to see some account of the form and character of the two or three original animals from which the present varieties of living beings have descended , and a genealogy of the families of animals as far back as to the original Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live long enough to complete this course of study himself ; but it will be ample and noble employment for many successive generations of his pupils and admirers . In the mean time the humbler faculties and efforts of less original men must go on in the old method of inquiry into what is , and , as far as possible , into what has been ; leaving to the higher - orders of genius the exalting speculations as to what may have been in the eternity that is past , as well as what may be in the eternity that is to come .
