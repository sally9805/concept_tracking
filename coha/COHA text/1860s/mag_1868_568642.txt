" WHAT sort of Schools ought the State to keep ? " This pithy question is one which , sooner or later , suggests itself to every thoughtful citizen . It is at least as old as Plato , and we might do worse in iiiodern society than to carry out some of the suggestions which he lays down respecting its solution in the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question whenever they have been interested in the relations of the commonwealth to the good of individ. nals . At times , in the history of a people , the question becomes of the greatest practical importance . Just now , for example , in England , France , Austria , Italy ( and , perhaps , we should add , in certain other countries of Europe ) , the happiness of generations to come depends upon the answer which will soon be given to this very inquiry . So in our own country , several of the States at the North , and all the States at the South , are engaged in the solution of the problem , and with our decentralized political organization a difference on this single point is likely to divide in bitter . // ness many a district and many a town . Whether or not we shall have a permanent class of white paupers at the North , and of black paupers at the South , depends , in no slight degree , on the views respecting public instruction which may prevail in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not to be governed by individual whims or by personal controversies . It is beyond the control of any individual , class , church , or political party . It is not merely of local but of universal interest . It will not be settled in any land till it is settled by the popular will , and settled right ; the agitation will not cease till a good education is provided for every child . Restrictions on the civil rights of individuals are rapidly disappearing-slavery at home , serfdom abroad ; and barriers to the acquisition of useful knowledge are also destined to fall , so that Freedom and Learning will go hand in hand the world over . Some thoughts upon this topic may therefore have at least this claim to the attention of our readers , that the inquiry is timely and general , for , whether we like it or not , the Public School holds a prominent place among the themes which engage the attention of European and American statesmen . A thorough student of this subject can not proceed beyond the elements , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public education , a certain system is spoken of as peculiar in its essential features to the United States of America . Abroad it is called " the American system , " at home " the New England system ; " and both abroad and at home it is regarded as an important contribution to the theory of public education , and even to the civilization of the world . This system is one in which as Americans , and especially as New Englanders , we feel an honest pride . It makes us indignant when we see insidious attacks upon its beneficent princi .. ples ; when we hear it openly assailed ; when we find the very men who are indebted to it for the little they know , or the much they have , refusing to extend its benefits to all the rising generation ; or when we see the leo4slature of a State ( even though led by accidental haste , or uninformed prejudice ) beginning to take the backward track . To any individual , the common school may seem to be a " bore ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversies ; he may find the burden of taxation heavy ; he may have no children to educate ; or he may prefer private schools to public for satisfactory considerations ; but , notwithstanding all this , he has neither the right nor the power to separate himself from the people with whom he lives , or to be indifferent to the general good . So closely are human interests interwoven in the fabric of human society , that the web can not be parted from the woof , without the ruin of the pattern . Every man , whether he has children or not to educate , and whether his taxes are much or little , has , in spite of himself , a personal interest in the public schools of the district , the town , the state , the nation , and the world ; and he will do well to bear in mind that as " eternal vigilance is the price of liberty , " a good system of instruction for the people can not be secured at a lower rate . For ourselves , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recoil from the local squabbles , and the petty selfishness by which ingenious and designing men are seeking to divert attention from the fundamental question , " WHAT SORT OF SCHOOLS OUGHT THE STATE TO KEEP We need not assure our readers that we advocate this " New England system " of Public Schools , as admirably suited to the wants of a free people ,  --  particularly in the flexibility with which it may*be adapted to the various needs of different localities and of different generations ; and also in the penetrability with which it carries useful knowledge into every nook and corner of the republic . This may sound to some , commonplace ; but designedly or ignorantly these views have been lately called in question , and need in consequence to be quietly examined . But instead of giving in detail , at the present time , our own opinion of the New England system , we propose to bring forward a few striking statements which have made a strong impression on many minds of the richness of our inheritance ; and we hope thereby to strengthen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whose views may have been befogged by secondary or tertiary issues . These illustrations will be chiefly drawn from the writings of foreigners , who represent very difterent classes of // observers . We begin with one of the latest reviews of the system , from the pen of a gentleman personally known to many of those readers whom we desire to reach . In the summer of 1865 , an English traveler found his way to New Haven for the purpose of examining our systems of education , public and private , primary , secondary , and superior . It was obvious , on the slightest acquaintance , that he was an observer of more than ordinary claims to attention and respect , for in addition to the attractive personal qualities which he possessed , he was the bearer of a commission from the government of Great Britain , directing him to investigate the principles and methods of American education . He did not appear to be in haste , but remained in town long enough to visit leisurely the college , the high school , the graded schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , of our large private schools , coming thus into contact with men of very different opinions and points of observation . All who saw him were impressed with his thoroughness and candor . While it was clear that he went beyond the surface , deep enough to discover both merits and defects which might escape a hurried , prejudiced , or unpractised inquirer , he was so cautious and even reticent in the expression of any generalizations , that it was not easy to prognosticate the tenor of his report . A graduate and a fellow of the university at Oxford , an ordained minister of the church of England , and rector of a rural parish , it was not strange that he was an earnest friend of the conservative and aristocratic traditions of his native land , and that nothing in his station and antecedents ( always excepting his genuine goodness , and his love of the human race ) , seemed to predispose him to commend the peculiarities of American institutions . His tour was not confined to Connecticut or New England , but extended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the results of his observations , inquiries , and reflections , have recently been presented to the Parliament of Great Britain . When this volume came into our hands , a short time ago , we turned to it with a good deal of curiosity to see in what // terms so fair a critic would characterize our country . From a perusal of its pages we have derived much valuable information respecting the aspect of our schools , both East and West , and we feel grateful to the author for the clearness and fidelity with which he has pointed out what seemed to him our weakness and our strength ; but to those who have not seen the volume , no single sentence which we can quote will give a better idea of the conclusions to which Mr. Fraser was led , than that with which he terminates his report on the United States : IT IS NO FLATTERY OR EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT THE AMERICANS , IF NOT THE MOST HIGHLY EDUCATED , ARE CERTAINLY THE MOST GENERALLY EDUCATED AND INTELLIGENT PEOPLE ON THE EARTH. * An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us on reading the above quotation , that he had heard a very similar remark from the mouth of Sir William Hamilton of Edinburgh . We have quoted Mr. Fraser as a representative of the established Church and of Oxford University . Now let us look in another direction . Richard Cobden and John Bright are known to every one as men of a very different type from the OxPrd fellow ; as agitators and leaders in popular reform , who care much le* for precedents than for practical measures fitted to promote the liberty , happiness , and prosperity of the English people . Through all , or nearly all his public life , Cobden was the intelligent advocate of the essential features of our American common schools ; but Bright , his powerful cob league in other movements for reform , long kept aloof from the educational platform , while he did not neglect to study the theory and practice of various systems of popular instruction . For several years , as we have heard from his own lips , he cherished the purpose of visiting the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report at the heading of this Article with . out any intention of making it the occasion of a formal review , but we desire to add in passing , that if the document itself could be reprinted , or if a good ahatract of its contents could be given in some one of the periodicals devoted to education , a valuable service would be rendered to the public . // thoroughly investigating the working of its educational institutions ; but being prevented from this journey , he collected and digested so large an amount of evidence , oral and printed , that he felt " almost as well acquainted with the system here prevalent as if he had seen it in actual operation . " These candid studies resulted in his conversion , and on the eighteenth of January , 1854 , he came before a crowded assembly in Manchester , on the platform with Cobden , Mimer Gibson , Alexander Henry , William Brown , and other well known members of Parliament , and amidst the loud applause of his friends upon the stage and on the floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England corresponding in its essential features with that of the United States . In the course of his remarks he dwelt upon two objections to the system which are often raised in England , and which appear to have embarrassed for a time the speaker himself ; the wellknown objections of the conservative , religious , or church on the hand . who object to secular education* and party , one the less familiar objection of the extremely radical party , on the other , who object to all interference on the part of the State with so private a concern . Here are the views of John Bright upon the latter topic . Mr. Baines and% Mr. Miall claim that " State interference is a timing which enfeebles a people ; that a nation becomes less free by government doing anything which the people can do even clumsily for themselves ; and that any interference by rates and taxes , or law and authority of any kind , can only have the effect of destroying the zeal of voluntary effort , not in questions of education only , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , this is true to a certain extent , and to a certain extent it is not true . It is true under certain circumstances and systems of government , but there are others in which it appears to me to have no kind of truth whatever . * * * It may be true in Russia , but * * I turn to the United States , and I say that there all that this association has ever proposed to do has been done for a long time past ; and that *mo man living can cay that the fearc which Air . Bainec and Xr . Miall have expreeced find any kind of conflrmation , from // any results that have taken place in the United States . " * One of the illustrations employed by Mr. Bright in his long and admirable speech was a comparison of the towns of Providence , R I. , and IRochdale , Eng. , in order to bring out how the latter would fare in educational advantages , under the New England system . It is pleasant to us to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as an example before an audience of intelligent and influential Englishmen , was largely due to the wisdom and foresight of Francis Wayland , that eminent teacher , in whom ( as it has truly been said ) " the common school , the high school , and the academy found a sympathizing friend , a skillful adviser , and a most efficient helper . " We do not know whether Mr. Bright had ever seen the suggestions and the principles laid down by President Wayland in a report , which was written in 1828 , on the school system needed in Providence , but we are confident that in all our American educational literature , he could hardly have found a more compact and convincing exhibition of the true New England views.t Fourteen years have passed by since that conference of the National Public School Association in&gt;Mlanchester , at which these tribunes of the l ) eople , IRichard Cobden , John Bright , and Milner Gibson , called so loudly for better education for the English nation . Th** have been years in which the Crimean war has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which Universal Exhibitions of industry have brought into comparison , with no flattering results , her skill in man ufactures ; in which her naval supremacy has been rendered questionable at least by the iron-clads and monitors of her transatlantic descendants ; and in which the value of popular education as an element in battle , more powerful than needle-guns or rifled cannon , has been tested in the Prussian victory of Sadowa . In illustration of this remark in respect to British skill in manufactures , let the reader consult the " Chemical News , " published in London , August 16 , 1867 , where , among other Eng Manchester Guardian , Jan. 21 , 1864. // lish criticisms on England , Professor Tyndall remarks , " that he has long entertained the opinion , in virtue of the better education provided by the Continental nations , that England must one day , and that no distant one , find herself *utstripped by those nations both in the arts of peace and war . " The credit due to the education of Prussian soldiers has been very generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted the following letter , which we can not err in attributing to the pen of Dr. Francis Lieber of New York : THE PRUSSIAN ARMY . To tke Editors of the Evening Po8t : One of the most distinguished of our generals in the West , during the civil war , who traveled in Germany and France on the eve of the war between Prussia and Austria , has recently sent a letter to this country , from which the following extract will interest the public : " There is no doubt that the two main factors of the amazing success of the Prussians over the Austrians have been the acttial nationality of the army ( which in Prussia is simply an armed generation ) . intelligently as well as stringently organized , and the individual intelligence of each soldier , inspirited by the great cause of Germany . The universal system of education established for the resusce - tation of Prussia , after the ruin of the battle of Jena , has borne its fruit at Sadowa . These two great elements , however , are wanting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very different are the physiognomies of the Austrian and ( I say it without hesitation ) the French armies ; all nicely dressed and splendidly set up , true enough , but no books and no maps and no newspapers , no discussion on political topics among tkem . All this is universal in the Prussian army . The Emperor Napoleon understands this all very well , and he therefore is the most peaceful man in France ; but at the same time he is making breech-loading guns as fast as possible . " F. L. Let us prolong this digression far enough to give a counter paragraph , which appeared in a recent number of the Si*cle , in Paris , occasioned by the pnhlication of two maps , entitled " France that can Read , and France that can Write : " " One-third of France unable either to read or write . Fifty-five departments out of 89 , in which the number of illiterate persona is from 30 to 76 per cent . Is it not a shame I And we talk of a new military organization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black phalanx of ignorance ; let us devote to this national work a tithe of the millions we uselessly squander . Let isa begin by beating Prussia on this ground . As regards primary instruction we are in the lowest rank of the European Powers , and we imagine ourselves to be marching at the head of civilization 1 , , // incessant discussion on national education , in reports , commissions , conferences , newspapers , and parliamentary debates , and still no results have been reached , though men of every shade of party acknowledge that something must be done . But as we write the debates grow warm , and intelligence reaches us that Earl Russell ( whose name as Lord John Russell is familiar to many as the President of one of the two great voluntary educational associations of England , the " British and Foreign School Society " ) , has given notice that on the second of December , 1867 , he will bring before the House of Lords four resolutions on the subject of national public instruction . His speech in introducing these measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we now write , but it can hardly be more telling than the resolutions themselves to which we here give place . EARL RUSSELL 'S RESOLUTIONS IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS . 1 . That in the opinion of this house , the education of the working classes in England and Wales ought to be extended and improved ; every child has a right to the blessings of education , and it is the duty of the State to guard and maintain that right . In the opinion of this house the diffusion of knowledge ought not to be hindered by religious differences , nor should the early employment of the young in labor be allowed to deprive them of education . 2 . That it is the opinion of this house that Parliament and Government should aid in the education of the middle classes by providing for the better administration of charitable endowments. 3 . That it is the opinion of this house that the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge may be made more useful to the nation by the removal of restrictions , and by the appointment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenues , for purposes of instruction in connection with the said universities . 4 . That the appointment of a Minister of Education by the Crown , with a seat in the Cabinet , would in the opinion of this House be conducive to the public benefit . The comprehensiveness of this fundamental movement is one of its most remarkable features ; for while it recognizes the rigid class distinctions still firmly maintained in English somety , it tends towards a national system embracing the lowest primary classes and the highest university instruction . But the first resolution is the most significant , for in it , as a careflul reader will remark , three principles are laid down , which became a part of the fundamental system of New // England two hundred years ago . " English instruction must be UNIVERSAL , SECULAR , AND COMPULSORY. *** This is progress ! These English gentlemen are not alone in their admiration of the Public Schools of this country . A series of thorough articles , from the pen of IMlons . E. de Laveleye , has recently appeared in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the best writers of that nation are contributors . These essays are studies on the educational systems of modern society . At the outset of his remarks the writer calls attention to the fact , that in all the world there arc four nations which can proudly say , that all their citizens know how to read , North Germany , Norway , Switzerland , and the United States ; but in respect to the United States , he adds this remarkable comment : " It is not simply true that every one knows how to read , but every one does read for purposes of instruction , entertainment , participation in public affairs , direction of labor , gaining of money , or investigation of ' religious truth . The American Union in consequence uses up as much paper as France and England combined ! " In illustration of these assertions , the writer recurs to a recent visit which he made to our national frigate Niagara , as it lay in the harbor of Antwerp , and he tells his readers ( as if it were something remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in hand a book , a review , or a newspaper . This general love of reading he rightly attrifutes to the Public School , which he delineates in these words : " Free to all , open to all , receiving upon its benches children of all classes and all religious denominations ; it obliterates social distinctions , deadens religious animosities , roots out prejudices and antipathies , and inspires in all a love of their common country , and a respect for free institutions. * ' It is surprising , he continues , to see what number of foreigners are absorbed every year into the American nationality . The Public School assimilates them . * The very year in which the fundamental agreement of New Haven Colony was entered into , a master was required to keep an apprentice " at school one year , or else to advantage him as much in his education as a year 's learning comes to , if at all , " &amp;c. p. 89 . Kingsley 's list . Disc. , 1838. t Revue des Deux Mondes , VoL 60 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our pages with extracts from the speeches of American statesmen , quite as laudatory as tbreign testimonials in respect to the New England Public Schools ; from Daniel Webster , whose first speech on entering public life was in their behalf ' , and whose pithy saying , " If I had as many sons as old Priam , I would send them all to the Pul*ic Schools , " has become a Massachusetts maxim ; or from Ed*ard Everett , the eloquent expounder and defender of the normal school and other improvements in the system , who said in the Hall of Representatives at Boston in 1849 , " If my tongue is ever silent when it ought to speak the praises of the Common Schools of Massachusetts , let it never be heard with favor in any other cause ; " or from the long series of gubernatorial messages in which the chief magistrates of the New England States are accustomed to commend to the several legislatures the various public interests ; or from the innumerable thanksgiving-day discourses , and fourth of July orations , which are even surer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so universal is the satisfaction with the essential features of the New England system , and so firm the confidence that its acknowledged hindrances and defects can be eliminated , that a man , desirous of promotion , who should openly in public meeting , or under his own signature in the columns of a newspaper , declare himself an opponent of the Common Scho6l as it now is , would be from that time onward politically dead . The obituary of his public life might at once be written . We may go even farther and say that we have never heard of an American who carried the non-interference theory of government so far , that he would have the State abstain entirely from the business of instruction . We do remember to have seen in a newspaper the phrase , that perhaps it will be found that the State can not keep school after all , but we regarded it as an expression which the writer himself would hardly have advocated with his voice in l ) ublic . On the other hand , all parties seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to encourage education ; some would place that something at the minimu7n and advocate ( perhaps with out knowing it ) a system of " pauper schools ; " a very few // would place it at the maximum , and include the administration of colleges and professional seminaries ; while the great body of the people , in public or in private life , would avoid both extremes , and would be almost as sorry to see our New England colleges and universities all absorbed by the State as to see our public schools maintained on an alms-house basis . Jusf at present the advocates of " the pauper system " are very active , and it is important to consider the measures which they propose , looking directly or indirectly to the introduction of their views . In these days there is very little danger of our going too far in the education of the people ; there is great danger of not going far enough . Indeed , we beg our readers to remark that it is the extent of popular ignorance , not the diffusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New England system of instruction . We believe that while it has done more for the people at large than any system which has elsewhere been devised , it has done far less than it might and should have done , so that all who would see the republic thrive should not enroll themselves with the down-pullers , but with the up-builders of the Common Schools . Far be it from us to flatter the pride of our countrymen , by untrue pictures of the workings of our institutions ; far be it likewise from us to discourage them because these institutions have not brought the millennium . We can labor x* ith zeal for the improvement of common schools , because we continue confident of the principles which underlie them . There are many persons who will acknowledge the truth of all that has thus far been said , * ho yet will feel some distrust of what they call the modern improvements in public instruction . They commonly have a very vague idea as to what these innovations are , and a still vaguer notion of their reputed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good old-fashioned housekeepers who can not be induced to substitute a modern range for the ancient brick oven , or who have a vague apprehension that gas brought into their dwellings will lead to some awful accident or some extravagant waste . To these dwellers in Doubting Castle especially , would we put the question , " What sort of Schools ought the State to keep * " and to help them in their answer , we would add , that there are // but four sorts which the State can keep-Private , Parish , Pauper , and Public . The State may say to private parties , you may maintain the schools , and we will inspect them ; you shall have the responsibility , and we will bestow encouragement and bounties . This would give us universal Private Schools . Or the State may say to the churches , you may do this work in your own religious way , and we will oversee and assist your efforts . This would give us universal Parish Schools . Neither of these plans stands any chance of adoption among us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may say , we will maintain schools for the destitute and neglected only , and all who can afford to pay must look out for themseli*es . This would establish Pauper Schools ,  --  like pauper homes in the alms-houses . Or , finally , the State may establish Public Schools adapted to the wants of all . The discussion is virtually narrowed to a choice between these two conflicting theories . Which system , doubter , would you have ? " What sort of Schools ought the State to keep ? " The people generally have pronounced themselves in favor of Public Schools , though it is true that there have been times , and there are localities , in which the pauper theory has gained ascendancy , sometimes even among entire communities ,  --  for example , in Pennsylvania , under the constitution of 1790 ; yet , as a general rule , throughout the United States , the decree has been uttered by the popular voice in favor of Public Schools , not only in the sense that they should be entirely controlled by the public , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be Common Schools , that is to say , open to all classes , without reference to social station . Commonly it is also held that when practicable these schools should also be graded or classified schools , because this is the cheapest and most efficient way of teaching a large number of children ; that they should be maintained with special reference to the wants of special cases , so as to avoid a routine too monotonous ; and finally , that they should be as good as the wealth , the intelligence , and the enterprise of the communit*y can make them . If any one doubts that such views as these are generally adopted , we refer him to the constitutional provisions of the various United States , as col // lected by Dr. Barnard in the circular quoted at the commencement of our remarks . If such inquiries are not conclusive , then let search be made for more definite information in the statute books of the several States . But before considering the modern operations , or so called innovations , derisively attributed to Horace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look with a closer analysis at this " New England school system , " so generally commended and so widely adopted . If we understand it , seven principles , aside from those of a secondary or non-essential character , may be regarded as peculiar to its administration . Many minor regulations which are certainly important , but are not of invariable worth proceed from these primary or fundamental laws . 1 . There is an admirable combination of local responsibility , supervision , and taxation ( secured in the various towns , school societies , and school districts ) , with legislation , codperation , and pecuniary aid from the State at large . 2 . Entire publicity is secured by frequent reports to the district , the town , and the State , by requiring a popular vote for the erection of a school house , the selection of a site , or the election of school officers , and by opening the doors of every school room to a visit from anybody at any time . 3 . There is a persistent avoidance of all offenses against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; while there is a steady enforcement of the doctrines of a pure morality . 4 . There is no recognition of the poor as a class , or the rich as a class , or of any social distinctions based on birth or money . 5 . The right of the people to tax themselves in districts , and towns , to any extent they please , for purposes of instruction , is every where acknowledged . 6 . The system is very pliable , so that cities and dense villages can maintain very different schools from country towns in which the population is scattered ; and the extent to which education shall be provided is governed by no universal law , but by a consideration of the wants , the wealth , and the other institutions of different localities . // 113 7 . The civil authorities are bound to protect the public from the barbarism of ignorance , by seeing to it that all the youth are instructed in at least the elements of useful knowledge . In accordance herewith , it is often found best to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade for the pupils more advanced ; and also special schools for special cases ,  --  like " evening schools " for youth who are kept at labor through the day ; or " sewing schools " for girls who may not be taught at home the indispensable art of using the needle ; or " truant schools " for those boys who will stay away from the regular schools , or who are so indifferent to the laws of propriety and morality as to require peculiar discipline . It is also possible to adapt the instructions of each particular locality , in a greater or less degree , to the wants of the boys and girls who are soon to be the men and women at work in that community in the various departments of human industry . These principles preclude the administration of the schools in the exclusive interest of any race or color , or of any social class . If the schools are so conducted that the poor are excluded , because of requirements to which they can not conform , whether these requirements are exacted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teacher , or the current sentiments of the comrnunity ,  --  then these fundamental principles are violated , and every friend of the system should protest ; or , oh the other hand , if the schools are so neglected , the houses so ill kept , and the teailiers so forlorn that none but the extremely destitute can think of entrusting their children to such influences , then , again , the equity which should govern all public transactions is offended , and a great wrong is perpetrated . Moreover , if covertly or avowedly , the Public Schools are managed so as to promote the peculiar or exclusive interests of any religious party ; if scholars are exposed to instructions or influences which violate their consciences , or which are hostile to the views of religious faith and doctrine enjoined by parental authority , the fundamental principles of our educational system , and not only so , but the fundamental principles of our republican government are directly opposed ; and it is // therefore the interest of us all , whatever our faith , to insist upon such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the faith of all . Some would advocate the adoption of a standard treatise on Christian morality , to which all Christian bodies might assent ; some would advise the total abandonment of religious instruction to Sunday schools and churches ; but whatever plan is followed there must be nothing in the public school room obnoxious to the charge of tending to proselyte from one faith to another ; and nothing which will tend to advance the interests of one church system at the expense of any other . We need only dwell on the workings of the school system in the Pacific States , where not only Roman Catholics and Protestants , but Mormons , and Buddhists , may be brought into close proximity , to discover the vital importance of adhering to this doctrine . A recurrence to these principles will help to answer a question which , like the story of a ghost , tends to puzzle if not to alarm , and disturbs some honest friends of popular improvement when they see the erection in our towns of stately " graded schools , " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning which these to them unwonted terms convey . How far do you propose to go , they ask ? Where will you stop ? What line will you draw between public and private responsibility ? This is a fair question , often put by thoughtful citizens when a proposal is made to improve the schools of a given locality . We have a ready answer . The point beyond which the Public Schools shall not go is determined by no general rule . It is and it must remain variable . The limits affixed by one generation are not the limits which need govern another . The line for a thriving and populous commercial or manufacturing town is not the line appointed for a scattered community of farmers . The solution of the problem , the determination of the level or the height , must be accomplished by those principles of civil engineering which are involved in the local selfgovernment of our land . Every town , the unit of our political 8ystem , must be a law to itself , subject only to such requirements and such restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the welfare of that commonwealth of towns which we call the State . The will ot the people in any given locality must decide how far in that locality the system of schools shall go . In determining a conclusion , the wealth of the town , the density of the population , the degree of good management observed in other public affairs , the possibility of securing good school officers , the existence and characteristics of endowed institutions , the sort of private schools which are main tamed , and other like considerations , deserve attention . They differ continually in different communities , as a few examples will show . By the great liberality of Mr. Russell Hubbard , Governor Buckiugham , and other public spirited citizens , who contributed a sufficient capital for the purpose , a Free Academy is maintained in Norwich . It is a classical and scientific School of a very high order , and receives , without any charge for tuition , the older boys and girls of Norwich , fitting them for college or the scientific school , or for the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be for Norwich to establish now a Public High School ! Hartford , from the very earliest days , has maintained a public Latin School , which received about two hundred years ago a small endowment from Governor Hopkins and so became a private trust , useful in its way but quite inadequate to the wants of the community . By the*harmonious action of the Hopkins trustees and the people of the town , an English High School has been added to the endowed Latin School , and the two foundations , one a permanent corporation , the other a popular appropriation , have been combined since 1847 as the Hartford High School , and now constitute one of the foremost schools in the land . Springfield , on the other hand , had no endowment , partial like Hartford , or sufficient like Norwich , and her citizens found it wise to establish a High School , for both English and classical studies ; arid they have long maintained such an institution to the entire satisfaction of all classes in the community , even of those who were at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affords a good example of the different aspects of the question in different generations . In the days of John Davenport and Theophilus Eaton , a Common // School , a Grammar School , and a Collegiate School , were advocated as essential grades in the system of public instruction . We have the authority of a local historian for saying that in the earliest colonial days , Not only were the advantages of a common school education immediately secured to all , but with a wise reference to what is essential to the full success of common schools themselves , provision was very early made for the higher branches of instruction , and a grammar school was established . As early as 1654 , when the colony was suffering from the failure of their commercial projects , and when the estates of individuals were greatly diminished , and even doubts were entertained by some , whether it was expedient to struggle nny longer against disaster ; Mr. Davenport gave a strong proof of his confidence in the stability of the settlement , and its ultimate prosperity , by the efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He brought forward before the General Court a plan for such an institution ; and the town of New Haven , notwithstanding its depressed state , made a donation in landfor its encouragement. * Because it was then thought wise for the town to contribute to the support of the college , it does not follow that it would be wise to ask such help in 1868 ( though the town might do worse with its money ) ; but we cite the illustration merely to show , that even if the public interest in education should go so far as to grant some land to aid the college , it would not l ) e a new proceeding in the history of New Haven . Forty years ago there was in this same town no public High School ; probably the number of persons who cared for one would not have made a corporal 's guard , because the Hopkins Grammar School fitted boys for college , and the calls for other sorts of educated labor were not very loud . Now this community of nearly 50,000 inhabitants gives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various walks of mercantile and mechanical enterprise ; and a high school is imperatively needed . The movement for its establishment , which began with Judge W. W. Boardman , Judge E. K. Foster , Rev. Dr. IDutton , and other well known citizens , in 1852 , t received in 1866 the popular approval . Those who declaim the loudest against the " modern innovations " of a high school have not yet carried their love of and Prof. J. L. Kingsley 's Historical Discourse at Ne*- Haven in 183S , p. 40. t See the printed Report which they presented to the School Society , 1852. // tiquity so far as to propose a repetition of that liberal action of two hundred years ago , the bestowal of a town grant upon the college . Having thus shown what sort of schools the State may keep , where the old iNew England system is established , let us enquire what sort of schools such a State should keep ? We are here led at once to the consideration of secondary or nonessential points , which are very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion may exist among those who are heartily devoted to the work of popular education . Every one , whether a friend of good public schools or not , must recognize at the present time the existence of social circumstances quite unknown to our forefathers . Once the people of New England were all of English stock , now all the nations of the earth have their representatives among us ; once the same religious faith was held , now the diverse creeds of Christendom are openly taught ; once there were none very rich , now there are many ; once farming was the predominant interest , now manufactures and traffic are ascendant ; once the demands of social life were few and simple , now they are infinitely complex . Let the reader recur to Dr. Dwight 's Travels in New England and New York , written in 1810 , if he would see what a simple , homogeneous , and quiet people then lived in New England , and he will not wonder that such a happy land has attracted the oppressed and down trodden of the nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not changed , but methods have . It is just as true now as it was forty years ago , that virtue and intelligence are the foundations of social prosperity ; it is just as true that the State requires good schools for all , and that boys and girls should be fitted for all the ordinary avocations of life ; it is likewise true that the system of public schools should be free from sectarian influences , or from class distinctions , or from poor teachers , or from unjust and illegal expenditures of money . But modern society , so busy , so complex , so multiform in its activity , may require different sorts of schools from what were known forty years ago ; and a wise public policy will enquire what meth // ods in these days will best carry out our fundamental principles . Some would pretend to believe that Horace Mann , or Henry Barnard , or the Prussian school system , or Teachers ' Institutes , or Normal Schools , have introduced these changes into modern society . But steam and lightning have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mann or Barnard . It is Fulton with his steamboat , and Morse with his telegraph , and Hoe with his printing press , and Whitney with his cotton gin , and all the rest of the inventors ' tribe ; it is Cunard steamers , and ocean telegraphs , and Pacific railroads , and Nevada silver mines , and daily newspapers , and steam manufactories which have brought us from the quiet life of the boy to the busy life of the man . Now , in view of this altered society , and in view of the obvious dangers to which the republic is exposed by the intermingling of heterogeneous elements , by the growth of large cities , by the accumulation of enormous tbrtunes in the hands of a few , and by the reception of so many foreigners who are destitute of American ideas , we who desire to see the knowledge and the virtue of all the people maintained at its former standard are striving to introduce improvements in school administration , which shall apply the principles inherited from our forefathers to the requirements of to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the points of secondary importance to which attention is directed , but on the following there is very close accordance : 1 . Education should be made compulsory to such an extent that none of the youth shall waste their time in idleness and truancy ; and hence , the adoption and the enforcement of statutes against the excessive and injurious employnent of children in factories , and against truancy in towns and cities , are loudly called for . It is deemed especially important to enlighten public opinion on the necessity for such proceedings , as otherwise the best of legislative or municipal enactments become at once a dead letter . The cry of the children arising from factory villages in the new world as well as the old has been expressed in verses none too strong from the pen of Mrs. Browning . Would that it might be heard in every church and every household of the land , till there should be // a universal clamor for the physical , mental , and moral improvement of those children whose parents are too sordid , too ignorant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Education should be made so cheap that pecuniary obstacles shall form no barrier to the acquisition of knowledge . Generally , schools which are absolutely free are advocated by the friends of public instruction , and even the few who advocate a slight tax upon parents recognize the value of a property tax , and also the necessity of putting the parental fee at the very lowest point . Accordingly we find that in nearly all the States of the Union , " Free Schools " are established by fundamental law , and in those where a rate bill for tuition is maintained , its effect is to shorten the period during which the schools are kept , and to deter the very children who ought not to be driven off , thus doing more harm than good . 3 . Teachers should be encouraged to make teaching a permanent occupation , and also to qualify themselves for proficiency in their calling . Some would be glad to see a system of examinations of teachers , uniform and thorough , akin to such as is advocated by Mr. Jenckes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now maintained in England by the cooperation of the universities ; but where such views as these do not prevail , the necessity of making some provision for the training of young w*men to be the teachers in country schools is almost universally recognized . Women have become the teachers of New England schools , not exclusively but generally . Their advantages , compared with those of you*Ig men , are very poor , though they are rapidly improving . Multitudes engage in the work of teaching district schools , with no other preparation than the education they have themselves received in district schools of an inferior sort . Hence something like a Normal School , or a prolonged Teachers ' Institute , becomes an absolute necessity if the public schools are to be maintained with vigor. 4 . Public Schools should be graded ,  --  which simply means that the scholars should be classified under different teachers and in different rooms , so that in a given time a higher education can be secured . how far such gradation should be // carried , and how many scholars should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on which we shall not enter now . Teachers and school authorities differ among themselves . None but ignorant or bitter opponents of a good school system ob , ject to the gradation or classification of scholars . Little children are taught by themselves with all the appliances which make a school attractive ; those who are more advanced come under different teachers , and the older boys and girls under the direction of the principal . We can understand how public schools may be intelligently opposed , but how " graded schools , " or the classification of the scholars , can be objected to , surpasses our comprehension . Mr. Fraser , to whom we have before referred , thus explicitly advocates the adoption in England of our graded school system : " It is the one thing , " he says , " which our elementary schools have not , and which they most need . I do not care so much about Common Schools ; I have no particular preference for Free Schools ; but I do see most clearly the advantages of a Graded School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great influence upon schools of a lower grade , awakening a love of knowledge , and an aspiration for its attainment in all the younger scholars ; and also , because , at a very slight cost , young men and young women , who would otherwise be excluded from education beyond the rudiments , have the doors of higher education thrown open to them . Whether these high schools should be maintained by districts , towns , or counties , and what should be their range of studies , are variable questions to be determined in different localities according to the principles already laid down . 6 . The influence of the State , and the distribution of State school-funds , should tend to the encouragement and reward of local fidelity and enterprise , and to the removal of local negligence and meanness ; and , so , also , the whole power of the town , pecuniary and moral , should be brought to bear on those forlorn and decaying districts which , without this outside influence , will descend into the very " barbarism of ignorance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the applications of fundamental principles , which are now-a-days // advocated by the friends of good public schools . No radical changes are proposed , but only the united and vigorous carrying out in our day of those very doctrines which have made New England hold so honorable a position in thrift , intelligence , and general uprightness . Why is it that the views which we have laid down awaken such bitter opposition ? Part of the hostility to public schools undoubtedly comes from the dread of increased taxation . We do not know whether the custom is a general one ; but , in Connecticut , the taxation for schools is a distinct item which every tax payer is particularly reminded of when the collector calls upon him . Other taxes are consolidated in such a way that the citizen can not tell his proportion of the tax expended for a given object . He pays town or city taxes for all the manifold wants of the community except for schools . He can not tell what the tax is for maintaining the fire department , or the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the support of out.door poor , but he can tell exactly what he pays for the public school ; and it is not every one who stops to think that the money paid on school account is money saved from the account of vice and crime ; though if the school tax should be given up , property holders may be very sure that it would not be many years before the town and city taxes would be augmented to a like amount by increased expenses for constables and jails . We acknowledge that public schools are costly ; but in itself this is no reason for abandoning them . Railroads , and steamboats , city halls , and fire departments , courts of justice , post offices , poor-houses , and prisons-all are costly ; but some of these establishments are worth what they cost . Is it not so with the public schools ? IDo they not save the cost of other outlays for police and prisons ? Do they not add to the material wealth of the State by training up a higher class of citizens ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by making the citizens of every occupation intelligent and sensible ? But , after all , public schools are not so costly as many people think who look at the aggregate sums which are paid , and not at the number of children who are taught . Mr. // Fraser , from inquiries made in eleven of the chief cities of the Union , ascertained that the average cost to the public for tuition only , in the public schools , was $10.39 per annum ; and that an American farmer can educate his children at a cost to the community of not more than one-third the amount at which the Committee of Council in England estimate the cost of educating the laborers ' children . Another source of opposition is found in the apprehension of dangerous " tendencies " in the views we have laid down . We can imagine a person going so far as to claim that if public schools are maintained , public theaters must be , public trips to Europe , public education in foreign universities and the like , is if there was no common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can imagine that the great cry of hostility to the public school system will be its tendency , but not that public legislatures will be deceived thereby . Let us pause for a moment to enquire what means this cry of " tendency , " a cry which was used so absurdly a short time since when we were told that the improvement of Connecticut common schools would end in a National University at a cost of thirty millions . These alarmists foreet that where there is a current , there is also a counter current ; and that the Gulf of Mexico is not likely to be emptied because there is a tendency in the gulfstream to carry northward its waters . There is a tenden.cy in the emancipation of human thought which took place in the sixteenth century to evoke a race of irreligious freethinkers , but is there anybody who would prefer the days of medieval darkness ? There is a tendency in republican institutions to send such men as Morrissey to Congress , and to make a Mayor of Fernando Wood ; but we are yet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ballot-box , as the emblem of sovereignty . There is a tendency in the earth to fly away from the solar source of heat , but who thinks it a necessity to lay in extra coal ? Obviously , in estimating a tendency , our work is but half done if we do not estimate also the counteracting force . It is the equation of centrifugal and centripetal forces which keeps the earth in its orbit ; it is the equation of opposite tenden // cies in public affairs which maintains the equilibrium of the State ; and while a few may cry out against " a tendency to communism " as they call it in the common school , as commonly conducted , because it is largely supported by a tax upon property , and is open to all the people , that is , to the commons , we agree with the advocates of popular enlightenment at home and abroad , in discovering here the same counteracting influences which regulate many other of our common institutions , the common-park , the common-highway , the common-wealth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SENSE IS THE KING in this democratic republic . It is sovereign in resisting all tendencies to communism ; it governs th' state , it governs the nation , it governs public opinion , it governs the Common School . The English statesman was right when he told his hearers that the fears which are entertained of enervating influences from the establishment of a system of Public Schools find no sort of confirmation in the history of the United States . As this royal rule of Common Sense has guided us for two hundred years , we are not afraid to trust it now . Some of those who would represent the people may be frightened by this tendency cry ; but the people themselves will not be easily misled by an argument so specious . We urge upon these who dread this tendency , to study the records of the past , and see that for more than two hundred years in New England , the Public School has been at work without producing any dreadful results . We will not fill these pages with the extracts which could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now everywhere accessible , but we refer to the documents themselves with entire confidence that the historical student will agree with us in the statement , that what we have presented as the essential principles of the New England or American system of Public schools were recognized two hundred years ago ; and have not been essentially modified from that time to the present . Even most of the points to which we have referred as secondary and non-essential were regarded by the fathers in the same light in which they are now regarded by the most diligent and intelligent advocates of popular education . // See the views of Mr. Ban croft : " The constitution of Massachusetts required a system of universal public education as a vital element in the State . The measure was a bequest from their fathers , endeared by a long experience of its benefits , and supported by the reflective judgment of the people . As yet , the system was established nowhere else except in Connecticut . Pennsylvania aimed at no more than to instruct youth at low prices . ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided instruction at the cost of the State for every child within its borders ; and bound up its schools in its public life ; while the other only proposed to dole out a bounty to the poor . " * While we anticipate very great improvements in the public school systems of the United States , and welcome accordingly all criticisms and recommendations which proceed from a sincere desire to carry out those fundamental principles to which we have called attention ( such , for example , as those suggested in a recent pamphlet by Mr. Harrington of New Bedford ) , we look at the same time for a different kind of criticism , tending not to reform , but to destroy . Very few will be bold enough to say that the pocket is the source of their hostility to modern public schools , and fewer still will advocate so offensive a doctrine as the establishment of pauper schools , but the dread of higher school taxes is a subtle case , and the establishment of pauper schools is a sure result of some of the measures which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as to coniplain of " the new measures , " which are based on " the deceptive plan that the schools for the poor should be made as good as the schools for the rich , " and to talk of " the clap-trap declamation about the children of the poor sitting on the same seat with the children of the rich . " But there are many whose opinions indirectly involve the establishment of the pauper system . Let us show how this is true . One man objects to Normal Schools , having an idea that they are useless excrescences . He does not stop to ascertain that the great reason for advocating Normal Schools is because it is so hard to get good teachers . College graduates are , in these days , in haste for professional employment . Other competent young men are drawn into business which will " pay , " large numbers being of late years led away from teaching to // serve as book agents and solicitors for life insurance companies . Women have already taken the places once filled by young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have had no other advantages than the district school of the country town . They are bright , and earnest , and have native adaptation to the teacher 's work , but unless they have some training for it , their schools will be so poor , that only the poor will accept their instructions . New Haven and Hartford , Boston and Springfield , can get along without State Normal Schools ; but for the country towns it is indispensable that some means should be contrived for the training of young women for the work of teachers , or otherwise pauper schools alone will flourish in the rural districts . Another person objects to the High School , without stopping to see how great its influence is upon the schools of lower grade , how it tends to keep the scholars longer under the influence of instruction , how it opens the door to higher education to those who would otherwise be excluded , and how it tends even more than the primary school to bind together in the brotherhood of American citizens those who might otherwise be estranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public that the Public school is for all . To dispense with its influence is to impair the system , and render it less attractive to those who are taxed for its support , and who have a right to demand a*systetn for all . The pauper system needs no tHigh School . Another objection is brought against Graded School houses . These are simply good buildings , erected so as to last , and designed to provide in the most efficient and economical way for the instruction of the large number of children who must be taught in large towns and densely peopled villages . It is an arrangement which parents know how to value , and which tax-payers , if they understood it , would be the last to dispense with . But do away with graded schools , mix up in one room children of all ages , provide no course of study , let each teacher manage as she likes , without help or oversight , and the schools are at once deserted by all who can get away , and become inevitably pauper schools . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every parent // pay for tuition , and do n't tax those who do n't use the Public Schools for their own offspring . " This is another device to get the rich by themselves and the poor by themselves . Practically this very thing is done at this very day in many a country town in New England ,  --  and with what results ? The schools are , in such cases , so forlorn , the teachers so ill-paid , and the local obstacles to progress so great that a constant outcry of dissatisfaction arises from all who are intelligent enough to see that a good school , at whatever cost , is one of the greatest blessings which a community can desire . All who can afford it resort at great cost to other means of education , and the pauper school remains for the few who can get no better . Thus , one by one , all the features which make up a good school system are opposed and put down in theory if not fact , by those who advocate , often without knowing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated that the prevalence of their views involves such results . It is not a question of " tendency " or of theory . Mr. Gradgrind himself can be shown that it is a matter of fact . " Give me the little red school of forty years ago , " we can hear these objectors say , " and we will be content . " We can tell them that there are plenty of just such school houses left all over Coniiecticut , and , indeed , throughout New England . They stand at the corners of the cross roads , unenclosed , looking " brown and bare " , a Maud Muller 's ancle , with the window lights broken , and the benches hacked up by the scratches and cuts which have come down from a former generation . We heard the other day of the sale of one such little red school house in Windham county , which was purchased by some farmer for a hen-house , at the price of five dollars , " the opinion of the neighbors being that the hens had the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we met with an account of another little red school house , in a district we could name . It is said to be one of the richest of agricultural districts in Connecticut , and is famous for its perpetuation of the old fashioned method . Its school house has been figured in a well known work on School Architecture as an example of the schools which were . " A few years since a denizen of the district left a few hundred dollars , the income to be expended in support // of the school , provided they should read and spell in school at the same time , and just as many times a day as they did when he was a boy . " Last year they received a Webster 's Dictionary , in common with other districts , from State appropriations . Their last act was to vote to sell it for eight dollars ! Clergymen and school visitors , familiar with what are called the " outlying districts , " away from villages and churches , will recognize the truth of the picture we draw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little red school house at the corner of the cross roads . We wish our space was ample enough for an expansion of the benefits of maintaining a Public System of Schools . With all its imperfections the New England system works better than any other which the human race has yet devised ; it sheds more penetrating light upon the darkness of the laud than any other agency of man ; it makes books and newspapers fruitful ; it promotes industry , ingenuity , and wealth ; it prepares the citizen for the duties of the commonwealth ; it trains the factory operative for domestic enjoyment ; it Americanizes the foreigner ; it binds together the more favored and the less favored in ties of acquaintance and friendliness ; it fits us all for the brotherhood of a republic ; it promotes morality and virtue , and prepares the mind for the reception of sound religious truth . It is a cheap , a satisfactory , a pliable , and a penetrating influence for good which may reach every farm , every workshop , every store , and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given ? Though we are well aware of the dangers to which this system is exposed , from local mismanagement , from unwise or extravagant expenditures , from the apathy of the community , and various other circumstances , we believe , that the system which we have expounded is destined to live a thousand years . Mankind was long in arriving at the notion of a Free Church , long in securing a Free State , long in obtaining a Free School , but once discovered and acquired , the three will go hand in hand . Together they will rise ; together they will fall . The least of all our dangers is the danger of going too far in the education of the people . The idea of the Public School , devised and developed by the // earliest settlers of Massachusetts and Connecticut , has been adopted through New England and through the land . New York accepted it before the close of the last century . It has followed the line of New England emigration . Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in all the towns within their borders . The golden State has added this jewel to its radiant crown . The Pacific Railroad will carry with the log cabin of the settler the public free schocil for his children . Even Utah has adopted the New England system . The States of the South have recognized the fact that it was the Common School which fought the battles of the war , and fitted the Northerners for victory . Tennessee and Louisiana have sent to Connecticut for counsel and aid . Kentucky has discovered that her people will not remain at home while the agents of other States are able to offer free public education to all who will avail themselves of it. * Other States , southern and midland , are devising ineasures to adopt the system . Even the mother land looks favorably on our results . Earl Russell , while pointing to the fact that three persons in every ten in England can not write their names , quotes Mr. Fraser in proof of the general intelligence of the American citizen ; and the Pall 3/lall Gazette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be regarded " by the legislatur* and by the people , neither as a benefit conferred by the rich upon the poor , nor as a lesson taught by spiritual superiors to spiritual inferiors , but as a great advantage purchased for the nation at large , by the nation at large , just as we purchase for ourselves a thousand other things , protection from violence , the administration of justice , supplies of gas , water , and other conveniences . " Even John Stuart Mill , the able opponent of State interference in the concerns of individuals , makes a clear exception of education , in which he claims that the State may rightly interfere4 Thus spreads the notion of a school tor all , maintained by all .
