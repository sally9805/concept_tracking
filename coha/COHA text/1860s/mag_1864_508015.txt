A TOUR THROUGH ARIZONA . F*Fftb 3 ) a4ev J MUST here interrupt my narrative for a moment to say a word about the sketches which accompany these papers . Sketching in Arizona is , to a man of mercurial temperament , rather a ticklish pursuit . I shall not readily forget my experience of the cafions and thickets , and the queer feeling produced by the slightest sound that fell upon my ears as I hurriedly committed the outlines to paper . It has been my fortune to furnish the world with sketches of Madagascar , Zanzibar , Palestine , the Continent of Europe , Iceland , and some few other points , many of which were my story . qwq Even with all the safeguards of pistols and sol* diers I am free to admit that on occasions of this kind I frequently looked behind to see how the country appeared in its rear aspect . An artist with an arrow in his back may be a very picturesque object to contemplate at one 's leisure ; but I would rather draw him on paper than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Fort Yuma I was beset by these difficulties ; and if any man of genius and enterprise thinks he could do better under the circumstances he is welcome to try . This much premised , I resume THE FINE AIITS iN ARIIONA. // A TOUR THROUGH ARIZONA . chiefs , head-men , and people , came pouring in . They came from the river-bottom , from the villages , from the weeds , from the grass , and possibly from the holes in the ground . On horseback and on foot they came ; by twos and by threes , and by sixes and by dozens . Paint and red blankets , beads and brass buttons , shone with resplendunt brilliancy around our encampment . By noon it presented a busy scene of savage enjoyment . The Pimo belles were in their glory . Plump and good-natured ; their pretty eyes fringed around with black paint ; their teeth shining in pearly whiteness ; their bosoms bare ; their forms of almost Grecian symmetry and delicacy . Poston , with his enthusiastic appreciation of beauty , would have lost his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that surrounded him ; so thair when severely pressed by a bevy of Pimo maidens for beads , calicoes , and the like , he usually closed both his eyes . and handed out the presents at random . In this way I observed that he frequently gave a sash , or shawl , or string of beads to some stalwart buck , and a shovel or pickaxe to some tender maid . When the looking-glasses and tin jewelry were distributed , never was there such a sensation in Pimeria ; and as for the fancy calicoes , the excitement produced by the sight of them can not but descend to the Pimo posterity , and the name of Mr. Commissioner Dole be blessed unto the last geneuttion of these good people . I have no doubt many of them will name their children Dole . I conscientiously believe that historians in future ages will find the name of Dole common among the Pimos . My friend Poston made a speech to Antonio Azul that , in point of terseness and eloquence has never , I venture to assert , been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the friendly professions made by the chiefs and people , we signified that two pumpkins for our journey across the desert would be a most , acceptable return for the laborious services we had rendered the great cause of civilization ; whereupon over a dozen pumpkins were immediately dragged forth from the loose and somewhat discolored drapery that hung around the squaws . We gracefully thanked them and proceeded to pick up our vegetables . " Dos rails , " said the Indians . We gave them two bits . " Quatro redis , " they observed . We offered them four bits . They gravely wrapped up their pumpkins . We offered a dollar for two . They coolly demanded two dollars . We indignantly showed them the way out of camp . Antonio and Francisco had long since disappeared before the impending storm . Not so their followers , who , in this case , were no followers at all . Firmly as rocks of adamant they sat gossiping upon the ground , regardless of our displeasure . S&amp;me of them considered it in the light of a friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the odorous fumes of the pots and frying-pans . Toward the shades of evening the pumpkin-vendors had sufficiently warmed their backs an-I were about to depart . Our cook , Dr. Berry , was in favor of seizing a choice pair of pumpkins as a military necessity , but that proposition was overruled as beneath the dignity of our official position . Have them , however , we must . They were indispensable to our health . I left it all to Poston , whom I knew to possess a high order of genius for trade . He traded for two hours ; he was calm and violent by turns ; he reasoned and raved alternate ly . I fell asleep . When I awoke triumph sat perched upon his brow . The Indians were gone . Success had crowned his efforts . Two pumpkins , the spoils of victory , lay at his feet . " What did they cost ? " was my natural inquiry . He looked a little confused , but quickly rallied , and replied , " Oh , not much-for this country ! Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TWENTY-TWO dollars in trade . " It was gratifying at all events to know that the Pimos were rapidly becoming a civilized people . Under these circumstances we thought it advisable to pursue our journey without further waste of time . Traveling all day from Sacatone we reached the Blue-Water Wells early in the evening , where we camped till dark . A few hours of night-travel brought us to the Pecacho , a little beyond which we made a dry camp till morning . The country between the Gila River and Tucson is a hard , gravelly desert , partially covered with a scrubby growth of mesquit and cactus , and at this season destitute of water except at two or three points , where the wells dug by the Overland Mail Company still remain . In former years emigrant parties suffered much in crossing this inhospitable desert . At certain seasons of the year some pools of water near the Pecacho afford relief to the trains , and enable the emigrants to reach the Gila ; but these are a very uncertain dependence . The Pecacho lies forty- five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance from Tucson . It presents a prominent and picturesque landmark from both points , and is seen at a great distance from the Papagoria . The name is Spanish , and signifies " point , " or " peak . " Some travelers have discovered in this curious formation of rocks some resemblance to an axehead . There are many Pecackos throughout Arizona . I have been unable to see in any of them the most remote resemblance to an axehead . Generally they consist of two sharppointed rocks , one of a triangular and the other of a rectangular shape , growing out of the top of some isolated mountain , and serve to indicate the routes across the desert , which would otherwise be difficult to find . I had no idea before my visit to Arizona that there existed within the territorial limits of the United States a city more remarkable in many respects than Jericho  --  the walls of which were blown down by horns ; for , in this case , the walls were chiefly built up by horns  --  a city realizing , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been before they were destroyed by the vengeance of the Lord . It is // gratifying to find that travel in many lands has not yet fatally impaired my capacity for receiving aew sensations . Virginia City caine near it ; but it was reserved for the city of Tucson to prove that the world is not yet exhausted of its wonders . A journey across the Ninety-mile desert prepares the jaded and dust-covered traveler to enjoy all the luxuries of civilization which an ardent imagination may lead him to expect in the metropolis of Arizona . Passing the Point of the Mountain , eighteen miles below , he is refreshed during the remainder of the way by scraggy thickets of mesquit , bunches of sage and grease-wood , beds of sand and thorny cactus ; from which be emerges to find himself on the verge of the most wonderful scatteration of human habitations his eye ever beheld  --  a city of mud-boxes , dingy and dilapidated , cracked and baked into a composite of dust and filth ; littered about with broken corrals , sheds , bakeovens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of verdure , parched , naked , and grimly desolate in the glare of a southern sun . Adobe walls without whitewash inside or out hard earth-floors , baked and dried Mexicans , sore-backed burros , coyote dogs , and terra-cotta children ; soldiers , teamsters , and honest miners lounging about the mescal shops , soaked with the fiery poison ; a noisy band of Sonoranian buffoons , dressed in theatrical costumes cutting their antics in the public places to the most diabolical din of fiddles and guitars ever heard ; a long train of Government wagons preparing to start for Fort Yuma or the Rio Grande-these are what the traveler sees , and a great many things more , but in vain he looks for a hotel or lodging-house . The best accommodations he can possibly expect are the dried mud walls of some unoccupied outhouse , with a mud floor for his bed ; his own food to eat , and his own cook to prepare it ; and lucky is he to possess such luxuries as these . I heard of a blacksmith , named Burke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Tucson . Both parties drank whisky all day for occupation and pleasure . When bedtime came , Burke said , " Let 's go home and turn in . " He led the way up to the Plaza , and began to hand off his clothes . " What are you doing ? " inquired his guest . " Going to bed , " said Burke- " this is where I genrally sleep . " And they both turned in on the Plaza , which if hard was at least well-aired and roomy . The stranger started for the Rio Grande the next day . For various reasons Tucson has long enjoyed an extensive reputation . Before the acquisition of Arizona by the United States the Mexicans had a military post at this place , with a small command for the protection of the missions and adjoining grain fields against the Apaches . It then numbered some four or five hundred souls . Since 1854 it has been the principal town in the Territory , and has been occupied successively by the Federal and rebel troops . As the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying on the high-road from the Rio Grande to Fort Yuma , it became during the few years preceding the " break-up " quite a place of resort for traders , speculators , gamblers , horse-thieves , murderers , and vagrant politicians . Men who were no longer permitted to live in California found the climate of Tucson congenial to their health . If the world were searched over I suppose there could not be found so degraded a set of villains as then formed the principal society of Tucson . Every man went armed to the teeth , and street-fights and bloody aifrays were of daily occurrence . Since the coming of the California Volunteers , two years ago , the state of things in this delightful metropolis has materially changed . The citizens who are permitted to live here at all still live very much in the Greaser style  --  the tenantable houses having been taken away from them for the use of the officers and soldiers who are protecting their property from the Apaches . But then , they have claims for rent , which they can probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal in that sort of paper . Formerly they were troubled a good deal about the care of their cattle and sheep : now they have no trouble at all ; the cattle and sheep have fallen into the hands of Apaches , who have become unusually bold in their depredations ; and the pigs which formerly roamed unmolest. ed about the streets during the day , and were deemed secure in the back-yards of nights , have become a military necessity . Eggs are scarce , because the hens that used to lay them cacklo no more in the hen form . Drunkenness has been effectually prohibited by a written order limiting the sale of spirituous liquors to three specific establishments , the owners of which pay a license for hospital purposes , the fund whereof goes to the benefit of the sick and disabled , who have fallen a sacrifice to their , zeal in the pursuit of hostile Indians . Gambling is also much discountenanced ; and nobody gambles when he is out of money , or ca n't borrow any from other sources . The public regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town-at the mescal-shops , the montetables , and houses of ill-fame-for the preservation of public order , or go there of their own accord for that purpose , which amounts to the same thing . Public property is eminently secure . The Commissary 's store-house is secured by a padlock on the door and a guard in. front with a musket on his shoulder ; so that nobody can go in at any time of the day or night and steal one hundred pounds of coffee and one hundred pounds of sugar , deposited there by private parties for safe-keeping , without killing the guard and breaking open the padlock , or cutting a hole through the adobe wall . If such a thing did occur it would be considered a reflection upon the entire post , and the loss would at once be reimbursed either from public or private sources . Otherwise people would naturally think very strange of such an occurrence . Although there are two companies of ablebodied // men well-armed and equipped at Tucson , aud although the Apaches range within three miles of the place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Citize* in small parties of five or six go out whenever occasion requires , and afford aid and comfort to unfortunate travelers who happen to be waylaid in pursuit of their legitimate business ; and the Papago Indians also do good service by following up and killing the hostile savages who infest the country . It is confidently believed , therefore , that as long as the troops are kept within the precincts of the ancient Pueblo of Tucson , they will not be molested by any enemy of a more deadly character than mescal , against which the regulations provide a remedy , and if they do n't the physician of the post is prepared to do so free of compensation for eighteen months . Neither can the pangs of starvation assail this important strong-hold , unless the climate should unfit them for the heavy labor of lifting the food to their mouths ; for , unlike the poor wretches of miners and traders who are prowling around the country in search of a living , the troops here stationed receive their regular salary and rations , and the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they require , and vast numbers of wagons and mules to haul the same from distant points . Besides , there are private traders always ready to furnish them with food from Sonora at a reduction upon the present cost to Government ; and even if none of these sources could be relied upon , there are abundant tracts of rich arable lands lying within a few miles , upon which it would be mere pastime for the men to raise fifty or sixty bushels of wheat or corn to the acre at an extra compensation of fifty cents per day-convenient places where the Papagoes would be willing to protect them from the Apaches for the trifling consideration of a few strings of beads or yards of manta . I say , therefore , there is no reason to apprehend that the command at Tucson will ever be reduced to the humiliating necessity of depending upon the Pimo Indians who live on the Gila River for wheat upon which to feed their mules , to the exclusion of miners , traders , and other human beings engaged in developing the resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of sustenance , and who , under the ordinary rules of trade , may come in competition with them , or offer more to the Indians for the products of their labor . Such a degradation could never befall California Volunteers . Far rather would they go to work and raise wheat for their mules , or let the mules die , than squabble - over a miserable pittance of wheat raised by the industry of a degenerate race , whom they are expected to elevate by their example to the standard of civilization ; nor would they undertake to evade the imputation that would rest upon them for such an act by placing it on the ground of military necessity , when such necessity , if it existed at all , could only have arisen from negligence , incompetency , or dishonesty in their own departmeats , and which , at all events , would be a very dangerous plea to establish in a Territory remote from the seat , of rebellion , and under the acknowledged protection of civil law . By proclamation of the Governor , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that martial law no longer prevailed , and that the military should afford all the aid in their power in carrying the civil law into effect , such a mortifying state of things is expressly provided against . News reached us at this place of the massacre by the Apaches of two gentlemen well known to the members of our party-Mr . J. B. Mills , Superintendent of the Pata*nia Mines , and Mr. Edwin Stevens , who had just come down by the way of Guyamas to take his place ; also of an attack by the same band of Indians upon Mr. S. F. Butterworth , President of the Arizona Mining Company . The statements were conflicting , and there were still some members of Mr. Butterworth 's party for whose safety great anxiety was felt . As our route lay in part through the same region of country in which these startling events bad taken place , we made immediate application for an escort from the detachment who had accompanied us from Fort Yuma , in the hope of being enabled to render some assistance to our friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tucson has greatly improved within the past two years , and offers at the present time rare attractions for visitors from all parts of the world , including artists , who can always find in it subjects worthy of their genius . The views of life , the varied *f // attitudes of humanity that I , a mere sketcher , found in the purliens of the town as well as in public places , will be valuable to posterity ; but , as Dr. Johnson said when looking from an emiuence over the road that led out of Scotland into England , it was the finest view he had seen in the country , so I must be permitted to say the best view of Tucson is the rear view on the road to Fort Yuma . A sojourn of two or three days quite satisfied us with the metropolis of Arizona . It is a very delightful place for persons of elegant leisure ; but as we belonged*to the class who are compelled to labor for a living , there was no excuse for our staying beyond the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions of the south . On the 19th of January we set forth on our journey with an escort of thirty men belonging to Company G , California Volunteers , undes* command of Lieutenant Arnold . I may here be allowed to say that a better set of men I never traveled with . They were good-humored , obligir*g , and sober , and not one of them stole a pig or a chicken during the entire trip . Nine miles from Tucson we came to the fine old mission of San Xavier del Bac , built by the Jesuits in 1668 . This is one of the most beautiful and picturesque edifices of the kind to be found on the North American continent . I was surprised to see such a splendid monument of civilization in the wilds of Arizona . The front is richly ornamented with fanciful decorations in masonry ; a lofty bell-tower rises at each cor ner , one of which is capped by a dome ; the other still remains in an unfinished condition . Over the main chapel in the rear is also a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ornaments appropriately designed . The material is principally brick , made , no doubt , on the spot . The style of architecture is Saracenic . The entire edifice is perfect in the harmony of its proportions . In every point of view the eye is satisfied . Mr. Mowry well observes , in his pamphlet on Arizona , that , " incredible as it may seem , the church of San Xavier , with its elaborate facade , its dome and spires , would to-day be an ornament to the architecture of New York . " A village of Papago Indians , numbering some two or three hundred souls , partially surrounds the mission . There are also a few Mexicans living among the Indians ; but they are regarded with distrust , and complaint is made that they have intruded themselves against the wish of the tribe . Mr. Poston , upon investigation of the matter , ordered the Mexicans to leave . As far back as our knowledge of the Papagoes extends they have been a peaceable , industrious , and friendly race . They live here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low grounds in the vicinity , which they make wonderfully productive by a system of irrigation . Wheat , corn , pumpkins , and pomegranates are the principal articles of subsistence raised by these Indians ; and they seem to enjoy an abundance of every thing necessary for health and comfort . They profess the Catholic faith , and are appar BEAR VIEW OF TUCSON . // a C a a p ently sincere converts . The Jesuit missionaries taught them those simple forms which they retain to this day , though of late years they have been utterly neglected . The women sing in the church with a degree of sweetness and harmony that quite surprised me . At the time of our visit two padres from Santa Clara , California , who had come as far as Tucson with the command* had just taken up their quarters in the mission . From my acquaintance with them on the road , I judge them to he very sincere and estimable as well as intelligent men . We furnished them with a Pimo grammar , published by Mr. Buckiugham Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are now studying that language with a view of holding more advantageous intercourse with the Papagoes , who are originally a branch of the Pimos , and speak the same language . The reverend fathers entertained us during our sojourn with an enthusiastic account of their plans for the restoration of the mission and the instruction and advancement of the Indian tribes , with whom they were destined to he associated for some years to co*ne . Subject as the Papagoes are to frequent encroachments from th' Apaches , they are compelled to keep their cattle closely watched . At present they possess scarcely sufficient stock for the ordinary purposes of agriculture . Not more than five or six months ago a small hand of Apaches made a foray within a mile of the village , and carried away with them at a single swoop mast of the stock then grazing in the pastures . Though naturally disposed to peaceful pursuits , the Papagoes are not deficient incourage . On one occasion , when the principal chiefs and hraves were away gathering pat ayak in the desert , the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally heat off , a band of over two hundred Apaches who made a descent upon the village . Frequently they pursue their hereditary enemies to the mountains , and in almost every engagement inflict upon them a severe chastisement . Leaving San Xavier , we followed the course of the Santa Cruz Valley for two days , making only one camp at Rhodes 's Ranch . I had sup . // posed , previous to our entrance into this region , that Arizona was nearly a continuous desert , as indeed it is from Fort Yuma to Tucson ; but nothug cau he a greater mistake than to form a general opinion of the country from a journey up the Gila . The valley of the Santa Cruz is one of the richest and most beautiful graziug and agricultural regions I have ever seen . Occasionally the river sinks , but even at these points the grass is abundant and luxuriant . We traveled , league after league , through waving fields of grass , from two to four feet high , and this at a season when cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of California . Mesquit and cotton-wood are abundant , and there is no lack of water most of the way to Santa Cruz . Three years ago this beautiful valley was well settled by an enterprising set of frontiersmen as far up as the Calabasas Ranch , fifteen miles beyond Tubac . At the breaking out of the rebellion , when the Overland Stage Line was withdrawn , the whole Territory , as stated in a previous paper , went to ruin with a rapidity almost unparalleled . The Apaches supposing they had created a panic among the whites , became more bold and vigorous in their forays than ever . Ranch after ranch was desolated by fire , robbery , and murder . No white man 's life was secure beyond Tucson ; and even there the few inhabitants lived in a state of terror . I saw on the road between San Xavier and Tubac , a distance of forty miles , almost as many graves of the white men murdered by the Apaches within the past few years . Literally the road-side was marked with the burial-places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single living soul to enliven the solitude . All is silent and death-like ; yet strangely calm and beautiful in its desolation . Here were fields with torn - down fences ; houses burned or racked to pieces by violence , the walls cast about in heaps over the once-pleasant homes ; every where ruin , grim and ghastly with asso* ciations of sudden death . I have rarely traveled through a country more richly favored , yet more depressing in its associations with the past . Day and night the common subject of conversation was murder ; and wherever our attention was attracted by the beauty of the scenery or the richness of the soil a stone-covered grave marked the fore-ground . The history of Bill Rhodes , at whose ranch we camped , was an example . In the full tide of success this daring frontiersman returned to his house one evening , and found his comrades murdered and himself surrounded by a large band of Apaches . By some means he managed to break through their lines ; but his horse being jaded it soon became apparent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him he flung himself into a willow thicket and there made battle . A circle was formed around him by the blood-stained and yelling devils , who nii*rihered at least thirty ; but he was too cool a man to be intimidated by their infernal demonstrations . For three hours he kept them at bay with his revolver ; although BILL RHODES 5 RANCH . // they poured into the thicket an almost continuous volley of rifle-shots and arrows . A ball struck him in the left arm , near the elbow , and nearly disabled him from loss of blood . He buried the wounded part in the sand and continued the fight till the Indians , exasperated at his stubborn resistance , rushed us in a body , determined to put an end to him at once . He had but two shots left . With one of these he killed the first Indian that approached , when the rest whirled about and stood off . They then addressed him in Spanish , calling him by name , and telling him he was a brave man , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , " said he , " d-n you ! I 'll kill the last one of you before you shall take me ! " He had given such good evidence of his ability in that way that they held a parley and concluded he was about right ; so they retired and left him master of the field . Bill Rhodes 's Apache fight is now one of the st'andard incidents in the history of Arizona . On reaching the old Pueblo of Tubac we found that we were the only inhabitants . There was not a living soul to be seen as we approached . The old Plaza was knee-deep with weeds and grass . All around were adobe houses , with the roofs fallen in and the walls crumbling to ruin . Door and windows were all gone , having been carried away by the Mexicans three years ago Old pieces of machinery belonging to the neighboring mines lay scattered about the main building , formerly the head-quarters of the Arizona Mining Company . Many of these are still valuable . At the time of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had upward of $60,000 worth of machinery stored in the building attached to the old tower , every pound of which was hauled in wagons at great expense from Lavacca in Texas , a distance of twelve hundred miles . Two boilers , weighing 6000 pounds each , were hauled in the same way , one of which was taken to the Patagonia Mining Company . The other , at the time of our journey , lay on the Sonora road a little beyond the Calabasas . Some Mexicans were hauling it away when they were attacked by a band of Apaches , who killed two of the party , took the teams , burned the wagon , and left the boiler on the road-side , where it lay when we passed . Tubac was first settled by the Americans in 1856 , when my friend Poston , the Arizona pioneer and late superintending agent of the silver mines in this vicinity , established it as his head-quarters . It lies on a pleasant slope in one of the most beautiful parts of the valley of the Santa Cruz , within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about twenty-two from the Heintzelman or Cerro Colorado , two of the richest mining districts within the limits of the Territory . Under the direction of Mr. Poston , Tubac was soon partially rebuilt . Good houses and store-rooms were erected , old buildings were repaired ; a farm was fenced in and put under cultivation ; a fine garden was started and irrigated by acequias in the Mexican style ; and it may literally be said " the wilderness blossomed as the rose . " In 1858 , 59 , and 60 , during which the mines were in progress of development , Tubac might well be regarded as the head-quarters of civilization in the Territory . Men of refinement and education connected with the mines were here occasionally assembled , and even the fair sex was well represented . The gardens afforded a pleasant place of retreat in summer , with their shady groves of acacias and peach-trees ; and deep pools in the river , overhung by willows , were cleared out and made into bathing-places , in which all who pleased might refresh themselves with a luxurious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Englishman in Hyperion , and read the newspapers , by which means he kept his temper cool amidst the various disturbing influences that surrounded him . Tubac is now a city of ruins-ruiwand desolation wherever the eye rests . Yet I can not but believe that the spirit of American enterprise will revisit this delightful region , and reestablish , on a more permanent footing , all that has been lost , and as much more as its enterprising American founder conceived in his most sanguine anticipations . The mines are proverbially rich ; and rich mines will sooner or later secure the necessary protection for working them . A view of the Plaza , and especially the old tower upon which , amidst the cheers of our escort , we planted the glorious flag of our Union , will convey some idea of the general character of the town . As a matter of historical interest , characteristic of the vicissitudes suffered by these border towns of Arizona , a few incidents connected with the depopulation of Tubac will not be deemed out of place . In 1840 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty men , and the town contained a population of four hundred . After the boundary-line was established and the Mexican troops were withdrawn , th2 entire population retired to Santa Cruz , Imuriz , Magdalena , and other points within the Sonora line . Subsequently , when it became the head-quarters of the Arizona Mining Company , it contained a mixed population of four or five hundred , consisting of Americans , Germans , Mexican peons , and Indians . When the Federal troops were withdrawn to the Rio Grande Tubac was again partially abandoned , only twenty-five or thirty souls remaining . At this period ( 1861 ) the Apaches came down from the mountains in large force , and surrounded the town with a view of plundering it ; but the few Americans left made a bold defense , and kept them at bay for several days , although it is esti*nated they numbered over two hundred . The beleaguered residents , finding they would ultimately be overwhelmed or starved out , sent an express to Tucson during the night , stating their condition and asking for assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Grant Ourey , got up a party of twenty-five men , and by rapid and skillful movements // came suddenlyupon the Apaches , whom they attacked with such spirit that the whole band fled in a panic to the Santa Rita mountains . At the time of Mr. Ourey 's arrival a party of seventy-five Mexicans , who had heard that the Government of the United States was broken up , came in from Sonora with the same purpose of plunder which the Apaches had just attempted to carry into effect . Seeing the preparations for defense they fell back upon Tumacacari , three miles distant , where an old American lived , whom even theApaches had spared , killed him in cold blood , robbed the place of all it contained worth carrying away , and retired to Sonora . Thus harassed on both sides by Apaches and Mexicans , and without hope of future protection , the inhabitants of Tubac for the last time abandoned the town ; and thus it has remained ever since , a melancholy spectacle of ruin and desolation . We were exceedinglyanxious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered such a disastrous attack from the Indians-especially of Messrs . Kustel , Janin , and Higgins , who had crossed over from the Patagonia mines , and of whose safety we had no intelligence . There was abundant reason to suppose they had fallen into the hands of the same band of Apaches who had killed Mr. Mills and Mr. Stevens and robbed Mr. Butterworth . Our vaquero discovered fresh traces of a wagon on the Santa Rita road , which somewhat reassured us of their safety ; but we were not yet satisfied . It was deemed advisable under the circumstances to send the vaquero with a E4 a detachment of five men over to the Santa Rita hacienda , with instructions to make a careful examination of the premises , and join us the next day at Calabasas . As an instance of the wonderful sagacity of the Mexicans in determining the number and movements of parties entirely unknown to them , from signs which to us would be quite unintelligible , the vaquero reported next day that he had found traces of our American friends . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to their movements , and said we had missed them by eight days Nor was there any mere // conjecture about this information . It was all demonstrated by the closest reasoning upon isolated and trifling yet incontrovertible signs ; and what is most remarkable , his statement was subsequently corroborated by the facts in every particular . We killed several deer in the vicinity of Tnbac , which contributed materially to our scanty stock of provisions . Wild turkeys were also abundant , but our hunters failed to get a shot at them , although their tracks were to be seen within a stone's-throw of the Plaza . Leaving a written notice upon the wall of the old fort , informing all persons who might pass this way of our arrival and departure , we proceeded without loss of time on our journey . Three miles beyond Tubac we made *a halt to visit the old mission of San Jose de Tumacacari. another of those interesting relics of Jesuit enterprise which abound in this country . The mission lies a little to the right of the road , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred yards of the Santa Cruz River . A luxuriant growth of cotton-wood , mesquit , and shrubbery of various kinds , fringes the bed of the river and forms a delightful shade from the heat of the sun , which even in midwinter has something of a summer glow about it . Like San Xavier and other missions built by the Jesuits , Tumacacari is admirably situated for agricultural purposes . The remains of acequias show that the surrounding valley-lands must have been at one time in a high state of cultivation . Broken fences , ruined outbuildings , bake-houses , corrals , etc. , afford ample evidence that the old Jesuits were not deficient in industry . The mission itself is in a tolerable state of preservation , though by no means so perfect as San Xavier del Bac . The dome , bell-towers , and adjacent outhouses , are considerably defaced by the lapse of time , or more probably by the Vandalism of renegade Americans . A strong adobe corral adjoining the back part of the main edifice , with a massive gateway and with loop-holes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy fathers carried on their agricultural pursuits . Valesquez writes in strong terms of the richness and beauty of this part of the valley . I spent some hours making sketches of the ruins , and succeeded , I flatter myself , in getting some tolerably good views , one of which was given in the first of these papers . Proceeding on our journey , we reached at an carly hour in the afternoon the fine old ranch ) f the Calabasas or " pumpkins . " This splendid tract of country belongs , I believe , to Sefior Gandara , formerly Governor of Sonora . As an instance of the vicissitudes of life in Sonora , I may mention that we met Sefior Gandara just before crossing the Colorado Desert , making his way into California , with a few broken-down retainers , mounted on mules and burros . All he possessed in the world was a rickety ambulance , his animals , and a few pounds of corn . He was a sad spectacle of a used-up Governor ; was old and poor , and had no hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country that gave him birth . The " Calabasas " will never profit him more . An ex-Governor is an outlaw in Sonora . And yet this ranch is one of the finest in the country . It consists of rich bottom lands and rolling hills , extending six leagues up and down the Santa Crnz River by one league in width , embracing excellent pasturage and rich arable lands on both sides . Situated as it is at the junction of the two main roads from Sonora , the Santa Cruz and Magdalena , iL might be made a very valuable piece of property in the hands of some enterprising American . A ready market for its productions could always be had at the neighboring silver mines and also at Tucson . At present , however , and until there is military protection in the country , it is utterly worthless , owing to the incursions of the Apaches . For the past two or three years a stout-hearted frontiersman by the name of Pennington lived at this place , with a family ranging from ten to a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnishing the troops at Tucson with a large amount of hay . " Old Pennington , " as he is familiarly called , is one of those strange characters not unfrequently to be met with in the wilds of Arizona . During the whole time of the abandonment of the country by the Americans he occupied with his family a small cabin three miles above the Calabasas , surrounded by roving bands of hostile Indians . He stubbornly refused to leave the country-said he had as much right to it as the infernal Indians , and would live there in spite of all the devils out of the lower regions . His cattle were stolen , his corrals burned down , his fields devastated ; yet he bravely stood it out to the last . When hard pressed for food he was compelled to go out in the hills after deer , which he packed in on his back , always at the risk of his life . At times he was several days absent ; and I am told his daughters frequently had to stand guard with guns in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of them , a Mrs. Paige , was on one occasion traveling with her husband , when the Indians attacked the party , killed all the men , beat her on the head with a club , and cast her over a precipice , where they left her for dead . Maimed and bleeding , she crept away during the night , and for sixteen days endured the most dreadful tortures of hunger and thirst , subsisting on roots and berries , and suffering indescribable agony from her wounds . When rescued by a party of whites , she was nothing more than a living skeleton . She now lives with her father , and is an active , hearty woman . Three months ago the family moved down to the neighborhood of Tucson , where I had the pleasure of an introduction to the eccentric " Old Pennington . " He is a man of excellent sense , strange as it may seem . Large and tall , with a fine face and athletic frame , he presents as good a specimen of the American frontiersman as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midst // of the Apaches , with his family of buxom daughters , would fill a volume . While camped at the Calabasas , some of us slept in the old building , as the nights were rather cool . The escort remained by the bank of the river , which is the best place for pasturage . Calabasas presents something the appearance of a Mexican military post , which I believe it was in former years . The houses are built of stone and adobe , and are still in a good state of preservation , except some of the roofs and a portion of the tower . Major Stem had his head-quarters here in 1 856- ' 57 . It was occupied for nearly a year by the First Regiment of Dragoons under his command . It was also temporarily occupied by Colonel Ewell , now of the rebel service . A characteristic anecdote of Ewell was related to me during the evening . He wished to procure a supply of water from a spring in one of the neighboring hills , and went out one day with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having no apprehension of an enemy in such close proximity to his command he had omitted to take any arms with him , and his men were only provided with axes and spades . About half a mile from the house they were suddenly surprised by a band of Apaches , who commenced shooting at them with their arrows from every bush . The men started to run for the fort , so that they might obtain their arms and make something of a decent fight . " Halt ! ' * shouted Ewell , in stentorian tones , while the arrows fell around him in a perfect shower . " Halt , boys ! let us retreat in good order I " And as the story goes , he formed his men in line , and deliberately marched down the hill to an imaginary quick-step , stopping every now and then as the arrows pricked their skins or pierced their clothing to deliver a broadside of imprecations at the cowardly devils who had taken such a dirty advantage of them . It was said of old Ewell that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one can readily imagine that he did some tall swearing on this occasion . During the night we were visited by a detachment of the common enemy , evidently on a tour of observation . Next morning their tracks were visible in the road near the river , showing how they had come down and where they halted to inspect the camp , as also their return . Their purpose evidently was to steal our horses ; but they must have seen the sentinels and concluded it would not be a safe investment of time or labor . Had the command been less vigilant we would doubtless have made the remainder of our tour on foot , as many a command has already done in this country . Pleasant prospect , is it not ? where one stands an even chance of being shot with a rifle-ball or an arrow as he sleeps , and does not know when he wakes up but he may have to cross deserts and mountains on foot before he reaches any point inhabited by white people . But I suppose in these war times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such incidents must appear very tame and commonplace . A few years ago I would have regarded my tour through Arizona as something of an achievement . Now I write the details with a humiliating consciousness that they are scarcely worthy of record , except as pictures of everyday life in a country but little known . As the main object of our journey down in this direction was to ascertain the fate of our American friends who had been waylaid , we posted up notices advising them of our movements in case they should pass along the tame road ; and determined after some consultation to proceed to Magdalena , Sonora , so as to intercept them in case they had started to return by the way of Guyamas . A few miles beyond Calabasas we encountered a party of Mexicans and Yaqui Indians , on their way up to the placers on the Colorado River , from whom we learned that Mr. Butterworth and his party had passed through Magdalena eight days before . The Mexicans said they met them on the road between Magdalena and Hermosillo , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , and were traveling " muy racio , " with their rifles in their hands . The cover to the ambulance , and some other details , showing the manner in which the Apaches had cut away the leather , identified our friends , and we were satisfied it would be impossible for , us to overtake them . It was necessary , however , that we should continue our journey to Magdalena in order to procure a fresh supply of provisions , as we were nearly out , and there was but little prospect of procuring any thing at Santa Cruz . This day 's journey through the valley of Nogales , or the " walnut-trees , " was one of the most pleasant of our trip . Every mile we traveled the country improved in beauty and fertility . Grass up to our horses ' shoulders covered the valley , and the hills were clothed with luxuriant groves of oak . Much of the country reminded me of the coast range in California . We stopped a while ' at the boundary-line to examine the monument erected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now reninins save an unshapely pile of stones . Wandering bands of Sonoranians , in their hatred of every thing American , had doubtless mutilated it as an expression of national antipathy . These people say they never consented to the sale of any portion of Sonora , and still regard Arizona as legitimately a part of their territory . I could not help regretting , as I looked beyond the boundary of our territorial possessions , that we had not secured , by purchase or negotiation , a line sufficiently far south to afford us a port on the Gulf of California . Without such a port Arizona will always be difficult of access . Major Fergusson , in his report of a reconnoissance from Port Lobos to Tucson , via Caborca and Arivaca , demonstrates clearly the vast im portance of this strip of territory , not only to Arizona but to Mesilla and a large portion of Ne*v Mexico . He shows also the urgent desire of the people of the South to secure it , together with Arizona , and the advantages it would give them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event of a permanent division of the Union . General Carleton , in transmitting this report to Washington , urges the importance of securing this strip of territory prom Mexico before it becomes a possession ot5*rance . I do not believe our Government , in the multiplicity of its present labors , is quite aware of the importance of the proposed purchase . It would give to Arizona and its rich mineral regions an easy and direct communication with the Pacific Ocean . It would encourage the settlement of the country , by affording facilities for the transportation of mining and agricultural implements and su**-plies of all kinds , which can now he had only at enormous expense . It would open a route for a railway to the ocean from the valley of the Mesilla . The country is for the most part nearly a level plain , and a very small expendituse of money *vonld make one of the finest *vagon-roads in the world from La Libertad to Tucson . The total distance , as measured hy Major Fergusson , is 211 miles . It is to be hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early a period as practicable .
