txt E PLURIBUS UNU1T . WE do not believe that any government - no , not the Rump Parliament on its last legs-ever showed such pitiful inadequacy as our own during the past two months . Helpless beyond measure in all the duties of practical statesmanship , its members or their dependants have given proof of remarkable energy in the single department of peculation ; and there , not content with the slow methods of the oldfashioned defaulter , who helped himself only to what there was , they have contrived to steal what there was going to be , and have peculated in advance by a kind of official post-obit . So thoroughly has the credit of the most solvent nation in the world been shaken , that an administration which still talks of paying a hundred millions for Cuba is unable to raise a loan of five millions for the current expenses of Government . Nor is this the worst ; the moral bankruptcy at Washington is more complete and disastrous than the financial , and for the first time in our history the Executive is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of the nation . Our material prosperity for nearly half a century has been so unparalleled , that the minds of men have become gradually more and more absorbed in matters of personal concern ; and our institutions have practically worked so well and so easily , that we have learned to trust in our luck , and to take the permanence of our government for granted . The coun // try has been divided on questions of temporary policy , and the people have been drilled to a wonderful discipline in the maneuvres of party-tactics ; but no crisis has arisen to force upon them a consideration of the fundamental principles of our system , or to arouse in them a sense of national unity , and make them feel that patriotism was anything more than a pleasin g sentiment ,  --  half Fourth of July and half Eighth of January , - a feeble reminiscence , rather than a living fact with a direct bearing on the national well-being . We have had long experience of that unmemorable felicity which consists in having no history , so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and changes of dynasty ; but the present generation has never been called upon to learn that deepest lesson of politics which is taught by a common danger , throwing the people back on their national instincts , and superseding party-leaders , the peddlers of chicane , with men adequate to great occasions and dealers in destiny . Such a crisis is now upon us ; and if the virtue of the people make up for the imbecility of the Executive , as we have little doubt that it will , if the public spirit of the whole country be awakened in time by the common peril , the present trial will leave the nation stronger than ever , and more alive to its privileges and the duties they imply . We shall have learned what is meant by a government of laws , and that allegiance to the sober will of the majority , concentrated in established forms and distributed by legitimate channels , is all that renders democracy possible , is its only conservative principle , the only thing that has made and can keep us a powerful nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best government is that which governs least , seems to have been accepted literally by Mr. Buchanan , without considering the qualifications to which all general propositions are subject . His course of conduct has shown up its absurdity , in cases where prompt action is required , as effectually as Buckingham turned into ridicule the famous verse ,  --  " My wound is great , because it is so small " by instantly adding , - " Then it were greater , were it none at all . " Mr. Buchanan seems to have thought , that , if to govern little was to govern well , then to do nothing was the perfection of policy . But there is a vast difference between letting well alone and allowing bad to become worse by a want of firmness at the outset . If Mr. Buchanan , instead of admitting the right of secession , had declared it to be , as it plainly is , rebellion , he would not only have received the unanimous support of the Free States , but would have given confidence to the loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treason in the South . Either we have no government at all , or else the very word implies the right , and therefore the duty , in the governing power , of protecting itself from destruction and its property from pillage . But for Mr. Buchanan 's acquiescence , the doctrine of the right of secession would never for a moment have bewildered the popular mind . It is simply mob-law under a plausible name . Such a claim might have been fairly enough urged under the old Confederation ; though even then it would have been summarily dealt with , in the case of a Tory colony , if the necessity had arisen . But the very fact that we have a National Constitution , and legal methods for testing , preventing , or punishing any infringement of its provisions , demonstrates the absurdity of any such assumption of right now . When the States surrendered their power to make war , did they make the single exception of the United States , and reserve the privilege of declaring war against them at any moment ? If we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Government have expended immense sums in fortifying points whose strategic position is of continental rather than local consequence ? Florida , after having cost us nobody knows how many millions of dollars and thousands of lives to render the holding of slaves possible to her , coolly proposes to withdraw herself // from the Union and take with her one of the keys of the Mexican Gulf , on the plea that her slave-property is rendered insecure hy the Union . Louisiana , which we hought and paid for to secure the mouth of the Mississippi , claims the right to make her soil French or Spanish , and to cork up the river again , whenever the whim may take her . The United States are not a German Confederation , hut a unitary and indivisible nation , with a national life to protect , a national power to maintain , and national rights to defend against any and every assailant , at all hazards . Our national existence is all that gives value to American citizenship . Without the respect which nothing hut our consolidated character could inspire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of San Marino , for all the protection it would afford us . If our claim to a national existence was worth a sevenyears ' war to establish , it is worth maintaining at any cost ; and it is daily hecoming more apparent , that the people , so soon as they find that secession means anything serious , will not allow themselves to he juggled out of their rights , as members of one of the great powers of the earth , hy a mere quibble of Constitutional interpretation . *Te have been so much accustomed to the Buncombe style of oratory , to hearing men offer the pledge of their lives , fortunes , and sacred honor on the most trivial occasions , that we are apt to allow a great latitude in such matters , and only smile to think how small an advance any intelligent pawn-broker would he likely to make on securities of this description . The sporadic eloquence that breaks out over the country on the eve of election , and becomes a chronic disease in the two houses of Congress , has so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look upon strong language as an evidence of weak purpose , that we attach no meaning whatever to declamation . Our Southern brethren have been especially given to these orgies of loquacity , and have so often solemnly assured us of their own courage , and of the warlike propensities , power , wealth , and general superiority of that part of the universe which is so happy as to be represented by them , that , whatever other useful impression they have made , they insure our never forgetting the proverb about the woman who talks of her virtue . South Carolina , in particular , if she has hitherto failed in the application of her enterprise to manufacturing purposes of a more practical kind , has always been able to match every yard of printed cotton from the North with a yard of printed fustian , the product of her own domestic industry . We have thought no harm of this , so long as no Act of Congress required the reading of the Congressional Globe . " We sub . mitted to the general dispensation of longwindedness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold fast our faith in the divine government of the world in the midst of so much that was past understanding . But we lost sight of the metaphysical truth , that , though men may fail to convince others by a never so incessant repetition of sonorous nonsense , they nevertheless gradually persuade themselves , and impregnate their own minds and characters with a belief in fallacies that have been uncontradicted only because not worth contradiction . Thus our Southern politicians , by dint of continued reiteration , have persuaded themselves to accept their own flimsy assumptions for valid statistics , and at last actually believe themselves to be the enlightened gentlemen , and the people of the Free States the peddlers and sneaks they have so long been in the habit of fancying . They have argued themselves into a kind of vague faith that the wealth and power of the Republic are south of Mason and Dixon 's line ; and the Northern people have been slow in arriving at the conclusion that treasonable talk would lead to treasonable action , because they could not conceive that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an independent frame of government on so visionary a basis . Moreover , the so often recurring necessity , incident to our system , // of obtaining a favorable verdict from the people , has fostered in our public men the talents and habits of jury-lawyers at the expense of statesmanlike qualities ; and the people have been so long wonted to look upon the utterances of popular leaders as intended for immediate effect and having no reference to principles , that there is scarcely a prominent man in the country so independent in position and so clear of any suspicion of personal or party motives , that they can put entire faith in what he says , and accept him either as the leader or the exponent of their thoughts and wishes . They have hardly been able to judge with certainty from the debates in Congress whether secession were a real danger , or only one of those political feints of which they have had such frequent experience . Events have been gradually convincing them that the peril was actual and near . They begin to see how unwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Executive in allowing men to play at Revolution till they learn to think the coarse reality as easy and pretty as the vaudeville they have been acting . They are fast coming to the conclusion that the list of grievances put forward by the secessionists is a sham and a pretence , the veil of a long-matured plot against republican institutions . And it is time the traitors of the South should know that the Free States are becoming every day more united in sentiment and more earnest in resolve , and that , so soon as they are thoroughly satisfied that secession is something more than empty bluster , a public spirit will be aroused that will be content with no half-measures , and which no Executive , however unwilling , can resist . The country is weary of being cheated with plays upon words . The United States are a nation , and not a mass-meeting ; theirs is a government , and not a caucus ,  --  a government that was meant to be capable , and is capable , of something more than the helpless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive and administrative officers that are not mere puppet-figures to go through the motions of an objectless activity , hut arms and hands that become supple to do the will of the people so soon as that will becomes conscious and defines its purpose . It is time that we turned up our definitions in some more trustworthy dictionary than that of avowed disunionists and their more dangerous because more timid and cunning accomplices . Rebellion smells no sweeter because it is called Secession , nor does Order lose its divine precedence in human affairs because a knave may nickname it Coercion . Secession means chaos , and Coercion the exercise of legitimate authority . You can not dignify the one nor degrade the other by any verbal charlatanism . The best testimony to the virtue of coercion is the fact that no wrongdoer ever thought well of it . The thief in jail , the mob-leader in the hands of the police , and the murderer on the drop will be unanimous in favor of this new heresy of the unconstitutionality of Constitutions , with its Newgate Calendar of confessors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have volunteered to a man for its propagation or its defence . Henceforth let every unsuccessful litigant have the right to pronounce the verdict of a jury sectional , and to quash all proceedings and retain the property in controversy by seceding from the court-room . Let the planting of hemp be made penal , because it squints toward coercion . XYhy , the first great Secessionist would doubtless have preferred to divide Heaven peaceably , would have been willing to send Commissioners , must have thought Michael 's proceedings injudicious , and could probably even now demonstrate the illegality of hell-fire to any five-year-old imp of average education and intelligence . What a fine world we should have , if we could only come quietly together in convention , and declare by unanimous resolution , or even by a twothirds ' vote , that edge-tools should hereafter cut everybody 's fingers but his that played with them , - that , when two men ride on one horse , the hindmost shall always sit in front , - and that , when a man // tries to thrust his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shall be deemed to have established his title to an equitable division , and the bed shall be thenceforth his as of right , without detriment to the other 's privilege in the floor ! If secession be a right , then the moment of its exercise is wholly optional with those possessing it . Suppose , on the eve of a war with England , Michigan should vote herself out of the Union and declare herself annexed to Canada , what kind of a reception would her Commissioners be likely to meet in Washington , and what scruples should we feel about coercion ? Or , to take a case precisely parallel to that of South Carolina ,  --  suppose that Utah , after getting herself admitted to the Union , should resume her sovereignty , as it is pleasantly called , and block our path to the Pacific , under the pretence that she did not consider her institutions safe while the other States entertained such unscriptural prejudices against her special weakness in the patriarchal line . Is the only result of our admitting a Territory on Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go out again on Tuesday ? Or do only the original thirteen States posscss this precious privilege of suicide ? We shall need something like a Fugitive Slave Law for runaway republics , and must get a provision inserted in our treaties with forei*zn powers , that they shall help us catch any delinquent who may take refuge with them , as South Carolina has been trying , to do with England and France . It does not matter to the argument , except so far as the good taste of the proceeding is concerned , at what particular time a State may make her territory foreign , thus opening one gate of our national defences and offerin* a bridge to invasion . The danger of the thing is in her making her territory foreign under any circumstances and it is a danger which the Government must prevent , if only for self-preservation . Within the limits of the Constitution two sovereignties can not coexist ; and yet what practical odds does it make , if a State becomes sovereign by simply de daring herself so ? The legitimate consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that , so far as the General Government is concerned , she has outlawed herself , nullified her own existence as a State , and become an aggregate of riotous men who resist the execution of the laws . We are told that coercion will be civil war ; and so is a mob civil war , till it is put down . In the present case , the only coercion called for is the protection of the public propezty and the collection of the federal revenues . If it be necessary to send troops to do this , they will not be sectional , as it is the fashion nowadays to call people who insist on their own rights and the maintenance of the laws , but federal troops , representing the will and power of the whole Confederacy . A danger is always great so long as we are afraid of it ; and mischief like that now gathering head in South Carolina may soon become a danger , if not swiftly dealt with . Mr. Buchanan seems altogether too wholesale a disciple of the laissez-faire doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from interference which is true policy only in regard to enterprise wisely and profitably directed . He has been naturally reluctant to employ force , hut has overlooked the difference between indecision and moderation , forgetting the lesson of all experience , that firmness in the beginning saves the need of force in the end , and that forcible measures applied too late may be made to seem violent ones , and thus excite a mistaken sympathy with the sufferers by their own misdoing . The feeling of the country has been unmistakably expressed in regard to Major Anderson , and that not merely because he showed prudence and courage , but because he was the first man holding a position of trust who did his duty to the nation . Public sentiment unmistakably demands , that , in the case of Anarchy vs . America , the cause of the defendant shall not be suffered to go by default . The proceedings in South Carolina , parodying the sublime initiative of our own Revolution with a Declaration // of Independence that hangs the franchise of human nature on the kink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all men to the pursuit of happiness the more practical privilege of some men to pursue their own negro , - these proceedings would be merely ludicrous , were it not for the danger that the men engaged in them may so far commit themselves as to find the inconsistency of a return to prudence too galling , and to prefer the safety of their pride to that of their country . It can not be too distinctly stated or too often repeated , that the discontent of South Carolina is not one to be allayed hy any concessions which the Free States can make with dignity or even safety . It is something more radical and of longer standing than distrust of the motives or probable policy of the Republican Party . It is neither more nor less than a disbelief in the very principles on which our government is founded . So long as they practically retained the government of the country , and could use its power and patronage to their own advantage , the plotters were willing to wait* but the moment they lost that control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw that their chance of ever regainin git was hopeless , they declared openly the principles on which they have all along been secretly acting . Denying the constitutionality of special protection to any other species of property or branch of industry , and in 1832 threatening to break up the Union unless their theory of the Constitution in this respect were admitted , they went into the late Presidential contest with a claim for extraordinary protection to a certain kind of property already the only one endowed with special privileges and immunities . Defeated overwhelmingly before the people , they now question the right of the majority to govern , except on their terms , and threaten violence in the hope of extorting from the fears of the Free States what they failed to obtain from their conscience and settled convictions of duty . Their quarrel is not with the Republican Party , but with the theory of Democracy . The South Carolina politicians have hitherto shown themselves adroit managers , shrewd in detecting and profiting by the weaknesses of men ; but their experience has not been of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important part of government which depends for success on common sense and husiness - habits . The members of the South Carolina Convention have probably less knowledge of political economy than any single average Northern merchant whose success depends on an intimate knowledge of the laws of trade and the world-wide contingencies of profit and loss . Such a man would tell them , as the result of invariable experience , that the prosperity of no community was so precarious as that of one whose very existence was dependent on a single agricultural product . What divinity hedges cotton , that competition may not touch it , - that some disease , like that of the potato and the vine , may not bring it to beggary in a single year , and cure the overweening conceit of prosperity with the sharp medicine of Ireland and Madeira ? But these South Carolina economists are better at vaporing than at calculation . They will find to their cost that the flgur*s of statistics have little mercy for the figures of speech , which are so powerful in raising enthusiasm and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , as they must do , sooner or later , is neither agreeable nor nutritious ; hut it is better to do it before there is nothing else left to eat . The secessionists are strong in declamation , but they are weak in the multiplication - table and the ledger . They have no notion of any sort of logical connection between treason and taxes . It is all very fine signing Declarations of Independence , and one may thus become a kind of panicprice hero for a week or two , even rising to the efligial martyrdom of the illustrated press ; but these gentlemen seem to have forgotten , that , if their precious document should lead to anything serious , they have been signing promises to pay for the State of South Carolina to an // 1861.1 E Pluribus Unum. enormous amount . It is probably far short of the truth to say that the taxes of an autonomous palmetto republic would be three times what they are now . To speak of nothing else , there must be a military force kept constantly on foot ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge made by a standing army on the finances of the new empire is likely to be far more serious and damaging than can be compensated by the glory of a great many such " spirited charges " as that by which Colonel Pettigrew and his gallant rifles took Fort Pinckney , with its garrison of one engineer officer and its armament of no guns . Soldiers are the most costly of all toys or tools . The outgo for the army of the Pope , never amounting to ten thousand effective men , in the cheapest country in the world , has been half a million of dollars a month . Under the present system , it needs no argument to show that the Nonslaveholding States , with a free population considerably more than double that of the Slave-holding States , and with much more generally distributed wealth and opportunities of spending , pay far more than the proportion predicable on mere preponderance in nnmbers of the expenses of a government supported mainly by a tariff on importations . And it is not the burden of this difference merely that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as large , probably a larger , army and navy than that of the present Union ; as numerous a diplomatic establishment ; a postal system whose large yearly deficit they must bear themselves ; and they must assume the main charges of the Indian Bureau . If they adopt free trade , they will alienate the Border Slave - States , and even Louisiana ; if a system of customs , they have cut themselves off from the chief consumers of foreign goods . One of the calculations of the Southern conspirators is to ren ( ler the Free States tributary to their new republic , by adopting free trade and smuggling their imported goods across the border . But this is all moonshine ; for , even if smuggling could not be prevented as easi ly as it now is from the British Provinces , how long would it be before the North would adapt its tariff to the new order of things ? And thus thrown back upon direct taxation , how many years would it take to open the eyes of the poorer classes of Secessia to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance has been trifled with by men who cover treasonable designs with a pretence of local patriotism . Neither they nor their misleaders have any true conception of the people of the Free States , of those " white slaves " who in Massachusetts alone have a deposit in the Savings Banks whose yearly interest would pay seven times over the four hundred thousand dollars which South Carolina can not raise . But even if we leave other practical difficulties out of sight , what chance of stability is there for a confederacy whose very foundation is the principle that any member of it may withdraw at the first discontent ? If they could contrive to establish a free-trade treaty with their chief customer , England , would she consent to gratify Louisiana with an exception in favor of sugar ? Some of the leaders of the secession movement have already become aware of this difficulty , and accordingly propose the abolition of all State lines ,  - -  the first step toward a military despotism ; for , if our present system have one advantage greater than another , it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction . Even now the merits of the Napoleonic system are put forward by some of the theorists of Alabama and Mississippi , who doubtless have as good a stomach to be emperors as ever Bottom had to a bottle *f hay , when his head was temporarily transformed to the likeness of theirs ,  --  and who , were they subjects of the government that looks so nice across the Atlantic , would , ere this , have been on their way to Cayenne , a spot where such red - peppery temperaments would find themselves at home . The absurdities with which the telegraphic column of the newspapers has been daily crowded , since the vagaries of // South Carolina finally settled down into unmistakable insanity , would give us but a poor opinion of the general intelligence of the country , did we not know that they were due to the necessities of " Our Own Correspondent . " At one time , it is Fort Sumter that is to be bombarded with floating batteries mounted on rafts behind a rampart of cotton-bales ; at another , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention that the President-elect shall be inaugurated , or Mr. Buchanan declaring that he shall cheerfully assent to it . Indeed and who gave them any choice in the matter ? Yesterday , it was General Scott who would not abandon the flag which he had illustrated with the devotion of a lifetime ; to-day , it is General Harney or Commodore Kearney who has concluded to be true to the country whose livery he has worn and whose bread he has eaten for half a century ; to-morrow , it will be Ensign Stebbins who has been magnanimous enough not to throw up his commission . What are we to make of the extraordinary confusion of ideas which such things indicate ? In what other country would it be considered creditable to an officer that he merely did not turn traitor at the first opportunity ? There can be no doubt of the honor both of the army and navy , and of their loyalty to their country . They will do their duty , if we do ours in saving them a country to which they can be loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of local independence in the management of our affairs , and the Central Government has fortunately had so little occasion for making itself felt at home and in the domestic concerns of the States , that the idea of its relation to us as a power , except for protection from without , has gradually become vague and alien to our ordinary habits of thought . We have so long heard the principle admitted , and seen it acted on with advantage to the general weal , that the people are sovereign in their own affairs , that we must recover our presence of mind before we see the fallacy of the assump tion , that tile people , or a bare majority of them , in a single State , can exercise their right of sovereignty as against the will of the nation legitimately expressed . When such a contingency arises , it is for a moment difficult to get rid of our habitual associations , and to feel that we are not a mere partnership , dissolvable whether by mutual consent or on the demand of one or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never abdicate its right , and can never surrender it while virtue enough is left in the people to make it worth retaining . It would seem to be the will of God that from time to time the manhood of nations , like that of individuals , should be tried by great dangers or by great opportunities . If the manhood be there , it makes the great opportunity out of the great danger ; if it be not there , then the great danger out of the great opportunity . The occasion is offered us now of trying whether a conscious nationality and a timely concentration of the popular will for its maintenance be possible in a democracy , or whether it is only despotisms that are capable of the sudden and selfish energy of protecting themselves from destruction . The Republican Party has thus far borne itself with firmness and moderation , and the great body of the Democratic Party in the Free States is gradually being forced into an alliance with it . Let us not be misled by any sophisms about conciliation and compromise . IDiscontented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open rebels with arms in their hands . If there be any concessmons which justice may demand on the one hand and honor make on the other , let us try if we can adjust them with the Border Slave-States ; but a government has already sinned its own deathwarrant , when it consents to make terms with law-breakers . First reestablish the supremacy of order , and then it will be time to discuss terms ; but do not e*ill it a compromise , when you give up your purse with a pistol at your head . This is no time for sentimnentalisms about the empty chair at the national hearth ; all // 1861 . E Pluribus Unurn. the chairs would be empty s*on enough , if one of the children is to amuse itself with setting the house on fire , whenever it can find a match . Since the election . of Mr. Lincoln , not one of the arguments has lost its force , not a cipher of the statistics has been proved mistaken , on which the judgment of the people was made up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any existing rights of property ; the majority have not assumed to decide upon any question of the righteousness or policy of certain social arrangements existing in any part of the Confederacy they have not undertaken to constitute themselves the conscience of their neighbors ; they have simply endeavored to do their duty to their own posterity , and to protect them from a system which , as ample experience has shown , and that of our present difficulty were enough to show , fosters a sense of irresponsibleness to all obligation in the governing class , and iu the governed an ignorance and a prejudice which may be misled at any moment to the peril of the whole country . But the present question is one altogether transcending all limits of party and all theories of party-policy . It is a question of national existence ; it is a question whether Americans shall govern America , or whether a disappointed clique shall nullify all government now , and reader a stable government difficult hereafter ; it is a question , not whether we shall have civil war under certain contingencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is idle , and worse than idle , to talk about Central Republics that can never be formed . We want neither Central Republics nor Northern Republics , but our own Republic and that of our fathers , destined one day to gather the whole continent under a flag that shall be the most august in the world . 1-laying once known what it was to be members of a grand and peaceful constellation , we shall not believe , without further proof , that the laws of our gravitation are to be abolished , and we flung forth into chaos , a hurlyburly of jostling and splintering stars , whenever Robert Toombs or Robert Rhett , or any other Bob of the secession kite , may give a flirt of sehMmportance . The first and greatest benefit of government is that it keeps the peace , that it insures every man his right , and not only that , but the permanence of it . In order to this , its first requisite is stability ; and this once firmly settled , the greater the extent of conterminous territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inspired by one patriotism , the better . That there should be some diversity of interests is perhaps an advantage , since the necessity of legislating equitably for all gives legislation its needful safeguards of caution and largeness of view . A single empire embracing the whole world , and controlling , without extinguishing , local organizations and nationalities , has been not only the dream of conquerors , but the ideal of speculative philanthropists . Our own dominion is of such extent and power , that it may , so far as this continent is concerned , be looked upon as something like an approach to the realization of such an ideal . But for slavery , it might have succeeded in realizing it ; and in spite of slavery , it may . One language , one law , one citizenship over thousands of miles , and a government on the whole so good that we seem to have forgotten what government means , - these are things not to be spoken of with levity , privileges not to be surrendered without a struggle . And yet while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and servile experience of centuries , are striving toward unity as the blessing above all others desirable , we are to allow a Union , that for almost eighty years has been the source and the safeguard of incalculable advantages , to be shattered by the caprice of a rabble that has outrun the intention of its leaders , while we are making up our minds what coercion means ! Ask the first constable , and he will tell you that it is the force necessary for executing the laWs . To avoid the danger of what men who have seized upon forts , arsenals , and other property of the United States , and continue to // hold them by military force , may choose to call civil war , we are allowing a state of things to gather head which will make real civil war the ' occupation of the whole country for years to come , and establish it as a permanent institution . There is no such antipathy between the North and the South as men ambitious of a consideration in the new republic , which their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , would fain call into existence by asserting that it exists . The misunderstanding and dislike between them is not so great as they were within living men between England and Scotland , as they are now between England and Ireland . There is no difference of race , language , or religion . Yet , after a dissatisfaction of near a century , and two rebellions , there is no part of the British dominion more loyal than Scotland , no British subjects who would be more loath to part with the substantial advantages of their imperial connection than the Scotch ; and even in Ireland , after a longer and more deadly feud , there is no sane man who would consent to see his country irrevocably cut off from power and consideration to obtain an independence which would be nothing hut Donnybrook Fair multiplied hy every city , town , and village in the island . The same considerations of policy and advantage which render the union of Scotland aud Ireland with England a necessity apply with even more force to the several States of our Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen of them break away in a freak of anger or unjust suspicion , or , still worse , from mistaken notions of sectional advantage , would be to fail in our duty to ourselves and our country , would be a fatal blindness to the lessons which immemorial history has been tracing on the earth 's surface , either with the beneficent furrow of the plough , or , when that was unheeded , the fruitless gash of the cannon-ball . When we speak of coerciort , we do not mean violence , hut only the assertion of constituted and acknowledged authority . Even if seceding States could be conquered back again , they would not be worth the conquest . We ask only for the assertion of a principle which shall give the friends of order in the discontented quarters a hope to rally round , and the assurance of the support they have a right to expect . There is probably a majority , and certainly a powerful minority , in the seceding States , who are loyal to the Union ; and these should have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them . It is not to the North or to the Republican Party that the malcontents are called on to submit , but to the laws , and to the benign intentions of the Constitution , as they were understood by its framers . What the country wants is a permanent settlement ; and it has learned , by repeated trial , that compromise is not a cement , but a wedge . The Government did not hesitate to protect the doubtful right of property of a Virginian in Anthony Burns by the exercise of coercion , and the loyalty of Massachusetts was such that her own militia could be used to enforce an obligation abhorrent , and , as there is reason to believe , made purposely abhorrent , to her dearest convictions and most venerable traditions ; and yet the same Government tampers with armed treason , and lets I dare not wait upon I would , when it is a question of protecting the acknowledged property of the Union , and of sustaining , nay , preserving even , a gallant officer whose only fault is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we write , the newspapers bring us the correspondence between Mr. Buchanan and the South Carolina " Commissioners , " and surely never did a government stoop so low as ours has done , not only in consenting to receive these ambassadors from Nowhere , but in suggesting that a soldier deserves courtmartial who has done all he could to maintain himself in a forlorn hope , with rebellion in his front and treachery in his rear . Our Revolutionary heroes had old-fashioned notions about rebels , suitable to the straightforward times in which they lived , - times when blood was as freely shed to secure our national existence as milk-andwater is now to destroy it . Mr. Buchanan // might have profited by the example of men who knew nothing of the modern arts of Constitutional interpretation , but saw clearly the distinction between right and wrong .

While our government , like Giles in the old rhyme , is wondering whether it is a government or not , emissaries of treason are cunningly working upon the fears and passions of the Border States , whose true interests are infinitely more on the side of the Union than of Slavery . They are luring the ambitious with visionary promises of Southern grandeur and prosperity , and deceiving the is , norant into the belief that the principles and practice of the Free States were truly represented by John Brown . All this might have been prevented , had Mr. Buchanan in his Message thought of the interests of his country instead of those of his party . It is not too late to check and neutralize it now . A decisively national and patriotic policy is all that can prevent excited men from involving themselves so deeply that they will find " returning as tedious as go o'er , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Slavery is no longer the matter in debate , and we must beware of being led off upon that side-issue . The matter now in hand is the rei*stablishment of order , the reaffirmation of national unity , and the settling once for all whether there can be such a thing as a government without the right to use its power in self-defence . The Republican Party has done all it could lawfully do in limiting slavery once more to the States in which it exists , and in relieving the Free States from forced complicity with an odious system . They can be patient , as Providence is often patient , till natural causes work that con. viction which conscience has been unable to effect . They believe that the violent abolition of slavery , which would he sure to follow sooner or later the disruption of our Confederacy , would not compensate for the evil that would be entailed upon both races by the abolition of our nationality and the bloody confusion that would follow it . More than this , they believe that there can be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that this government , like all others , , rests upon the everlasting foundations of just Authority , - that that authority , once delegated by the people , becomes a common stock of Power to be wielded for the common protection , and from which no minority or majority of partners can withdraw its contribution under any conditions , - that this Power is what makes us a nation , and implies a corresponding duty of submission , or , if that be refused , then a necessary right of self-vindication . We are citizens , when we make laws ; we become subjects , when we attempt to break them after they are made . Lynch-law may be better than no law in new and half-organized communities , but we can not tolerate its application in the affairs of government . The necessity of suppressing rebellion by force may be a terrible one , but its consequences , whatever they may be , do not weigh a feather in comparison with those that would follow from admitting the principle that there is no social compact binding on any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States Marshal . As we are writing these sentences , the news comes to us that South Carolina has taken the initiative , and chosen the arbitrament of war . She has done it because her position was desperate , and because she hoped thereby to unite the Cotton States by a complicity in blood , as they are already committed by a unanimity in bravado . Major Anderson deserves more than ever the thanks of his country for his wise forbearance . The foxes in Charleston , who have already lost their tails in the trap of Secession , wished to // throw upon him the responsibility of that second blow which begins a quarrel , and the silence of his guns has balked them . Nothing would have pleased them so much as to have one of his thirty-two-pound shot give a taste of real war to the boys who are playing soldier at Morris 's Island . But he has shown the discretion of a brave man . South Carolina will soon learn how much she has undervalued the people of the Free States . Because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has too lightly reckoned on their caution and timidity . She will find , that , though slow to kindle , they are as slow to yield , and that they are willing to risk their lives for the defence of law , though not for the breach of it . They are beginning to question the value of a peace that is forced on them at the point of the bayonet , and is to be obtained only by an abandonment of rights and duties . When we speak of the courage and power of the Free States , we do not wish to be understood as descendi% to the vulgar level of meeting brag with brag . We speak of them only as among the elements to be gravely considered by the fanatics who may render it necessary for those who value the continued existence of this Confederacy as it deserves to be valued to kindle a back-fire , and to use the desperate means which God has put into their hands to be employed in the last extremity of free institutions . And when we use the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying of blood and fire among those whom we still consider our brethren of South Carolina . These civilized communities of ours have interests too serious to be risked on a childish wager of courage ,  --  a quality that can always be bought cheaper than day-labor on a railway-embankment . We wish to see the Government strong enough for the maintenance of law , and for the protection , if need be , of the unfortunate Governor Pickens from the anarchy he has allowed himself to be made a tool of for evoking . Let the power of the Union be used for any other purpose than that of shutting and barring the door against the return of misguided men to their allegiance . At the same time we think legitimate and responsible force prudently exerted safer than the submission , without a struggle , to unlawful and irresponsible violence . Peace is the greatest of blessings , when it is won and kept by manhood and wisdom but it is a blessing that will not long be the housemate of cowardice . It is God alone who is powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws that are strong enough to protect and avenge themselves . Every human government is bound to make its laws so far resemble His , that they shall be uniform , certain , and unquestionable in their operation *nd this it can do only by a timely show of power , and by an appeal to that authority which is of divine right , inasmuch as its office is to maintain that order which is the sin , , le attribute of the Infinite Reason that we can clearly apprehend and of which we have hourly example .
