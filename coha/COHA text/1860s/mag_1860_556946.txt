London : Longman , Brown , &amp; Co. 1858 . WE gladly welcome the treatise of Lord Wrottesley upon Government and Legislation ; for although it professes to be only elementary in its character , it presents many valuable thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention than it is apt to receive , even from those whose business it is to practise it , few of whom , it is to be feared , have any adequate sense of the profound political and economical science requisite to an intelligent discharge of the duties of a legislator . In a chapter upon the studies and qualifications of legislators , the author says that there are no educational institutions in England whose professed object is to prepare the future statesman for the performance of legislative and administrative functions ; that there are no books which can in strictness be said to have been written with a special view to this end ; and that thus the noblest of all branches of knowledge must be picked up at hazard by all who aspire to conversance with it . In his Preface , he expresses the hope that the publication of his work may prove useful , not only in the higher class of schools and in the Universities , but , perhaps , even to those who are looking forward to a seat in either House of Parliament . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance not only to // 161 1860. those who are preparing themselves for the discharge of legislative duties , but to legislators themselves . If any believe that there is little or nothing to learn about the general principles of legislation , or that questions demanding for their solution an accurate knowledge of the leading principles of social and economical science can be discussed with profit in the careless manner in which they are often handled , both in sodiety and in the senate , the perusal of this book may undeceive them . When we seriously reflect on the nature of the functions which a legislator is called upon to perform , it would seem at first sight , that the knowledge necessary to their highest discharge must be almost universal . " On what subject , " asks the writer , " may not the statesman be called upon to speak and legislate ? The disheartening descriptions given by Cicero of the amount of previous study necessary to form an accomplished orator , will apply with equal , if not greater force , to the senator of modem times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how is it to be sought for and acquired ? To these and other similar questions an answer may be expected , but a complete reply to them is perhaps impossible in the present state of our knowledge . " The author proceeds to point out the principal subjects of study which should go to the preparation of men for legislative duties , giving estimates of the merits of different writers upon these subjects , and practical hints as to the actual conduct of legislation . Lord Wrottesley maintains that a thorough knowledge of political science is indispensable , not only to legislators , but to artisans and operatives , and all the vital members of society . The prevalent ignorance of the first principles of this science is one of the chief drawbacks to the advantages derivable from free institutions . Of course , the more liberal the institutions of a country are , the more important it is that a knowledge of their principles should be extended ; for legislation must then conform to public opinion . In England and the United States the influence of the political institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more to consider and discuss questions of legal and political science , and gradually to pre // pare them for the exercise of political power . An enlightened public opinion has by degrees been created , and its influence has become controlling . Sir G. C. Lewis , in the Preface to his " Treatise on the Government of Dependencies , " remarks that the ulterior progress of the chief nations of Europe and America " mainly depends upon the nature of the opiflions prevailing among the bulk of the people ; that where public opinion is unenlightened , no political forms can be an effectual security against unwise and mischievous exercises of the power of government ; and that where the public opinion is enlightened , political forms lose a large portion of their meaning and importance . " Mr. Austin , in his " Province of Jurisprudence , " writes , that " the best moral security for good government , and therefore for national happiness so far as it be dependent thereon , is a wide diffusion of the soundest political science . " Lord Wrottesley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such knowledge , as a means of insuring the gradual destruction of those existing opinions and prejudices which arrest the course of political improvement , and of securing improved legislation in every department . The work of IRichard Jones , the title of which is cited at the head of our article , consists of lectures and tracts on various branches of the science of political economy , although it is chiefly devoted to the discussion of rent , wages , and cognate subjects . As the title indicates , this is not a systematic treatise . Dr. Whewell , in his Prefatory Note , states that Mr. Jones had , to the last , cherished the hope of giving a complete and systematic character to his speculative views of this science , but was prevented by his business engagements , by his habits of social intercourse , and by his impatience of the labor requisite to give literary symmetry to his writings . His writings show that the tendency of his mind was rather to practical ends than to scientific analysis ; and that he possessed eminent administrative abilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructing and carrying out measures for great social improvements . It is evident that his sympathies were with the practical aims of life . In his writings he makes more frequent reference to // facts than to fixed principles for the support of his views . He distinctly avows induction to be the proper method of reasoning in political economy . lie says - " The principles which determine the position and progress , and govern the conduct , of lnrge bodies of the human race , placed under different circumstances , can be learnt only by nn appeal to experience . It would be absurd to suppose that any one , by mere efforts of consciousness , by consulting his own views , feelings , and motives , and the narrow sphere of his own personal observation , and reasoning a priori from them , could anticipate the conduct , progress , and fortunes of large bodies of men , differing from himself in moral or physical temperament , and influenced by differences , varying in extent and variously combined , in climate , soil , religion , education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work is , in our opinion , due to his having assumed that the inductive method is the only one applicable to questions of political economy . When he discusses the practical management of economical affairs , his thoughts are always valuable ; and the papers contained in his volume will prove a valuable contribution to this department of literature . The works which stand at the head of this article suggest an inquiry into the influence of political economy upon the legislation of modern times . It is only about a century since the first principles of political economy were reduced to a body of precepts having anything of a scientific character . At the present day it is ranked as an established science ; but " every one is aware , " says Senior , " that political economy is in a state of imperfect development , I will not say characteristic of infancy , but certainly very far from maturity . " There was . no lack of opinions , however , upon many of its topics , long before there had been any scientific investigation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangely erroneous . Till commerce sprang up , there was little inducement and little opportunity to seek information about the industrial resources of foreign nations , or any of the phenomena of wealth . No inquiry was made by the wisest of the ancients as to the origin and na // ture of wealth . The Greeks , with a broad civilization , and with the highest achievements in some branches of philosophy , do not show the slightest acquaintance with this branch of knowledge , either in their literature or their legislation . The Romans , too , in their prejudice against trade , commerce , and manufactures , display an entire ignorance of its first principles . The political history of antiquity , as well as that of the Middle Age , is mostly a record of wars , conquests , and political changes . Before the sixteenth century there was no legislation worthy of the name which had for its object the promotion of the industrial interests of society . Commerce and manufactures , if they existed at all , were left to take care of themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to affect these interests in any way were quite apt to be in utter violation of the principles which have since been framed into the science of political economy . At the present day , however , this class of subjects occupies a far more prominent place in legislation than is given to anything else ; and the rulers and legislators of enlightened nations no longer make it the chief object of their economical . regulations to raise the largest amount of revenue with the least trouble to themselves , but rather to develop the resources of the state , whose strength and security they regard as contingent upon the prosperity of the people . Since the year 1500 great advances have been made in every branch of mental science ; and this is the era from which many of the physical sciences date their origin . Political economy presupposes much , both in mental and in physical science ; and in the natural order of things we should look for its development late in the progress of knowledge . We accordingly find that it was not till the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distribution of wealth were well enough understood to constitute a science . It is true , that before this period many precepts and rules of practice had been laid down , and political economy may be said to have existed as a rude and unsystematic art . Before this time , too , many writers had treated of various topics within the province of this science . But it was hard for them to break away from the popular prejudices that had // gathered round it , and their opinions were often wrong . Even if authors had been capable of pointing out the prevalent mistakes in theory , or the evils that resulted from vicious laws and customs , it would not always have been safe to do so . But something was effected in this direction . In 1581 , William Stafford dedicated his " Briefe Conceipte of English Pollicie " to Queen Elizabeth . Some sound and intelligent views were hinted at ; and Mr. Buckle pronounces this striking essay to be , on the whole , the most important work on the theory of politics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then that there could be found any one who would declare that " the Queen 's Majesty can not have treasure when her subjects have none . " Although the author recommended free trade in corn , he advocated the prohibition of the exportation of wool and undressed cloth from the kingdom ; and if any of his opinions produced an effect upon the policy of the times , it was probably those which confirmed the old system of restriction . The transporting of wool and sheep out of the kingdom was an offence at common law known by the name of owling . This offence is mentioned in the Vliirror des Justices , and again in a statute of Edward III. ; while a statute enacted in the earlier part of Elizabeth 's reign - " for sundry good causes and considerations moved in the High Court of Parliament " - makes the transportation of live sheep , or the embarking them on board any ship , an offence punishable by forfeiture of goods and imprisonment for a year , and declares that the offender , " at the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fulness of the market , on the market-day , have his left hand cut off , and that to be nailed upon the openest place of such market . " It is instructive to notice that various statutes of the reigns of Charles II . and William III . imposed restrictions on similar exportations , and that these statutes were amended and enforced by several others , the last of which is as late as 19 George II. , while they were not repealed till 5 George IV . About the time that Stafford , in England , was inquiring how the subsidies could be large " when the subjects have little to depart with , " the IDuc de Sully , Minister of Finance under Henry j*T of France , was aware " that , if he made money pass // through the hands of the people , there would necessarily flow into the public treasury a proportionate quantity , which no one would regret . " He was the first statesman in France entitled to the character of a politicals economist , and his measures for arousing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , were attended with remarkable success . The maxim upon which he acted was , that " tillage and pasturage are the nursing mothers of the state . " So efficient was a wise system of encouragement given to one branch of industry , that , while the taxes and duties of the kingdom were greatly reduced , much of the state debt was paid off , provinces alienated by the king 's predecessors repurchased , and the revenue largely increased . But Sully participatcd in the prejudices of the times as to commerce and manufactures , which he greatly discouraged . The king 's favorites were allowed to practise various extortions upon different branches of commerce for their own benefit . Taxes so onerous were levied upon all commodities from the Levant , that France lost the great transit trade to the North of Europe , which had built up the flourishing cities of Marseilles and Lyons . A deputy from Lyons , complaining of this ruinous policy , said : " The city of Lyons , illustrious and flourishing as it has been , is hastening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burdens which nations bear , although they may be heavy , have ever been considered as sanctioned by divine and human law ; but they are intended to serve the same purpose for a state which sails serve for a vessel , namely , to propel it in an onward course , and to keep it upright , not to overload and sink it . " This was well said , but the government took no notice of it . France did not become aware of the injury that had been done till some years afterward , when she found that a commerce had been diverted which no efforts of hers could bring back , and manufactures stopped which it was hard to build up again . In ancient times restraints were often placed upon trade from political considerations , or from a feeling of proud exclusiveness ; but in modern times these restraints have been imposed from a belief that the wealth of the nation would thus be increased . A great number of laws prohibiting or restraining // exportation and importation may be found upon the statute-books of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer than two thousand laws with respect to commerce had been passed in England before 1820 . It was thought that commerce could not flourish without the continual interference of the government . Most of these laws were made under mistaken views of the nature of wealth . Till the time of M. Quesnay , whose views were published about the middle of the eighteenth century , wealth was supposed to consist of gold and silver . Consequently economical legislation had for its object the increase of the amount of the precious metals in the country ; that commerce which brought home gold and silver was encouraged , and that which carried them off was restrained . The labor of the people was interfered with , and directed to particular objects . It was supposed that agricultural products might be made cheaper by prohibiting their exportation , and that manufactures , which might be exported and sold for money , would be thus favored , it was with this view that the duties upon the exportation of corn from England were made so very high as almost to amount to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William III . Under this mistaken theory of the nature of wealth , legislators thought that the interests of their own people were promoted by receiving few commodities from others , and by doing all they could to injure the trade of foreign nations . In 1620 the English House of Commons , in much alarm , passed a resolution , " that the importation of tobacco out of Spain is one reason of the scarcity of money in this kingdom . " A few years after this , it was argued in the same House that the Netherlands were becoming weakened by their trade with the East Indies , because it carried money out of the country . The idea that a nation 's wealth is measured mainly by its stock of the precious metals , is very old . We find Cicero declaring , in his Oration for Flaccus , that the Senate had often determined , and during his consulship it came to a most solemn resolution , that gold ought not to be exported . The statutes of all the commercial nations of Europe show that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth was promoted by the simple expedient of getting all the 15* // gold and silver they could into the country , and keeping it there . This opinion appears in the preamble of a statute passed in England in the time of Richard II. , forbidding the exportation of the precious metals , on pain of forfeiture : " For the great mischief which this realm suffereth , and long hath done , for that gold and silver are carried out of the realm , so that , in effect , there is none thereof left , which thing , if it should longer be suffered , would shortly be the destruction of the same realm , which God prohibit . " Various complicated measures were adopted in order to make the precious metals flow into England , and then to keep them there . To effect these purposes , staple towns and the corporation of the staple were established , so as to bring together the dealings in the chief articles exported from the country , and thus enable the government officers to inspect every bargain in these commodities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullion . When foreign coin was brought into the country , in order to prevent its passing at an unauthorized value , or its going out of the country again , it was provided that it should not be used in England for any other purpose than that of being exchanged for English coin at the king 's mint , or that the king 's exchanger should receive it at his own valuation . It was also provided , that , when foreign merchants imported their cargoes into England , they should not leave the country until they had given satisfactory proof that they had employed all the moneys they had received for their goods in the purchase of English commodities for exportation . The statutes passed to effect this object were called by the old writers Statutes of Employments , the most complete and stringent of which is probably one of 18 Henry VI . " The obliging foreign merchants to reside with official hosts , " says Mr. Jones , " wasan old regulation , which might probably , with some pains , be traced to other countries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object of bitter denunciations for forestalling , and other wicked deeds ; but they were now selected by Henry and his councillors as the fittest instruments for carrying out their object of securing the employment of the moneys received by foreigners in the purchase // of British commodities . " After reciting in the preamble , among other things , that " great damages and losses daily come to the king and to his people , as well by the buyings and sellings that merchants , aliens , and strangers do make at their proper will and liberty , without any notice , governance , and survey of any of the king 's lawful liege people ; " that great treasure by the same aliens is carried out of the realm ; and that the earlier remedies have been found insufficient ; - the statute provides that no alien merchant shall sell merchandise to another alien on pain of forfeiture ; that all alien merchants shall be under the survey of certain persons , to be called hosts or surveyors , to be appointed by the mayors of the several cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert in merchandise , but not of the same trade as the alien under their survey . The hosts are to be privy to all sales and contracts of the aliens , and to see that within eight months they sell their whole cargoes and employ the proceeds in the purchase of English goods ; and the hosts are to keep books , in which they shall register all the contracts , and twice a year deliver a transcript of the books to the Exchequer . For this trouble they are to levy two-pence in the pound on all such contracts . Any alien merchant refusing to submit to these regulations is to be imprisoned till he gives security to comply with them , and to be fined at time king 's will ; and if he make any contract without the privity of his host , he is to forfeit the value of the goods . Spain presents a notable example of the vain attempt to prevent the exportation of the precious metals . When she found herself in possession of the unrivalled opulence which the discovery of the rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to keep it all by shutting up the avenues of trade and retaining her precious metals within the country . Her statesmen , seeing that the exchangeable value of silver in Spain had depreciated , and that it would naturally leave the country in exchange for other articles , labored to check foreign commerce by establishing exorbitant duties upon imports , and by restraining the mercantile enterprise of the people . But they could devise no restraints that would permanently supersede the natural laws , according to which the // prices and amounts of commodities are equalized throughout the commercial world ; and Spain found that she could no more shut up within her borders her great surplus of silver , than she could dam up the flow of her rivers . At the beginning of the seventeenth century , the economical affairs of Europe had come to be of too great importance to escape careful examination . Writers now exposed some of the old errors . Among these writers , Serra is said to have been the first to prove the absurdity of the expedients usually resorted to in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economists seem to have had very little immediate influence upon the policy of the times . The old policy of restriction had been acted upon so long , that men seemed to accept it as something fixed in the order of things ; and even when experience had conclusively shown that it was injurious , there was a long period of vacillation between the old errors that were familiar to the public mind , and the new truths , which seemed incomplete because they were new . It was not till long after the increasing commerce of Europe had practically refuted the ancient prejudices , that the reasonings of economists had any practical weight . The change from the prohibitive system to that which obtained the name of the mercantile , was the result of circumstances rather than of any abstract reasoning . It is not clearly settled where or when the mercantile system had its origin . In England it followed the opening of a direct intercourse with India , and the springing up of a profitable Indian trade . It was found impossible to carry on this trade without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still ruling belief , that the prosperity of the country was measured by the amount of money it could accumulate and retain , men could not hclp seeing that the exportation of money was advantageous in some way or other , they hardly know how . But an explanation was at length found , which was for a long time deemed satisfactory . It was supposed that the advantage arose from the re-exportation of the greater part of the commodities purchased by bullion to other countries , where a greater price was obtained for them than they originally cost . The East-India Company on its first establishment , in 1600 , // obtained leave to export a limited amount of specie ; and finally through its influence the prohibition upon the exportation of specie , which had existed for more than four centuries , was wholly removed by a statute of 15 Charles II. , the preamble of which sets forth the new ideas which now prevailed . " Forasmuch , " says the act , " as several considerable foreign trades can not be conveniently driven without the species of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience that the species of money and bullion are carried in greatest abundance , as to a common market , to such places as give free liberty of exporting the same , and tbe better to keep in and increase the current coins of this kingdom , be it enacted that it shall be lawful to export all sorts of foreign coin and bullion , first entering the same at the custom-house. ** It will be observed that the object of this statute purported to be " the better to keep in and increase the current coins of this kingdom . " Mistaken notions of the true nature of wealth and of the true object of trade still prevailed . But something had been gained . Under the new order of things commerce began to flourish , and a general intercourse to prevail among nations . The mercantile system proposed to do something , too , for the productive industry of the country , instead of checking it , as the old exclusive system had . But , what was of vastly more consequence , men learned that the prosperity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that the general welfare of society may be most materially affected by the social arrangements of the government as to property ; and that legislation upon these subjects is susceptible of great , and perhaps indefinite improvement . It now began to be seen that governments had sadly mistaken the road to wealth . There had been much to account for the ignorance that had existed as to the nature of wealth and the principles which regulate its production and distribution , in the systems of government that had prevailed . Under monarchical forms rulers had often regarded the public revenue as a portion of their private income , and their chief concern had been to collect it with the least trouble to themselves . It was not for the people to inquire how it was obtained or how it was spent ; and they seemed to care little about it , if they were not // called upon to pay direct taxes . This indifference to the financial affairs of the state was sometimes increased by the circumstance , that in certain cases the private estate of the sovereign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent of his subjects . But this state of things for the most part passed away with the feudal system . The people came to understand that they had an interest in the administration of the public revenue ; and the sovereign , too , was made aware that the well-being of the people was deserving of his attentive consideration . All parties were anxious to ascertain the arrangements that would conduce to a greater amount of pros* perity than had already been attained . The possibility of this was seen , and political economy was called upon to point out the mode . Of these M. Quesnay was the first to explain in what wealth consists , and he did much toward establishing some of the other most important principles of the science . It was seen that something certain had been found out . A large band of devoted disciples took up Quesnay 's opinions , and zealously engaged in their promulgation ; and the influence of the system they established was very great , especially upon the policy of France . The Italians regard their own Bandini as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his system . But his object seems to have been rather to influence the conduct of the Grand Duke of Tuscany , than to establish comprehensive principles . He had the good fortune to see his theories embodied in practice , and the most happy results followed from them . Count Pecchio , in his History of Political Economy in Italy , giving an account of these results , observes : " Such were the effects of a good book upon a good prince . " But it was reserved for Adam Smith to take the first important step toward establishing the *cience of political economy . He discovered many of its important principles ; and was the first to arrange these , and many others which previous investigations had traced out , but had left to exist as single truths , into a system having the air of a science . The truths of political economy are to a great extent mutually dependent ; and it is often unsafe to follow out one of them alone to its ultimate results , without considering its relation to others . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the " Wealth of Nations " is quite imperfect , yet it has been the foundation for all subsequent systematic labors . This work is pronounced by Mr. Buckle to be " the most valuable contribution ever made by a single man towards establishing the principles on which government should be based ; " and its influence has been very great throughout the civilized world . Since the time of Adam Smith , political economy is said to have had more writers and students than any other department of research . Among these have been men of the very highest talent and genius , and though they have not perfected the science , they have done much toward settling its general principles and defining its limits . But probably no one has done so much to place political economy in the rank of the pure sciences as Mr. Senior ; and no more essential service was demanded in this branch of knowledge than an elucidation of the science of political economy as distinguished from the art . All the early and most of the later treatises upon political economy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treat it as an art . Very much of the uncertainty and contradiction in which it has been involved is owing to the ignoring of this distinction . Safe conclusions seem impossible , as long as it is unknown whether they are scientific generalizations or merely empirical rules of conduct . The truth is best attained by a purely scientific treatment of the subject , though this is one of the latest stages in the progress of every branch of knowledge . In the work of Mr. Senior , the title of which is given at the head of this article , the distinction between the science and the art of political economy is very clearly drawn . If treated as a science , he defines political economy as " the science which states the laws regulating the production and distribution of wealth , so far as they depend on the action of the human mind . " If treated as an art , he defines it as " the art which points out the institutions and habits most conducive to the production and accumulation of wealth . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political economy , it would be necessary to refer to the labors of many other writers . But our object is only to give such an account of its rise , progress , and condition , as may be necessary // to illustrate our views of its influence upon modern legislation . In connection with this sketch of the science , it is worthy of note that its more important principles are fast becoming matters of popular knowledge . For the last half-century various topics of political economy have been carefully examined in the reviews and freely discussed in the newspapers . Works upon this subject are frequently referred to in our legislatures , and many statesmen are profoundly versed in the science . All who have written and spoken upon it have not pretended to be political economists . But every legislator who has appealed to it for arguments upon the currency , upon the tariff question , or upon the financial policy of the government , has done something toward creating a popular knowledge of its teachings upon these topics ; and every writer who has given his views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though they may have been quite falla*-cious , has done something toward calling attention to questions within the domain of political economy , which very intimately concern the welfare and happiness of all men . And now , when new measures , affecting the commercial , industrial , or financial interests of the state , are proposed for adoption in legislative assemblies , the nature and effect of these measures immediately become subjects of familiar reflection and daily discussion with persons of ordinary intelligence in all parts of the country . It can not but be noticed , that there is a kinship between the prevalence of more correct views of political economy , and the improvements that have taken place in modern times in the laws relating to economical matters . But has science or legislation taken the lead ? Have writers drawn the principles of their science from the practice of legislators , or have legislators based their laws upon principles of abstract science deduced by political economists ? We have seen that legislators were practising political economy as an art long before it existed as a science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were founded upon prejudices rather than reason , upon traditional errors rather than scientific principles . The early writers , too , upon political economy seem often to have been under the control // of the same influences , and in some instances to have adopted the political policy of the times as the basis of their doctrines . But the establishment of the science , and its subsequent improvements , have been the work of philosophy , not of legislative experiments . Political economy belongs to the department of mind , and is a science of reasoning rather than one of observation . It is affirmed by Mr. Senior , " that the facts on which its general principles rest may be stated in a very few sentences , or rather in a very few words , and that the difficulty is merely in reasoning from them . " The science results from the wants and inclinations of man , so far as property and his relations to external things are concerned . There are elements existing at all times and in every place . It is only by deduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the name of political economy is arrived at . Truth is the only direct end of the science . Legislation did not construct the science ; it might have existed before all legislation . The science furnishes economical conclusions ; and it is for legislators and men of business to go to these for information upon economical matters of practice . But practical men have been far enough from using all the assistance they might have derived from this science . They have not always acquainted themselves with the discoveries made in it ; and they have been distrustful of the conclusions of men whom they have sometimes sneeringly denominated theorists . It is true , that in many instances the principles of the science have been adopted by legislators immediately upon their promulgation . Thus , many of the artificial restrictions upon labor and trade in England , to which Adam Smith had called attention as being contrary to sound principles of political economy , were abolished not long afterward . At a later period , the reports of select committees of the British Houses of Parliament upon various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given before them by political economists ; and thereupon principles of the science have been recognized by the public laws , and have become a part of the economical policy of the country . This mode of influencing legislation is illustrated in Lord Overstone 's volume upon the currency , a large portion of this valuable publication being made up of // extracts from evidence given by the author before Parliamentary committees . Instances of this kind of influence upon legislation are also to be met with in other countries . But the far more important influence of the science upon legislation has been silent and gradual . It is difficult to form any correct idea of the extent of this influence . The principles of the science have been stealing into the minds of men so imperceptibly , that , though many of them which a century ago were unknown have now become simple truths , familiar to all men , no one can tell when they became predominant . Change must necessarily follow the diffusion of knowledge ; and as the knowledge of political economy has become more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its principles have been working their way into the legislation of all civilized communities ; so that their policy in economical affairs has been greafly amended , and vast improvements are still going on . But with all the great improvements that nations have recently made in their economical policy , ha* the influence of political economy , whatever may have been the manner of its operation , kept pace with the progress of the science itself ? It is an old remark , that " nations are slow and ieluctant learners . " The consequences of legislative changes are so momentous and uncertain , that some statesmen are for this reason slow to embody into law opinions of which their reason is convinced . It is necessary that time should familiarize new opinions to the minds of such men , before they can feel sufficient confidence in their truth to adopt them as the basis of legislative action . Great caution ought always to be exercised against applying unsettled principles to the actual affairs of nations . The welfare of a whole people is too great a thing to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , their practical adoption should not be precipitate . But other causes than a sense of responsibility and a conservative prudence have more frequently delayed or prevented the abandonment of errors in legislation for more enlightened views . Political economy has encountered its full share of such difficulties as beset all political progress . // It has had to work its way against the ignorance , pride , and self-confidence of statesmen and rulers . It is well known that Napoleon Bonaparte regarded the science as a pretentious and artificial philosophy ; and it was a saying of his , that " if an empire were made of adamant , the economists could grind it to powder . " Political economy has had to contend , too , against popular prejudices and superstitions . Changes in the economical policy of states are especially apt to excite the fears of those who do not understand the principles upon which they are based , because they so dirqctly concern their pecuniary interests . When the excellent new Poor Law of England was proposed , " it was greeted with the curses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out lovingly and willingly to the very letter , but are too ready to resist any improvement or relaxation in it which may be proposed by that very Poor-Law Board from which it emanated . " Many instances might be mentioned in Which the fears of the ignorant and prejudiced have long prevailed against the adoption of measures based upon sound principles of political economy . The presumption in favor of the existing state of things is very strong with some minds . And then there is a certain inconvenience attendant upon the introduction of legislative changes , even if they are unquestionably right . " The disposition is too prevalent , " says Lord Overstone , " to compromise or to suspend principles altogether , when the immediate consequence to which they lead involves temporary inconvenience or partial suffering ; and if at such a moment the wavering are reminded of the principles which they have acknowledged , and are called upon to maintain their consistency , the response is not unmixed with a half-suppressed but angry murmur against the narrow-minded or the hard-hearted theorist . " Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among statesmen , has been the aversion which they have entertained against it because it is abstract and theoretical . There is too often a misunderstanding between practical men and theorists . Their aims are different , and their modes of thought different ; and they // sometimes forget that they are laboring for different objects . Political economists should have no other direct end . in their labors than to ascertain the truth , and to point out the consequences of economical principles . It is for legislators and statesmen to apply these conclusions to the affairs of nations , so as to promote their highest interests in general . In many cases the correctness of a principle is only a secondary motive for its direct adoption . There may be numberless other considerations , moral and political , to which thought must be given in obtaining the solution of the problem how to produce the greatest amount of permanent good . With these considerations political economists have nothing to do ; although they have often encroached upon the exclusive domain of statesmanship by discussing questions of a purely political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty or expediency , - to enjoin precepts , or recommend maxims of conduct . Men of science are for the most part wanting in the practical knowledge requisite to a wise application of their doctrines to the actual conduct of affairs . They have often betrayed their ignorance by advocating a naked application of general principles of science , without taking intd account other facts and considerations touching the public welfare . In this way they have appeared to jealous statesmen and a prejudiced public as " theoretical innovators in state matters ; " and practical men have thus been deterred sometimes from going to political economy for guidance in the affairs of nations . The cultivators of this science have sometimes brought discredit upon it by framing theories according to the anomalous and peculiar circumstances of a particular country , and promulgating them as of universal application . Of this description are the theories of Malthus on population , and Ricardo on rent . There are instances , too , of theories which have proved false after they had been received with general assent . But not unfrequently have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wrong application of them by legislators themselves . Such principles have sometimes been crudely and hastily embodied into legislation , before the elements involved in them were duly compared with the wants // of the actual case . " Political economy , " says Mr. Samuel Laing , " is not a universal science , of which the principles are applicable to all men under all circumstances , and equally good and true for all nations . " Its principles must be submitted to different modifications in almost every particular application of them . And then it is exceedingly difficult to estimate the disturbances that may come into the working of each separate principle . Measures provided with reference only to the ordinary course of events may not suffice to meet an unanticipated crisis . In such cases political economy has often been held accountable for failures which resulted wholly from the want of caution , practical skill , or knowledge of facts on the part of those who applied it . It has sometimes been the case , too , that political writers have incorrectly deduced maxims of conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been censured for them . In this way fear and distrust of the abstract propositions of political economy have been created in the minds of practical politicians . Another cause of distrust exists in the newness and imperfection of the science of political economy . Many of its first laws have without doubt been discovered , and some of these hare obtained universal recognition . But there is no general agreement as to others , and it will not be denied that there is still munch to be established and defined . This newness of the science , with the mistakes of its cultivators , and the mistakes of legislators , has made it easy to represent it as wanting in exactness and certainty ; and as needing more facts and more experience to support its principles before they become firm enough to be securely built upon . But in fact the settled principles of political economy are as demonstrable as any moral truths can be , and experiment can add nothing to their certainty . The circumstance that political economy relates directly to the interests of men , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in its influence upon legislation . Archbishop Whately has remarked , that the demonstrations of Euclid would not have commanded universal assent , if they had been applicable to the pursuits and fortunes of individuals . When changes in the economical laws of states have 16* // been proposed , there has been the easiest scope for the working of prejudice and short-sighted interest . The difficulty that political economy has had in gaining an influence over the policy of nations would be illustrated by a history of the course of legislation upon any one of the various subjects within its domain ; while such a history would be emphatically one of progress , - of the abandonment of ancient errors , and of a laborious onward movement through much complication and difficulty to ever more enlightened views . But the point of particular significance which would be brought out by such a survey would be the fact that legislation has gradually come to recognize as its basis , in a large degree , economical principles which have been arrived at by processes of reasoning and logical deduction . Theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their acceptance completed by the practical realization of their benefits . With every advance which has been made in the science of political economy , a corresponding movement sooner or later is seen to ensue in legislation . Meanwhile , in the whole history of modern legislation , there is no truth which can be read in clearer characters than that progress is made exactly in proportion as a knowledge of the truths of political science is generally diffused . Under all free and liberal governments , it is every day becoming more and more apparent that all political improvements come from the people . In all representative governments , whatever the people generally believe to be true and expedient in politics will find its way sooner or later into legislative halls , and be placed upon the statute-book . Especially in England and the United States , when old systems are to be set aside , or new systems to be instituted , it is necessary to appeal to the great public ; and before any important alteration can be made , or at least made permanent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an age when intelligent men take an interest in the laws and institutions under which they live , and are aware how materially their welfare is affected by them . They much desire to know what possibility there is for the attainment of a greater amount of prosperity , and to learn the mode of such attainment . It is the glory of the present age , that the num // ber who are able to understand the principles on which their welfare rests is large , and is constantly becoming larger . Political economy has never been a popular science , but some of its general principles are fast becoming matters of common knowledge . When original writers upon the science now expound their principles , it is not the thinking few only whom they may hope to reach . Besides those who will study their works , there is a great public capable of an intellectual influence through the agency of the more learne&amp; , and by means of the press , which diffuses knowledge among all classes of society . Public opinion is thus instructed ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of the people , and gradually convince them ; and perhaps even the reasons of these truths are disseminated . But where the discoveries of the science are not generally understood , there is a popular respect for knowledge and science which gives weight to the authority of learned and scientific men . In our own country , the members of our Stats Legislatures are especially of the 9 people , and unless the people are made familiar with scientific principles , or have confidence in the teachings of science , there is little hope of their being adopted into legislation . Our legislators are the exponents of the public opinion of the State in political matters , and public opinion must be the source of our social progress . Nowhere is this moral power greater , and nowhere has it accomplished greater things in the way of political improvement . It is doubtless true , that the science of political economy has for the last century had a greater influence over the legislation of England and of the United States , than over that of other countries . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries there is a higher standard of intelligence among the middle ranks of society , and that these have had a far greater power in the government of these countries than elsewhere . This element , so essential to peaceable progression , has not its freest scope anywhere else . Under governments less liberal , even if accnrate political knowledge were as generally diffused , its influence upon legislation would be slower and much less certain . It is often very long aftersound political views have been promulgated , in the most enlightened community , and // under the most liberal form of government , before they convince the nation and find their way into its legislation . But when the truth has a chance to work in this way , it will always prevail sooner or later . Under arbitrary governments the pressure from the people must be very great before legislation gives way to it . It is true that there has been a great change in the character of such governments within a few years . The welfare of the whole people has come to be recognized as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great influence upon their economical policy , and their rulers have been more willing to listen to the teachings of science . But the surest means of influence which political economy can have , is a free and enlightened public . It is a fact of history , that political improvements usually come from the people rather than from their rulers . This fact , together with the agency of popular knowledge in producing changes , is very forcibly illustrated by Mr. Buckle , in his " History of Civilization in England . " The commercial reforms of that country have certainly been wrought through the people . The repeal of the Corn Laws did not come from the ministry , but from the people , who had been convinced of the desirableness of the change through the reasonings of political economists . Legislative reforms and improvements become inevitable when the mass of the population have ascertained what is correct , and have patiently waited a while for the operation of the great moral power of disseminated truth . It can not but be noticed that the principal improvement which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has consisted in undoing earlier legislation . We have already noticed some of the restrictions that were formerly placed upon trade , under the mistaken belief that the national industry would thereby be *beneflted . There were heavy duties upon exportations , and heavy duties upon importations ; while foreign trade in many articles was wholly prohibited . The exchange of commodities was so hampered with numberless restrictions , that it has recently been declared by a French writer of great authority on the history of political economy , that , had it not been for smuggling , commerce must have perished . Besides the more strictly commercial restrictions , there // were oppressive laws of apprenticeship , laws to regulate wages and prices , and laws to regulate profits and expenses . Legislatures had marked out for the people the particular branches of industry which they might pursue , the way in which they might exercise them , and the extent to which they might carry them . It has been the merit of modern legislation to remove many of these unnatural impediments , and to leave society free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faire principle has been a ruling one of modern economical progress . Under its influence many useless and mischievous laws , which had long encumbered our statute-books , have been passing away one after the other . But although the principle is a wise one , and has accomplished much good , it . should be kept in mind , that , like all other principles of politi. cal economy , it is not directly applicable in all countries and under all circumstances . Till a very recent day , the prosperity of one country has generally been thought to be inconsistent with the prosperity of its neighbors . Each country did what it could to injure the commerce and depress the industry of every other . This mistaken view of national policy has been conspicuous among the causes of war during the last two or three centuries ; and it was a mistake , not only of jealous rulers , but even of pliilosophers . " Such is the condition of humanity , " says Voltaire , " that to wish the greatness of one 's own country , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that one country can not gain except another loses . " The Earl of Shaftesbury , while Lord Chancellor of England , declared that the time had come when the English must go to war with the Dutch ; for that it was " impossible both should stand upon a balance , and that , if we do not master their trade , they will ours . They or we must truckle . One must and will give the law to the other . There is no compounding where the contest is for the trade of the whole world . " Ideas of this kind were founded upon ignorance of the true nature of trade . It is the science of political economy which has shown that man 's relation to man rests upon no such ruinous basis ; but that every nation has an interest in the prosperity of its neighbors ; and that a calamity to one member of the great family of nations is a // calamity to all . This felicitous doctrine is beginning to be reduced to practical realization in the intercourse of nations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and human progress has great hope in it for the future . Enough has already been said to show that the legislation of modern times is largely indebted to the science of political economy for its improvement . The science itself is daily assuming a more definite form , and daily gaining increased respect from practical men . Economical legislation has now a surer ground than mere opinion to rest upon ; and we may hope that it will cease making vast and uncertain experiments with the welfare of nations , and will seek a solution of its great problems by means of the fixed principles of political economy . It is certainly incumbent upon legislators vigilantly to learn its truths , to watch its development , and to note all the changes which time produces in it ; and then to see that the art which they practise keeps pace with the science which is its chief aid . But the condition of the greatest influence of political economy upon legislation is popular knowledge ; and in the genera'l diffusion of knowledge and the enlightened spirit of the age it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
