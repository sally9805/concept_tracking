txt THE ISLE OF SPRINGS . CHAPTER III . THE COUNTRY . AFTER having been detained in town several days longer than I had rcckoned on , by heavy rains , which ran through the streets in rivers , and filled the bed of Sandy Gully , through which we must pass , with a rushing torrent of irresistible strength , a small party of us left Kingston one morning for the mountains of St. An*drew and Metcalfe , among which lie the stations of the American missionaries whom we had come to join . We were mounted on the small horses of the country , whose first appearance excited some doubts in the mind of a friend whether he was to carry the horse or the horse him . However , they are not quite ponies , and // their blood is more noble than their size , being a good deal of it Arab . They are decidedly preferable for mountain travel to larger animals . We directed our course over the hot plains towards the mountains which rose invitingly before us , ready to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we passed first through sandy lanes bordered by cactus hedges , rising in columnar rows , and then came out upon the excellent macadamized road over which thirteen of the sixteen miles of our journey lay . As we went along we met a continual succession of groups of the country people , mostly women and children , coming into Kingston with their weekly load of provisions to sell . They eyed us with expressions varying from good-natured cordiality to sullenness , and occasionally we heard a rude remark at the expense of the Buckras ; ' but for the most part their demeanor was civil and pleasant . Most of them had the headloads without which a negro woman seems hardly complete in the road , varying in dimensions from a huge basket of yams or bananas to an ounce vial . How such a slight thing manages to keep its perpendicular with their careless , swinging gait , is something marvellous , but they manage it to perfection . Almost every group , in addition , had a wellladen donkey-comical little creatures , looking hardly bigger under their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , with a speed that betokened a wholesome remembrance of a good many hard thrashings in the past and a reasonable dread of similar ones in the future . If I held the doctrine of transmigration , I should be firmly persuaded that the souls of parish beadles , drunken captains , and other petty tyrants , shifted quarters into the bodies of Jamaica negroes ' donkeys . One patriotic black woman , whose donkey was rather refractory , relieved her mind by exclaiming , in a tone of infinite disgust , 0-h-h you Rio-shan ! ' accompanying her objurga tion by several emphatic demonstrations on his hide of how she was disposed to treat a Rooshan ' at that present moment. * Going on , we passed several beautiful pens , ' as farms devoted to grazing are called . These near town are little more than mere pieces of land surrounding elegant villas , the residence of wealthy gentlemen whose business lies in Kingston . Here you see the one-storied house of the tropics , with its green jalousies and deep veranda , ' surrounded by handsomely kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large a part of the island with its golden green , and enclosed by wire fences or by the intricate but delicate logwood hedges , or else by stone walls . On either side of the carriage road which swept round before the most elegant of these villas , that of Mr. Porteous , we noticed rows of the mystic century plant . At last we left the comparatively arid plain , with its scantier vegetation , and began to ascend Stony Hill , which is 1,360 feet high where the road passes over it . The cool air passing through the gap , and our increasing elevation , now began to temper the heat , and soon the clouds began to gather again , and a slight rain fell . But I did not notice it , for every step of the journey now seemed to bring me farther into the heart of fairyland . It was not any variety of colors , but the unutterable depth of green , enclosing us , as we ascended , more and more completely in its boundless exuberance . From that moment the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor . Reaching the top of the hill , we saw above us the higher range , looking down on us through the shifting mists , with that inexpressible gracefulness which tempers the grandeur of tropical mountains . We descended the hill on the other side into a small inland valley , containing the two estates of Golden * This was during the crimean war . V // spring and Temple HalL The former , which presented nothing very noticeable then , has since passed under the management of a gentleman who to a judicious and energetic personal oversight has added a kindliness and strict honesty in his dealings with the labor*rs much more desirable than frequent in the island . As a result of this , Golden Spring has become a garden . A great many more dilapidated estates would become gardens under the same efficacious mode of treatment . The streams were so swollen by the rain that on coming to what is commonly a trifling rivulet , we found it so high as to cost us some trouble to cross . However , we all got over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the current and carried down several rods almost into the river , which was rushing by in a turbid torrent . I ought to have been much alarmed , but having a happy way , in new circumstances , of taking it for granted that everything which happens is just what ought to happen then and there , I stood composedly on the farther bank , nothing doubting that the hoy and the beast had their own good reasons for striking out a new track , and it was not till they were both safe on land that I learned with sov* consternation that they had come within an inch of being drowned . At length we turned aside into a byroad leading up a steep hill , slippery with mud , and left this pleasant valley . I passed through it many a time afterwards , and never lost the impression of its peaceful richness . We now found ourselves in the wild country in which our missionary stations lie . Hills rose around on every side ; their surfaces broken and furrowed into every fantastic variety of shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain streams to flow . In our latitude such a country would be much of the time a bleak desolation . But here the mantle of glorious and everlasting green softens 435 and enriches the broken and fluctuating surfaces into luxuriant and cloying beauty . In such an ocean of verdure we now found ourselves , its emerald waves rolling above , below , and around us . Our road , when once we had surmounted the short hill , was a narrow , winding bridle path , which kept along almost upon a level over a continual succession of natural causeways , spanning the gullies with such an appearance of art as I have never seen elsewhere . I afterward learned that these are dikes of trap , from which the softer rock has been gradually disintegrated , leaving them thus happily arranged for human convenience . After three miles ' travel over these roads of nature 's making , in a rain which at last became quite uncomfortable , we came finally to Oberlin Mission House . A West Indian country house , without fire or carpets , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wet day , and Oberlin House appeared rather cheerless as we alighted with streaming garments , the romance pretty well soaked out of us for the time . But after supper and a change of clothes , and the clearing away of the clouds , our dismal spirits cleared up too , and we went out into the garden to enjoy the rare flowers and plantsthe crimson-leaved ponsetto , the Bleeding Heart , with its ensanguined centre , the curiously pied and twisted Croton Pictum , the Plumbago , well named from the leaden hue of its flowers , the long , deep-red leaves of the Dragon 's Blood , the purple magnificence of the Passion flower , relieved by the more familiar beauty of the Four o'clock and of the Martinique rose . Seeing something that pleased me , I stepped forward to view it more narrowly , when a sudden access of acute pain in one foot , quickly spreading to the knee , admonished me that I had got into mischief in the shape of an ant 's nest , and gave me the first instalment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the beauties of Jamaica are to be // enjoyed with a very cautious regard to the paramount rights of the insect creation . When I went to bed , I found the bedclothes saturated with dampness . But I learned that it was like a Newport fog , too saline to be mischievous . The atmosphere of the island , even in the brightest and most elastic weather , is so impregnated with moisture , that a Leyden jar will lose its charge in being taken across the room , and an electrical machine will not work without a pan of coals under the cylinder . But as no part of the island is more than twenty-five miles from the sea , this continual moisture appears to be quite innocuous , its worst effect being the musty smell which it causes in everything in the mountains , where there is the most rain . Use fortunately takes from us the perception of this , or it would be quite intolerable . Perpetual summer , and the utmost glory of earth , sky , and sea , are not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful about the desirableness of the exchange . And so ended my first day in the country . CHAPTER Iv . GEOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF THE ISLAND . I had intended writing some of my first impressions about Jamaica , particularly its negro population . But I find , on reviewing my residence of five years and a half in the tranquil island , that first impressions melt so imperceptibly into final conclusions , that it appears best not to attempt a too formal separation of them . Before recounting the results of my own experience , however , in any form , it will not be amiss to attempt some general description of the island and of its population , and to give a slight sketch of its history . The parallel of 180 . N. lat. passes through the island of Jamaica , which has thus a true tropical climate . It is 160 miles in length and 40 in average breadth , having thus a plane area of 6,400 square miles , being about equal to the united area of Connecticut and Rhode Island . Although the third in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great remove after Hayti , the second , being not more than one-fourth as large . Nor does it compare in fertility with either ilayti or Cuba . The former island is the centre of geological upheaval , and the great rounded masses , sustaining a soil of inexhaustible depth , run off from thence splintering into sharp ridges , which in Jamaica become veritable knife edges , sustaining a soil comparatively thin . The character of the island is that of a mountain mass , which , as the ancient watermark on the northern coast shows , has at some remote period been tilted over , and has shot out an immense ' amount of detritus on its southern side , forming thus the plains which extend along a good part of that coast , varying in breadth from ten to twenty miles , besides the alluvial peninsula of Vere . In the interior , also , there is an upland basin of considerable extent , looking like the dry bed of a former lake , which now forms the chief part of the parish of St. Thomas-in-the-Yale . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running in various ranges through its whole length , culminates in the eastern part of it in the Blue Mountains , whose principal summit , the Blue Mountain Peak , is 7,500 feet high . It is said that Columbus , wishing to give Queen Isabella an impression of the appearance of these , took a sheet of tissue paper , and crumpling it up in his hand , threw it on a table , cx claiming , There ! such is their appearance . ' The device used by the great discoverer to convey to the mind of the royal Mother of America some image of her new-found realms , forcibly recurs to the mind of the traveller as he sails along the southeastern coast , and notices the strange contortions of the mountain surfaces . But seen from the northern shore , at a greater distance , through the purple haze which envel // ops them , their outlines leave a different impression . I shall always remember their aspect of graceful sublimity , as seen from Golden Yale , in Portland , and of massive sweetness , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George . The gray buttresses of their farthest western peak , itself over 5,000 fees in height , rose in full view of a station where I long resided , and the *egion covered by their lower spurs , ranging in elevation from seven to ten and twelve hundred feet , is that which especially deserves the name of the well-watered land , * or , as it is poetically rendered , the isle of springs , ' of which Jamaica , or perhaps more exactly Xaymaca , is the Indian equivalent . There you meet in most abundance with those crystal rivulets , every few liundred yards threading the road , and going to swell the wider streams which every mile or two cross the traveller 's way , laying his horse 's sides with refreshing coolness , as they hurry on in their tortuous course from the mountain heights to the sea . Farther west the mountains and hills assume gentler and more rounded forms , particularly in the parish of St. Anne , the Garden of Jamaica . I regret that I know only by report the scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principally devoted to grazing , and its past*ures are maintained in a park-like perfection . Grassy eminences , crowned with woods , and covered with herds of horses and the handsome Jamaica cattle , descend , in successive undulations , to the sea . Over these from the deck of a vessel a few miles out , may be seen falling the silver threads of many cascades . Excellent roads traverse the parish , which is inhabited by a gentry in easy circumstances , and by a contented and thriving yeomanry . St. Anne appears to be truly a Christian Arcadia . In respect of climate and vegetation , there are three Jamaicas-Jamaica of the plains , Jamaica of the uplands , and Jamaica of the high mountains . The highest summit of the mountain region is below the line at which snow is ever formed in this latitude , and it is disputed whether an evanescent hoarfrost even is sometimes seen upon it . As high as four and five thousand feet there are residences , which , however , purchase freedom from the lowland heats at the expense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fogs . Here the properly tropical productions cease to thrive , and melancholy caricatures of northern vegetables and fruits take their place . You see in the Kingston market diminutive and watery potatoes and apples , that have come down from the clouds , and on St. Catherine 's Peak I once picked a few strawberries , which had about as much savor as so many chips . The noble forest trees of the lower mountains , as you go up , give way to an exuberant but spongy growth of tree-ferns and bushes . Great herds of wild swine , descended from those introduced by the Spaniards , roam these secluded thickets , and once furnished subsistence to the runaway negroes who , under the name of Maroons , for several generations annoyed and terrified the island . In these high mountains the sense of deep solitude is at once heightened and softened by the flute-like notes of the solitaire . I shall never forget the impression produced by first hearing this . It was on the top of St. Catherine 's Peak , fifty-two hundred feet above the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed most profound , that my companion and I heard from the adjacent woods its mysterious note . It was a soft and clear tone , somewhat prolonged , and ending in a modulation which imparted to it an indescribable effect , as if of supernal melancholy . It seemed almost as if some mild angel were lingering pensively upon the mountain tops , before pursuing his downward flight among the unhappy sons of men . The uplands of the island , from 800 to 1,500 feet above the sea , are a cheerful , // sunny region , in which the tropical heat is tempered by almost constant refreshing breezes , and , in the eastern part at least , by abundant showers . Some of the western parishes not unfrequently suffer terribly from drought . There are two or three which have not even a spring , depending wholly upon rain water collected in tanks . These sometimes become dry , causing unutterable distress both to man and beast . We hear even sometimes of poor people starving during these seasons of drought . But our more favored region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors seldom permitted us even to fear it , and were more apt to send us a deluge than a drought . In the uplands our winter temperature was commonly about 750 in the shade at noon , and the summer temperature about ten degrees higher . The nights are aLmost always agreeably cool , and frequent showers and breezes allay the sultriness of the days . I never saw the thermometer above 9O* in the shade , and seldom below 65g . It once fell to 54O* to the lamentable discomfort of our feelings and fingers . Of course , where the sun for months is nearly vertical , and twice in the summer actually so , the heat of his direct beams is intense . But those careful precautions of avoiding travelling in the middle of the day , on which some lay such stress , we never concerned ourselves with in Jamaica , and I could not discover that we were ever the worse for it . An umbrella was enough to stand between us and mischief . On the whole , it may safely be said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Eden than that of the highland region of Jamaica during a large part of the year . It is true that after a while northern constitutions begin to miss the stimulus of occasional cold . But for a few years nothing could be more delightful . The chief drawback is that at uncertain cycles there come incessant deluges of rain for months together , making it dreary and uncomfortable both in doors and out . Years will sometimes pass before there is any excessive amount of these , and then sometimes for years together they will prevail to a most disagreeable extent . They break up the mountain roads and swell the mountain streams to such a degree as to render travelling almost impossible , and in a country where your friends are few , you do not like to be kept back from seeing them by the imminent risk of finding no road at all on the side of a hill where at best there is barely room enough between the bank and the gully for one horse to pass another , or of finding yourself between two turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible for you to get either forward or back . But during my residence I had just enough of these adventures to give a pleasant zest to life . And after a tremendous rain of hours , when the sun reappeared , and the banks of fleecy cloud were once more seen floating tranquilly in heaven , and the streams ran again crystal clear , and the hills smiled again in all the glory of their brilliant green , and the air had again its wonted temper , at once balmy and elastic , it was enough to make amends for all previoi*s discomfort . Although no part of the island is peculiarly favorable to constitutions of the European race , yet with prudence and temperance foreigners find this midland region reasonably healthy . The missionaries , who have mostly resided in the uplands , have but seldom fallen victims to fevers . Foreigners must not expect to live here without occasional attacks of fever ; but with care , there need be little apprehension of a fatal result , except to those of a sanguine temperament or of a corpulent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consumption may well be thought to compensate the somewhat greater risks from fever . Even on the plains , that // immense mortality of whites from the mother country which once gave to Jamaica the ominous name of The Grave of Europeans , ' was caused as much by their reckless intemperance as by any necessity of the climate . Or , rather , habits which in Great Britain might have been indulged in with comparative impunity , in Jamaica were rapidly fatal . It is said that another cause of the excessive mortality among the overseers was that they were often secretly poisoned by the blacks . On some plantations , I have heard it said , overseer after overseer was poisoned off , almost as soon as he arrived . In most cases , I dare say , it would be found that over-liberal potations of Jamaica rum were the poison that did the mischief . But the reports have probably some foundation in truth . An oppressed race , seldom daring to strike openly , woufd be very apt to devise subtle ways of vengeance . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our own Southern newspapers used to be accounts of attempts made by slave girls to poison their masters ' families . Arsenic , which they commonly used , is a clumsy means , almost sure to be detected ; but in the West Indies , where the proportion of native Africans was always very large , the African sorcerers , the dreaded Obimen , who exercise so baleful a power over the imaginations of the blacks , appear also to have availed themselves of other than imaginary charms to keep up theis credit as the disposers of life and death , and to have often gained such a knowledge of slow vegetable poisons as made them formidable helpers of revenge , whether against their own race or against the race of their oppressors . In a recent Jamaica story of Captain Mayne Reid 's , the plot centres in the hideous figure of an old Obiman , who wreaks his revenge for former wrongs in this secret way , destroying victim after victim from among the lords of the soiL The piece is stocked with horrors enough for the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so true to the conditions of life in the old days of Jamaica , that it is well worth reading for a lively sense of the time when the fearful influences of savage heathenism , slavery , and tropical passion were working together in that land of rarest beauty and of foulest sin . Evil enough remains , but , thank God , the hideous shadows of the past have fled away forever . l3ut these tragical remembrances and suspicions belong rather to the plains , into which we are about to descend . Here we feel distinctly that we are in the tropics . The sweltering heat , tempered , indeed , by the land and sea breezes , but still sufficiently oppressive , and almost the same day and night , leaves no doubt of this fact . Yegetation , too , appears more distinctly tropical . The character of the landscape in the two regions is quite different . In the uplands the wealth of glowing green swallows up peculiarities of form , and presents little difference of color except the endless diversity of its own shades . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape . Conspicuous on every hillside are the groves where the mango apples grow , ' their mass of dense rounded foliage looking not unlike our maples , and giving a pleasant sense of home to the northern sQjourner . The feathery bamboo , most gigantic of grasses , runs in plumy lines across the country . Around the negro cottages , here and there , rise groups of the cocoanut palms , giving , more than anything else , a tropical character to the landscape . On a distant eminence may perhaps be seen a lofty ceiba or cotton tree , its white trunk rising sixty or seventy feet from the ground without a limb , and then putting out huge , scraggy arms , loaded with parasites . Every lesser feature is swamped in verdure , except that here and there the whitewashed walls of a negro cottage of the better sort gleam pleasantly forth from // embowering hedgos and fruit trees . I do not know how Wordsworth 's advice to make country houses as much as possible of the color of the surrounding country may apply among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills of Jamaica , the white which he deprecates forms a welcome relief to the splendid monotony of glowing emerald . It is not amiss to call it emerald , for there are so many plants here with glossy leaves , that under the brilliant sunlight the lustre of the green is almost more than the eye can bear : To the southward of Oberlin station , formerly belonging to our mission , rises a range of verdant hills , which in some lights has so much the pure , continuous color of a gem , as almost to realize Arabian fables to the eye . Indeed , I have gazed at it sometimes with such a feeling as Aladdin had when the magician had left him confined in the Hall of Jewels , and have almost wished for an earthquake to cleave its oppressive superbness and give a refreshing sight of the blue sea beyond . But on descending to the plains , where there is less moisture , and where vegetation therefore is scantier , we find the unwonted forms of growth more distinct , and have the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorn palms , the cactus hedges , the penguin fences , resembling huge pineapple plants , and various trees and shrubs , being seen more isolated , make a stronger impression of the peculiarities of tropical forms . Here too we meet in greater abundance with the cocoanut tree , occasionally forming long avenues of lofty palms on the estates . And here we see more frequently the huge squares of many acres , heavy with the luxuriant wealth of the cane , and thronged by dusky laborers . The heat , which in the uplands is pleasant , though rather too steady in the plains , becomes oppressive and enervating . The distinction between the wet and dry seasons , also , is much more distinctly marked , and , in short , everything cor responds more fully with the usual idea of a tropical land . The luxuriance and the glory of nature are the same now as ever ; but everywhere over the island the traveller sees the melancholy evidences of the decay of former wealth . You may travel over miles and miles on the plains once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uplands once covered with the dark-green coffee plantations , which now are almost a wilderness . To quote the language of another , ridges , overgrown with guava bushes , mark the cornfields ; rank vegetation fills the courtyard , and even bursts through the once hospitable roof . A curse seems to have fallen upon the land , as if this generation were atoning for the sins of the past . For while we lament the ruin of the present proprietors , we can not forget the unrequited toil which in times gone by created the wealth they have lost ; nor that hapless race , the original owners of the soil , whose fate darkens the saddest page in history . ' A passing traveller will see little to compenshte the sadness occasioned by old magnificence thus in ruins , strewing the whole island with its melancholy wrecks . What there is to set off against it , we shall consider hereafter . What survives of the agriculture and commerce of Jamaica is still , as formerly , mainly dependent on the two great staples , sugar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and valleys , the latter in the uplads and mountains . There was , it is said , an indigenous sugar cane in the West Indies , when first discovered ; but if so , it has long been supplanted by the Mauritius cane , which is now cultivated . The joints of the cane , being cut and laid horizontally in furrows , which are then covered over , spring up in a crop which comes to maturity in about a year ; and when this is cut , the roots rattoon , or send up shoots for five or six years in succession . This is one reason why Jamaica sugar planters find it so 7 // hard to compete with Cuban production . On the deep soil of Cuba the cane rattoons , it is said , not five or six , but forty years in succession . The coffee plant is a beautiful shrub . Left to itself , it would grow twenty or thirty feet high ; but it is kept down to such a height as that the berries can easily be picked by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal the jessamine ; and the resemblance is increased during the time of flowering , by the beautiful white blossoms , of a faint , delicate fragrance , which are scattered over the branches like a light powdering of snow . It thrives well in a moist air ; and coffee plantations may be seen clothing the sides of mountains three , four , and even five thousand feet above the sea . The history of the way in which coffee was introduced to the West Indies is really quite a little romance , though an authentic one . It is well known that Holland used to practise the most odious commercial monopoly ever known among Christian nations . Her spice islands were guarded with a cruel jealousy rivalling the fables of the dragon that guarded the golden apples ; and her great coffee island , Java , was equally locked up from the world . To give a spice plant or a coffee plant to a stranger , was an offence inexorably punished with death . A single coffee plant , however , was allowed to come to Europe as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was still : more jealously watched than its fellows in the East Indies ; but at length a French visitor managed to secrete a living berry , and , taking it with him to Paris , to raise a plant . From this again a young plant was taken to Martinique , one of the French West Indies . When the young stranger , freighted with such possibilities of wealth , arrived there , it was found that the exposure of the voyage had nearly extinguished its vitality . It was tended with the most anxious care ; but for two or three years it continued to lanvoL. iv. - 80 guish , and threatened by an untimely death to give Dutch selfishness a triumph after all . At last , however , it took a happy start , and from that plant the whole West Indies have derived their coffee . It was introduced into Jamaica in 1720 , and Temple Hall , one of the two estates which I have mentioned as being in the beautiful valley between Kingston and the American Mission , has the honor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee is of an excellent quality ; the berries , it is said , if kept two years , being equal to the best Mocha . As some one laments that the cooks and grooms of the Romans spoke better Latin than even Milton among the moderns could write , so I can boast in behalf of the Jamaica negroes , that even Delmonico , unless he could secure the services of one of them who understands the true method of reducing the browned berry to an impalpable powder , by pulverizing it between a fiat stone and a round one , must give up all hopes of presenting his guests with the ideal cup of coffee . I would give the whole process by which an amber-colored stream , of perfect flavor , might be poured out , without a trace of sediment , to the very last drop , did I not reflect with pity that probably in all the wide extent of my country there is neither the apparatus of grinding nor the sable domestic with skill to use it . Nay , even in Jamaica , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good thing , since they are so amazingly slow to every good thing , I grieve to say that the barbarous mill , hacking and mangling the fragrant berry , has almost universally supplanted the more laborious ancient method by which it was gently reduced to its most perfect attrition , yielding up every particle of its aromatic strength . Thus the modern demon of expedition , to whom quickness is so much more than quality , has invaded even the slumberous repose of our fair island , bringing under his arm , not a locomotive , but a // coffee milL There are , to be sure , two or three locomotives on the twelve-mile railway between Kingston and Spanishtown , but it would be a cruel sarcasm to intimate that the genius of expedition ever brought them . There are several other vegetable products of Jamaica , which it owes likewise to a happy accident . The mango , for instance , which now grows in such profusion on uplands and plains , that if the groves should be cut down , the face of the country would seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a French ship destined forMartinique , somewhere about 1790 . At first it is said the mangoes sold for a guinea a piece , with the express stipulation that the seed should be returned . Now , in a good bearing season , I have actually seen a narrow mountain road fetlock deep with decaying mangoes , besides the thousands consumed by man and beast . During the summer , in the good years , they furnish the main subsistence to the negro children , and a large part of the subsistence of the adults , and make a grateful and wholesome change from the yam and salt fish which constitute the staples of their diet the rest of the time . It is this , probably , which has given rise to the absurd report that the negroes live principally on fruits spontaneously growing . The young leaves of the mango are of a brownish red ; and amid the general profusion of green , they impart a not ungrateful relief to the eye . Even their russet blossoms have a pleasant look . But in a good season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magnificently rich appearance . Rows upon rows of yellow fruit look like lines of golden apples . Most people are extravagantly fond of them ; but for myself I must say that , excepting the superb No. 11 - so named from being thus numbered on the captured French ship  --  and one or two other rare kinds , I concur with the late Prof. Adams , of Amherst , in thinking that a very good mango might be made by steeping raw cotton in turpentine , and sprinkling a little sugar over it . Another fortuitous gift to Jamaica , so far as human intention is concerned , was the invaluable donation of the Guinea grass . Toward a century ago some African birds were brought as a present to a gentleman in the west of the island . Some grass seeds had been brought along for their feed ; and when they reached their journey 's end , the seeds were thrown away . After a while it was noticed that the cattle were very eager to reach the grass growing on a certain spot , and on examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as a grass of remarkable succulence and nutritiousness . It was soon distributed , and now it is spread over the island . You pass rich meadows of it on every lowland estate ; and it clothes hundreds of hills to their lops with its yellowish green . I do not see what the island would do without it . The pens or grazing farms in particular have been almost wholly created by it . Jamaica has , of course , the usual . West Indian fruits , the orange , the shaddock , the lime , the pineapple , the guava , the nispero , the banana , the cocoanut , and many others not much known abroad . But the lusciousness of tropical fruits compares ill with the thousand delicate flavors which cultivation has extended through our temperate clime ; while , at the same time steam makes nearly all the best fruits of the West Indies familiar to our markets . The resident of New York or Philadelphia , and still more of Baltimore , has small occasion to wish himself in the tropics for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and therefore the great staple of existence to the immense majority of the inhabitants , is the yam . There are some indigenous kinds ; but the species most in use appear to have been brought in by the imported African slaves . This solid edible dwarfs our potatoes , a single // root varying in weight from five to ten pounds , and sometimes even reaching the weight of fifty pounds . They are of all shapes , globular , finger shaped , and long ; and the latter* with their thick , brown rinds , look more like billets of wood , crusted with earth , than anything else . People in this country are apt to imagine them to be a huge kind of sweet potato , with which they have no other connection than that both are edible roots . The white yams , boiled and mashed , are scarcely distinguishable from very superior white potatoes . Above ground the plant is a vine , requiring to be trained on a pole , and a yamfield looks precisely like a vineyard . But oh , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laughing girls treading the grape , and the sunny lands of story , a yamfield reminds you only that under the ground is a bulky esculent , which some months hence will be put into a negro pot , and boiled and eaten , with an utter absence of poetry , or of anything but appetite and salt . It is plai*that in this case solid usefulness stands no chance with erratic and rather loosemannered brilliancy . And yet some kinds of yam in flower diffuse a fragrance more exquisite , I am persuaded , than comes from any vineyard . So that , after all , their homely prose has some flavor of poetry , which , when African poets arise , will doubtless be duly canonized in song . As yet the small freeholders have chiefly occupied themselves in raising these ground provisions , ' as yams , plantains , bananas , and the various vegetables are called . But they are more and more largely planting cane and coffee , greatly to their own advantage and that of the island . If in this favored zone the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the heavens above . Being under the parallel of 180 N. lat. , of course we have a full view of all the northern heavens , and of all the southem heavens , except 180 about the South Pole . The rarefied atmosphere gives peculiar brilliancy to the stars ; and on a clear night  --  and most nights are clear  --  the heavens are indeed flooded with white fire , while , according to the season of the year , Orion and his northern company appear with a lustre unwonted to us , or the Scorpion unfolds his sparkling length , or the Ship displays its glittering confusion of stars , or the Southern Cross rears aloft its sacred symbol . Meanwhile , well down toward the northern horizon , the pole star holds its fixed position , and the Great and the Little Bear , dipping toward the ocean wave , but not yet dipping in it , pursue their nightly revolutions . Long after sunset , and long before sunrise , night after night , the faint , nebulous gleam of the zodiacal lights stretches up toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fugacious planet , Mercury , so seldom seen at the north , in distinct view . While Venus not merely casts a shadow in a clear night , as she does with us , but when she is brightest , actually shines through the clouds with an illumining power . Alternating with these glories of the starry firmament , the moon at the full fills the lower air with a soft , yet bright light , in which you can read without difficulty the smallest print . Under this milder illumination , the overpowering luxuriance of the landscape loses its oppressiveness , the hills assume more rounded forms , and from the general obscurity , the palms , a tree made for moonlight , stand out in soft distinctness . At such a time we forget the foul crimes which disfigure the past , and the vices which degrade the present of this fair land , and can easily imagine ourselves in the garden where the yet unfallen progenitors of mankind walked under a firmament glowing with living sapphires , ' and together hymned the praises of their Creator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reality of Christian of contributing , in some humble measwork , whose rugged but cheerful tasks ure , toward restoring in a province of replace the delicious but ineffectual fallen earth the lineaments of Paradise dreams of Paradise Lost , by the hope Regained .
