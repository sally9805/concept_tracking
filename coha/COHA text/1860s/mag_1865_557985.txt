ART . VIII . - Iii stoire des Ide'es Morales et Politiques en France an X Vilime Si*cle . Par M. JULES BARNI , Professeur * l'Acad6mie de Gen*ve . Tome II . Paris . 186** . " WE have had the great professor and founder of the philosophy of Vanity in England . As I had good opportunities of knowing his proceedings almost from day to day , he left no doubt in my mind that he entertained no principle either to influence his heart or to guide his understanding but vanity ; with this vice he was possessed to a degree little short of madness . Benevolence to the whole species , and want of feeling for every individual with whom the professors come in contact , form the character of the new philosophy . Setting up for an unsocial independence , this their hero of vanity refuses the just price of common labor , as well as the tribute which opulence owes to genius , and which , when paid , honors the giver and the receiver , and then pleads his beggary as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those only who touch him by the remotest relation , and then , without one natural pang , casts away , as a sort of offal and excrement , the spawn of his disgustful amours , and sends his children to the hospital of foundlings . The bear loves , licks , and forms her young ; but bears are not philosophers . " This was Burke 's opinion of the only contemporary who can he said to rival him in fervid and sustained eloquence , to surpass him in grace and persuasiveness of style . Perhaps we should have been more thankful to him if he had left us instead a record of those " proceedings almost from day to day " which he had such " good opportunities of knowing , " but it probably never entered his head that posterity might care as much about the doings of the citizen of Geneva as about the sayings of even a British Right Honorable . Vanity eludes recognition by its victims in more shapes , and more pleasing , than any other passion , and perhaps had Mr. Burke been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would have found no juster equivalent for the obnoxious trisyllable than " righteous self-esteem . " For Burke was himself also , in the subtler sense of the word , a sentimentalist , that is , a man // who took what would now be called an aesthetic view of morals and politics . No man who ever wrote English , except perhaps Mr. Ruskin , more habitually mistook his own personal likes and dislikes , tastes and distastes , for general principles , and this , it may be suspected , is the secret of all merely eloquent writing . He hints at madness as an explanation of Rousseau , and it is curious enough that Mr. Buckle was fain to explain him in the same way . It is not , we confess , a solution that we find very satisfactory in this latter case . His fury against the French Revolution was nothing more than was natural to a desperate man in self-defence . It was his own life , or , at least , all that made life dear to him , that was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be naturally secreted from a magnanimous nature and a sensitive temperament , *bsolutely none of that rough-and-tumble kind which is so needful for the conduct of affairs . Fastidiousness is only another form of egotism ; and all men who know not where to look for truth save in the narrow well of self will find their own image at the bottom , and mistake it for what they are seeking . Burke 's hatred of Rousseau was genuine and instinctive . It was so genuine and so instinctive as no hatred can be but that of self , of our own weaknesses as we see them in another man . But there was also something deeper in it than this . There was mixed with it the natural dread in the political diviner of the political logician ,  --  in the empirical , of the theoretic statesman . Burke , confounding the idea of society with the form of it then existing , would have preserved that as the only specific against anarchy . Rousseau , assuming that society as it then existed was but another name for anarchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The one has left behind him some of the profoundest aphorisms of political wisdom ; the other , some of the clearest principles of political science . The one , clinging to Divine right , found in the fact that things were , a reason that they ought to be ; the other , aiming to solve the problem of the Divine order , would deduce from that abstraction alone the claim of anything to be at all . There seems a mere oppugnancy of nature between the two , and yet both were , in different ways , the dupes of their own imaginations . Now let us hear the opinion of a philosopher who was a bear , // whether bears be philosophers or not . Boswell had a genuine relish for what was superior in any way , from genius to claret , and of course he did not let Rousseau escape him . " One evening at the Mitre , Johnson said sarcastically to me , It seems , sir , you have kept very good company abroad , - Rousseau and Wilkes ! ' I answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call Rousseau bad company ; do you really think him a bad man ? ' JOHNSON . Sir , if you are talking jestingly of this , I do n't talk with you . If you mean to be serious , I think him one of the worst of men , a rascal who ought to be hunted out of society , as he has been . Three or four nations have expelled him , and it is a shame that he is protected in this country . Rousseau , sir , is a very bad man . I would sooner sign a sentence for his transportation , than that of any felon who has gone from the Old Bailey these many years . Yes , I should like to have him work in the plantations . ' " We were the plantations then , and Rousseau was destined to work there in another and much more wonderful fashion than the gruff old Ursa Major imagined . However , there is always a refreshing heartiness in his growl , a masculine bass with no snarl in it . The Doctor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the native manufacture of the British conservative mind . Three or four nations have , therefore England ought . A few years later , had the Doctor been living , if three or four nations had treated their kings as France did hers , would he have thought the ergo a very stringent one for England ? Mr. Burke , who could speak with studied respect of the Prince of Wales , and of his vices with that charity which thinketh no evil and can afford to think no evil of so important a living member of the British Constitution , surely could have had no unmixed moral repugnance for Rousseau 's " disgustful amours . " It was because they were his that they were so loathsome . Mr. Burke was a snob , though an inspired one . Dr. Johnson , the friend of that wretchedest of lewd fellows , Richard Savage , and of that gay man about town , Topham Beauclerk , - himself sprung from an amour that would have been disgustful had it not been royal , - must also have felt something more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice . We must sometimes allow to personal temperament // its right of peremptory challenge . Johnson had not that fine sensitiveness to the political atmosphere which made Burke presageful of coming tempest , but both of them felt that there was something dangerous in this man . Their dislike has in it somewhat of the energy of fear . Neither of them had the same feeling toward Voltaire , the man of supreme talent , but both felt that what Rousseau was possessed by was genius , with its terrible force either to attract or repel . " By the pricking of my thumbs , Something wicked this way comes. ** Burke and Johnson were both of them sincere men , both of them men of character as well as of intellectual force ; and we cite their opinions of Rousseau with the respect which is due to an honest conviction which has apparent grounds for its adoption , whether we agree with it or no . Bnt it strikes us as a little singular that one whose life was so full of moral inconsistency , whose character is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say so revolting , should yet have exercised so deep and lasting an influence , and on minds so various , should still be an object of minute and earnest discussion , - that he should have had such vigor in his intellectual loins as to have been the father of Chateaubriand , Byron , Lamartine , George Sand , and many more in literature , in politics of Jefferson and Thomas Paine , - that the spots he had haunted should draw pilgrims so unlike as Gibbon and Napoleon , nay , should draw them still after the lapse of near a century . Surely there must have been a basis of sincerity in this man seldom matched , if it can prevail against so many reasons for repugnance , aversion , and even disgust . He could not have been the mere sentimentalist and rhetorician for which the roughand-ready understanding would at first glance be inclined to condemn him . In a certain sense he was both of these , but he was something more . It will bring us a little nearer the point we are aiming at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . Mr. Thomas Moore , returning pleasantly in a travellingcarriage from a trip to Italy , in which he had never forgotten the poetical shop at home , but had carefully noted down all the pretty images that occurred to him for future use , - Mr. // Thomas Moore , on his way back from a visit to his noble friend Byron , at Venice , who had there been leading a life so gross as to be talked about , even amid the crash of Napoleon 's fall , and who was just writing " Don Juan " for the improvement of the world , - Mr. Thomas Moore , fresh from the reading of Byron 's Memoirs , which were so scandalous that , by some hocus-pocus , three thousand guineas found their way into his own pocket afterward for consenting to suppress them , - Mr. Thomas Moore , the ci-devant friend of the Prince Regent , and the author of Little 's Poems , among other objects of pilgrimage , visits Les Charmettes , where Rousseau had lived with Madame de Warens . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost , so good a text for a little virtuous moralizing not to be thrown away ; and accordingly Mr. Moore pours out several pages of octosyllabic disgust at the sensuality of the dead man of genius . There was no horror for Byron . Toward him all was suavity and decorous biens*ance . That lively sense of benefits to be received made the Irish Anacreon wink with both his little eyes . In the judgment of a liberal like Mr. Moore , were not the errors of a lord excusable ? But with poor Rousseau the case was very different . The son of a watchmaker , an outcast from boyhood up , always on the perilous edge of poverty , - what right had he to indulge himself in any immoralities ? So it is always with the sentimentalists . It is never the thing in itself that is bad or good , but the thing in its relation to some conventional and mostly selfish standard . Moore could be a moralist , in this case , without any trouble , and with the advantage of winning Lord Lansdowne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody would buy , and for the rest it is not hard to be a stoic in eight-syllable measure and a travelling-carriage . The next dinner at Bowood will taste none the worse . Accordingly he speaks of " The mire , the strife And vanities of this man 's life , Who more than all that e'er have glowed With fancy 's flame ( and it was his In fullest warmth and radiance ) showed What an impostor Genius is ; // How , with that strong mimetic art Which forms its life and soul , it takes All shapes of thought , all hues of heart , Nor feels itself one throb it wakes ; How , like a gem , its light may shine , O'er the dark path by mortals trod , Itself as mean a worm the while As crawls at midnight o'er the sod How , with the pencil hardly dry From coloring up such scenes of love And beauty as make young hearts sigh , And dream and think through heaven they rove , " &amp;c. , &amp;c . Very spirited , is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the similes , and it is very good oratorical verse . But would we believe in it , we must never read Mr. Moore 's own journal , and find out how thin a piece of veneering his own life was , - how he lived in sham till his very nature had become subdued to it , till he could persuade himself that a sham could be written into a reality , and actually made experiment thereof in his Diary . One verse in this diatribe deserves a special comment , - " What an impostor Genius is ! " In two respects there is nothing to be objected to in it . It is of eight syllables , and " is " rhymes unexceptionably with " his . " But is there the least filament of truth in it ? We venture to assert , not the least . It was not Rousseau 's genius that was an . mpostor . It was the one thing in him that was always true . We grant that , in allowing that a man has genius . Talent is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in whose power a man is . That is the very difference between them . We might turn the tables on Moore , the man of talent , and say truly enough , What an impostor talent is ! Moore talks of the mimetic power with a total misapprehension of what it really is . The mimetic power had nothing whatever to do with the affair . Rousseau had none of it : Shakespeare had it in excess ; but what difference would it make in our judgnwnt of Hamlet or Othello if a manuscript of Shakespeare 's memoirs should turn up , and we should find out that he had been a pitiful fellow ? None in the world ; for he is not a professed // moralist , and his life does not give the warrant to his words . But if Demosthenes , after all his Philippics , throws away his shield and runs , we feel the contemptibleness of the contradiction . With genius itself we never find any fault . It would be an over-nicety that would do that . We do not get invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grumbling and saying we have better at home . No ; the same genius that mastered him who wrote the poem masters us in reading it , and we care for nothing outside the poem itself . How the author lived , what he wore , how he looked , - all that is mere gossip , about which we need not trouble ourselves . Whatever he was or did , somehow or other God let him be worthy to write this , and that is enough for us . We forgive everything to the genius ; we are inexorable to the man . Shakespeare , Goethe , Burns , - what have their biographies tp do with us ? Genius is not a question of character . It may be sordid , like the lamp of Aladdin , in its externals ; what care we , while the touch of it builds palaces for us , makes us rich as only men in dream-land are rich , and lords to the utmost bound of imagination ? So , when people talk of the ungrateful way in which the world treats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of genius which has not teen the delight of mankind , no word of genius to which the human heart and soul have not , sooner or later , responded . But the man whom the genius takes possession of for its pen , for its trowel , for its pencil , for its chisel , him the world treats according to his deserts . IDoes Burns drink ? It sets him to gauging casks of gin . For , remember , it is not to the practical world that the genius appeals ; it is the practical world which judges of the man 's fitness for its uses , and has a right so to judge . No amount of patronage could have made distilled liquors less toothsome to Robbie Burns , as no amount of them could make a Burns of the Ettrick Shepherd . There is an old story in the Gesta Romanorum of a priest who was found fault with by one of his parishioners because his life was in painful discordance with his teaching . So one day he takes his critic out to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , asks him if he does not find it sweet and pure water . The parishioner , having answered that it was , is taken // to the source , and finds that what had so refreshed him flowed from between the jaws of a dead dog . " Let this teach thee , " said the priest , " that the very best doctrine may take its rise in a very impnre and disgustful spring , and that excellent morals may be taught by a man who has no morals at all . " It is easy enough to see the fallacy here . Had the man known beforehand from what a carrion fountain-head the stream issued , he could not have drunk of it without loathing . Had the priest merely bidden him to look at the stream and see how beautiful it was , instead of tasting it , it would have been quite another matter . And this is precisely the difference between what appeals to our aesthetic and to our moral sense , between what is judged of by the taste and the conscience . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigate his character , and are justified in so doing . He may express as many and as delicate shades of feeling as he likes , - for this the sensibility of his organization perfectly fits him , no other person could do it so well , - but the moment he undertakes to establish his feeling as a rule of conduct , we ask at once how far are his own life and deed in accordance with what he preaches ? For every man feels instinctively that all the beautiful sentiments in the world weigh less than a single lovely action ; and that while tenderness of feeling and susceptibility to generous emotions are accidents of temperament , goodness is an achievement of the will and a quality of the life . Fine words , says our homely old proverb , butter no parsnips ; and if the question be how to render those vegetables palatable , an ounce of butter would be worth more than all the orations of Cicero . The only conclusive evidence of a many s sincerity is that he give himself for a principle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to give away ; but when a man makes a gift of his daily life and practice , it is plain that the truth , whatever it may be , has taken possession of him . From that sincerity his words gain the force and pertinency of deeds , and his money is no longer the pale drudge twixt man and man , but , by a beautiful magic , what erewhile bore the image and superscription of Ca*sar seems now to bear the image and superscription of God . It is thus that there is a genius for goodness , for magnanimity , // for self-sacrifice , as well as for creative art ; and it is thus that by a more refined sort of Platonism the Infinite Beauty dwells in and shapes to its own likeness the soul which gives it body and individuality . But when Moore charges genius with being an impostor , the confusion of his ideas is pitiable . There is nothing so true , so sincere , so downright and forthright , as genius . It is always truer than the man himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been as marvellous a creature as the genius that wrote his plays , that genius so comprehensive in its intelligence , so wise eyen in its play , that its clowns are moralists and philosophers , so penetrative that a single one of its phrases reveals to us the secret of our own character , would his contemporaries have left us so wholly without record of him as they have done , distinguishing him in no wise from his fellow-players ? Rousseau no doubt was weak , nay , more than that , was sometimes despicable , but yet is not fairly to be reckoned among the herd of sentimentalists . It is shocking that a man whose preaching made it fashionable for women of rank to nurse their own children should have sent his own , as soon as born , to the foundling hospital , still more shocking that , in a note to his Discours sur l'In*galit* , he should speak of this crime as one of the consequences of our social system . But for all that , there was a faith and an ardor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers of his time . Nor were his practice and his preaching always inconsistent . He contrived to pay regularly , whatever his own circumstances were , a pension of one hundred livres a year to a maternal aunt who had been kind to him in childhood . Nor was his asceticism a sham . He might have turned his gift into laced coats and chdteaux as easily as Voltaire , had he not held it too sacred to be bartered away in any such losing exchange . But what is worthy of especial remark is this , - that in nearly all that he wrote his leading object was the good of his kind , and that through all the vicissitudes of a life which illness , sensibility of temperament , and the approaches of insanity rendered wretched ,  --  the associate of infidels , the foundling child , as it were , of an age without belief , least of all in itself , - he professed and evidently felt deeply a faith in the // for self-sacrifice , as well as for creative art ; and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Infinite Beauty dwells in and shapes to its own likeness the soul which gives it body and individuality . But when Moore charges genius with being an impostor , the confusion of his ideas is pitiable . There is nothing so true , so sincere , so downright and forthright , as genius . It is always truer than the man himself is , greater than he . If Shakespeare the man had been as marvellous a creature as the genius that wrote his plays , that genius so comprehensive in its intelligence , so wise eyen in its play , that its clowns are moralists and philosophers , so penetrative that a single one of its phrases reveals to us the secret of our own character , would his contemporaries have left us so wholly without record of him as they have done , distinguishing him in no wise from his fellow-players ?

There is no such thing as scoffing in his writings . On the other hand , there is no stereotyped morality . He does not ignore the existence of scepticism ; he rec*gnizes its existence in his own nature , meets it frankly face to face , and makes it confess that there are things in the teaching of Christ that are deeper than its doubt . The influence of his early education at Geneva is apparent here . An intellect so acute as his , trained in the school of Calvin in a republic where theological discussion was as much the amusement of the people as the opera was at Paris , could not fail to be a good logician . He had the fortitude to follow his logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character which quickened his perception of the beauties of nature , and made him alive to the charm of music and musical expression , prevented him from being in the highest sense an original writer , and if his ideas were mostly suggested to him by books , yet the clearness , consecutiveness , and eloquence with which he stated and enforced them made them his own . There was at least that original fire in him which could fuse them and run them in a novel mould . His power lay in this very ability of manipulating the thoughts of others . Fond of paradox he doubtless was , but he had a way of putting things that arrested attention and excited thought . It was , perhaps , this very sensibility to the surrounding atmosphere of feeling and speculation , which made Rousseau more directly influential on contemporary thought ( or perhaps we should say sentiment ) than any writer of his time . And this is rarely consistent with enduring greatness in literature . It forces us to remember , against our will , the oratorical character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great advocate , with Europe in the jury-box . Enthusiasm begets enthusiasm , eloquence produces conviction for the moment , but it is only by truth to nature and the everlasting intuitions of mankind that those abiding influences are won that enlarge from generation to generation . Rousseau was in many respects - as great pleaders always are - a man of the day , who must needs become a mere name to posterity , yet he could not but have had in him some not inconsiderable share of that principle by which man eternizes himself . For it is only to such that the night // cometh not in which no man shall work , and he is still operative both in politics and literature by the principles he formulated or the emotions to which he gave a voice so piercing and so sympathetic . In judging Rousseau , it would be unfair not to take note of the malarious atmosphere in which he grew up . The constitution of his mind was thus early infected with a feverish taint that made him shiveringly sensitive to a temperature which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was but too literally a rack . Good-humored Mother Nature commonly imbeds the nerves of her children in a padding of self-conceit that serves as a buffer against the ordinary shocks to which even a life of routine is liable , and it would seem at first sight as if Rousseau had been better cared for than usual in this regard . But as his self-conceit was enormous , so was the reaction from it proportionate , and the fretting suspiciousness of temper , sure mark of an unsound mind , which rendered him incapable of intimate friendship , while passionately longing for it , became inevitably , when turned inward , a tormenting self-distrust . To dwell in unrealities is the doom of the sentimentalist ; but it should not be forgotten that the same fitful intensity of emotion which makes them real as the means of elation , gives them substance also for torture . Too irritably jealous to endure the rude society of men , he steeped his senses in the enervating incense that women are only too ready to burn . If their friendship be a safeguard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but the strongest , and Rousseau was weak by inheritance and early training . His father was one of those feeble creatures for whom a fine phrase could always satisfactorily fill the void that non-performance leaves behind it . If he neglected duty , he made up for it by that cultivation of the finer sentiments of our common nature which waters flowers of speech with the brineless tears of a flabby remorse , without one fibre of resolve in it , and which impoverishes the character in proportion as it enriches the vocabulary . He was a very Apicius in that digestible kind of woe which makes no man leaner , and had a favorite receipt for cooking you up a sorrow a ' let douleur inassouvie that had just enough delicious sharpness in it to bring // tears into the eyes by tickling the palate . " When he said to me , Jean Jacques , let us speak of thy mother , ' I said to him , Well , father , we are going to weep , then ? ' and this word alone drew tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , give her back to me , console me for her , fill the void she has left in my soul ! ' " Alas ! in such cases , the void she leaves is only that she found . The grief that seeks any other than its own society will erelong want an object . This admirable parent allowed his son to become an ontcast at sixteen , without any attempt to reclaim him , in order to enjoy unmolested a petty inheritance to which the boy was entitled in right of his mother . " This conduct , " iRoussean tells us , " of a father whose tenderness and virtue were so well known to me , cansed me to make reflections on myself which have not a little contribnted to make my heart sound . I drew from it this great maxim of morals , the only one perhaps serviceable in practice , to avoid situations which put onr duties in opposition to onr interest , and which show us onr own advantage in the wrong of another , sure that in such sitnations , however sincere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or later grows weak without our perceiving it , and that we become unjust and wicked in action without having ceased to be just and good in soul . " This maxim may do for that " fugitive and cloistered virtue , unexercised and unbreathed , that never sallies out and seeks its adversary , " which Milton could not praise , - that is , for a manhood whose distinction it is not to be manly , - but it is chiefly worth notice as being the characteristic doctrine of sentimentalism . This disjoining of deed from will , of practice from theory , is to put asunder what God has joined by an indissoluble sacrament . The soul must be tainted before the action becomes corrupt ; and there is no self-delusion more fatal than that which makes the conscience dreamy with the anodyne of lofty sentiments , while the life is grovelling and sensual , - witness Coleridge . In his case we feel something like disgust . But where , as in his son Hartley , there is hereditary infirmity , where the man sees the principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerveless will , like a rope through the fingers of a drowning man , and the confession of faith is the moan of despair , there is room for no harsher feeling than // pity . Rousseau showed through life a singular proneness for being convinced by his own eloquence ; he was always his own first convert ; and this reconciles his power as a writer with his weakness as a man . He and all like him mistake emotion for conviction , velleity for resolve , the brief eddy of sentiment for the midcurrent of ever-gathering faith in duty that draws to itself all the affluents of conscience and will , and gives continuity of purpose to life . They are like men who love the stimulus of being under conviction , as it is called , who , forever getting religion , never get capital enough to retire upon and spend for their own need and the common service . The sentimentalist is the spiritual hypochondriac , with whom fancies become facts , while facts are a discomfort because they will not be evaporated into fancy . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confess even a country-cousinship with coarsehanded Practice , whose homely ways would disconcert her artificial world . The very susceptibility that makes him quick to feel , makes him also incapable of deep and durable feeling . He loves to think he suffers , and keeps a pet sorrow , a blue-devil familiar , that goes with him everywhere , like Paracelsus 's black dog . He takes good care , however , that it shall not be the true sulphurous article that sometimes takes a fancy to fly away with his conjurer . Ren6 says , " In my madness I had gone so far as even to wish I might experience a misfortune , so that my suffering might at least have a real object . " But no ; selfishness is only active egotism , and there is nothing and nobody , with a single exception , which this sort of creature will not sacrifice , rather than give any other than an imaginary pang to his idol . Vicarious pain he is not unwilling to endure , nay , will even commit suicide by proxy , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him a sensation . Had young Jerusalem been anything like Goethe 's portrait of him in Werther , he would have taken very good care not to blow out the brains which he would have thought only too precious . Real sorrows are uncomfortable things , but purely iesthetic ones are by no means unpleasant , and we have always fancied the handsome young Wolfgang writing those distracted letters to Auguste Stolberg with a looking-glass in front of him to give back an image of his desolation , and finding it rather // pleasant than otherwise to shed the tear of sympathy with self that would seem so bitter to his fair correspondent . The tears that have real salt in them will keep ; they are the difficult , manly tears that are shed in secret ; but the pathos soon evaporates from that fresh-water with which a man can bedew a dead donkey in public , while his wife is having a good cry over his neglect of her at home . We do not think the worse of Goethe for hypothetically desolating himself in the fashion aforesaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crisis as dentition , which the stronger worry through , and turn out very sensible , agreeable fellows . But where there is an arrest of development , and the heartbreak of the patient is audibly prolonged through life , we have a spectacle which the toughest heart would wish to get as far away from as possible . We would not be supposed to overlook the distinction , too often lost sight of , between sentimentalism and sentiment , the latter being a very excellent thing in its way , as genuine things are apt to be . Sentiment is intellectualized emotion , emotion precipitated , as it were , in pretty crystals by the fancy . This is the delightful staple of the poets of social life like Horace and B6ranger , or Thackeray , when he too rarely played with verse . It put* into words for us that decorous average of feeling to the expression of which society can consent without danger of being indiscreetly moved . It is excellent for people who are willing to save their souls alive to any extent that shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience has given us a hunger which what we so glibly call " the world " can not sate , just as a water-ice is nourishment enough to a man who has had his dinner . It is the sufficing lyrical interpreter of those lighter hours that should make part of every healthy man 's day , and is noxious only when it palls men 's appetite for the ' truly profound poetry which is very passion of very soul sobered by afterthought and embodied in eternal types by imagination . True sentiment is emotion ripened by a slow ferment of the mind and qualified to an agreeable temperance by that taste which is the conscience of polite society . But the sentimentalist always insists on taking his emotion neat , and , as his sense gradually deadens to the stimulus , increases his dose till he ends in a kind of // moral deliquium . At first the debaucher , he becomes at last the victim of his sensations . Among the ancients we find no trace of sentimentalism . Their masculine mood both of body and mind left no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their literature compared with that of recent times , its tonic property , that seems almost too astringent to palates relaxed by a daintier diet . The first great example of the degenerate modern tendency was Petrarch , who may be said to have given it impulse and direction . A more perfect specimen of the type has not since appeared . An intellectual voluptuary , a moral dilettante , the first instance of that character , since too common , the gentleman in search of a sensation , seeking a solitude at Vaucluse because it made him more likely to be in demand it Avignon , praising philosophic poverty with a sharp eye to the next rich benefice in the gift of his patron , commending a good life but careful first of a good living , happy only in seclusion but making a dangerous journey to enjoy the theatrical show of a coronation in the Capitol , cherishing a fruitless passion which broke his heart three or four times a year and yet could not make an end of him till he had reached the ripe age of seventy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - surely a more exquisite perfection of inconsistency would be hard to find . When Petrarch returned from his journey into the North of Europe in 1332 , he balanced the books of his unrequited passion , and , finding that he had now been in love seven years , thought the time had at last come to call deliberately on Death . Had Death taken him at his word , he would have protested that he was only in fun . For we find him always taking good care of an excellent constitution , avoiding the plague with commendable assiduity , and in the very year when he declares it absolutely essential to his peace of mind to die for good and all , taking refuge in the fortress of Capranica , from a wholesome dread of having his throat cut by robbers . There is such a difference between dying in a sonnet with a cambric handkerchief at one 's eyes , and the prosaic reality of demise certified in the parish register ! Practically it is inconvenient to be dead . Among other things , it puts an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to // have been an excellent understanding between Petrarch and Death , for he was brought to that grisly monarch 's door so often , that , otherwise , nothing short of a miracle or the nine lives of that animal whom love also makes lyrical could have saved him . " I consent , " he cries , " to live and die in Africa among its serpents , upon Caucasus , or Atlas , if , while I live , to breathe a pure air , and after my death a little corner of earth where to bestow my body , may be allowed me . This is all I ask , but this I can not obtain . Doomed always to wander , and to be a stranger everywhere , 0 Fortune , Fortune , fix me at last to some one spot ! I do not covet thy favors . Let me enjoy a tranquil poverty , let me pass in this retreat the few days that remain to me ! " The pathetic stop of Petrarch 's poetical organ was one he could pull out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary tears , as the cheap subterfuge for want of real feeling with natures of this quality . Solitude with him was but the pseudonyme of notoriety . Poverty was the archdeaconry of Parma , with other ecclesiastical pickings . During his retreat at Vaucluse , in the very height of that divine sonneteering love of Laura , of that sensitive purity which called Avignon Babylon , and rebuked the sinfulness of Clement , he was himself begetting that kind of children which we spell with a b . We believe that , if Messer Francesco had been present when the woman was taken in adultery , he would have flung the first stone without the slightest feeling of inconsistency , nay , with a sublime sense of virtue . The truth is , that it made very little difference to him what sort of proper sentiment his faint abstractions and the Platonism of a powerful nature fitted alike for the withdrawal of ideal contemplation and for breasting the storms of life , - would any one know how wide a depth divides a noble friendship based on sympathy of pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-sustainment are the readiest to give or to take , and a simulated passion , true neither to the spiritual nor the sensual part of man , - let him compare the sonnets of Petrarch with those which Michel Angelo addressed to Vittoria Colonna . In them the airiest pinnacles of // sentiment and speculation are buttressed with solid masonwork of thought , and of an actual , not fancied experience , and the depth of feeling is measured by the sobriety and reserve of expression , while in Petrarch 's all ingenuousness is frittered away into ingenuity . Both are cold , but the coldness of the one is self-restraint , while the other chills with pretence of warmth . In Michel Angelo 's , you feel the great architect ; in Petrarch 's , the artist who can best realize his conception in the limits of a cherry-stone . And yet this man influenced literature longer and more widely than alm6st any other in modern times . So great is the charm of elegance , so unreal is the larger part of what is written ! Certainly we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be looked at by the light of the artist 's biography , or measured by our standard of his character . Nor do we reckon what was genuine in Petrarch - his love of letters , his refinement , his skill in the superficial graces of laftguage , that rhetorical art by which the music of words supplants their meaning , and the verse moulds the thought instead of being plastic to it - after any such fashion . We have no ambition for that character of valet de chambre which is said to disenchant the most heroic figures into mere every-day personages , for it implies a mean soul no less than a servile condition . But we have a right to demand a certain amount of reality , however small , in the emotion of a man who makes it his business to endeavor at exciting our own . We have a privilege of nature to shiver before a painted flame , how cunningly soever the colors be laid on . Yet our love of minute biographical detail , our desire to make ourselves spies upon the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in us , that we must look for the spring of it in human nature , and that somewhat deeper than mere curiosity or love of gossip . It would seem to arise from what must be considered on the whole a creditable feeling , namely , that we value character more than any amount of talent ,  --  the skill to be something , above that of doing anything but the best of its kind . The highest creative genius , and that only , is privileged from arrest by this personality , for there the thing produced is altogether disengaged from the producer . But in natures incapable of this escape from themselves , the author is inevitably // mixed with his work , and we have a feeling that the amount of his sterling character is the security for the notes he issues . Especially we feel so when truth to self , which is always self-forgetful , and not truth to nature , makes an essential part of the value of what is offered us ; as where a man undertakes to narrate personal experience or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimentalists , because of their intrusive self-consciousness ; for there is no more universal characteristic of human nature than the instinct of men to apologize to themselves for themselves , and to justify personal failings by generalizing them into universal laws . A man would be the keenest devil 's advocate against himself , were it not that he has always taken a retaining fee for the defence ; for we think that the indirect and mostly unconscious pleas in abatement which we read between the lines in the works of many authors are oftener written to set themselves right in their own eyes than in those of the world . And in the real life of the sentimentalist it is the same . He is under the wretched necessity of keeping up , at least in public , the character he has assumed , till he at hst reaches that last shift of bankrupt self-respect , to play the hypocrite with himself . Lamartine , after passing round the hat in Europe and America , takes to his bed from wounded pride when the French Senate votes him a subsidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resents it ; in practical coin , he will accept the shame without a wry face . George Sand , speaking of Rousseau 's " Confessions , " says that an autobiographer always makes himself the hero of his own novel , and can not help idealizing , even if he would . But the weak point of all sentimentalists is that they always have been , and always continue under every conceivable circumstance to be , their own ideals , whether they are writing their own lives or no . Rousseau opens his book with the statement : " I am not made like any of those I have seen ; I venture to believe myself unlike any that exists . If I am not worth more , at least I am different . " 0 exquisite cunning of self-flattery ! It is this very imagined difference that makes us worth more in our own foolish sight . For while all men are apt to think , or to persuade themselves that they think , all // them literature , and the other society . But this did not prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ availing himself of his credit with persons who enjoyed all the advantages of that inequality whose evils he had so pointedly exposed . Indeed , it is curious how little practical communism there has been , how few professors it has had who would not have gained by a general dividend . It is perhaps no frantic effort of generosity in a philosopher with ten crowns in his pocket when he offers to make common stock with a neighbor who has ten thousand of yearly income , nor is it an uncommon thing to see such theories knocked clean out of a man 's head by the descent of a thumping legacy . But , consistent or not , Rousseau remains permanently interesting as the highest and most perfect type of the sentimentalist of genius . His was perhaps the acutest mind that was ever mated with an organization so diseased , the brain most far-reaching in speculation that ever kept itself steady and worked out its problems amid such disord*ered tumult of the nerves . His letter to the Archbishop of Paris , admirable for its lucid power and soberness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which no man can read and believe him to have been sane , show him to us in his strength and Weakness , and give us a more charitable , let us hope therefore a truer , notion of him than his own apology for himself . That he was a man of genius appears unmistakably in his impressibility by the deeper meaning of the epoch in which he lived . Before an eruption , clouds steeped through and through with electric life gather over the crater , as if in sympathy and expectation . As the mountain heaves and cracks , these vapory masses are seamed with fire , as if they felt and answered the dumb agony that is struggling for utterance , below . Just *uch flashes of eager sympathetic fire break continually from the cloudy volumes of Rousseau , the result at once and the warning of that convulsion of which Paris was to be the crater and all Europe to feel the spasm . There are symptoms enough elsewhere of that want of faith in the existing order which made the Revolution inevitable , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as early as 1Th5 ,  - -  but Rousseau more than all others is the unconscious expression of the groping after something radically new , the instinct // July , Boussea* and the Sentimentalists. for a change that should be organic and pervade every fibre of the social and political body . Freedom of thought owes far more to the jester Voltaire , who also had his solid kernel of earnest , than to the sombre Genevese , whose earnestness is of the deadly kind . Yet , for good or evil , the latter was the father of modern democracy , and without him our Declaration of Independence would have wanted some of those sentences in which the immemorial longings of the poor and the dreams of solitary enthusiasts were at last affirmed as axioms in the manifesto of a uation , so that all the world might hear . Though Rousseau , like many other fanatics , had a remarkable *vein of common sense in him , ( witness his remarks on duelling , on landscape-gardening , on French poetry , and much of his thought on education , ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , least of all in politics . For the great difficulty with his system , if system it may be called , is , that , while it professes to follow nature , it not only assumes as a starting-point that the individual man may be made over again , but proceeds to the conclusion that man himself , that human nature , must be made over again , and governments remodelled on a purely theoretic basis . But when something like an experiment in this direction was made in 1789 , not only did it fail as regarded man in general , but even as regards the particular variety of man that inhabited France . The Revolution accomplished many changes , and beneficent ones , but it left France peopled , not by a new race without traditions , but by Frenchmen . Still , there could not but be a wonderful force in the words of a man who , above all others , had the secret of making abstractions glow with his own fervor ; and his ideas - dispersed now in the atmosphere of thought - have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which prefer swift and sure generalization to hesitating and doubtful experience . Rousseau has , in one respect , been utterly misrepresented and misunderstood . Even Chateaubriand most unfilially classes him and Voltaire together . It appears to us that the inmost core of his being was religious . Had he remained in the Catholic Church , he might have been a saint . Had he come earlier , he might have founded an order . His was pre // cisely the nature on which religious enthusiasm takes the strongest hold , - a temperament which finds a sensuous delight in spiritual things , and satisfies its craving for excitement with celestial debauch . He had not the iron temper of a great reformer and organizer like Knox , who , true Scotchman that he was , found a way to weld this world and the other together in a cast-iron creed ; but he had as much as any man ever had that gift of a great preacher to make the oratorical fervor which persuades himself while it lasts into the abiding conviction of his hearers . That very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life was corrupt , is not unexampled among men who have left holier names than he . His " Confessions , " also , would assign him to that class with whom the religious sentiment is strong , and the moral nature weak . They are apt to believe that they may , as special pleaders say , confess and avoid . Hawthorne has admirably illustrated this in the penance of Mr. Dimmesdale . With all the soil that is upon Rousseau , we can not help looking on him as one capable beyond any in his generation of being divinely possessed ; and if it happened otherwise , when we remember the much that hindered and the little that helped in a life and time like his , we shall be much readier to pity than to condemn . It was his very fitness for being something better that makes him able to shock us so with what in too many respects he unhappily was . Less gifted , he had been less hardly judged . More than any other of the sentimentalists , except possibly Sterne , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chateaubriand , he is honesty , compared with Lamartine , he is manliness itself . His nearest congener in our own tongue is Cowper . In the whole school there is a sickly taint . The strongest mark which Rousseau has left upon literature is a sensibility to the picturesque in Nature , not with Nature as a strengthener and consoler , a wholesome tonic for a mind ill at ease with itself , but with Nature as a kind of feminine echo to the mood , flattering it with sympathy rather than correcting it with rebuke or lifting it away from its unmanly depression , as in the wholesomer fellow-feeling of Wordsworth . They seek in her an accessory , and not a reproof . It is less a sympathy with Nature than a sympathy with ourselves as we compel her to reflect // us . It is solitude , Nature for her estrangement from man , not for her companionship with him ,  --  it is desolation and ruin , Nature as she has triumphed over man ,  --  with which this order of mind seeks communion and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and destructive power of matter , and not with the spirit of life and renewal that dwells in it , that they ally themselves . And in human character it is the same . St. Preux , Ren6 , Werther , Manfred , Quasimodo , they are all anomalies , distortions , ruins ,  --  so much easier is it to caricature life from our own sickly conception of it , than to paint it in its noble simplicity ; so much cheaper is unreality than truth . Every man is conscious that he leads two lives , - the one trivial and ordinary , the other sacred and recluse ; one which he carries to society and the dinner-table , the other in which his youth and aspiration survive for him , and which is a confidence between himself and God . Both may be equally sincere , and there need be no contradiction between them , any more than in a healthy man between soul and body . If the higher life be real and earnest , its result , whether in literature or affairs , will be real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things who is not thoroughly sincere in dealing with himself , who would not exchange the finest show for the poorest reality , who does not so love his work that he is not only glad to give himself for it , but finds rather a gain than a sacrifice in the surrender . The sentimentalist does not think of what he does so much as of what the world will think of what he does . He translates should into would , looks upon the spheres of duty and beauty as alien to each other , and can never learn how life rounds itself to a noble completeness between these two opposite but mutually sustaining poles of what we long for and what we must . Did Rousseau , then , lead a life of this quality ? Perhaps , when we consider the contrast which every man who looks backward must feel between the life he planned and the life which circumstance within him and without him has made for him , we should rather ask , Was this the life he meant to lead ? Perhaps , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be no greater than our own , - we should ask , Was this the life he believed he led ? Have we any right to judge // this man after our blunt English fashion , and condemn him , as we are wont to do , on the finding of a jury of average householders ? Is French reality precisely our reality ? Could we tolerate tragedy in rhymed alexandrines , instead of blank verse ? The whole life of Rousseau is pitched on this heroic key , and for the most trivial occasion he must be ready with the sublime sentiments that are supposed to suit him rather than it . It is one of the most curious features of the sentimental ailment , that , while it shuns the contact of men , it courts publicity . In proportion as solitude and communion with self lead the sentimentalist to exaggerate the importance of his own personality , he comes to think that the least event connected with it is of consequence to his fellow-men . If he change his shirt , he would have mankind aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the class , considers it necessary to let the world know by letter from time to time his opinions on every conceivable subject about which it is not asked nor is of the least value unless we concede to him an immediate inspiration . We men of colder blood , in whom self-consciousness takes the form of pride , and who have deified mauvaise honte as if our defect were our virtue , find it especially hard to understand that artistic impulse of more southern races to pose themselves properly on every occasion , and not even to die without some tribute of deference to the taste of the world they are leaving . Was not even mighty C2esar 's last thought of his drapery ? Let us not condemn Rousseau for what seems to us the indecent exposure of himself in his " Confessions. ** Those who allow an oratorical and purely conventional side disconnected with our private understanding of the facts , and to life , in which everything has a parliamentary sense wholly where truth is made subservient to the momentary exigencies of eloquence , should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishes two kinds of truth , one for the world , and another for the conscience , while we take pleasure in a kind of speech that has no relation to the real thought of speaker or hearer , but to the rostrum only , we must not be hasty to condemn a sentimentalism which we do our best to foster . We listen in public with the gravity of augurs to what we smile at when we meet a brother adept . France is the na // tive land of eulogy , of truth padded out to the size and shape demanded by comme-il-faut . The French Academy has , perhaps , done more harm by the vogue it has given to this style , than it has done good by its literary purism , for the best purity of a language depends on the limpidity of its source in veracity of thought . Rousseau was in many respects a typical Frenchman , and it is not to be wondered at if he too often fell in with the fashion of saying what was expected of him and what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been true to his inmost consciousness . Perhaps we should allow something also to the influence of a Calvinistic training , which certainly helps men who have the least natural tendency towards it to set faith above works , and to persuade themselves of the efficacy of an inward grace to effect an outward and visible defection from it . As the sentimentalist always takes a fanciful , sometimes an unreal , life for an ideal one , it would be too much to say that Rousseau was a man of earnest convictions . But he was a man of fitfully intense ones , as suited so mobile a temperament , and his writings , more than those of any other of his tribe , carry with them that persuasion that was in him while he wrote . In them at least he is as consistent as a man who admits new ideas can ever be . The children of his brain he never abandoned , but clung to them with paternal fidelity . Intellectually he was true and fearless ; constitutionally , timid , contradictory , and weak ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a little too credulous of sonorous sentiment , but he was never , like Chateaubriand or Lamartine , the lackey of fine phrases . If , as some fanciful physiologists have assumed , there be a masculine and feminine lobe of the brain , it would seem that in men of sentimental turn the masculine half fell in love with and made ' an idol of the other , obeying and admiring all the pretty whims of this folle du logis . In Rousseau the mistress had some noble elements . of character , and less taint of the demi-monde than is visible in more recent cases of the same illicit relation . // ART . IX . - CRITICAL NOTICES . 1. - Inquiry into the Origin and Course of Political Parties in the United States . By the late Ex-President MARTIN VAN BUREN . Edited by his Sons . New York : Hurd and Houghton . 1867. 8vo. pp. ix. , 436 . EVERY manifestation of filial affection is entitled to respectful mention , when it is necessary to mention it at all ; and as Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the press by regard for their father 's memory , we presume it will he respectfully received by their countrymen , though its intrinsic value is by no means great . Mr. Van Buren never held office after his forced retirement from the Presidency in 1841 ; but for many years after that date he continued to be an active politician , and by his labors he made a permanent impression on his country 's history . He lived under dominion of the delusion that he was entitled to a second Presidential term , and that it was his business to destroy any Democratic statesman who should prevent his receiving a second nomination from the Democratic party . During the three years that followed his defeat , a majority of the members of his party favored his nomination for the election of 1844- 45 , and that nomination he would have received but for the success of an intrigue which placed General Jackson , much against the General 's wish and intent , in apparent opposition to him . The Democratic National Convention of 1844 contained a majority of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the existence of the " two-thirds rule , " were enabled to throw him out , and to give the nomination to Mr. Polk . It had been the purpose of those Democrats who took the lead in breaking down Mr. Van Buren to place General Cass in nomination ; but they were defeated , in their turn , by the friends of the ex-President , who had sufficient strength to say who should not be the candidate . Mr. Van Buren was inclined to oppose Mr. Polk ; but he could not carry his partisans that length , and the Tennesseean was elected , with memorable effect on the country 's fortunes ; for the revival of the pro-slavery agitation is directly traceable to the result of the Presidential contest of 1844 , and that led to secession and civil war , and to the abolition of slavery . Mr. Van Buren was still " kept before the people , " and expected to receive the Democratic nomination in 1848 . He was again disappointed , and his disappointment was greater than it had been in 1844 , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had been formed by the late Senator Douglas , to bring forward a new man , failing // to meet with favor . The course of Mr. Van Buren was characteristic . Though he had been conspicuous as a pro-slavery man , he accepted the nomination of the " Barnburners " of New York for the Presidency , in the expectation of thereby getting that of the FreeSoilers . His expectation was well founded . He received the Free-Soil nomination ; and in that way he succeeded in defeating the Democrats in the States of New York and Pennsylvania , which proved decisive on the result of the contest , and fatal to the hopes of General Cass . So many of our elections have been decided with direct reference to the hate felt by this or that eminent politician for some rival in his own party , that Mr. Van Buren 's conduct surprised no one , though he was the first ex-President of the United States who stooped to the ignoble part of Loredano , in order that he might ; be able to say , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy . After 1848 Mr. Van Buren saw that his public career was at an end . It is not probable that he could have obtained the Democratic nomination in 1852 , even had he supported General Cass four years earlier , as parties seldom have much respect for expended men ; but his conduct in 1848 had embittered the majority of his old supporters , and forced upon him a real retirement , as the decision of the people eight years before had compelled him to leave the White House . He sought forgiveness from those he had offended , and was allowed gradually to creep back into the Democratic fold , to which even repentant deserters were welcomed , because of the losses it had sustained in consequence of Democratic devotion to the interests of slavery , which became painfully conspicuous after the inauguration of President Pierce . He was of those Democrats who supported the administrations of Pierce and Buchanan in their pro-slavery policy , and thus condemned his own conduct in 1848 . But the leisure that was his he bestowed , for the most part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was engaged on the work when death overtook him , in the summer of 1862 . The book was left incomplete , closing with the year 1833 - 34 , when the writer was Vice-President of the United States . The fragment was placed by his sons in the hands of Mr. Charles H. Hunt , author of the " Life of Edward Livingston , " and who is now engaged on a biography of Mr. Van Buren . They retained the manuscript of the " Inquiry , " and have published it separately . The author began it as an episode , and , as the sons say , it grew on his hands " to such proportions as to seem to stand more properly as a distinct production ; and although , like the principal work , incomplete , it had been , nevertheless , carried forward to the point , chronologically speaking , that had been proposed , and that was , in fact , its natural termination . " They think highly of // the " Inquiry , " and they have performed a pious duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find few men to read it , and of those who read it but a very small number will be influenced by anything that is contained in its dull , dry pages . They say that " the subject is of peculiar interest at this time when , our country having suffered the rude shock and disord5 of civil war , and our free and popular institutions having sustained with admirable firmness and substantial triumph a more fearful trial than any to which they had before been subjected , the sacred and momentous duty is devolved on patriots and good citizens throughout our borders to reconstruct whatever valuable parts have been thrown down , to restore what may have been injured or defaced in our political system , and in the principles on which it rests ; and the occasion seems auspicious for recalling the attention of our people to the study of the lives and doctrines , the grounds and motives of action , of the great men by whom the foundafions of their government were laid . " Certainly it is the duty of all who take part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past for instruction ; but they should refer to it also for warning ; and we are convinced that the American people will find very little in the history of that party which it is the purpose of Mr. Van Buren 's " Inquiry " to glorify , that will commend itself for imitation . The early triumph and long ascendency of that party led to a civil war of proportions so great , that we must go back to Roman history to find anything with which justly to compare it ; and this was deliberately brought about by the calm action of men who prided themselves on being the genuine successors of other men whose theory and practice are the special objects of Mr. Van Buren 's eulogy , and to whom his sons would have the nation look for instruction in the work of restoring the law 's supremacy . In other words , the people are blandly advised to seek materials for the work of reconstruction in a magazine crowded with destructive agencies ; they are to organize anarchy , and make it permanent . The purpose which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inquiry " is to show that Alexander Hamilton was the evil genius of the American Union , and that Thomas Jefferson baffled him , and saved the Republic . This is the old , old story , that has been told over and over again by ten thousand partisan writers and orators during the last sixty years , till everybody has become tired of it , including even all Democrats whose memories do not take them back to the contest of 1800 . It differs from the ordinary versions of the story only in the coloring matter employed . Mr. Van Buren was a gentleman , and he was a practised statesman ; and as a gentleman he was above the use // of that political slang to which most Democratic writers have resorted when speaking of Hamilton 's labors and intentions ; and as a statesman familiar with men and affairs , he was aware that Hamilton 's motives , admitting them to have been unsound , could not have been low or selfish . Hence his " Inquiry , " in respect to manner , is not offensive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire course . He does justice to Hamilton 's talents , to his personal disinterestedness , and to his intentions . In this consists the solitary great merit of the work : it states the old Democratic view of the early political history of the country in dignified though heavy language , the reading of which creates no disgust . We dissent from his opinions , we think he is often wrong in his facts , and we are confident his conclusions are erroneous ; but we readily admit that he treats his political foes with the most polished courtesy , and that , apparently , he is sincerely anxious to state the truth - as he understands it . It will be understood that he is a more dangerous enemy of correct political principles than if he had written of them and their supporters with that coarseness which ever carries with it its own correction . But no danger need be apprehended from this work , because it is destitute of all the elem*nts of popularity . It was said of President Van Buren 's Messages , that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his " Inquiry " the same remark holds good . Were it as brilliant as one of Lord Macaulay 's political essays , it would be a dangerous book ; but being heavy as Dr. Nares 's Life of Burghley , it will have no effect on the popular mind . It will find its way into the hands of men who are curious on points of politics , and it will be consulted by those controversialists who get their facts and arguments at second-hand ; but most copies of it will enjoy that unenviable repose to which election sermons and Fourth-of-July orations are doomed . Even were its style excellent , we doubt if it could become very popular , so entirely is it written in the spirit of a departed age . It is , perhaps , its greatest failing , that it is entirely destitute of anything that can be mistaken for contemporary feeling . It appears to have been written , for the most part , in 1857 , but it might as well , as relates to the greater part of it , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now dead , ' and beyond hope of resurrection . We can not but believe that , if Mr. Van Buren had lived till now , either he would have altered his work extensively , or have consigned it to the fire ; for he could not have failed to see that it had become a modern antique through the sheer force of external circumstances . In the five years that have elapsed since the edict of emancipation was put forth , this country has gone through greater changes than could have been wrought by ordinary agencies in a century . The France of to-day // does not differ so much from the France of 1788 , morally speaking , as the American Republic of 1867 differs from the American Republic of 1862 , the year in which Mr. Van Buren died . We have outgrown - or rather we have overleaped - all the party truisms , for the possession of which politicians were so ready to contend even after Mr. Lincoln had been some time President , and when Mr. Davis was in the early days of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1857 , and which , if published in that year , would have been received as a valuable addition to our literature , is now of no more account to voters than would be the publication of the Marquess of Worcester 's Century of Inventions to the world of science . It is a curiosity , like any other disinterred fossil fragment , and it can be nothing more . It illustrates the ideas of an extinct time , - a time near to us in one sense , but in every other sense almost as remote as that of the Heptarchy . We have not the space in which to point out even the chief errors of the " Inquiry . " To do that , and to show that they are errors , would require us to write a volume . Two or three of those errors , which belong to the very basis of Mr. Van Buren 's general argument , may be indicated . He assumes that the Colonists - the men who founded the American world and their immediate descendants - were inclined to republicanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them had " an insurmountable opposition to hereditary political power in any shape and under any circumstances . " This is not supported by facts . The kings of Great Britain who ruled hereditarily - George II . and George III. , for example - had in no part of their dominions subjects more loyal than the Americans who lived during the thirty-eight years that followed the death of George I. , who had been called by Parliament to the British throne . Our predecessors had the same king as the inhabitants of England and Scotland , and they were content with him . But they did not admit that the British Parliament had the right to legislate for them in full , though they long submitted to its decrees . It was not the hereditary branch of the imperial government to which they had objections , but the elective branch , the House of Commons , which has been the ruling body in Great Britain ever since the success of the Revolutionists of 1688 . It was the union of the two branches for the oppression of the Colonists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government borne itself toward them with ordinary fairness , the Colonists never would have aspired to national life . Had George III . been as wise a monarch as his grandfather and his great-grandfather , he might have died master of North America . Separation would have come in time ; but it would have // come gradually and peacefully , as we see it is coming in the case of Canada , or in that of the Australasian colonies , which are taking initiatory steps toward a union . But the young king was mad in the medical sense , and by his insane action he hastened an event which need not have happened in his time ; and he was compelled , according to his own showing , to lay a dishonored head on his pi , llow , because he had lost his American provinces , - he who was born a gentleman ! The Colonies seem to have been singularly free from republicanism , if attachment to an hereditary chief-magistrate can be taken as evidence on the point . That republican feeling rapidly developed itself after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop itself in no other direction . That a republican polity was established here when the Revolution became armed was inevitable . It was that or nothing . A despotism was out of the question ; and there was a total absence of all the material from which a constitutional monarchy eith*r grows or is systemntically formed . There could have been a king chosen , had the people sought for one ; but whence could a nobility have been drawn ? We say nothing of the strongly defined social distinctions that existed in the Colonial age , for they are as apt to exist in republics as under monarchies . Another of Mr. Van Buren 's errors is his assumption that the triumph of the Democratic party in this country , and its long ascendency , were due to the action of the agricultural interest , the farmers and planters , who feared that liberty would he lost , should the rule of the Federalists be continued . " A great preponderance of the landed interest in every part of the country , " he says , sustained " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the re-election of John Adams to the Presidency . Now nothing can be more satisfactorily estnblished than this fact , that Mr. Adams was defeated through the result of a local election in a place that had the least pretensions to an agricultural character of any in the United States . The Presidential election of 1800 - 1801 depended for its decision on the vote of the State of New York ; and the Electors being chosen by the Legislature , the contest was narrowed down to the , result of the contest for members to the House of Assembly in New York City . Through the exertions of Aaron Burr , the Democratic candidates were chosen ; and in consequence of this*victory in a great commercial town , the Democrats obtained the votes of the twelve New York Electors . This secured seventy-three votes for Mr. Jefferson in the Electoral Colleges , leaving but sixty-five for Mr. Adams . New York City was at that time the first commercial place in the country , having sixty thousand inhabitants . Philadelphia had a larger population , but it was inferior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dominion of commercial influences . Thus the Democratic or old Republican party owed its first great victory to the political action of a mercantile community . There were few manufactures in the country at that time , agriculture and commerce all but monopolizing the attention of active and industrious men ; and as the North was then full of farmers , and most of its votes were given for Mr. Adams , we see no reason for supposing that Mr. Jefferson owed his election to the attachment of the agricultural interest . It can with no show of fairness be pretended that New England and New Jersey , which gave their forty-six electoral votes for Mr. Adams , were less pronouncedly agricultural communities than Virginia , the Carolinas , Georgia , and Kentucky , which gave forty-five votes for Mr. Jefferson . The votes of Pennsylvania were almost equally divided , - eight being given for Mr. Jefferson , and seven for Mr. Adams . Maryland 's votes were equally divided , five to five . And while Tennessee gave her three votes for Mr. Jefferson , Delaware gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various interests of the country were not far from unequally represented by the two parties that then contended for supremacy . The division of parties was , judging from the sources of their respective electoral votes , rather of a sectional character than one of interests , - more than four fifths of the votes given for Mr. Adams being from Northern States , and more than two thirds of those given for Mr. Jefferson being from Southern States . We have dwelt on this point because nothing is more common than to hear it said , or to find it stated in books , that victory in the decisive contest between the old Republicans and the Federalists was won by the former through the favor of the agricultural interest , - a statement without any foundation in the comprehensive sense in which it is made . If we look at the details of the contested elections since that of 1800 , we shall not find that the agricultural interest has extended an undivided support to the Democratic party . Mr. Van Buren might have found in the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts that are fatally adverse to his claim of a necessary connection between farming and attachment to Democratic party politics . As New York 's territory was settled , the number of farmers there greatly increased , and so did the number of anti-Democratic voters . The new counties , " Western New York , " became noted for their unflinching hostility to Democratic politics . The country " West of the Bridge " gave prodigious majorities against Democratic candidates , and it was relied upon to outvote the older part of the State , which was favorable to Democracy . It did so on more than one occasion . Mr. Van Buren lost the electoral vote of his own State in 1840 , because Western New York // was opposed to his re-election . Since that time we have seen great Democratic majorities in New York City rendered unavailable through the heavy anti-Democratic majorities cast by the agricultural counties of tho western part of the State . No longer ago than last year the Democrats were beaten in the State of New York through the hostility felt for their opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted for them by a majority that was counted by tens of thousands . They relied , indeed , upon their strength in the city to effect their restoration in the State ; and they were bitterly disappointed when they found that their urban masses were not able , though voting early and - voting often , to out-count the honest farming population . Yet a third error in the " Inquiry " is the assertion that there has been no material modification of the character and principles of parties in this country . The old Republican or Democratic party has undergone various modifications of a very radical character . In about a dozen years after the election of Mr. Jefferson to the Presidency , it had adopted most of the Hamiltonian theories , and its practices were in accordance therewith . It created a second national bank , and one of far greater proportions than that the creation of which had so alarmed the old Republicans a quarter of a century earlier . It became a protectionist party , and forced the manufacturing system on reluctant New England . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It created a navy , built fortifications , and kept up a standing army in time of peace . These were the very things which the Jeffersonian Republicans most condemned when the Federalists were in office , and yet the men who were most conspicuous in effecting changes so sweeping were all Jeffersonian Republicans . The administration of Mr. Monroe would have commanded the support of Alexander Hamilton himself . When Mr. Jefferson saw what was going on at Washington under the third President in succession of that Virginian line which he had himself founded , he must have thought that the time for the correction of his remark , that all Americans were Republicans and Federalists , had come , and that all Americans were nothing but Federalists . The " era of good feeling " came about as a matter of course ; for the Republicans had possession of the government , and the Federalists had possession of the Republican party . The late Mr. J. Q. Adams used to say that the party in opposition was a Republican ( or Democratic ) party , and the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational explanation of the matter that ever has been given . The country ever has been governed in accordance with Federal principles ; and every opposition party we have known has avowed principles not unlike to those which found favor with Jefferson and John // Taylor of Caroline seventy years since . The sentiments avowed by the Hartford Conventionists might be incorporated into the " platform " of a Democratic national convention this year without one man in a hundred being aware of their origin , while all Democrats would subscribe to them so long as they should be in ignorance of their source . Much has been said of the strong centralizing tendencies of the existing gov8rnment as controlled by Congress ; but it is not more centralizing than was the administration of Mr. Monroe , of which Mr. Calhoun , Mr. Crawford , and Mr. Wirt were members , - and they were Jeffersonian Republicans . The occurrence of the civil war may have accelerated the development of centralizing principles in this our day , as the occurrence of the second war with England accelerated it half a century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an anti-Democratic ascendency , the first happened when the Democratic party was supreme , and master of all the land . 2. - Letter of the Hon. Hugh 3k Culloch , Secretary of the Treasury of the United States , to William Cray and others of Boston , Miay 22 , 1867 . Boston Daily Advertiser , May 28 , 1867 . IT often happens that the unofficial writings of public men assume the importance of state papers . A few weeks ago , after the miscarriage of some liberal amendment to the Reform Bill , a private note of Mr. Gladstone , addressed to one of his supporters , was construed into a personal abdication of the leadership of the great Liberal p*irty of England . Mr. McCulloch 's recent letter , declining the honor of a public dinner tendered to him by certain citizens of Boston , has even higher claim to an official character than the familiar talk which he addressed to his neighbors at Fort Wayne in the autumn of 1865 . That speech was made and accepted as a declaration of the principles on which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Having come into office in March , he could make no official report till December . He therefore seized an earlier opportunity to speak to . the country through his more immediate constituents . Since that time the Fort Wayne speech has been more often quoted and referred to than any of Mr. McCulloch 's official papers . Cabinet ministers in this country , having no seats in Congress such as British ministers have in Parliament , seldom get a chance to speak officially , so that they are forced to seize upon any chance occasion which presents itself to get their views and purposes before the country . At the present time , when so much depends on the management of // the finances , it is very necessary that there should be a good understanding between the Secretary of the Treasury and the business public . To a large degree he holds their destinies in his hands , and they have a right to know how he intends to deal with them . What he proposes to do in reference to the currency , as to funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold and other funds in the treasury , should be foreshadowed as long beforehand as the Secretary himself can clearly see . In his late letter Mr. McCulloch gives us to understand that the monthly statement for the rest of the present and the early part of the next fiscal year ( that is , during the summer and autumn now upon us ) will not be as satisfactory as they have been for many months past. * " The donations or bounties to soldiers , preparations for a threatening Indian war , even if the war itself should be avoided , and very liberal appropriations of a miscellaneous character , will cause unusually heavy drafts to be made upon the treasury ; while , on the other hand , the general failure of the wheat crop and the partial failure of the corn crop last year , slow progress in the restoration of the Southern States to their proper relations with the Federal government , the dulness of trade throughout the country , - partly the result of a decrease of production , and partly the natural reaction which always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced taxes , will very considerably affect our revenues . This combination of adverse circumstances may retard a return to specie payments , and , with large issues of bonds to be made to the Pacific Railroad and its branches or divisions , will prevent for a brief season a reduction of the public debt , and may even render a temporary increase of it unavoidable ; but it will not weaken my faith in our ability to move on again in the right direction at an early day . On the contrary , I believe that this check to our progress will lead to improvements in our revenue laws , and to an increase of efficiency in their execution , hasten the representation in Congress of the Southern States , and secure greater economy in all branches of the public service . This is a timely warning against the dangers of extravagance . The ease with which money has been raised by taxation since the war * The public debt reached its maximum on the 31st of August , 1865 , when it amounted to $2,757,803,000 . On the 1st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2,515,616,000 ,  --  a decline of $242,187,000 in a period of twenty.one months ; an average of more than eleven and a half millions a month . Since October 31 , 1866 , the reduction has been $35,809,000 , or at the rate of a little over five millions a month . But these payments do not by any means show the magnitude of the work accomplished by the Treasury Department . One of the most uncomfortable features of the debt at the close of the war was the large amount of it unfunded , - being either due at short dates or on demand . In the twelve months ending with June 1 , 1867 , the amount of this class of debt either paid off or funded into long bonds was more than $527,000,000 . Of this amount $ 167,000,000 were temporary loans , and $28,000,000 greenbacks. // ended , and the vigor with which we have grappled with the public debt , have led to wild and dangeroi*s notions , both in Congress and among the people , as to the extent and availability of our resources . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of laws appropriating money to great schemes of internal improvement , helps to open the eyes of the people to the folly and danger of adding to the public debt . The business of the latter years of the war and of the first year of peace was so profitable , that it was an easy matter to pay the taxes ; but during the last year it can not be doubted that many branches of business paid taxes , not from income , but from capital . Such a state of things , if continued , is fatal to the industry involved , and is calculated to awaken the liveliest anxiety . It is just as dangerous for a nation as it is for an individual to consume its substance ; and no kind of business which is of a beneficial character , and is suitable to the country , should be permitted to be paralyzed by taxation . The present system of internal taxes is not only burdensome in its rates , but vexatious by the constant repetition of them in the successive processes of production . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crude and wholesale taxes imposed during the war , these must be still further reduced before business can recover a healthy tone . Added to this inherent difficulty , there has been a variety of untoward circumstances helping to prostrate the industry of the country during the last year . A short cotton crop left the South poorer at the end of the year than at the beginning . They had , therefore , very little to begin the new year with ; while the heavy decline in cotton discouraged immigration and the introduction of capital from the North . Southern planting has settled down upon the conditions of an ordinary business , with the speculative element eliminated . In the West the wheat crop was also a failure ; and thus another great customer of the Atlantic and Middle States has been restricted in its means of buying . In New England and Pennsylvania , the high cost of production , and the limited and slackening demand for products , have made nearly every class of manufacture unremunerative . The woollen trade , especially , has suffered largely in consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods and machinery . Trade languishes ; and commerce and transportation , whether by land or water , find no employment in the4 absence of production . In this state of things there is much feverishness in business circles , and , though money is abundant , there is great caution exercised in the investment of it , and a general distrust of credit . Some apprehensions have been felt that the summer would not pass over without a crisis . But convulsions in business , as well as in the human system , come from // fear , and not from exhaustion . Crises , according to Dr. Juglar , result from the abuse of high he%lth , and not from a low state of the system . The most serious danger of a crisis is when the opportunities for profitable investment are so numerous , that they are permitted to absorb too much of the working capital of a country . At present there is no lack of working capital , while few industries are profitable enough to attract it , and of money , such as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of Federal bonds , and the extent of domestic credits is very limited . The country is , therefore , neither sufficiently active nor sufficiently in debt to make a general failure probable . It waits and watches ; waits for an abun dant harvest and a new cotton crop , waits for the remoter remedy of action by Congress in the tax laws , and watches anxiously every movement of the financial machinery of the government . There was never so much financial speculation in the newspapers , never so much financial talk in the streets , the railway cars , and other places of casual meeting . In truth , there are now no questions really so interesting to the whole body of the people as those which relate to the currency , to taxation , and to the policy of the Treasury Department . It may be judged , therefore , with what eagerness the writers of money articles and the frequenters of the exchange have seized upon Mr. McCulloch 's letter . It produced a sensible impression on stocks , and was a welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and intricate combinations , and generally by financial hocus-pocus . On the whole , the bulls have been able to make the most out of it . It is regarded as a favorable feature in the stock market that the public debt is not likely to be reduced as rapidly as heretofore , and that there is to be no considerable reduction of the currency for some months to come . As the circumstances which make this modification of Mr. McCulloch 's plans necessary for the time grow out of the unprosperous condition of the country , it is difficult to see how any of the stocks which are dealt in on the exchange - all of them , except the public debt , being the rep- ' resentatives of some industrial interest - can be benefited thereby , and not injured . But it only goes to show how much more the price of stocks depends on the state of the money market than on the condition of industry . A leading purpose of Mr. McCulloch 's letter is to explain why he has not reduced the currency , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reasons which he assigns are ( 1 . ) That the majority of Congress was opposed to it , and that , as finance minister , he is especially dependent on them . In reference to this point , it seems to us the Secrett*ry 's deference to the opinions of Congress comes a little // late . If he had been more considerate of their opinions on political questions a year ago , they would have paid more deference to his financial counsels during the last session . lIt will be glory enough for Mr. McCulloch if he can , in his four years ' management , fund the public debt , make some sensible progress in its reduction , and bring us back to specie payments . He is a cabinet minister , it is true , and in that capacity one of the advisers of the President ; but his chief business is with the treasury , and when he accepted office he did so as the peculiar minister of the House of Representatives . Sir Robert Peel abandoned his party that he might carry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have managed to avoid a quarrel with Congress , when the good of the country so much required harmony and hearty co-operation between them ? The other reasons which he assigns are - ( 2 . ) That , in the present feverish temper of business circles , with much prevalent misconception of the true function and working of the currency , any considerable reduction of it would increase the distrust , and possibly precipitate disaster . ( 3 . ) That the payment of the compound-interest notes falling due this year demanded his first attention , and would in itself operate as a contraction of the currency . These notes are largely held by banks , as a part of their necessary reserve of legal-tender notes . When they are withdrawn , it will be necessary to hold greenbacks in place of them , and thus the effect on the circulation will be the same as withdrawing so many greenbacks. ( 4 . ) That , while so many real and grave causes exist to embarrass the business of the country , he does not feel willing to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real evils , and prevent the application of appropriate remedies . We think , in all these excuses , the Secretary betrays a consciousness of impaired influence , both with Congress and the people . We do not think , however , that he has the least reason to distrust his power over the people . The very signatures to the letter inviting him to Boston are a proof that we are right in this opinion ; for probably a large majority of the signers have not agreed with Mr. McCulloch 's political views . While he may err in particular measures , we believe the Secretary 's general line of policy is eminently wise , and so plain as to be understood and approved by all disinterested people ; - to fund the debt first , because , as an old banker , he can not sleep quietly with a debt impending which he is not prepared to pay ; to bring us back to specie payments ; and then to establish a steady scheme of liquidation , so that the current idea now prevailing in the country , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to be paid in one or two generations , may // never be abandoned ; and combined with these measures , and as accessory to all of them , a better revenue system , which shall tax the people without overburdening them . *f some of these measures we shall speak in noticing other publications . The concluding passages of the letter aver the confidence of the Secretary in the correctness of his past measures , and his purpose to adhere to the same policy in future ; through which he feels sure that he can bring the country out of present shadows into the sunlight of prosperity . They are as follows : - " I am as much persuaded as ever of the importance of an early return to specie payments , and of a reduction of the currency , as a means of checking extravagance and speculation , and of increasing production , without which all efforts to restore permanently the specie standard will be ineffectual . What the country needs , in order that specie payments may be resumed and maintained , and real prosperity secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our former habits of economy . As a people , among ourselves , we must earn more and spend less . In our trade with foreign nations , we must sell more or buy less . Any different prescription for existing financial evils is , in my judgment , quackery . That contraction will tend to bring about this desirable condition of things , I have never doubted It has been my constant aim so to manage the national finances as to aid in bringing the country to a healthy financial condition , without being subjected to the severe disasters which many judicious persons have supposed a large debt , and the derangement of business , and the diminution of industry , occasioned by the war and a redundant currency , would render inevitable . My faith that this can be accomplished is unshaken . The causes which are now operating against us are exceptional and temporary The people are beginning again to comprehend this important truth , which seems to have been disregarded for some years past , that prosperity is the result of labor ; that industry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual wealth . I shall be grievously disappointed if another year does not witness a large increase of industry , of enterprise , and of revenue , decided progress toward a resumption of specie payments , and a steady reduetion of the public debt .
