ATLANTIC MONTHLY . A Magazine of Literature , Sczence , Art , and Politics . VOL . XVI . - OCTOBER , i86*. - NO . XCVI . SAINTS WHO HAVE HAD BODIES . ALL doubtless remember the story which is told of the witty Charles II . and the Royal Society : How one day the King brought to the attention of its members a most curious and inexplicable phenomenon , which he stated thus : " When you put a trout into a pail full of water , why does not the water overflow ? " The savans , naturally enough , were surprised , and suggested many wise , but fruitless explanations ; until at last one of their number , having no proper reverence for royalty in his heart , demanded that the experiment should actually he tried . Then , of course , it was proved that there was no phenomenon to be explained . The water overflowed fast enough . Indeed , it is chronicled that the evolutions of this lively member of the piscatory tribe were so brisk , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namely , how to keep the water in . This story may be a pure fable , but the lesson it teaches is true and important . It illustrates forcibly the facility with which even wise men accept doubtful propositions , and then apply the whole power of their minds to explain them , and perhaps to defend them . Latterly one hears constantly of the physical decay which threatens the American people , because of their unwise and disproportioned stimulation of the brain . It is assumed , almost as an axiom , that there is " a deficiency of physical health in America . " Especially is it assumed that great mental progress , either of races or of individuals , has been generally purchased at the expense of the physical frame . Indeed , it is one of the questions of the day , how the saints , that is , those devoted to literary and professional pursuits , shall obtain good and serviceable bodies ; or , to widen the query , how the finest intellectual culture can exist side by side with the noblest physical development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that shall touch us most sharply , how our boys and girls can obtain all needful knowledge and mental discipline , and yet keep full of graceful and buoyant vitality . What do we say to the theories and convictions which are underneath this language ? What answer shall we make to these questions ? What answer ought we to make ? Our first reply would be , Entered according to Act of Congress , in the year 1865 , by TICKNOR AND FIELDS , in the Clerk 's Office of the District Court of the District of Massachusetts . // We doubt the proposition . We ask for the broad and firm basis of undoubted facts upon which it rests . And we enter an opposite plea . We affirm that the saints have as good bodies as other people , and that they always did have . We deny that they need to be patched up or watched over any more than their neighbors . They live as long and enjoy as much as the rest of mankind . They can endure as many hard buffets , and come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose intellectual bark foundered in the unsounded depths of his primer . The world 's history through , the races which are best taught have the best endowment of health . Nay , in our own New England , with just such influences , physical , mental , and moral , as actually exist , there is no deterioration in real vitality to weep over . We hold , then , on this subject very different opinions from those which prevail in many quarters . We believe in the essential healthfulness of literary culture , and in the invigorating power of sound knowledge . Emphatically do we believe that our common schools have been in the aggregate a positive physical benefit . We are confident , that , just to the degree that the unseen force within a man rec@ives its rightful development , does vigorous life flow in every current that beats from heart to extremities . With entire respect for the opinions of others , even while we can not concur with them , with a readiness to admit that the assertion of those opinions may have been indirectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks to us , to exhibit the facts which bear upon this subject in the shape and hue they have to our own minds , and to give the grounds of our conviction that a cultivated mind is the best friend and ally of the body . Would it not be singular , if anything different were true ? You say , and you say rightly , that the best part of a man is his mind and soul , those spiritual elements which divide him from all the rest of the creation , animate or inanimate , and make him lord and sovereign over them all . You say , and you say wisely , that the body , however strong and beautiful , is nothing , - that the senses , however keen and vigorous , are nothing ,  - -  that the outward glories , however much they may minister to sensual gratification , are nothing , - unless they all become the instruments for the upbuilding of the immortal part in man . But what a tremendous impeachment of the wisdom or power of the Creator you are bringing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether by its direct influence on the body , or indirectly by the habits of life which it creates , is destructive of all the rest , nay , self-destructive. ! You may show that every opening bud in spring , and every joint , nerve , and muscle in every animate creature , are full of proofs of wise designs accomplishing their purposes , and it shall all count for less than nothing , if you can demonstrate that the mind , in its highest , broadest development , brings anarchy into the system , - or , mark it well , produces , or tends to produce , habits of living ruinous to health , and so ruinous to true usefulness . At the outset , therefore , the very fact that the mind is the highest creation of Divine wisdom would force us to believe that that development of it , that increase of knowledge , that sharpening of the faculties , that feeding of intellectual hunger , which does not promote joy and health in every part , must be false and illegitimate indeed . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a rational being , thought is almost synonymous with vitality of all sorts . The brain throws out its network of nerves to every part of the body ; and those nerves are the pathways along which it sends , not alone physical volitions , but its mental force and high intelligence , to mingle by a subtile chemistry with every fibre , and give it a finer life and a more bounding elasticity . So one might foretell , before the study of a single fact of experience , that , other things being equal , he who had few or no thoughts would have not only a dormant mind , but also a sluggish and // inert body , less active than another , less enduring , and especially less defiant of physical ills . And one might prophesy , too , that he who had high thoughts and wealth of knowledge would have stored up in his brain a magazine of reserved power wherewith to support the faltering body : a prophecy not wide apart , perhaps , from any broad and candid observation of human life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cultivated mind has over one sunk in sloth and ignorance , - how much wider an outlook , how much larger and more varied interests , and how these things support when outward props fail , how they strengthen in misfortune and pain , and keep the heart from anxieties which might wear out the body ? Scott , dictating " Ivanhoe ' * in the midst of a torturing sickness , and so rising , by force of a cultivated imagination , above all physical anbuish , to revel in visions of chivalric splendor , is but the type of men everywhere , who , but for resources supplied by the mind , would have sunk beneath the blows of adverse fortune , or else sought forgetfulness in brutalizing and destructive pleasures . ( Sometimes a book is better far than medicine , and more truly soothing than the best anodyne . ) Sometimes a rich-freighted memory is more genial than many companions . Sometimes a firm mind , that has all it needs within itself , is a watchtower to which we may flee , and from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He who does not understand this has either had a most fortunate experience , or else has no culture , which is really a part of himself , woven into the very texture of the soul . So , if there were no facts , considering the mind , and who made it , and how it is related to the body , and how , when it is a good mind and a *vell-stored mind , it seems to stand for all else , to be food and shelter and comfort and friend and hope , who could believe anything else than that a well-instructed soul could do nought but good to its servant the body ? After all , we can not evade , and we ought not to seek to evade , the testimony of facts . No cause can properly stand on any theory , however pleasant and cheering , or however plausible . What , then , of the facts , of the painful facts of experience , which are said to tell so different a tale ? This , - that the physical value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these very facts . We know what is the traditional picture of the scholar , - pale , stooping , hectic , hurrying with unsteady feet to a predestined early grave ; or else morbid , dyspeptic , cadaverous , putting into his works the dark tints of his own inward nature . At best , he is painted as a mere bookworm , bleached and almost mildewed in some learned retirement beneath the shadow of great folios , until he is out of joint with the world , and all fresh and hearty life has gone out of him . Who can not recall just such pictures , wherein one knows nat which predominates , the ludicrous or the pitiful ? We protest against them all . In the name of truth and commonsense alike , we indignantly reject them . We have a vision of a sturdier manhood : of the genial , open countenance of an Irving ; of the homely , honest strength that shone in every feature of a Walter Scott ; of the massive vigor of a Goethe or a Humboldt . How much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own people , - how the jaw is retreating , how the frame is growing slender and gaunt , how the chest flattens , and how tenderly we ought to cherish every octogenarian among us , for that we are seeing The last of them ! If this is intended to be a piece of pleasant badinage , far be it from us to arrest a single smile it may awaken . But if it is given as a serious description , from which serious deductions can be drawn , then we say , that , as a delineation , it is , to a considerable extent , purely fanciful , - as an argument , utterly so . The facts , so far as they are ascertained , point unwaveringly to this conclusion , - that every advance of a people in knowledge and refinement is accompanied by as striking : an advance in health and strength . // Try this question , if you please , on the largest possible scale . Compare the uneducated savage with his civilized brother . His form has never been bent by confinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame . And if unremitting exercise amid the free airs of heaven will alone make one strong , then he will be strong . Is the savage stronger ? Does he live more years ? Can he compete side by side with civilized races in the struggle for existence ? Just the opposite is true . Our puny boys , as we sometimes call them , in our colleges , will weigh more , lift more , endure more than any barbarian race of them all . This day the gentle Sandwich-Islanders are wasting like snow-wreaths , in contact with educated races . This day our red men are being swept before advancing civilization like leaves before the breath of the hurricane . And it requires no prophet 's eye to see , that , if we do not give the black man education as well as freedom , an unshackled mind as well as unshackled limbs , he , too , will share the same fate . To all this it may naturally be objected , that the reason so many savage races do not display the greatest physical stamina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native or acquired , - or because they bring no wisdom to the conduct of life , but dwell in smoky huts , eat unhealthy food , go from starvation to plethora and from plethora to starvation again , exchange the indolent lethargy which is the law of savage life for the frantic struggles of war or the chase which diversify and break up its monotony . Allow the objection ; and then what have we accomplished , but carrying the argument one step back ? For what are self-control and self-care , but the just fruits of intelligence ? But in truth it is a combination of all these influences , and not any of them alone , that enables the civilized man to outlive and outrival his barbarian brother . He succeeds , not simply because of the superior address and sagacity which education gives him , though that , no doubt , has much to do with it ; not altogether because his habits of life are better , though we would not underrate their value ; but equally because the culture of the brain gives a finer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater hardihood to every fibre which is woven into his flesh . If it is not so , how do you explain the fact that our colored soldier , fighting in his native climate , with the same exposure in health and the same care in sickness , succumbs to wounds and diseases over which his white comrade triumphs ? Or how will you explain analogous facts in the history of disease among other uneducated races ? Our explanation is simple . As the slightest interfusion of carbon may change the dull iron into trenchant steel , so intelligence working through invisible channels may add a new temper to the physical nature . And thus it maybe strictly true that it is not only the mind and soul which slavery and ignorance wrong , but the body just as much . It may be said , and perhaps justly , that a comparison between races so unlike is not a fair comparison . Take , then , if you prefer , the intelligent and unintelligent periods in the history of the same race . The old knights Those men with mail-clad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as symbols of masculine strength ! The old knights ! They were not scholars . Their constitutions were not ruined by study , or by superfluous sainthood of any kind . They were more at home with the sword than the pen . They loved better " to hear the lark sing than the mouse squeak . " So their minds were sufficiently dormant . How was it with their bodies ? Were they sturdier men ? Did they stand heavier on their feet than their descendants ? It is a familiar fact that the armor which inclosed them will not hold those whom we call their degenerate children . A friend tells me that in the armory of London Tower there are preserved scores , if not hundreds , of the swords of those terrible Northmen , those Vikings , who , ten centuries ago , swept // the seas and were the dread of all Europe , and that scarcely one of them has a hilt large enough to be grasped by a man of this generation . Of races who have left behind them no methodical records , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their poets and ruder chronicles , it is not safe to make positive affirmations ; but all the indications are that the student of today is a larger and stronger man than the warrior of the Middle Ages . If we come down to periods of historical certainty , no one will doubt that the England of the present hour is more educated than the England of fifty years ago , or that the England of fifty years since had a broader diffusion of intelligence than the England of a century previous . Yet that very intelligence has prolonged life . An Englishman lives longer to-day than he did in i8oo , and longer yet than in 1700 . Here is a curious proof . Annuities calculated on a certain rate of life in 1694 would yield a fortune to those who issued them . Calculated at the same rate in 1794 , they would ruin them ; for the more general diffusion of knowledge and refinement had added , I am not able to say how many years to the average British life . Observe how this statement is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6oo to 1700 the average length of life in that city was is years 3 months . From 1700 to 1750 it was 27 years 9 months . From 1750 to i8oo , 31 years 3 months . From i8oo to 18y3 , 43 years 6 months . One more pertinent fact . Take in England any number of families you please , whose parents can read and write , and an equal number of families whose parents can not read and write , and the number of children in the latter class of families who will die before the age of five years will greatly exceed that in the former class , - some thirty or forty per cent . So surely does a thoughtful ordering of life come in the train of intelligence . If faith is to be placed in statistics of any sort , then it holds true in foreign countries that 389 human life is long in proportion to the degree that knowledge , refinement , and virtue are diffused . That is , sainthood , so far from destroying the body , preserves it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last argument . Abroad , we are told , there is such an element of healthy , out-door life , that any ill effects which might naturally follow in the train of general education are neutralized . Abroad , too , education with the masses is elementary , and advanced also with more moderation than with us . Abroad , moreover , the whole social being is not pervaded with the intense intellectual activity and fervor which are so characteristic especially of New England life . Come home , then , to our own Massachusetts , which some will have is school-mad . What do you find ? Here , in a climate proverbially changeable and rigorous , - here , where mental and moral excitements rise to fever-heat , here , where churches adorn every landscape , and school-houses greet us at every corner , and lyceums are established in every village , - here , where newspapers circulate by the hundred thousand , and magazines for our old folks , and " Our Young Folks , " too , reach fifty thousand , - here , in Massachusetts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in bonnie England , or vine-clad France , or sunny Italy . I read some statistics the other day , and I have ever since had a greater respect for the land of " east-winds and salt - fish and school - houses , " as . scandalous people have termed Massachusetts . What do these statistics say ? That , while in England the deaths reach annually 2.21 per cent of the whole population , and in France 2.36 per cent , , and in Italy 2.94 per cent , and in Austria 3.34 per cent , in Massachusetts .. the deaths are only 1.82 per cent annually . Even in Boston , with its large proportion of foreign elements , the percentage of deaths is only 2.35 . It may be said , in criticism of these statements , . that in our country statistics are not . // 390 kept with sufficient accuracy to furnish correct data . However this may be in our rural districts , it certainly is not true of the metropolis . The figures are not at hand , but they exist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a population most purely native reach a salubrity unexcelled . So that , with all the real drawbacks of climate , and the pretended drawbacks of unnatural or excessive mental stimulus , the health here is absolutely unequalled by that of any country in Europe . Certainly , if the mental and moral sainthood which we have does not build up the body , it can not be said that it does any injury to it . Have we noted what a splendid testimony the war which has just closed has given to the physical results of our educational trainino ? A hundred or a thousand young men taken from our New England villages and put into the ranks of our army - young men who learned the alphabet at four , who all through boyhood had the advantages of our common-school system , who had felt to the full the excitement of the intellectual life about them - have stood taller , weighed heavier , fought more bravely and intelligently , won victory out of more adverse circumstances , and , what is more to the point , endured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any other race on earth . We care not where you look for comparison , whether to Britain , or to France , or to Russia , where the spelling-book has almost been tabooed , or to Spain , where in times past the capacity to read the Bible was scarcely less than rank heresy , at least for the common people . This war has been brought to a successful issue by the best educated army that ever fought on battle-field , or , as the new book has it , by " the thinking bayonet , " by men whose physical manhood has received no detriment from their intellectual culture . These assertions are founded upon statistics*which have been preserved of regiments whose members were almost exclusively native-born . And the re*uits are certainly in accordance with all candid observation . It may , indeed , be said that the better health of our army has been after all the result of the better care which the soldier has taken of himself . We answer , the better care was the product of his education . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great measure to the superior watchfulness exercised over the soldier by others , by the Government , by the Sanitary Commission , and by State agencies . Then we reply , that this tenderness of the soldier , if tenderness it be , and this sagacity , if sagacity prompted the care , were both the offspring of that high intelligence which is the proper result of popular education . There is but one possible mode of escape from such testimony . This whole train of argument is inconclusive , it may be asserted , because what is maintained is not that intellectual culture is unhealthful , where it is woven into the web of active life , but only where the pursuit of knowledge is one 's business . It may be readily allowed , that , where the whole nature is kept alive by the breath of outward enterprise , when the great waves of this world 's excitements are permitted to roll with purifying tides into the inmost recesses of the soul , the results of mental culture may be modified . But what of the saints ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you restrain us to that line of inquiry , the argument will he trebly strong , and the facts grow overwhelmingly pertinent and conclusive . Will you examine the careful registry of deaths in Massachusetts which has been kept the last twenty years ? It will inform you that the classes whose average of life is high up , almost the highest up , are with us the classes that work with the brain , - the judges , the lawyers , the physicians , the clergymen , the professors in your colleges . The very exception to this statement rather confirms than contradicts our general position , that intellectual culture is absolutely invigorating . The cultivators of the soil live longest . But note that // it is the educated , intelligent farmers , the farmers of Massachusetts , the farmers of a State of common schools , the farmers who link thought to labor , who live long . And doubtless , if they carried more thought into their labor , if they were more intelligent , if they were better educated , they would live yet longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her soil , her down-trodden peasantry , sluggish and uneducated , do not live out half their days . Very likely the farmer 's lot , 1z51us education and i5lus habits of mental activity , is the healthiest as it is the primal condition of man . Nevertheless , considering what is the general opinion , it is surprising how slight is the advantage which he has even then over the purely literary classes . Will you go to Harvard University and ascertain what becomes of her children ? Take up , then , Dr. Palmer 's Necrology of the Alumni of Harvard from 1851 to 1863 . You will learn , that , while the average age of all persons who in Massachusetts die after they have attained the period of twenty years is but fifty years , the average age of Harvard graduates , who die in like manner , is fifty - eight years . Thus you have , in favor of the highest form of public education known in the State , a clear average of eight years . You may examine backward the Triennial Catalogue as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the testimony essentially different . The statement will stand impregnable , that , from the time John Harvard founded our little College in the wilderness , to this hour , when it is fast becoming a great University , with its schools in every department , and its lectures covering the whole field of human knowledge , the graduates have always attained a longevity surpassing that of their generation . And you are to observe that this comparison is a strictly just comparison . We contrast not the whole community , old and young , with those who must necessarily have attained manhood before they are a class at all ; but adults with adults , graduates with those of other avocations who have arrived at the period of twenty years . Neither do we compare the bright and peculiar luminaries of Harvard with the mass of men , - though , in fact , it is well known that the best scholars live the most years ,  - -  but we compare the whole body of the graduates , bright and dull , studious and unstudious , with the whole body of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought from all the registries of all the states and universities under heaven , some may triumphantly exclaim , " Statistics are unworthy of trust . " " To lie like statistics , " " false as a fact , " these are the stalest of witticisms . But the objection to which they give point is practically frivolous . Grant that statistics are to a certain degree doubtfuj , are they not the most trustworthy evidence we have ? And in the question at issue , are they , not the only evidence which has real force ? And allowing their general defectiveness , how shall we explain , that , though , gathered from all sides and by all kinds of people , they so uniformly favor education ? Why , if they must err , do they err so pertinaciously in one direction ? How does it happen , that , summon as many witnesses as you please , and crossquestion them as severely as you can , they never falter in this testimony , that , where intelligence abounds , there physical vigor does much , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there the years are many and happy ? If , therefore , facts can prove anything , it is that just such a condition of life as that which is growing more and more general among us , and which our common-school system directly fosters , where every man is becoming an educated man ,  --  where the farmer upon his acres , the merchant at his desk , and the mechanic in his shop , no less than the scholar poring over his books shall be in the truest sense educated ,  --  that such a condition is the one of all others which promotes habits of thought and action , an elasticity of temper and a 39 ' // breadth of vision and interest most conducive to health and vigor . It is the fashion to talk of the appearance of superior robustness so characteristic of our English brethren . But we suspect that in this case , too , appearances are deceitful . That climate may produce in us a restless energy inconsistent with rounded forms and rosy cheeks we freely allow . But in strength and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the stern logic of facts shows beyond a peradventure , that here there are no influences , climatic or intellectual , which war with longevity . What may he hidden in the future , what results may come from a still wider diffusion of education , we can not tell , hut hitherto nothing but good has come of ever-increasing knowledge . We hasten now to inquire concerning the health and years of special classes of literary men : not , indeed , to prove that there is no real war between the mind and the body , - for we consider that point to be already demonstrated , - hut rather to show that we need shrink from no field of inquiry , and that from every fresh field will come new evidence of the substantial truth of our position . We have taken the trouble to ascertam the average age of all the English poets of whom Johnson wrote lives , some fifty or sixty in all . Here are great men and small men , men with immortal names and men whose names were long since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would undermine any constitution , flourishing , too , in a period when human life was certainly far shorter in England than now . And how long did they live ? What do you think ? Thirty , forty years ? No ; they endured their sainthood , or their want of it , for the comfortable period of fifty-six years . Nor is the case a particle different , if you take only the great and memorable names of English poetry . Chaucer , living at the dawn almost of English civilization ; Shakspeare , whose varied and marvellous dramas might well have ex hausted any vitality ; Milton , struggling with domestic infelicity , with political hatred , and with blindness ; Dryden , Pope , Swift : none of these burning and shining lights of English literature went out at mid-day . The result is not altered , if you come nearer our own time . That galaxy of talent and genius which shone with such brilliancy in the Scottish capital at the beginning of the century ,  --  Sydney Smith , Lord Jeffrey , Christopher North , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these , with scarcely an exception , have lived far beyond the average of human life . So was it with the great poets and romancers of that period . Wordsworth , living the life of a recluse near the beautiful lakes of Westmoreland , lasted to fourscore . Southey , after a life of unparalleled literary industry , broke down at sixty-six . Coleridge , with habits which ought to have destroyed him early , lingered till sixty-two . Scott , struggling to throw off a mountain - load of debt , endured superhuman labor till more than sixty . Even Byron and Burns , who did not live as men who desired length of days , died scarcely sooner than their generation . You are not willing , perhaps , to test this question by the longevity of purely literary men . You ask what can be said about the great preachers . You have always heard , that , while the ministers were , no doubt , men of excellent intentions and much sound learning , what with their morbid notions of life , and what with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were saints with the very poorest kind of bodies . Just the contrary . No class lives longer . We once made out a list of the thirty most remarkable preachers of the last four centuries that we could call to mind . Of the age to which most of these attained we had at the outset no idea whatever . In that list were included the men who must figure in every candid account of preaching . The great men of the Reformation , Luther , Melancthon , Calvin , Beza , Knox , were there . That resplendent group which adorned the seventeenth century , and whose // names are synonymes for pulpit eloquence , Barrow , South , Jeremy Taylor , and Tillotson , were prominent in it . The milder lights of the last century , Paley , Blair , Robertson , Priestley , were not . forgotten . The Catholics were represented by Massillon , Bossuet , Bourdaloui* , and F6nelon . The Protestants as truly by Robert Hall and Chalmers , by Wesley and Channing . In short , it was a thoroughly fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those included in it . It was just sixty-nine years . And we invite all persons who are wedded to the notion that the saints are always knights of the broken body , to take pen and paper and jot down the name of every remarkable preacher since the year i*oo that they can recall , and add , if they wish , every man in their own vicinity who has risen in learning and talent above the mass of his profession . We will insure the result without any premium . They will produce a list that would deli , ht the heart of a provident director of a lifeinsurance company . And their average will come as near the old Scripture pattern of threescore years and ten as that of any body of men who have lived since the days of Isaac and Jacob . If now any one has a lurking doubt of the physical value of an active and well-stored mind , let him pass from the preachers to the statesmen , from the men who teach the wisdom of the world to come to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him begin with the grand names of the Long Parliament , - Hampden , Pym , Vane , Cromwell , - and then gather up all the great administrators of the next two centuries , down to the octogenarians who are now foremost in the conduct of British affairs ; and if he wishes to widen his observation , let him pass over the Channel to the Continent , and in France recall such names as Sully and Richelieu , Mazarin and Ccdbert , Talleyrand and Guizot ; in Austria , Kaunitz and Metternich . And when he has made his list as broad , as inclusive of all really great statesmanship everywhere as he can , find his average ; and if he can bring it 393 much beneath seventy , he will be more fortunate than we were when we tried the experiment . Do not by any means omit the men of science . There are the astronomers . If any employment would seem to draw a man up to heaven , it would be this . Yet , of all men , astronomers apparently have had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Place , Herschel , - these are the royal names , the fixed stars , set , as it were , in that very firmament which for so many years they searched with telescopic eye . And yet neither of them lived less than seventy-eight years . As for the men of natural science , it looks as though they were spared by some Providential provision , in order that they might observe and report for long epochs the changes of this old earth of ours . Cuvier dying at seventy-five , Sir Joseph Banks at seventy-seven , Buffon at eighty-one , Blumenbach at eighty-eight , and Humboldt at fourscore and ten , are some of the cases which make such a supposition altogether reasonable . Cross the ocean , and you will find the same testimony , that mental culture is absolutely favorable to physical endurance . The greatest men in our nation 's history , whether in walks of statesmanship , science , or literature , almost without exception , have lived long . Franklin , Washington , Jefferson , Madison , the elder Adams , and Patrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Clay , Calhoun , Webster , Choate , and Everett , Irving , Prescott , Cooper , and Hawthorne , in later times , - are cases in point . These men did not die prematurely . They grew strong by the toil of the brain . And to-day the quartette of our truest poets - Bryant , Whittier , Longfellow , and Holmes - are with us in the hale years of a green age , never singing sweeter songs , never harping more inspiring strains . Long may our ears hear their melodies If now we could enter the walks of private life , and study widely the experience of individual men , we should // 394 have an interesting record indeed , and a manifold and weilnigh irresistible testimony . Consider a few remarkable , yet widely differing cases . Who can read attentively the life of John Wesley , and not exclaim , if varied and exhausting labor , if perpetual excitement and constant drafts upon the brain , would ever wear a man out , he would have worn out ? It was his creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piety that inspired it , his clear mind that legislated for it , his heroic industry that did no mean part of the incessant daily toil needful for its establishment . Yet this man of many labors , who through a long life never knew practically the meaning of the word leisure , says , at seventy-two , " How is it that I find the same strength that I did thirty years ago , that my nerves are firmer , that I have none of the infirmities of old age , and have lost several that I had in youth . " And ten years later , he devoutly records , " Is anything too hard for God ? It is now eleven years since I have felt such a thing as weariness . " And he continued till eighty-eight in full possession of his faculties , laboring with body and mind alike to within a week of his death . Joseph Priestley was certainly a very different man , but scarcely less remarkable . No mean student in all branches of literature , a metaphysician , a theologian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeble frame , and ended a hearty old age at seventy-one . He himself declares at fifty-four , that , " so far from suffering from application to study , I have found my health steadily improve from the age of eighteen to the present time . " You would scarcely find a life more widely divided from these than that of Washington Irving . Nevertheless , it is like them in one respect , that it bears emphatic testimony to the real healthiness of mental exertion . He was the feeblest of striplings at eighteen . At nineteen , Judge Kent said , " He is not long for this world . " His friends sent him abroad at twenty-one , to see if a sea voyage would not husband his strength . So pale , so broken , was he , that , when he stepped on board the ship , the captain whispered , " There is a chap who will be overboard before we are across ! " Irving had , too , his share of misfortunes , - failure in business , loss of investments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of support . Even his habits of study were hardly what the highest wisdom would direct . While he was always genial and social , and at times easy almost to indolence , when the mood seized him , he would write incessantly for weeks and even for months , sometimes fourteen , fifteen , or sixteen hours in a day . But he grew robust for half a century , and writes , at seventy-five , that he has now " a streak of old age . " The example of some of those who are said to have been worn out by intense mental application furnishes perhaps the most convincing proof of all that no reasonable activity of the mind ever warred with the best health of the body . Walter Scott , we are told , wore out . And very likely , to a certain extent , the statement is true . But what had he not accomplished before he wore out ? He had astonished the world with that wonderful series of romances which place him scarcely second to any name in English literature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his generation . He had produced histories which show , that , had he chosen , he might have been as much a master in the region of historic fact as in the realm of imagination . He had edited other men s works ; he had written essays ; he had lent himself with a royal generosity to every one who asked his time or iniluence ; and when , almost an old man , commercial bankruptcy overtook him , and he sought to lift the mountain of his debt by pure intellectual toil , he wore out . But declining years , disappointed hopes , desperate exertions , may wear anybody out . He wore out , but it was at more than threescore years , when nine tenths of his generation had long October , // slept in quiet graves , - when the crowd of the thoughtless and indolent , who began life with him , had rusted out in inglorious repose . Yes , Walter Scott wore out , if you call that wearing out . John Calvin , all his biographers say , wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolonged resistance . Commencing life with the frailest constitution , he was , as early as twenty-five , a model of erudition , and had already written his immortal work . For thirty years he was in the heat and ferment of a great religious revolution . For thirty years he was one of the controlling minds of his age . For thirty years he was the sternest soldier in the Church Militant , bearing down stubborn resistance by a yet more stubborn will . For thirty years neither his brain nor his pen knew rest . And so at fifty-six this man of broken body and many labors laid down the weapons of his warfare ; but it was at Geneva , where the public registers tell us that the average of human life in that century was only nine years . One writes words like these : - " John Kitto died , and his death was the judgment for overwork , and overwork of a single organ , - the brain . " And who was John Kitto ? A poor boy , the son of a drunken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunate lad , who at thirteen fell from a scaffolding and was taken up for dead , and escaped only with total deafness and a supposed permanent injury to the brain . A hapless apprentice , who suffered at the hands of a cruel taskmaster all that brutality and drunken fury could suggest . A youth , thirsting for knowledge , but able to obtain it only by the hardest ways , peering into booksellers ' windows , reading at book-stalls , purchasing cheap books with pennies stained all over with the sweat of his toil . An heroic student , who labored for more than twenty years with almost unparalleled industry , and with an equally unparalleled neglect of the laws of health ; of whom it is scarcely too much to say literally , that he knew no change , but from his desk to his bed , and from his 395 bed to his desk again . A voluminous writer , who , if he produced no work of positive genius , has done more than any other man to illustrate the Scriptures , and to make familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the natural history of the Holy Land . And he died in the harness , - but not so very early , - at fifty . And we say that he would have lived much longer , had he given his constitution a fair chance . But when we remember his passionate fondness for books , how they compensated him for the want of wealth , comforts , and the pleasant voices of wife and children that he could not hear , we grow doubtful . And we hear him exclaim almost in rhapsody , - " If I were blind as well as deaf , in what a wretched situation should I be ! If I could not read , how deplorable would be my condition ! What earthly pleasure equal to the reading of a good book ? 0 dearest tomes ! 0 princely and august folios ! to obtain you ; i would work night and day , and forbid myself every sensual joy ! " When we behold the forlorn man , shut out by his misfortune from so many resources , and finding more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his library , we are tempted to say , No , he would not have lived as long ; had he studied less , he would have remembered his griefs more . Of course it is easy to take exception to all evidence drawn from the life and experience of individual men ,  --  natural to say that one must needs be somewhat old before he can acquire a great name at all , and that our estimate considers those alone to whom mere prolongation of day has given reputation , and forgets " the village Hampdens , the mute , inglorious Miltons , " the unrecorded Newtons , the voiceless orators , sages , or saints who have died and made no sign . To this the simple reply is , that individual cases , however numerous and striking , are not relied upon to prove any position , but only to illustrate and confirm one which general data have already demonstrated* Grant the full force of every criticism , and // then it remains true that the widest record of literary life exhibits no tendency of mental culture to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Indeed , w* do not know where to look for any broad range of facts which would indicate that education here or anywhere else has decreased or is likely to decrease health . And were it not for the respect which we cherish towards those who hold it , we should say that such a position was as nearly pure theory or prejudice or opinion founded on fragmentary data as any view well could he . But do you mean to assert that there is no such thing as intellectual excess ? that intellectual activity never injures ? that unremitting attention to mental pursuits , with an entire abstinence from proper exercise and recreation , is positively invigoratincr ? that robbing the body of sleep , and bending it sixteen or eighteen hours over the desk , is the best way to build it up in grace and strength ? Of course no one would say any such absurd things . There is a right and wrong use of everything . Any part of the system will wear out with excessive use . Overwork kills , but certainly not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it is overwork of the body . Overwork in the study is just as healthful as overwork on the farm or at the ledger or in the smoky shop , toiling and moiling , with no rest and no quickening thoughts . Especially is it true that education does not peculiarly tempt a man to excess . But are you ready to maintain that there is no element of excess infused into our common-school system ? Certainly . Most emphatically there is not . What , then , is there to put over against these terrible statements of excessive labor of six or seven hours a day , under which young brains are reeling and young spines are bending until there are no rosy-cheeked urchins and blooming maids left among us ? The inexorable logic of facts . The public schools of Massachusetts were taught in the years 1863-4 on an average just thirtytwo weeks , just five days in a week , and , making proper allowance for recesses and opening exercises , just five and a quarter hours in a day . Granting now that all the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an average for the three hundred and thirteen working days of the year of two hours and forty-one minutes a day , - an amount of study that never injured any healthy child . But , going back a little to youthful recollections , and considering the amazing proclivity of the young mind to idleness , whispering , and fun and frolic in general , it seems doubtful whether our children ever yet attained to so high an average of actual study as two hours a day . As a modification of this statement , it may be granted that in the cities and larger towns the school term reaches forty weeks in a year . If you add one hour as the average amount of study at home , given by pupils of over twelve years , ( and the allowance is certainly ample , ) you have four hours as the utmost period ever given by any considerable class of children . That there is excess we freely admit . That there are easy committee - men who permit too hi *ha pressure , and infatuated teachers who insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can stop , and silly parents who fondly wish to see their children monstrosities of brightness , lisping Latin and Greek in their cradles , respiring mathematics as they would the atmosphere , and bristling all over with facts of natural science like porcupines , till every bit of childhood is worked out of them , - that such things are , we are not inclined to deny . But they are rare exceptions , - no more a part of the system than white crows are proper representatives of the dusky and cawing brotherhood . Or yet again , do we mean to assert that no attention need be given to the formation of right physical habits ? or that bodily exercise ought not to be joined to mental toils ? or that the walk in the woods , the row upon the quiet river , the stroll with rod in hand by the babbling brook , or with gun on // 397 shoulder over the green prairies , or the skating in the crisp December air on the glistening lake , ought to be discouraged ? Do we speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the paraphernalia of the gymnasium ? Are we aggrieved at the mention of boxing-gloves or single-stick or foils ? Would it shock our nervous sensibilities , if our next-door neighbor the philosopher , or some near-by grave and reverend doctor of divinity , or even the learned judge himself , should give unmistakable evidence that he had in his body the two hundred and odd bones and the five hundred and more muscles ; with all their fit accompaniments of joints and sinews , of which the anatomists tell us ? Not at all . Far from it . We exercise , no doubt , * too little . We know of God 's fair world too much by description , too little by the sight of our own eyes . Welcome anything which leads us out into this goodly and glorious universe ! Welcome all that tends to give the human frame higher grace and symmetry ! Welcome the gymnastics , too , heavy or light either , if they will guide us to a more harmonious physical development . We ourselves own a set of heavy Indian-clubs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have iron dumb-bells and wooden dumbbells . We recollect with considerable satisfaction a veritable bean-bag which did good service in the household until it unfortunately sprung a-leak . In an amateur way we have tried both systems , and felt the better for them . We have a dim remembrance of rowing sundry leagues , and even of dabbling with the rod and line . We always look with friendly eye upon the Harvard Gymnasium , whenever it looms up in actual or mental vision . Never yet could we get by an honest game of cricket or base-ball without losing some ten minutes in admiring contemplation . We bow with deep respect to Dr. Windship and his heavy weights . We bow , if anything , with a trifle more of cordiality to Dr. Lewis and his light weights . They both have our good word . We think that they would have our example , were it not for the fatal proclivity of solitary gymnastics to dulness . If we have not risen to the high degrees in this noble order of muscular Christians , we claim at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all seriousness , we have no faith in mental activity purchased at the expense of physical sloth . It is well to introduce into the school , into the family , and into the neighborhood any movement system which will exercise all the muscles of the body . But the educated man is not any more likely to need this general physical development than anybody else . Establish your gymnasium in any village , and the farmer fresh from the plough , the mechanic from swinging the hammer or driving the plane , will be just as sure to find new muscles that he never dreamed of as the palest scholar of them all . And the diffusion of knowledge and refinement , so far from promoting inactivity and banishing recreations from life , directly feeds that craving for variety out of which healthful changes come , and awakens that noble curiosity which at fit seasons sends a man out to see how the wild - flower grows in the woods , how the green buds open in the spring , how the foliage takes on its painted autumn glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through pathless woods that he may behold the brook laughing in cascade from rock to rock , or to breast the steep mountain that he may behold from a higher outlook the wonders of the visible creation . Other things being equal , the educated man in any vocation is quite as likely as another to be active , quick in every motion and free in every limb . But admit all that is claimed . Admit that increasing intelligence has changed the average of man 's life from the twenty-five years of the seventeenth century to the thirty-five of the eighteenth or the forty - five years of the nineteenth century . Admit , too , that the best edu // cated men of this generation will live five or ten years more than the least educated men . Ought we to he satisfied with things as they are ? Should we not look for more than the forty or fifty years of human life ? Assuredly . But it is not our superfluous sainthood which is destroying life . It is not that we have too much saintliness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence , too small an endowment of virtue and conscience . It is our fierce absorption in outward plans which plants anxieties like thorns in the heart . It is our sloth and gluttony which eat out vitality . It is our unbridled appetites and passions which burn like a consuming fire in our breasts . It is our unwise exposure which saps the strength and gives energy and force to latent disease . These , tenfold more than any intense application of the brain to its legitimate work , limit and destroy human life . The truly cultivated mind tends to give just aims , moderate desires , and good habits . Ay , and when the true sainthood shall possess and rule humanity ,  --  when the fields of knowledge with their wholesome fruits shall tempt every foot away from the forbidden paths of vice and sensual indulgence , - when a wise intelligence shall cool the hot passions which dry up the refreshing fountains of peace and joy in the heart ,  --  when a heavenly wisdom shall lift us above any bondage to this world 's fortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall forbid us to be slaves to any occupation lower than the highest , - when we stand erect and free , clothed with a real saintliness ,  --  then the years of our life may increase , and man may go down to his grave " in a full age , like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season . " Meanwhile we must stand firmly on this assertion , that , the more of mental and moral sainthood our people achieve , the more that sainthood will write fair inscriptions on their bodies , will shine out in intelligence in their faces , will exhibit itself in graceful form and motion , and thus add to the deeper and more lasting virtues physical power , a body which shall be at once a good servant and the proper representative of a refined and elevated soul .
