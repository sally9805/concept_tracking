Scene I.  --  The curtain rises upon a gay festival of a rural character , in one of the inland villages of France . All the parties are French except one young man , Charles Seymour , who pays particular attention to Madelaine Lecour , the belle of the ball , and the only daughter of a thriving manufacturer of Lyons , the lady being betrothed to Adolph Lefvre , a member of the firm of Lecour , Lefvre &; Co . The dance goes on , and at its close . Seymour and Madelaine come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mademoiselle , for permitting a stranger thus to have enjoyed the pleasure of a dance with you . Madelaine . M'lle Madelaine Lecour Not at all , good sir ; the pleasure was mutual , for I am passionately fond of the dance . Seymour . Charles Seymour Much , however , depends upon the parties , and although I am a novice in the exciting amusement , allow me to say that I was never so delighted . Madelaine . M'lle Madelaine Lecour You flatter , sir ; but we provincial maidens can not be deceived by the fine words of even so gallant a foreigner . ( Lefvre , evidently much annoyed , and who has been standing among the group eying the couple , now approaches . ) Lefvre . Adolph Lefvre Pardon me , M'lle ( bowing low to Seymour ) ; but the hour for your departure has arrived . Madelaine . M'lle Madelaine Lecour Indeed ! I had no idea that it was so late ; but the enjoyment was so keen that I did not note the flight of time . ( She turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the pleasure of being one of your party to the town ? ( He thus addresses Madelaine , and then , turning to Lefvre , says )  --  With your leave , sir ? Madelaine . M'lle Madelaine Lecour Certainly ; we shall only be too happy of your company . ( They move off . ) Annette and Marie ( two of the girl dancers ) now come forward . Annette . Annette Who is that young stranger ? Marie . Marie A very gentlemanly person , and of excellent family , I am told . He brought letters to the Prefect and several of the notabilities . Annette . Annette How charmingly he danced with Madelaine ! His whole soul seemed to be in the movement . Marie . Marie And hers too . Annette . Annette What a contrast to Adolph Lefvre , to whom Madelaine is betrothed . Marie . Marie Indeed ! And are they really engaged ? Annette . Annette Yes , and have been for a year , but the match has been arranged by the old folks , and Madelaine is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie . Marie How a mistake ? Annette . Annette Ah ! Marie , I have had some little experience in matters of love , and , although not a prophet nor the child of a prophet , believe me , the electric spark that was kindled this afternoon will warm into a flame that will require something more than water to extinguish . Marie . Marie Fie , Annette ! Madelaine is betrothed to Mons. Lefvre , and you , who are her maid , know her principles too well to suppose for a moment that she will falter . Annette . Annette I do know her principles  --  Heaven guide and guard her !  --  and it is precisely because I know them that I feel convinced she will never give her hand where her heart is unwilling or reluctant . But do not question me further . The sun will soon set , and all have gone but us . Let us away . ( They clasp hands and go out . ) Scene II .  --  Madelaine in her chamber . She rises from a sofa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fevered brain , this bounding pulse ! My heart beats more quickly than is its wont , and strange emotions agitate my frame . No , no , it can not be . I am betrothed to Adolph , a member of my father 's firm  --  the cold , the calm , the formal , yet the upright Adolph ; and I should not , nay , I will not , think even for a moment of another . But alas , can we master ourselves , can we control the divinity that stirs within us ! Why do I recall his looks , his words ! why dwell upon his image , and feel once more , even to the very depths of my physical existence , the gentle pressure of his trembling hand ! Fool that I am , it can not be . It is too late . Another claims me , and I must fulfil the contract . I must not , nay , I will not think further of this stranger . It would be cruel , nay , criminal , situated as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much more criminal would it be to become the wife of one man , and to love another , " to strive hourly and daily against a passion which might have been perfectly innocent , but which one fatal error , one false step of irresolution has rendered forever guilty . " Heaven advise and protect me ! ( She falls upon her knees in prayer , and the scene shifts . ) Scene III .  --  A room at the village inn . The young Englishman is seated at a table , his head resting upon one hand . He rises and paces the apartment . Seymour . Charles Seymour Only ten days in France and caught already . I , too , who have mingled among the brightest of my native land  --  I , who have passed through the fiery ordeal of the gay season of the great metropolis . It can not be , the impression is but momentary , it soon will pass away . And yet , why does her girlish image haunt me like a shadow ? Why do I turn to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel her large blue eyes peering into mine , as if they would penetrate into the very recesses of my soul ? What folly , what madness ! and yet , why should there be either ? To love and be beloved again is the highest heaven of human felicity , the soul 's wildest , fondest , deepest dream of worldly bliss ; a consummation to yearn for , to pant for , to struggle for . Oh , who that has realized that delicious dream , although it may have lasted only for a few fleeting years , would not freely barter all further hopes of earthly gain , or pomp , or splendor , to revel in its delerious repetition ! Why , then , should I push from me a cup that sparkles with a draught so ecstatic ! Why turn away from Paradise , when the path that leads thither is clear and open before me ! ( A pause . ) That stern , cold man , Adolph Lefvre . By what authority did he ask her to return ? Down , busy devil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no right , no claim , and perhaps he has ; but she does not love him as she should love , as she could love . Of this I feel assured . The fire in her eye , the glow upon her cheek , the music of her voice , the grace of every step , and then her joyous and artless spirit , I never can forget them , never . But what is to be done ? How obtain an interview ? " Faint heart never won fair lady , " and a jewel so precious and so priceless is worth a world of trouble . The man who , with a noble prize in view , permits himself to be intimidated or dismayed , although even mountains intervene , was never born for a conqueror . But ho ! Flix , Flix . ( Calls to his valet . ) ( Felix soon appears , bowing . He is a dashing young Irishman , with a palpable desire to ape French manners and habits . ) Flix . Flix Your honor called . Seymour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deuce is the matter with you ? How strangely you are dressed ! Flix . Flix All right , your honor . When you are in Rome , do as Rome does . I am merely adapting myself to the customs of the country . Seymour . Charles Seymour Where did you get that moustache ? Flix . Flix Bought it , sir . It is all the rage now , and especially since the war . It looks la militaire . Seymour . Charles Seymour And what had you to do with the war . Flix . Flix Nothing , your honor , except by sympathy . The Irish , you know , are generally a warlike people , and in this they resemble the French . If , moreover , they can not get up a good fight at home , they do their best to keep the embers alive and burning abroad . Seymour . Charles Seymour True , very true ; but , Flix , I am about to confide to you an important mission . Flix . Flix I will do my best , your honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I desire that you exercise your utmost discretion . Flix . Flix You have only to command , sir . Seymour . Charles Seymour You saw Mademoiselle Lecour , with whom I danced this afternoon . Flix . Flix I did , sir ; a lovely creature ! Seymour . Charles Seymour Well , M'lle resides in the beautiful chateau , surrounded with honeysuckle , that attracts the eye just as you enter the village . It may be recognized by the graceful little spire that towers up from what seems to be an observatory on the top . Flix . Flix I remember , sir . Seymour . Charles Seymour Can you contrive to place within the hands of M'lle , without being seen by any other person , a note that I will have ready for you in an hour ? Flix . Flix I will do my best , and if I fail it will not be for want of effort . ( Bows and retires as Charles proceeds to write the note . ) Scene changes Scene IV .  --  A garden ; Madelaine walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes bent upon the ground . Annette follows a few steps behind , evidently observing her mistress , but unwilling to interrupt her reverie . Francois , the servant of Adolph Lefvre , concealed behind some bushes , watching and listening . Felix suddenly appears to Annette with two bouquets in his hand . Flix . Flix Be not alarmed , M'lle . I have a mission from my master , as well as a duty for myself . This , fair maiden , is for you , with a thousand blessings on your sweet face , and these ( handing a bouquet and letter ) are for your Lady . ( He seizes her hand , presses it gallantly to his lips , and rushes off . Madelaine at this point turns around , and Annette , hastening to her , gives the flowers and letter . ) Madelaine M'lle Madelaine Lecour ( much agitated . She holds the letter in her hand and exclaims ) It is , it is from him , from him . ( She pauses , still more deeply agitated ; then , breaking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mudemoiselle , a thousand times I crave your pardon . I have seen , I have conversed with , and I never can forget you . The brief hours I have passed in your society form the brightest page in the tablet of my memory . Whatever may be my fate it will live and shine there forever . To love truly and deeply is to give to another , not by bargain or contract , but involuntarily , that which never can be taken back again . And thus it is , strange and startling as it may seem , I proffer you my hand , my heart , my deathless and unwavering devotion . Believe me , dearest Madelaine , this is no idle fancy , no boyish dream ; it is an impulse of principle , and it will live forever . I have , I confess , but little reason to hope . You may scorn , you may spurn , but you can not but pity me . It is therefore that I venture to ask for an interview . Let it be to-morrow at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I will never reproach you . May angels watch and guard , and Heaven 's choicest blessings attend you . " " Truly yours and forever " " CHARLES SEYMOUR " ( The letter , which was read by starts , and produced the deepest emotion , fell from the hands of the young girl when she had concluded . She threw herself upon a seat , and for a moment pressed her hands to her forehead . ) Madelaine . M'lle Madelaine Lecour Ah , me ! what a bitter fate is mine . Adolph , the kind , cold Adolph , I would not falsify or deceive , but I feel now for the first time that I can not love , that I never have loved you . My father and mother too ! They have set their hearts upon this marriage , and how bitter will be their disappointment . But no , it can not be ; I feel that it can not . Better to undeceive at once than to deceive for life . Better be honest now than a hypocrite for , years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger . Can I , dare I , meet him ? My judgment , my duty , say no ; but my pity , nay , my heart , says yes . ( A pause . ) Perhaps it would be better to see and tell him the whole truth . If he be the soul of honor , as I trust he is , he will advise me kindly , justly . But hark , who calls ? Madame Lecour . Madame Lecour Madelaine , Madelaine . Madelaine . M'lle Madelaine Lecour It is my dear mother , and here she comes . Enter Madame Lecour . Mad . Lecour . Madame Lecour My dear child , we wondered what had become of you . Mons. Lefvre is in the drawing-room , and he is impatient to see you . Go in immediately , Alack , it was not so when I was betrothed to your father . Madelaine . M'lle Madelaine Lecour Dearest mother , excuse me , I will be with you in a minute . Mad . Lecour . Madame Lecour But stop , my child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been fixed . Your father had a long conversation with Adolph this morning . Everything has been arranged . Tuesday next , my darling , is the happy day . But why start and blush so ? Mons. Lefvre , although much older than you , is an excellent man , and any maiden in France might be proud of him as a husband . But come , my child , arrange your hair , and hasten to meet your affianced . Madelaine . M'lle Madelaine Lecour Yes , mother , yes , one minute and I will be with you . Madame Lecour leaves . Madelaine . M'lle Madelaine Lecour Heaven save me ! How rash , how foolish I have been . I stand upon the brink of a precipice . Another step , and all will be over . I love my father , I adore my mother , and I respect Mons. Lefvre , who has been so kind to me , but I feel that at such a crisis I must be firm . Friendship , esteem , regard , all have charms , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soul . Without it life is as a desert , springless and sterile , while with it , the sun shines , the buds burst , the trees blossom , and the Eden of our first parents comes back again with all its freshness , its beauty , and its bloom . Scene V.  --  Monsieur and Madame Lecour enter from one side , and Monsieur Lefvre from the other . The latter is a man of thirty-five or forty , thin , precise , and formal . His manner is stiff and cold , and his air is somewhat haughty . Lefvre . Adolph Lefvre I have called to complete the arrangements of which we spoke last evening . Lecour . Monsieur Lecour Yes , Monsieur ( hesitating ) ; but have you consulted my daughter ? Lefvre . Adolph Lefvre No ; I have not yet thought that step necessary . The engagement is one of long standing , and M'lle , being a dutiful daughter , will , no doubt , cheerfully comply . Lecour . Monsieur Lecour Still , sir , it would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madelaine first , as she is the party more directly interested . Lefre . Adolph Lefvre I can not agree with you , Mons. Lecour . Children are sometimes perverse , and know not what is best for them . You are aware , moreover , that the judgment which I hold over your property may be enforced at any moment , and I have consented to cancel it on the night of our marriage . Lecour . Monsieur Lecour True , most true , Monsieur . Let us proceed to execute the necessary papers . But should Madelaine hesitate ? Lefvre . Adolph Lefvre That is impossible . In a matter of this kind your will should be her law . Lecour . Monsieur Lecour As you say , Mons. ( They proceed together to a table and sign papers . ) Lefvre . Adolph Lefvre On Tuesday of next week is the day fixed for the marriage . Lecour . Monsieur Lecour You have my consent . I can do no more . Madelaine may yet refuse ; but you , her affianced husband , should know her disposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of honor , would not have an unwilling bride . Lefvre . Adolph Lefvre No ; but I am bound to have the contract fulfilled , and you , Mons. , know that I may not be trifled with  --  and with impunity . The hand of Madelaine , or  --  the Mortgage . ( Leaves . ) Lecour . Monsieur Lecour Alas ! my child , my poor , poor , child . ( Leaves on the other side , and the scene changes . ) Scene VI .  --  A grove . Charles pacing up and down near the spot where the first scene opened . Francois , servant of Lefvre , in the background watching him . Seymour . Charles Seymour And will she come ! A fearful step I know , but I could venture on no other . Madelaine approaches accompanied by Annette , who lingers a few steps behind . Seymour . Charles Seymour Thanks , a thousand thanks , for this kindness . Madelaine . M'lle Madelaine Lecour Alas ! good sir , I fear that the step is not one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a desire to advise you of my true situation , have persuaded me . Seymour . Charles Seymour Fair lady , be not alarmed . Your honor is dearer to me , far dearer than my own life ; and rather than it should be sullied or endangered by any act of mine , I would peril the eternal destiny of my own soul . But M'lle  --  Madelaine , if I may be permitted thus to address you , I love you with my whole heart  --  with all the fervor and strength of my nature  --  an honest and an honorable , though an impulsive nature  --  and I desired that you should be told so by my own lips . Madelaine . M'lle Madelaine Lecour I fear , dear sir , that you came too late . I am the betrothed of another . Seymour . Charles Seymour And is it even so ? Ah ! cruel fate , how have you deceived me ! And yet , fair lady , if your heart accompany your hand why should I protest . My love is deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sensual passion . It seeks to promote , not to destroy your happiness . Let me but be assured that this intended marriage is of your own seeking , that it is based upon mutual affection , that you really , truly love this man , and though I should perish in the effort , I would tear myself away from you forever . ( Madelaine presses her hand to her head and is in deep agitation . ) Seymour . Charles Seymour Speak ! sweet lady , speak ! My fate hangs upon your lips . Has your heart been consulted in this betrothal , or is the arrangement only one of family and convenience ? Do you love Mons. Lefvre ? Do you love him not as a brother or a friend , but with your whole soul , and as woman should love a man to whom her destinies are about to be interblended , not merely for a day or a year , but forever , aye , forever ! Speak , fair lady , I adjure you , speak . Madelaine . M'lle Madelaine Lecour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I think that I may trust you . I have but a slight knowledge of the busy world , and still less of the workings of the hearts of men , but you seem to be truthful and sincere ! Seymour . Charles Seymour Believe me , lady , believe me . As Heaven is my judge , I will neither abuse your confidence , nor mislead your mind . A viler thing crawls not upon the face of earth , than the man , the wretch , who would steal into the affections of a young and unsuspecting woman only to deceive and betray . Mad . M'lle Madelaine Lecour Enough , enough ! I am the only child of my beloved parents . They dote upon , nay , almost worship me , and since my earliest thought I have obeyed their every wish . This I have done as well from a sense of duty , as because , until now , they never demanded aught that was repulsive to my own feelings , or adverse to the calmer dictates of my own judgment . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is much my senior , but he has known me from childhood . I esteem and respect him , and was taught , years ago , even before I could think for myself , to regard him as my affianced husband . I did so regard him , and never , even in thought , permitted my feelings to wander towards another ; but now  --  Seymour . Charles Seymour Speak on , fair lady . Mad . M'lle Madelaine Lecour But now , it is due to him , as well as to myself , that he be undeceived . I do not , can not love him , as I should . The delusion is over . The mockery is apparent . For friendship , however earnest and devoted , is not love . Seymour . Charles Seymour I thank you , lady , for this generous candor . From my very soul , I thank you . The lowering cloud has passed , and now ( falling upon one knee ) dearest , fairest Madelaine , now that you are still free , permit me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my professions of devotion , and to offer you my heart and hand . Madelaine . M'lle Madelaine Lecour Rise , sir , rise . But how escape these dreaded nuptials ? My parents have fixed their hearts upon them . Their honor is concerned , their interests are involved , and to all the appeals that I have made , they have replied either by silence , by tears , or by reproaches . Seymour . Charles Seymour There is but one alternative . Do not be alarmed , dear Madelaine . To one of your gentle nature it may seem bold , rash , and undutiful . I mean Elopement . ( Madelaine starts . ) Do not tremble , lady ; a few short days , and all will be over . Your good , but mistaken parents , will then relent . Better any fate than that of a false and treacherous marriage  --  a union at which the heart revolts , and the penalty of which would be misery and hypocrisy for life . Madelaine . M'lle Madelaine Lecour The alternative is indeed dreadful , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Seymour Do not hesitate , fair lady . Say but one word , and I will have everything in readiness by to-morrow night . A few fleet hours , and we will be at Boulogne . Then the priest and the altar , and England , my native land , will open her arms to receive us . Madelaine , dearest Madelaine , let me conjure you . Once in merry England , and we can address a joint letter to your beloved parents , imploring their forgiveness , and pledging to return the moment they desire . Decide , dearest , decide ; time flies , and the opportunity may be lost  --  yes , lost forever . Madelaine . M'lle Madelaine Lecour I do , I will . God forgive me if I am wrong ! ( She falls into his arms , and as he leads her off the curtain falls . ) ACT II . Scene I.  --  A chamber . Lefvre . Adolph Lefvre I have too long delayed . Her young heart is awakening . This stranger , too ; I feel that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dare not ! What will not woman dare , when once her soul is roused to love and passion ? The prize hitherto almost within my grasp . No , by heavens , I will never yield ! Cold I may be to all the world beside , but for her my soul is fire and flame . The crisis is at hand , and I must venture all . Enter Francois . Lefvre . Adolph Lefvre Well , sir , have you learned anything ? Franois . Franois I have , sir . Lefvre Adolph Lefvre ( starting with impatience ) . Speak on . Franois . Franois They have had an interview . Lefvre . Adolph Lefvre When and where ? Franois . Franois In the grove , near the village . It lasted for more than an hour , and both were deeply affected . In brief , your honor , I saw and heard enough . Too much . Mademoiselle  --  loves this stranger . Lefvre . Adolph Lefvre Impossible . Franois . Franois True , sir ; true as Heaven . I heard but few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the look , the tone , the manner , could not be mistaken . Nay , they have determined to elope ! Lefvre . Adolph Lefvre Elope ! It can not be !  --  it must not ! In such an event , I would become the mock and by-word of the whole town . My pride of character , my love for Madelaine , my hate for this rash Englishman , all forbid . Franois . Franois All is true that I have told you . You must consent to relinquish your affianced , or  --  Lefvre . Adolph Lefvre Or what ? Franois . Franois ( approaching and speaking in a low voice ) . Get rid of this presumptuous rival . He is our national , if not our natural enemy , and in Paris  --  Lefvre . Adolph Lefvre What mean you , Franois ? Do not hesitate ; my whole heart is in this affair . Franois . Franois I mean , sir , that I speak only like a man , and a Frenchman ; and I would never permit myself to be supplanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort . Strong cases require strong remedies , and many a better man has suddenly disappeared , as well within as without the walls of Paris . Lefvre . Adolph Lefvre But my position , Franois . I am a member of her father 's firm , and enjoy an enviable reputation . Franois . Franois Well , sir , I have nothing more to say . ( Turning to go . ) Lefvre . Adolph Lefvre Stop , Franois , stop ! I love this girl with my whole soul . When she was apparently mine , I felt calm and safe ; but now , that another has ventured to enter the field in competition , I feel little better than a madman , and would give half my fortune to secure her . Franois . Franois Enough , sir . Confide to me but 20,000 francs , and the prize is yours . Lefvre . Adolph Lefvre But how ? Franois . Franois Ask no questions  --  leave the task to me ; I have served you heretofore , and in a case of equal delicacy . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a word of that , Franois  --  not a word . Franois . Franois I am silent . Lefvre . Adolph Lefvre ( after traversing the chamber a few seconds ) . Well , I am resolved . ( He then sits down to his desk and draws a check . He rises , and as he hands it to Francois , says ) May I confide in you ? Franois . Franois You have done so before , and it is now too late to doubt . Lefvre . Adolph Lefvre Forgive me , Franois ; but this is a serious matter . Franois . Franois It is , but you may trust me . I know my purpose , and I know my men . ( He leaves the room . ) Lefvre . Adolph Lefvre Oh , jealousy , how wild a fiend art thou ! The current of my blood flows on like lava . My brain is mad with doubt , and could I murder with a thought , the body of my hated rival would soon lie still and cold before me . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hotel ; Seymour , and Flix in attendance . Seymour . Charles Seymour Flix , my good fellow , you have done well thus far . Take this ( throwing him a purse . Flix catches , views it with pleasure , and then pockets it . ) But I have something more serious for you to undertake . Flix . Flix Anything in reason , sir . But you must not forget that we are in France , and the eyes of the police are constantly upon us . ( At this moment the door is slowly opened , and a gens d'armes looks in . ) In the name of Heaven ! who is that ? Seymour . Charles Seymour Nothing , or nothing at least that concerns us . If you pick no one 's pocket , you need not be alarmed . Franois . Franois Is there any law against making love in France ? Seymour . Charles Seymour Oh , no . In no country on the face of the globe , is greater latitude allowed in that respect . But why do you ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been making a fool of yourself . Flix . Flix I beg pardon , sir , but I fear I have . You have seen little Annette , the maid of Mademoiselle Madelaine ? Seymour . Charles Seymour To be sure I have . But what of her ? Flix . Flix The dear little creature , I could not help it ; and then it was so natural for me to follow in the footsteps of my master . Seymour . Charles Seymour So much the better ; you will only take the deeper interest in the matter I am about to refer to . Flix , look to that door , and see that it is fastened , and that no one listens outside . ( Felix examines the door . ) Seymour . Charles Seymour Now lend me your ears ; come closer . I have seen Mademoiselle Lecour ; she has consented to elope with me , and this very night . But the movement can not be accomplished without the greatest possible tact . It is upon this point that I desire to avail myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Franois I think I can . Seymour . Charles Seymour Then you must represent , or rather counterfeit myself , while Annette must render the same service to Mademoiselle ; we , on the other hand , will play the parts of the valet and the lady . Flix . Flix Mon Dieu , is there no danger ; the police , the gens d'armes , can we avoid or escape such lynx-eyed spies ? Seymour . Charles Seymour Yes , there is danger , great danger ; but was ever a great enterprise achieved without danger ? The New World would never have been discovered had Columbus counted the danger ; it is that which imparts keenness and interest to every exciting event in life . Flix . Flix But , my dear sir , this is a most serious business ; had you not better reflect ? Seymour . Charles Seymour I have reflected , nay , I have decided . Were death itself to threaten , I would still venture . The lady has consented ; my honor is involved , and I can take no step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I will do my best . Seymour . Charles Seymour To night at 12 o'clock , provide two carriages , and the necessary disguises , and on your life , neither falter nor fail ; you an Irishman , and talking of danger ! Remember Wellington and Waterloo . ( Leave at opposite side of the stage , and the scene changes . ) Scene III .  --  A low restaurant in the Faubourg St. Antoine , Paris ; Franois in a room alone . Franois . Franois Twenty thousand francs , truly a snug sum ; I can get the job done for half the money , and pocket the balance . ( Enter two ruffians . ) Ah , here already ! welcome , gentlemen , welcome , I have some business for you . 1st Ruffian . 1st Ruffian Well , sir , we are at your service , provided we can agree upon terms ; what 's the job ? Franois . Franois A very simple matter . A young Englishman has planned an elopement with Mademoiselle Lecour , one of the loveliest women of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I desire that you seize him , and put him out of the way ; no bloodshed , but he must disappear for at least a month ! You understand ? 1st Ruffian . 1st Ruffian Perfectly , but what are the terms ? Franois . Franois Ten thousand francs . 1st Ruffian . 1st Ruffian To be paid , when ? Franois . Franois Within an hour after the prevention of the elopement , and the disappearance of the Englishman . 1st Ruffian . 1st Ruffian All this seems fair ; what say you , comrade ? 2d Ruffian . 2d Ruffian If you know your man , I am satisfied . 1st Ruffian . 1st Ruffian And so am I ; your hand upon the bargain , friend Franois . Franois . Franois ( Gives his hand . ) But no bloodshed , and as little noise as possible . 1st Ruffian . 1st Ruffian All right ; but the lady , what are we to do with her ? Franois . Franois Treat her with all possible respect , and see her delivered in safety at her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; good night , sir ; you shall hear from us in the course of a few hours . ( They go out , and scene changes . ) Scene IV .  --  Night . Two coaches are in waiting in a side road near the residence of Madelaine . The coachmen are lingering and talking . 1st Coachman. 1st Coachman At what hour are the parties to arrive ? 2d Coachman. 2d Coachman At half past eleven precisely . 1st Coachman. 1st Coachman Whither are we to drive them ? 2d Coachman. 2d Coachman To the railway station for Boulogne . 1st Coachman. 1st Coachman Who are they ? 2d Coachman. 2d Coachman Do n't know and do n't care . They paid me in advance , and I thought it better to ask no questions . 1st Coachman. 1st Coachman In this you were wise . Mum 's the word on all such enterprises . It is not our business to suspect people and play the part of the police . If we did we should soon starve for want of something to do . 2d Coachman. 2d Coachman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for my part , I rather like work of this kind . It gives a fresh edge to the humdrum dodges of every-day life ; and after all , what would Paris be without love and intrigue , rendezvous , and elopements ? It would soon lose its reputation as the Paradise of the world . By the way , neighbor , did you hear of the scene of last night on the Bois de Boulogne ? 1st Coachman. 1st Coachman No. 2d Coachman. 2d Coachman Truly , an awkward affair ; a husband and wife met each other face to face , but each accompanied by an outside partner . 1st Coachman. 1st Coachman You do n't say ; and what did they do ? 2d Coachman. 2d Coachman Do ! behaved like sensible people . Looked daggers , but did not recognize each other for the time being . But hark ! hither come our customers .

Flix assumes the character of master and gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are somewhat in haste , and desire to be driven as rapidly as possible to the depot .

( Tears come to her eyes . ) I can not help thinking of them , and of the agony they must have suffered on my account . And then  --  you still insist upon the necessity of keeping our marriage secret ! This is exceedingly painful , and as I drive through the country and observe the inquiring  --  nay , the distrustful looks of the neighboring gentry , I can not but feel abashed and mortified .

But listen , my dearest , and I will tell you the whole truth in relation to my position and prospects . The Earl of Cheshire , one of the richest noblemen in England , is my uncle . Upon him I am wholly dependent in a pecuniary point , with the exception of the allowance I receive from government as a Lieutenant in the Army . I am the second son of a younger brother , who died at the age of thirty , and left his children nothing but an honest and an honorable name . My uncle has an only daughter , Matilda Delorme , the heiress to his vast estates , and he years ago determined that I should become her husband . His object was to preserve the property in the family , and at the same time to unite the older and younger branches of the name . Meanwhile , he made me a princely allowance , a thousand pounds a year , upon which I have been travelling and indulging in various descriptions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marriage , according to the programme of the Earl , is to take place when she is eighteen . Of the condition of her feelings toward me , I know nothing ; of mine , as regards her , I had scarcely ever thought , till I met you . And thus my story is told . The necessity of keeping our marriage a secret must be apparent . I regret it , deeply regret it , but under existing circumstances , there is no other alternative . A time may come , nay , must come , when I will be compelled to confess all to my uncle , and appeal to his generosity . Until then , dearest Madelaine , you must rely upon my faith , my honor , my devotion . Madelaine . M'lle Madelaine Lecour Alas , my husband , the task is indeed difficult . Away from my paternal roof , a thousand anxieties constantly beset me . Fears , unfounded fears , perhaps , annoy and perplex . And when , as is so often the case , you are absent in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle , I feel not only lonely and deserted , but distrustful and wretched . And how long , may I ask , is this mystery to last ? For myself , I would rather know the worst at once . Better , far better , to live upon one-fifth of the allowance that is now provided , than to be pressed to the earth by this terrible misgiving . I like not mystery , in a matter of this kind . Specious and plausible as it may seem , it has the aspect of guilt . To you , dear Charles , all this may amount to little or nothing ; but to me , the anxiety , the apprehension , the agony , are truly dreadful . Seymour . Charles Seymour Forgive me , dearest , forgive me ! I have been summoned to London this very night , and , come what may , I will strip the mask from my features , and detail our touching story to my uncle . Yes , this very night .

Take a seat ; I have something to say which concerns you deeply . ( The Earl places a chair for Charles and then sits down beside him . ) My dear nephew , you are now twenty-five years of age , and it is but fitting that , as the affianced husband of my daughter , you should have a suitable establishment .

Here , sir , are the deeds to an estate that will yield you five thousand pounds a year .

By the laws of France , a marriage , in order to be perfect and complete , must be confirmed by a Civil Magistrate . This is essential to its vitality . And yet , in our case , this form has been neglected . A priest alone officiated at the altar . The marriage is informal and illegal . The estates may yet be mine . But what of Madelaine , my fond , confiding Madelaine . The dilemma is fearful , the temptation is terrible . Oh , fate , most cruel fate , in what a labyrinth am I involved !

True , he is dependent upon his uncle , and is compelled in some sense to avoid the publication of our marriage . But better anything than this uncertainty .

Beloved Parents : I am quite well , but my husband is compelled to be in London a large portion of his time , and hence I am very lonely . Thus far I have rather avoided the neighbors , and have very few visitors . Indeed it often happens that I do not see a strange face for a whole week . The villa is very beautiful , but it occupies a secluded spot , several hundred yards from the main road , and it is , therefore , remarkable for solitude and silence .

Whatever change may have been wrought in him by the desertion of Madelaine , he must still remember that but for me he would be nothing . Mad . L. Madame Lecour Alas , dear husband , let us have faith and do our duty . For the rest we must look to Heaven .

( Charles hesitates and looks at the ground , but is silent . ) The Earl The Earl of Cheshire ( with a softened tone and manner ) . Charles , my dear Charles , I trust that I have made no mistake . You know that you are my younger brother 's younger son , and that from your very boyhood I have loved you as tenderly as if you were my own child . I have educated you . I have sent you abroad to see the world . I have secured you an honorable post in the army of your country .

And yet for some reason you hesitate . In the name of Heaven , young man , what do you expect ? What do you mean ? Seymour . Charles Seymour Forgive , dearest , kindest uncle , forgive me , but I could not accept your generous , noble offer , without becoming a villain ; false to you , false to my fair cousin , and false to my own honor . The Earl . The Earl of Cheshire What mockery is this ? But go on , sir ; go on , and explain this riddle . Seymour .

It so chanced that I lingered for some weeks in Lyons and its neighborhood , and mingled in many of the gay and innocent festivities of that particular locality . In brief , dear uncle , I became attached , deeply and honorably attached , to a fair young French girl Madelaine Lecour , the daughter of a thriving and successful manufacturer of the city of Lyons . My passion was returned ; but she , like many others before her , had been betrothed by her parents to another  --  another whom she respected but did not love . The wedding day was fixed , and her parents were determined . I saw Madelaine , fell at her feet , avowed my devotion , and , in the despair of the crisis , proposed an elopement . The struggle was long and deep , but at last she consented . We fled , we were married by a priest at Boulogne ; crossed the Channel ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a villa near Southampton . The marriage has yet to be confirmed and legalized by civil rites , according to the law of France . And it is to you that I now appeal , dear uncle , to you to whom I am indebted for the very bread upon which I live , to choose for me the path of duty under the circumstances . I deeply and keenly feel for the disappointment of your plans and hopes , but I know that the generous , the manly , and the high-minded policy which has heretofore marked your course towards the son of your brother will not be abandoned now . The Earl of Cheshire never was , never can be unjust . The Earl The Earl of Cheshire ( much agitated , endeavoring to master his feelings ) . Ah ! Charles , Charles , you know not the fond dream you have dissolved . But " man proposes and God disposes .

The name and the fame of the Earls of Cheshire have hitherto been without a spot of dishonor , and I would rather that my right hand should wither with paralysis , than that it should confirm a cruel or dishonorable deed . And Madelaine , the beauty of Lyons , is she honest ? Seymour . Charles Seymour Honest ! A purer being , a nobler woman never breathed the breath of life . She is the very soul of truth and love , and yet all modesty and chastity . The Earl . The Earl of Cheshire All , then , is forgiven . Hasten back to Southampton , and at once relieve the mind of Madelaine .

A little longer and this dreadful suspense will be over ; nay , at this moment , he , my husband , yes , mine in the eyes of Heaven , may be another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fortune , and honor ! No , not honor ; for the man who once pledges himself to woman , wins her best affections , and then ruthlessly abandons her , can never be other than a wretch , a base and heartless wretch . In the moral world at least , feelings can not be measured , and hearts can not be bought with gold . Oh ! Seymour , Seymour , can you be such a vile and worthless thing ? Forbid it , truth ; forbid it , Heaven ! A little longer and the shadowy curtain which conceals my fate will be withdrawn , and then if all my worst forebodings be fulfilled , despair and death can not approach too soon . ( Mad . Lecour re-enters with a letter in her hand . ) Mad . Lecour . Madame Lecour A letter , and with the London postmark . Madelaine . M'lle Madelaine Lecour ( She rushes forward and grasps the letter ; she holds it for a moment in her hand as if afraid to open it ; she then breaks the seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Madelaine , dear Madelaine , beloved wife and mistress of my soul , all is well . My uncle knows all and forgives all . I send this in haste and will follow instantly on the wings of love and fidelity . Yours , forever , CHARLES . Madelaine gives a shriek of joy , when , at the moment , steps are heard approaching , and Seymour rushes in and clasps her to his arms . Scene VII .  --  The same spot as at the first meeting of the lovers . Another rural festival , but larger and more joyous than the former . The old folks are seated in the background , and the young girls have all white roses in their hair . One or two dances take place , when suddenly the dancers fall back as a bridal procession approaches . It is headed by a civil magistrate , who is accompanied by his clerk , and these are followed by a priest . Then come Seymour and Madelaine , a suitable number of bridesmaids , &c.; &c.; The orchestra plays appropriate music , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk ; a solemn peal of music goes up , when the voice of the magistrate Magistrate is heard in these words :  --  Wilt thou , Madelaine Lecour , accept this man , Charles Seymour , to be thy lawful husband , and remain faithful to him even unto death ? And wilt thou , Charles Seymour , accept this woman , Madelaine Lecour , to be thy lawful wife , love , honor , and protect her in sickness and in health ? Madelaine and Seymour bow their assent , when the music again swells forth , and the whole party All join in a chorus , as follows :  --  When true love is requited Heart beats to heart  --  heart beats to heart , And thus by Heaven united , Man can not part  --  man can not part . The world has no elysian So sweet as this  --  so sweet as this  --  A type of that bright region , Where all is bliss  --  where all is bliss . Curtain falls .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
