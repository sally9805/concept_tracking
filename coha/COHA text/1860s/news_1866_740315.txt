txt The problem of wise relief for sufferers by the Portland fire is very difficult of solution . Notwithstanding the admirable zeal and devotion of the Citizens ' Committee , of which Mr. HENRY Fox is Chairman , and the untiring efforts of the sixty ladies who have given their time to this work , there are very many whom no public effort can ever reach . There is a multitude of persons who , accustomed to live in all the comforts of elegant homes , have suddenly led everything , and are now too poor to buy even a tooth brush or a pocket handkerchief . This statement is literally true to an appalling extent . A lady , to whom a small sum of money had been sent for application in charity as she thought best , speaking of such people , said to me , " I spent that money in tooth-brushes , combs and handkerchiefs ; and I found nothing so acceptable . They were eagerly received by those who had lived in luxury before , but can not now afford even a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are without even a change of linen . " The Citizens ' Committee have , it is true , done wonders , and without the aid which they have administered through the ward-rooms there must have been actual starvation . But the mass of the laboring population who dwelt among the stores are now being rapidly relieved , and are in many instances living better and more healthily than they ever did in the crowdek dirty quarters of Gorham 's Corner and Bebastopol . The heaviest and most piteous deprivation falls on those who previously possessed comfortable , pleasant houses , but are now too poor to procure even the decencies of life . The number of this class of sufferers is surprising to any one not familiar with the burnt district and who is ignorant how many b* tiful mansions were scattered all through the b nese regions ; houses which , surrounded trees , were sufficiently removed from the turmoil of active life in their neighberhood , and were too agreeable to be abandoned by their old occupants , where traffic flowed in about them . The stories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea Captain , who supported himself and his aged wife by giving lessons in navigatlem ' By years of economy he had succeeded a week before the.fire in paying of/ the mortgage on his house , and they thought they had secured their home for life . It and its contents are burned , and the insurande is worthless . The savings of years are gone , and they have neither clothes to wear , house to live in , money to procure new ones with , nor vises to earn it . Here is a wife with ten children , whtise lather established them in a good home , and is now absent across the seas . They have not a change of clothing left among them all . There is a white  --  headed citizen whose name has been known throughout the city for forty years as the very synonym of honor and Christian excellence . He has lost house and store , and the moderate competence on which he expected soon to retire after a long and useful life of industry .

They can only be reached by personal friendship and individual knowledge . And yet they are the very persons whose sorrows appeal most to our sympathies . To assist them a different system from ward-room relief is needed ; or rather no system which does not utilize the personal knowledge of individuals in the best . social life in the city can reach those high-spirited , sensitive men and women who can not beg , and would rather suffer in silent penury than apply to strangers , however benevolent , and be forced to prove their wants , in the way which is unavoidable in all general distributions . The sympathetic ladies of Portland have felt this state of things deeply , and with their wonted energy and good judgment have devised a mode of reaching these people , which is at once simple , thorough and effective . They have formed an . association , whose circular I inclose you and hope you will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one at all acquainted with the best society of Portland , tell their own story . Others , however , will probably De willing to trust the wives of gentlemen so well known and deservedly respected as Judge Fox , GM WASHBURN , SABIDEL E. SPRING , JABIES T. MCCOBB and JOHN B. BROWN . The Ladies ' Relief Association-of Portland is made up from all the religious ' secieties in the city . Its object is " to seek out and investigate cases of loss sustained in the .. late disastrous fire , and particularly of those who Would not themselves solicit public aid . " Their executive committee devises means for raising fluids ' and provider places of deposit for clothing and other articles . It has sub-committees of not more than three persona from each religious society in the city who inquire into all cases of suffering and report to the executive committee , which alone appropriates money . These ladies look dot merely to the immediate wants , but are endeavoring to provide for the inevitable distress of Fall and Winter .

A noblehearted gentleman , who retired from business with a very moderate income , and is biniself a heavy loser , leases a little house to a worthy old ? man whose family is houseless for the same rent he , received before the fire , and refuses nearly double rent from others better able to provide for themselves . To see such a spirit , and to perceive how earnestly this association of ladies is going to work , makes one think bettor of his fellow-creatures . This association needs everything for its work , and it is made up of the very " persinist.who can be most safely trusted to use everythtng:well .
