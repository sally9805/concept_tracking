NANCY , Lady 's Maid . SCENE  --  NEW YORK . Period  --  1859-60 . Main text ACT I. A Parlor in Mr. Lacy 's House . Evening . Mr. and Mrs. Lacy , seated . Mr. Lacy . Mr. Lacy So , my dear , as I expect Mr. Dalton this very night , I hope you 'll have a room and a bed ready for him . Mrs. Lacy . Mrs. Lacy Very well , my love . Lacy . Mr. Lacy And I desire you to treat him with all the kindness in your power . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Of course , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very cordial about it , Mrs. L. What 's the matter ? Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Well , Mr. Lacy , though I would not for the world be deficient in hospitality , yet I must say that this idea of yours , of receiving a Frenchman under the roof which shelters your wife and daughter , is a very singular one . Lacy . Mr. Lacy He 's not a Frenchman , my dear . I 've told you again and again that , though born in France , he is the son of the American minister to Berlin . His father was a Green Mountain boy , and his mother was the belle of Baltimore . If that is not enough to make the son an American , I should like to know what is ? Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Well , his education is French , and his principles are Parisian , of course . I do n't know how it is , but I 've come to look upon every Frenchman that comes to this country , as an impostor . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Lafayette included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dalton 's not a souave . And the son of an American ambassador can not be a cook in disguise or a dancing master incog . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy But he may be a bad man , a fast man , a loose man ! They say that play of the " Camelia Woman " was founded on fact . Who knows but what your Mr. Dalton was the hero of it ? Lacy . Mr. Lacy Oh , wife , wife , how can you be so absurd ? Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy It 's not absurd , after the examples we 've had . He 'll make love to Flora , poor innocent child , as a matter of course . And then Frenchmen are so insatiable , and are so notoriously fond of married women , he may actually make love to me ! And more than all , who knows what pernicious influence he may have upon you ? I could not bear to see you become the prey of dissipation , at an age when your constitution is no longer fitted to endure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Why the older I grow , the stronger I get , Mrs. L. Now listen , my dear . Frederick Dalton is the only son , the orphan son , of a man with whom I went to school . I ca n't tell you how many skating parties , and chestnut parties , and poaching parties I 've been on with that boy . I never shall forget the night when I sprained my ankle , in jumping from one of old Goddard 's pear trees . Old Goddard appeared at one of his windows with a blunderbuss , and took aim at  --  an exposed part of my person ; we wore jackets in those days . I verily believe he 'd have fired , had not Dalton stepped out before the window and said , " Look here . Goddard , that boy 's hurt and ca n't walk : if you must fire at somebody , fire at me . " Goddard did n't fire at anybody , and Dalton took me on his shoulders and carried me home ! Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest in your house ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy Yes , madam , I do , and I wish you and Flora to treat him as the son of my old schoolmate deserves . Let him have a night-key and breakfast at noon . Let him make love to Flora , and I hope he will : let him make love to the chambermaid , her French airs will suit him ; and if it will give him the slightest satisfaction , why , he may make love to you , and welcome . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Well , Mr. Lacy , since you are so violent , there is no help for it , I suppose . I 'll receive your French friend , but if any harm comes of it , mind , I told you so . As to his making love to Flora , that 's one thing : as to his marrying her , that 's quite another thing . His father left him $3000 a year , it seems . Flora 's bill at Stuart 's alone , since last January , is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want a wife now-a-days , they 've got to pay a good round sum for her . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Quite true , my love , and the number of young men that are finding out that the said good round sum is a great deal more than the article is worth , is quite fabulous , my dear . A bell rings . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy There he is , I suppose ; bless me , I would not have him surprise me in this dress . I must polish up my French a bit , too . An revoir , vieux chri . Exit . Lacy . Mr. Lacy My poor wife , these French doings in the papers have quite turned her head . And now for the son of my old friend . If he is a true chip of the old block , I shall know him at a glance . Enter Tyrrell and Dalton . Tyrrell . Godfrey Tyrrell Mr. Lacy , allow me the pleasure  --  Lacy . Mr. Lacy Spare your introductions , Tyrrell . Dalton , my boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Dalton . Frederick Dalton I shall try to make it so , sir , for it was the home of my father and mother . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Let me look at you well , Frederick  --  you do n't mind my calling you Frederick , do you ? I called your father Fred . Yes , those are his eyes , his nose  --  no , you 've got your mother 's mouth , without the dimple , though ; jet black hair , too , like her . Give me your hand again , my boy . Oh , welcome , thrice welcome home ! Doesa n't he look like his father , Tyrrell ? Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Of course he does . It 's one of the duties a human being owes to the memory of his mother , to look like his father . Dalt . Frederick Dalton And now , Mr. Lacy , allow me to offer you my thanks for your kindness and the hospitable offer of a room in your house . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Well , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frederick Dalton By no means , sir . I accept with gratitude . Without a relative in the city , but my tenth cousin , here , Tyrrell , I should have been solitary enough in New York . And as you are so good as to offer a home to him who has none of his own , you must not be surprised if I accept . Lacy . Mr. Lacy No , but I should be savage if you did n't . Come , sit down . Tyrrell , take a chair . Well now , Dalton , what are your plans ? What do you mean to do , and how do you intend to employ your time ? Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell The first thing he 's got to do is to go round to the Mayor 's office with me , and get naturalized . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Nonsense , Tyrrell , I 'm an American already . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Ah , yes , but you were born abroad though , my boy . Dalt . Frederick Dalton I was born upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , American soil in Europe ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton Let me explain , sir . My father , not wishing his first child , who , like all fathers , he hoped would be a boy , to be debarred , by a technicality of birth , from the right to aspire to the office of President of the United States , in case his talents should authorize him to cherish such an ambition , which they do not , gentlemen , which they do not  --  Lacy . Mr. Lacy Well , Dalton always was the greatest man for looking out ahead , that I ever knew in my life ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton My father told my mother that there were always certain doubts attending the nationality of children born beneath a foreign flag , at the same time intimating that the frigate Constitution was anchored in the port of Brest , in France . My mother was as patriotic as my father ; she understood his meaning , and together they made the journey in a post-chaise . The salute due to my father 's rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the sailors manned the yards , and the stars were run up to the main . Well , gentlemen , I was born in the captain 's bunk , on board old Ironsides ! And of course , by a diplomatic fiction , on American soil ! Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Hooray for the Bar-tangled-Spanner ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton That 's not a good joke , Tyrrell . Wait till I have done . My mother did not live to embrace her son . She died where I was born ; the staunch old frigate was my cradle and her tomb . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Getting up . Forgive me , Dalton , for my irreverent jest . Had I known  --  Dalt . Frederick Dalton Never speak flippantly of the flag of your country , Tyrrell : should it ever be your lot to die in a foreign land , you will find the presence of that emblem a priceless consolation . Lacy . Mr. Lacy I believe you , my boy , I believe you . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell I never will again , Dalton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , Mr. Lacy , that I resemble my mother somewhat . I am glad to hear it , for I have no portrait of her and never have seen one , though I have reason to believe there is a miniature in existence . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Well , we must hunt it up for you . Dalt . Frederick Dalton I would give a great deal to find it . So you see , gentlemen , as I am an American by birth , I wish to become one by habit and practice , and I must depend upon you to put me in the way of it . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell You must learn to drink brandy and water . Lacy . Mr. Lacy You must buy a 2.40 nag , and race on Sundays . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell You must learn to talk slang , and call things by flash names . Lacy . Mr. Lacy When you sit down , say you 'll " take a squat , " and when you announce my death to Tyrrell , say I 've " stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a free lunch , " and Greenwood " a bone orchard . " Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , I 've no desire to swell the ranks of Young America . No , the first thing I think of doing , is to join the Seventh Regiment . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell No , join the Seventy-first . I fancy you are American enough for that . And we are crowding the Seventh pretty sharply , too . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Well , belong to my brigade , at any rate . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Dear me , I forgot , Dalton , General of Brigade Lacy . Dalt . Frederick Dalton General , my compliments . A military salute . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Sir , you are very kind . Dalt . Frederick Dalton There is an institution here , I have heard , of which I am entirely ignorant . Can either of you enlighten me ? I allude to flirtation . Tyrrell starts up . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Now sit down , Tyrrell , behave yourself . You must know , Dalton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old story : he fell in love with a jilt , Araminta Flowerbell , I believe . So he tries to pass for a cynic , gives out that his temper is soured , and that he is old before his time . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell I 'll tell you my history , some day , Dalton : it will make your hair stand on end . When I tell it to bald men they have goose-flesh instead . Dalt . Frederick Dalton But what is flirtation ? I have a very vague idea . Osborne . Jack Osborne Without . Is Miss Flora in ? Lacy . Mr. Lacy Here comes Jack Osborne : he 's the man to tell you , for he knows all about it . Enter Osborne . Osb . Jack Osborne Ah , Lacy , how are you ? Flora in ? How d'ye do ; Tygrell ? Who 's your friend ? Lacy . Mr. Lacy Osborne , let me make you acquainted with Mr. Dalton , from Paris . Osb . Jack Osborne Dalton , how are you ? How 's Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Osborne , explain to my young friend what flirtation is , will you ? Osb . Jack Osborne What , been to France , and not know that ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton It is not known in France , and seems to be indigenous in this country . Osb . Jack Osborne Well , it is a difficult thing to describe . You 'd better try it on and find out by experience . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , I should be very awkward , I 'm sure . I do n't think I could do it . Osb . Jack Osborne Well , if you could n't firt , you might be flirted with , you know . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Is there any difference , then ? Osb . Jack Osborne Oh , Lord , yes : it 's very rare that two flirts flirt together . As a general thing , one is in earnest and the other is n't . At last things come to a point and some one gets bit . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what flirtation is . It 's the Declaration of Independence run wild : it 's liberty degenerated into license  --  Osb . Jack Osborne Yes , you 've been bit . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell It 's the Hail Columbia of girlhood unrestrained by a proper feminine instinct  --  it 's the spread-eagleism of  --  it 's the  --  Osb . Jack Osborne In short , it 's the eldest daughter of the Bar-tangled Spanner by the Fourth of July ! Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell There 's that unfortunate Spanner again . Osb . Jack Osborne To show you by an example , Dalton  --  how much are you worth , if it 's not an impertinent question ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton Well , at present , about $3000 a year . Osb . Jack Osborne $3000 ? Well , you are just the man to be flirted with . There 's many a girl that would flirt with you , because of your moustache , and because you 've been to France , that would n't marry you , because you are minus the tin . Lacy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is news to me . They did n't do such things in my time . Osb . Jack Osborne In fact , the girl that 's fixed her mind upon ten thousand per annum , a box at the opera , and a cottage at Newport , and yet flirts with little gentlemen that have n't got a red , is like a woman going shopping for gowns . She wants , we 'll suppose , a double hem-stitched brocade . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Ha , ha , a double hem-stitched brocade ! Osb . Jack Osborne No matter , it 's merely for illustration 's sake . She wants a brocade , but she 'll look at barge . She wants a brocade , but she 'll dally over the muslins , and make eyes at the poplins , and even potter over the cambrics , and never for a minute let slip the brocade . She looks at them one after the other , thinks she would like them all , but she ca n't have more than one , and finally , if she has good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the hem-stitched brocade . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Or else she gets fobbed off , at last , with a ninepenny calico , short in the skirt and scant all round . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Then , gentlemen , I am to understand that flirtation is , as it were , a series of trial trips the ladies make in the smooth waters of courtship , before venturing upon the rough sea of matrimony . Osb . Jack Osborne Yes , with a new engineer each time . Dalt . Frederick Dalton It seems to me that such a system must produce strange results . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Results ! Ah yes , Osborne has not told you of the results ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy Now , Tyrrell , if you are going to tell that story , I shall go up stairs . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell No , but I 'm going to put Dalton on his guard . The result of it all is , Dalton , that you ca n't tell a woman that 's in love from a woman that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first love : that half the men are disappointed and some of them broken-hearted . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Tyrrell , I 'm going . Osb . Jack Osborne Why , Tyrrell , you talk as if there were no men flirts and no disappointed women . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Well , there are none to speak of . Osb . Jack Osborne Conceitedly . Oh , come , Tyrrell , some men are lady-killers , you know . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Nonsense , Jack . But these things wo n't endure for ever . Dalton , Americans were once the most gallant people in the world , but they are getting over it . Males are having their revenge . We sit down in the avenue cars now , and make the biddies stand : we swear the panic was caused by female extravagance ; and we make delicious puns on crinoline and cotton . Osb . Jack Osborne Talking of cotton , I say , Lacy , where 's Flora ? Lacy . Mr. Lacy She 'll be down directly . They talk apart . Dalt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story to Mr. Osborne ? He had goose-flesh , I presume . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell No , it was before he lost his hair . It stood on end . Dalt . Frederick Dalton How old is he ? Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Twenty-nine . Dalt . Frederick Dalton He 's very young to be bald . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Oh , some of our fast young men are bald at twenty-one . I 'll tell you how they do it : by dint of smoke , brandy and water , late hours , brandy and water , hot suppers , brandy and water , meerschaum , gutter , brandy and water , poker , station house and opium . As for Jack here , he is what is called a young man about town . He has fifteen thousand a year , and is considered a tremendous catch . Do n't let him be your rival , for you 'd stand but precious little chance . Dalt . Frederick Dalton I hardly think it likely that his taste and mine would bring us into any very serious collision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These men are pretty dainty in their fancies . Ah , here come the ladies . Enter Mrs. Lacy and Flora . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Now , Dalton , let me introduce you . My dear , this is Frederick Dalton , the son of my old friend . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy I am very happy to see you , sir , I am sure . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Frederick , this is my daughter , and a good girl , too . Flora , I hope you 'll do everything in your power to render my young friend 's stay agreeable . Flora . Flora Aside . Oh my , is n't he handsome ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Miss Lacy , one of my principal objects in visiting America was to convince myself of the truth of the reports I had heard concerning the beauty of American ladies . I need hardly say that I am already convinced , as far as one transcendent example can justify an opinion upon the sex in general . Flora . Flora Aside . He is Frenchy , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aloud Oh , there are a great many prettier girls than me . Wait till you see Belle Summerton , Amy Nelson , and Sylvia Burgess . Dalt . Frederick Dalton If they are as pretty as their names , they must be beautiful indeed . Osb . Jack Osborne Joining in the conversation . I say , Flora , did you know that Bellamy Squib came out last night with his hair parted in the middle ? Never saw so straight a line in my life . The equator 's crooked to it . Last week he appeared with a dog-collar standee about his throat . Sheet iron was limpsy next to it . When he shaves I shall leave town . Flora . Flora I do n't care anything about Bellamy Squib , or the equator either . Do n't talk to me , Mr. Osborne . Osb . Jack Osborne Mr. Osborne ! She called me Jack only yesterday . Reads a newspaper . Flora . Flora Taking Dalton to a seat upon the sofa . And so you were born in France ? Why , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So do I , after a fashion . Oh , we had such a lovely French professor at our school . The mistress said he was a decayed count . Have you been to the opera , yet ? No , of course not , as you only arrived this morning , how could you ? You can go to-morrow night in our box . And then you can take me to parties , and bring me home . Wo n't that be nice ? As you live in our house , of course it will be perfectly proper . Just as if you were my brother . Oh , I 'm so glad you 've come , for I guess we are going to have a tip-top winter . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Aside . What a charming prattler ! To Flora . If you must make a relative of me , I think I should prefer being your cousin . Flora . Flora Oh , yes , my cousin . It 'll be such fun ! Aside . I 'll make Jack Osborne jealous if there 's any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must keep a watch over that girl . Aloud " Thirteenth edishin ! Twenty-five minutes later from Eurpe ! " Flora . Flora I want to introduce you to all my acquaintances especially Amy Nelson . She 's the dearest girl . She 's an orphan : yes , she has n't any father or mother ; orphans never do , you know : poor thing : her father was in the navy . You shall tell me if she is not a great deal prettier than me . Oh , I do everybody justice . Suppose she is prettier than me ; I can do a great many things better than her . I can entertain more gentlemen at a time than she can . Oh , there 's no harm in saying that , because it 's so : everybody can see it . I often have a dozen men round me at a party and she never has more than two . However , that 's better than Jemima Bradshaw ; she never has a single one , poor girl : I often send her one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always looks so grateful . Dalt . Frederick Dalton I trust you will never resort to such a pretext to rid yourself of me , Miss Lacy . Flora . Flora Oh , how can you think of such a thing ? Look here a minute . I want to tell you a secret . They whisper . Osb . Jack Osborne Listen to this . " Fourteenth Edishin ! A despatch from Rome mentions a rumor that his Holiness the Pope has been happily converted to the Protestant faith . " Flora . Flora Why , what was he before ? Osb . Jack Osborne A Catholic , of course , simpleton . Flora . Flora I declare I always thought he was a Jew ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Aside . What a delicious little ignoramus ! Flora . Flora So , remember , you are to call me Flora , and I 'll call you Frederick . It 's so stiff to say Mr. and Miss , and for cousins , you know , it 's absurd . And you must be with me as much as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've finished my education . Osb . Jack Osborne Louis Napoleon 's going it , is n't he ? " Fifteenth Edishin ! A telegram from Paris states that the French Emperor , in view of the augmenting disproportion between the population and the harvests , has decreed that all persons desiring an increase in their families , must apply for a permit to the Prefect of Police . " Aside . I think I wo n't go to France . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Low to Osborne . If you are going to read the French news , for gracious sake put a fig-leaf over your mouth . Lacy . Mr. Lacy I say , my dear , is n't it nearly time for tea ? Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy I am expecting it every moment . Lacy . Mr. Lacy I am as fond of my tea as old Sam Johnson was I ca n't do without my tea . Flora . Flora Now , remember , you are to sit next to me . Do you like waffles ? Oh , I adore waffles : we have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you sit next to me at table always . That 'll be so nice ; we can talk , you know , about the opera and my new dresses . You must have such taste in dress , being from Paris , of course . And then I can help you to waffles . Dalt . Frederick Dalton I should be delighted to sit next to you , even without the waffles . I should be perfectly happy , were I only permitted to gaze at you . Flora . Flora Oh , but you must n't look at me while I am eating , you 'd make me laugh . Oh , I ca n't go to the opera to-morrow night , I 've got to go to a funeral in the morning . Yes , my most intimate friend , Carry Titbit ; she died last evening . She was the sweetest girl . Jim Bachelor flirted with her , and she was awfully in love with him , and he went and offered himself to a fearfully ugly girl that was rich , and Carry Titbit died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studs those are ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Do you like them ? Osb . Jack Osborne " Sixteenth Edishin ! The schooner Four and Twenty Blackbirds arrived this morning from Bermuda , with a cargo of potatoes . " Never knew so entertaining a paper in my life . So enterprising , too ! Servant . Servant Entering . The tea is on the table , madam . Exit . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Gentlemen , will you come to tea , if you please . Mr. Dalton , give me your arm . Flora . Flora No , ma , he 's going with me . Did n't you say you 'd go with me , Frederick ? Lacy . Mr. Lacy Oh , leave the young people to themselves , Mrs. L. You should associate with your contemporaries . Come along with me . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell To Dalton . Dalton , you are making a fool of yourself . Mrs L. Mrs. Lacy Flora , come down to tea immediately . Exeunt Mr. and Mrs. Lacy , and Tyrrell . Dalt . Frederick Dalton I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for the sake of the tea . Kisses her hand . Flora . Flora The next time you do that , do n't let pa see you , or he 'll take my head off . Dalt . Frederick Dalton I 'm not such a lover of tea as Dr. Johnson . Flora . Flora What Dr. Johnson ? Dr. Johnson of 23d St. ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton No , Dictionary Dr. Johnson , Flora . Flora . Flora After reflection . I do n't know him . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Aside . One thing is very certain , Flora is not a flirt , at any rate . They go up . Osb . Jack Osborne That girl is the most thorough-bred flirt I ever knew in my life . Flora . Flora Going out . Mr. John Osborne , waffles and chocolate . Exeunt Dalton and Flora . Osb . Jack Osborne Yes , I 'm coming presently , when I 've finished this paper . I believe there 's another edition . " Seventeenth edishin ! We hasten to announce that all the items contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoid of foundation ! " Exit , putting the paper carefully in his pocket . END OF FIRST ACT . ACT II . Same Scene . Evening . A fortnight later . Nancy , arranging furniture . Nancy . Nancy And so Miss Flora 's got another string to her bow , or rather another beau to her string ; and a pretty long string it is , too . Poor fellow ! I suppose he 'll be done brown like the rest . One would actually think the men liked it . I 'm perfectly sure such doings ca n't be right , for when I told Mr. Dalton 's French servant , Pierre , how my missis carried on , he lifted his eyebrows and said , Sapristi ! And when I told him Mr. Dalton was the twentieth at least , he put his arm round my waist for support , and said , Mong Dioo ! I asked him what Mong Dioo meant , and he said it was the French way of swearing , but quite proper and genteel , so that if you swore at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind it . I think I shall learn , for of course swearing in English would be out of place in a female ; though , sometimes , I must say , I should think a good round D , A , double M , damm , must take quite a load off one 's stomach . Here he is , poor young man . Enter Dalton . Dalton . Frederick Dalton Ah , Nancy , you are the very person I wanted to see . Aside . I 'll question the chambermaid , it 's the custom in such cases . Aloud . Tell me , Nancy , does Miss Flora ever speak to you of me , when you and she are alone together ? Nancy . Nancy Aside . I 'll tell him the truth , if I die for it . Aloud . Yes , sir , she said last night that she wished Jack Osborne was as handsome as you . Dalton . Frederick Dalton Rather a left-handed compliment . Nancy . Nancy Or else she said she wished you were as rich as Jack Osborne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . But , Nancy , what did she do with the bouquet I sent her for the ball last night ? Nancy . Nancy Well , sir , she had so many bouquets , she gave yours to Jemima Bradshaw  --  that girl , you know , that never has any gentlemen . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Kind-hearted Flora ! And , Nancy , what did she do with my daguerreotype ? Lowering voice . Did she put it  --  you know  --  where women put that sort of thing ? Nancy . Nancy Sir ! Aside . Sapristi ! Aloud . No , sir , she put it in the box where she keeps the others . Dalt . Frederick Dalton What others ? Nancy . Nancy Why , the other daguerreotypes . She 's got thirty of them . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Who are they , for gracious sake ? Nancy . Nancy Well , she 's got Jack Osborne , and you , and Mr. Tyrrell , and Bellamy Squib , and  --  Dalt . Frederick Dalton That 'll do , Nancy . Flora is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I do n't like to say . Bellamy Squib says she is ; she says , she is n't . There 's no telling . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Very well , that 's all I wanted to know , Nancy . Here , here are five francs for you  --  it 's my last piece of French coin . Nancy . Nancy Thank you , sir . I 'll always do all I can for you , just as I have for all the rest . Aside . Five franes ! I 'll ask Pierre how much it 's worth . Mong Dioo ! Exit . Dalt . Frederick Dalton And to think that I am actually in love with her ! For I am , I can neither conceal it from myself nor from others . There 's a fascination about her that I can not explain , and I can not escape from the spell . I am ashamed of my own weakness , yet I can not summon courage to break my bonds . No man knows better than I that Flora is worldly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted to be my wife ; that her education has been lamentably neglected ; and yet her charming manners , her amiable , senseless prattle , and above all , the positive encouragement she gives me , keep me in torture while awake , and fill my brain with dreams while asleep . Ah ! I do n't well see my way out of this unhappy business . I wonder if Lacy has changed my investments yet , by the way . For it seems that if I am to have any chance with Flora , I must look into my money matters a little . I hardly like disturbing the prudent arrangements of my father , but every one tells me that they are too old-school for a man of the present generation . Besides , I 've no choice , if I wish to succeed in this reckless race . Would I were back again , and Flora forgotten ! Enter Flora , with a calico dress in her hand . Flora . Flora Ah , Frederick , I was looking for you . I wanted to ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frederick Dalton Why , this gingham thing is not for you , is it ? Flora . Flora Oh yes , it 's for ma 's calico ball , you know . Dalt . Frederick Dalton A calico ball ! Pray , what 's that ? Flora . Flora Why , do n't you know ? A calico ball 's a ball where all the ladies come dressed in calico , and then when the gong strikes at midnight , they take them off , and give them to the poor . Only sometimes they have them made low in the neck and very tight-waisted , and then the poor ca n't get into them . The indigent are always so stout , you know . Or if they do , the gowns are so scant , they almost freeze to death . So I told ma that if we did anything for the poor , I wanted to do it right . See , this is high in the neck , and loose enough for our cook . I 'm making it myself ; and Amy Nelson is coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten my spool . Rings bell . And then we are to rehearse the new dance to-night too . That 'll be such fun . Just try it on to me , will you ? Enter Nancy . Nancy , fetch my sewing cotton , will you ? Nancy . Nancy Yes , miss ! Exit . Dalt . Frederick Dalton I do n't believe I should know how . This way , is it ? Flora . Flora Yes , put it right over my head , so . You have n't told me what you think of Amy Nelson . Ah , you hurt ! Is n't she a sweet girl ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton I admire her very much . Rather long waisted , Flora . Flora . Flora Who ? Amy ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton No , the dress . Flora . Flora Oh , that 's no matter , I take it off at midnight , you know . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Rather palish complexion , though . Flora . Flora What , the dress ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton No , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I look now ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , delicious ! Miss Biddy O'Flannigan , I declare . I do n't know which becomes you best , calico or satin . Flora . Flora Now , bi mi sowl , that 's just like you min . Ye ca n't spake the truth for the life of ye . The divvle fly away wid ye , for a pack of chating , desateful craters ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Applauding . Bravo ! What an unctuous brogue ! I say , Biddy , are you the barmaid of the establishment ? Flora . Flora Faith , ye may say that . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Then I 'm going to have a kiss ! A vivacious scramble around the furniture ensues , during which enter Nancy , with a slice of bread and molasses . Dalton kisses her , and comes forward triumphant . Nancy . Nancy Sapristi ! Here 's the spool , Miss . Mong Dioo ! Exit . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh ! Flora , I am happy now , for the first moment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Flora . Flora Taking off the dress . I should think it must have been . There 's a little drop of molasses left in your moustache ! Ha ! ha ! ha ! Well , Nancy is a good girl , but there 's no accounting for tastes . Oh , by the way , Frederick , one of our dancing party can not come to-night , and I told Nancy she must take her place . You can have her for a partner if you like . Dalt . Frederick Dalton No , I want you for a partner . Flora . Flora You ca n't , I 've promised to dance with Jack Osborne . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Aside . Confound Jack Osborne ! Aloud . Well , on the night of the ball ? Flora . Flora That depends on whether you 'll pay the price ; I 'll tell you about that . Hush , there 's some one coming . Enter Amy Nelson . Flora . Flora Why , it 's Amy , I declare ; oh , I 'm so glad you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amy Nelson Good evening , Mr. Dalton . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Good evening , Miss Nelson . Flora . Flora And you 've brought your dress , too ; that 's a love . I do so wonder how you 'll look in calico , Amy . Amy . Amy Nelson Oh , I know very well how I look in it . I wear calico nearly all summer , at my aunt 's house in the country . You know I do n't go to Newport , Flora , so this sort of gown is exactly what I want . Imagine me making butter in a watered silk ! Flora . Flora I guess it would be a buttered silk before you got through ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Do you make butter , Miss Nelson ? Flora . Flora Oh , do tell us how you do it , I 'm dying to know . Of course I know it does n't grow on a tree . Amy . Amy Nelson You must come and see me next summer , and then I 'll show you . Flora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , ma 's going to Newport , you know . Amy . Amy Nelson Well , I think for us who live on the sea-board in the winter , it is best to spend the summer a little inland , among the mountains . To be salted in New York for ten months , and then salted again at Newport for two months more , is rather too much salt . Well now , Flora , about the rehearsal to-night . Flora . Flora Oh ! it is all arranged . Eight gentlemen and eight ladies . Frederick is going to dance with Nancy . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Miss Nelson , may I beg you to place no credit whatever in the statement of Miss Lacy , and to grant me the honor of your hand during the rehearsal . Amy . Amy Nelson With pleasure , sir . Dalt . Frederick Dalton And now , Miss Lacy , having secured a partner , will you permit me to solicit the privilege of being your vis- vis ? Flora . Flora Imitating him . Mr. Dalton , you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duty of selecting an opposite couple . Aside . Humph ! I can be as stiff as he can . Aloud . Oh , Amy , I 'm going up-stairs to see if the ladies ' dressing-room is ready . Will you come with me , or stay and entertain Frederick ? Amy . Amy Nelson I 'll go with you if Mr. Dalton will excuse me . Flora . Flora That 's right : I 've got an idea that I want to tell you . Come along . Runs out . Dalt . Frederick Dalton To Amy , following her . Miss Nelson , will you allow me one word , if you please ? Amy . Amy Nelson Certainly , sir . Aside . What can he want ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton Miss Nelson , will you do me the favor , the very great favor , to read me the riddle of Flora Lacy 's character ? I have never met with such a one before , and as the subject is one which interests me deeply , may I beg you not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant it as if we were already old friends . Amy . Amy Nelson But I am surprised by it , sir : I hardly see by what right  --  Dalt . Frederick Dalton By no right , Miss Nelson , but I appeal to our fellowship in misfortune : we are both orphans , I am a stranger , almost an exile ; tell me , tell me truly , has Flora Lecy a heart ? Amy . Amy Nelson I suppose she has ; she is capable of friendship , for she has always proved a true friend to me . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Is she capable of love ? Amy . Amy Nelson I have no doubt she is . At any rate , it would be preposterous in any man to presume her incapable of affection from the fact that she has never manifested any for him . Dalt . Frederick Dalton But suppose a woman does manifest affection , does not that prove , as an inevitable conclusion , the existance of affection itself ? Amy . Amy Nelson Not always . Dalt . Frederick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be using , for purposes of her own , the arts which nature has given her as weapons of defence . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Does she never use them as weapons of offence ? Amy . Amy Nelson Often . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Is not that wrong ? Amy . Amy Nelson Towards whom ? Herself or others ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton Towards others . Amy . Amy Nelson Ah ! I understand . Mr. Dalton , the hearts that are broken by a flirt  --  for I wo n't deny that Flora is one  --  are generally hearts that are not much injured by the breaking . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , Miss Nelson , you are severe . Amy . Amy Nelson Aside . I must defend Flora for the honor of the sex . Aloud Why , what is a woman to do with her time , Mr. Dalton ? If she reads , her conversation shows it , and men call her blue ; if she has opinions and maintains them , men call her strong-minded ; if she studies a profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she can hardly get a position behind a counter to retail tape and needles , that the men do n't murmur ! To think of a man peddling shoe-strings when he ought to be ploughing in the field ! No , a woman has nothing left on earth but to make a profession of her beauty , and to rise in the world by her face , as men rise by their intellect . At the same time , though I do not think that such an amiable , thoughtless , frivolous girl as Flora can do any serious harm to others , I think she may to herself . She will soon cease to be respected , and so I tell her . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Do you think that Flora , in the marked attentions she shows me , is indifferent to the effect they may produce ? Amy . Amy Nelson No . She desires you to be fascinated with her , but she does not desire to cause you either suffering or regret . The poor child does not imagine that she is gifted with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Dalton ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , I 'm bewildered , Miss Nelson , taken captive , body and soul . Remember , for my excuse , if my folly needs one , that until I saw Flora , I had no knowledge of young ladies whatever . I have lived among the French , and their manners are different from yours . A girl there never quits her mother 's side till she is married . Amy . Amy Nelson I may be wrong , but it seems to me that a young lady who needs her mother 's constant watching before marriage , would require all her husband 's watching afterwards . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Well , I 'll not argue the point with you . In short , you think , as far as Flora and I are concerned , that I have no chance . Amy . Amy Nelson Flora has told me , Mr. Dalton , that she will marry no one but a man of large and independent fortune . You are the best judge . Flora . Flora Reappearing . Amy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait ? Do n't beleive a word she says , Frederick , she 's horribly deceitful . Come , I want to tell you my idea . You see , Amy  --  Exeunt , talking confidentially . Dalt . Frederick Dalton It 's no use ; the more they try to dissuade me , the more I 'm resolved . I believe I 've the fever or the vertigo : I 'm in an unnatural state altogether . Now let me think , if I can collect my senses . The question is one of money : I must purchase Flora , or go without her . A large and independent fortune ! I thought mine so , till I landed upon these luckless shores  --  fifty thousand dollars safely invested at seven per cent . But it seems that one hundred thousand rashly ventured at twelve per cent , is the figure at which I must aim . I must make fifty thousand dollars in a fortnight , for there 's plainly no time to lose . Oh for the purse of Fortunatus , or the shower of Dana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , where can I find the goose with the golden eggs ? Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Mother Goose , you mean ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Can I make fifty thousand dollars in ten days ? Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Yes . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Honorably ? Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell No . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Then it wo n't do . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Is this foolish girl still running in your head ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton Alas ! yes . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Upon my word , it does surprise me to see a man capable of winning a woman by his talents , his acquirements , his position , condescend to run a money-muck for a prize not worth the getting or the keeping ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Well , it surprises me too : but I ca n't help it  --  it 's the change of climate , perhaps . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Or else something you 've eaten . We have queer things here , that 's a fact . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , succotash , pea-nuts . To Lacy entering . Ah , I 've been expecting you . Well , what have you done ? Quick , I 'm nervous , come . Lacy Mr. Lacy Well , wait , give me time . I 'm not altogether satisfied that what I 've done is right , but I 've done what you told me , at any rate . I 've made an exchange , Frederick . I 've converted your bond and mortgage in South St. into railway stock  --  the Smash and Bang'em  --  one of our fastest lines , They had an accident day before yesterday , so the stock was down . By the merest chance I met the agent of a man who wanted to dispose of all the stock he had ; ten thousand dollars ' worth . So I took it . The Smash and Bang'em has always paid ten per cent. , and I hope for your sake it always will . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell I 've heard people wonder , though , how the deuce it did it . Dalt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; at ten , one thousand ; difference three hundred dollars . Not so bad . But this is slow work , it will never do . I must take a look at the brokers ' board . Enter Osborne . Osb . Jack Osborne Good evening , gentlemen three . Where 's the calico ? Lacy . Mr. Lacy If you mean the ladies by that complimentary term , they are coming directly . Osb . Jack Osborne I wish they would . I 've worked hard enough today , I should like a little play . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell I do n't believe you 've worked as hard as a man I met in the omnibus to-night . Never heard of such a day 's work in my life . I 'll tell it to you if I can remember it ; let me see ; ah , yes . Got up , eat fish-ball , kissed wife , went down town  --  had ship arrive from Calcutta  --  swindled custom-house out of eight hundred dollars  --  dropped into prayer-meeting in John St.  --  sold cargo at fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  sent Cashmere shawl to eldest daughter  --  went to funeral of partner  --  and rode up town in a five cent stage ! Osb . Jack Osborne Yes , that takes me down , I own up . What I did was not so much in itself , but it was so very satisfactory . Lacy , what do you think of this ? Heard of concern that was going to assign to-day : had stock in it : frightened to death : sent agent to get rid of said stock at any sacrifice : agent met jolly old codger acting for green young man : got stock off on him for more than I gave for it . Ha ! ha ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy Rather sharp practice , Jack . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Rather a questionable transaction , sir . Osb . Jack Osborne Oh , no , perfectly allowable  --  business is business , you know . Lacy . Mr. Lacy What sort of concern was it that 's going to assign ? Some coal mine , I suppose . Osb . Jack Osborne No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good gracious , Jack ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton What railroad , sir , what railroad ? Osb . Jack Osborne It 's a secret till to-morrow : but it is n't worth a red cent . Lacy . Mr. Lacy I have private reasons for wishing to know , Jack . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Tell us , sir . Quick , I 'm nervous , come . Osb . Jack Osborne Wo n't you tell ? Lacy . Mr. Lacy Dalt . No , no . Osb . Jack Osborne Confidentially . Well , it 's the Smash and Bang'em ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy Heavens ! Osb . Jack Osborne And the cream of the joke is that I swapped it off against a tip-top , straight out , A No. 1 . bond and mortgage in South St. ! Lacy and Dalton go up and talk excitedly . Hallo , what 's the matter now ? I say , Lacy , were n't they jolly green ? Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell I wish you joy of your achievement ; the old codger in question was Lacy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Osborne Whew ! Well , it ca n't be helped now , of course ! Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell I advise you to annul the whole transaction , and suffer the loss upon the stock yourself . Osb . Jack Osborne I sha n't do it , though , by George , I 'm sorry for Dalton . Goes up . I say , Lacy , &c.; Enter Mrs. Lacy , Flora , and Amy . Tyrrell talks with Amy , Osborne with Flora . Dalton apart . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Wife , I 've a word to say to you . What do you suppose your hopeful candidate for a son-in-law has done today ? Juggled ten thousand dollars out of Dalton 's pocket into his own . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Serves him right for coming to this country ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy But what 's worse , I was a partner in the operation , and as I am not in the habit of being accessory to such affairs , I mean to make good the amount . Now I do n't intend my daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So you may as well banish that scheme from your mind . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy I suppose you want her to marry the Frenchman ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy Who do you mean by the Frenchman ? Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Why , Dalton , of course . Lacy . Mr. Lacy I 've told you till I 'm black in the face that he 's not a Frenchman . But Flora sha n't marry Osborne , that 's flat . Goes up . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy And she sha n't marry Dalton , that 's flatter . Flora , my dear , come here . Flora . Flora Ma , we are going to begin the dance now . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Flora , my love , your father refuses his consent up and down to your marriage with Osborne . There 's no help for it , my child . There 's only one way out of it . You must elope . Flora . Flora Oh , ma ! I do n't want to go away from home ! Besides I 've only had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to marry till I 've had fifteen ! Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy I ca n't help it , my dear . I 'll arrange it for you ; you must elope on the night of the ball . I 've invited the reporter of the Weekly Small Talk  --  so he can do up the ball and the elopement at the same time . Flora . Flora Well , I must ask Jack : perhaps he wo n't want to . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Be sure and tell him there 's no other chance . Aside . But where shall I get the necessary funds ? For of course I ca n't ask Mr. Lacy . Hum  --  I must make another visit to Mr. Israel Dross , I suppose . My pearl necklace must pay the scot . I 'm half ashamed  --  but then Flora 's happiness depends upon it . Aloud . Tell Jack , my love . Flora . Flora Mr. Osborne , look here a minute . What do you think ? Ma says we must elope ! Osb . Jack Osborne No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing . For your old gentleman is frightfully riley , and what do you think for ? Because I diddled Dalton out of ten thousand dollars . Flora . Flora Was it all fair and square ? Osb . Jack Osborne Perfectly fair : it was n't precisely honorable . Flora . Flora Well , I mean , they ca n't arrest you for it  --  those horrid police ca n't interfere ? Osb . Jack Osborne Good heavens , no ! Flora . Flora Oh , well then , it 's all right . Oh , Jack , I wanted to tell you something ; if you dance with me at the ball , you must pay five dollars a dance ; it 's for the poor . Miss Hatpasser did it and made a hundred dollars . Do put your name down . Osb . Jack Osborne Certainly . Gentlemen , Miss Lacy appeals to your gallantry at five dollars a dance . Writes . Jack Osborne : first and third waltz , first and third redowa , first and third lancers , first and third polka . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn next ? Takes out pocket-book . Dalt .

Flora Oh , yes , I 'm so glad . You see , Amy , I 'm such a silly little thing , I want to do some good in the world if I can . Well , this fills-up my list , does n't it ? Oh , no , there 's the German ! Why , I had almost forgotten the German . I think I ought to have ten dollars for the German : it may last two hours . Dalt . Frederick Dalton I will give ten , gladly , Miss Flora Osb . Jack Osborne And I twelve . Dalt . Frederick Dalton And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an auction ; quick , give me a chair .

Jack Osborne I believe I was born to swindle that Dalton . Goes up and out . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Well , I came out ahead that time at any rate . Flora . Flora Wait a moment , gentlemen , how much am I offered for Jemima Bradshaw in the lot ? Amy . Amy Nelson Oh , Flora , that was ill-natured . Flora . Flora Pooh ! Catch me . I 'm going to jump .

Tyrrell is going up to her , Dalton anticipates him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dalton Will Miss Nelson allow me to inscribe my name upon her card upon the same conditions ? Amy . Amy Nelson You may inscribe your name , and you may give what you like to the poor . But I should not wish it to pass through my hands . Dalt . Frederick Dalton May I put down six dances ? Amy . Amy Nelson No , that would excite remark : I will dance with you three times with pleasure . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Ah , Miss Nelson , if all girls were like you . Aside . Why did I not fall in love with Amy instead of Flora ? Amy . Amy Nelson Aside . I think I am rather sorry he is in love with Flora . Aloud . Shall we go and dress ? Exeunt . Flora . Flora Now , pa , I say you must : and you too , ma , we sha n't have enough without you . Pulls them . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Flora , my child , you hurt me . Flora .

Enter four male dancers , in blouses , overalls , caps , and other attire the worse for wear . Enter four female dancers , in calico gowns , all alike . Enter Lacy , Tyrrell , Dalton , and Osborne , in blouses , &c.; Enter Mrs. Lacy , Nancy , Amy , and Flora , in calico gowns , alike , but different from the other four . A Fancy Dance . The Gong sounds . A rapid taking off of calico , blouses , and overalls , which are thrown in a heap in the centre . END OF SECOND ACT . ACT III . Flirtation Room , or Boudoir . Enter Flora and Dalton , arm in arm . Flora . Flora Fanning herself . Oh , my , is n't it hot ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton But what a delightful redowa ! And to think I have already had six of my dances , and that there are only two left ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much rather look at you , only I 'm forced to gaze at the man you are with , and that takes away all the satisfaction . Flora . Flora I 've a great mind to tell Amy that you do n't like to dance with her . Dalt . Frederick Dalton But I do like to dance with her , for I can talk of you . Flora . Flora Oh dear , I wish men would talk of something else but love : it 's always the same thing . Frederick , what made you fall in love with me ! You know I have n't two ideas in my head . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Well , I believe that 's the reason . I love you because you are charming , nonsensical , delightful . Never , since I was born , have I seen a creature so utterly seductive and bewildering . You 've taken away my senses , and I have n't two ideas either . I used to think the choice of a wife the most serious thing in life , but I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a black and tan terrier . Oh , Flora , if you only knew how madly I love you ! Flora . Flora And do you think I do n't return it ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton Flora , Flora , do n't say such things , unless you mean them ! I 'm sick at heart enough already , and could not endure a disappointment like that ! Flora . Flora Drawing a medallion from her bosom . Now to show you what an ungrateful man you are . Look ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Flora ! My portrait ! Oh , how unjust I was to doubt you . Aside . Oh , this can not be flirtation ! Aloud . Flora , dearest Flora ! Flora . Flora Dear Frederick ! Hush ! there 's some one coming . It 's that horrid Mr. Dross , that Jack introduced me to . Jack says he 's a dreadful low man , but he had to invite him . Enter Israel Dross . Dross . Israel Dross How d'ye do , again ? Jack told me to waltz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get you . You do flit so excruciating on the light bombastic toe ! Flora . Flora Excuse me , Mr. Dross , but I 'm engaged for this waltz to Mr. Osborne . Dross . Israel Dross Oh , come now , Jack said that he was busy , making preparations for you 'd know what , and I might waltz with you instead . They are playing the bulliest music . Flora . Flora To Dalton . Is n't it disgusting ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton It 's odious . Dross . Israel Dross So , if you please , marm . Offering his arm . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Stay with me . Flora . Flora You must excuse me , Mr. Dross , but I am fatigued , and wish to rest during this dance . Dross . Israel Dross Oh , bother , you can rest afterwards , you know . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Who is this creature , Flora ? Flora . Flora I never saw him till to-night . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Shall I knock him down ? Flora . Flora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carpet . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Miss Lacy , will you do me the honor of waltzing this waltz with me , if you are not too fatigued ? Flora . Flora With great pleasure . I am not fatigued in the least . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Well , I get an extra dance by it at any rate . Flora . Flora And it does n't cost you anything either . Ha ! ha ! Exeunt . Dross . Israel Dross Well , I 'm blowed if I like that . Confound that dandy chap . If I ever catch him in Chatham St. wo n't he get knocked higher'n a kite ? He do n't know I 'm in the money-lending line , what 's he blowing about ? Curse that girl with her imperance . Did n't Jack interduce me , and is n't Jack going to marry her ? She need n't turn up her nose ; do n't I loan chemicals and mint-drops to her ma ? Ai n't I her precious ma 's own special druggist ? And do n't Jack advance ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em over again to her ? Miss Pert wo n't dance with ma 's own Hegeman ? I 've a notion to blurt the whole thing . I wish they 'd hurry up that spread . Enter Mr. Lacy . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Dear me , a strange gentleman unattended to . I do n't know what 's got Mrs. Lacy to-night . Can I do anything for you , my dear sir ? Aside . Who can he be ? Dross . Israel Dross Well , yes , you can . If you know where the cup-board is , I should like a shy at the sherry . I 'm as dry as Bloomingdale on a dusty Sunday . Lacy . Mr. Lacy I presume , sir , that the cupboard is kept shut for reasons best known to the master of the house . Aside . This is a very free and easy gentleman . Dross . Israel Dross Do you know whether there 's to be much of a spread , to-night ? Lacy . Mr. Lacy How do you mean , spread ? Dross . Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a pass-round-on-a-tray , or a regular spandangulous blow-out-on-a-counter ? You ought to know if you are a friend of the family . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Aside . Good heavens ! what horrible language ! Can this be an acquaintance of Flora 's ? Aloud . The supper will be creditable to the house , sir , I have no doubt . Dross . Israel Dross I hope it will , for I 've been saving myself up . Any salmon , do you know ? You seem posted , so I do n't mind asking . Lacy . Mr. Lacy I think there is salmon , sir . I caught sight of it just now , if I am not mistaken . Dross . Israel Dross Then it 'll be a spread sure : any Green Seal , hey ? Lacy . Mr. Lacy I believe the champagne ordered is of that brand . You seem quite a connoisseur . Dross . Israel Dross Well , Green Seal and I , we 've had some good times together . If you 'll promise not to open your head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I usually do , in fact , when I 'm primed with Green Seal . Were you at Mrs. Wallabout 's ball ? Lacy . Mr. Lacy Mrs. Wallabout ? No , I do n't know her . Dross . Israel Dross She 's the wife of an East River skipper ; rich , though , bound to get into the Upper Ten . Gave magnificent spread ; salmon and Green Seal . Never felt so creamy in my life ; spied dumb waiter in corner  --  you know , one of those things that slide up and down with crockery ; drew out pocket bowie-knife  --  this one  --  cut strings and let down crockery to eternal smash . Confidentially . I say , do you know whether there is a dumb waiter in this house ? Lacy . Mr. Lacy Aside . Mercy on me , who can this ruffian be ? Aloud . No , sir , I believe there is not . Dross . Israel Dross Curse it , that 's bad , it makes such an infernal clatter . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Aside . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates , too . How can I get him out of the house ? It would make too much trouble to kick him out , I suppose . At any rate , I can order the Grape Leaf up and the Green Seal down , and so save the crockery . To Dross . Pray excuse me now . I see a friend in the other room . Aside . Bless my stars , who can have invited him ? Exit . Dross . Israel Dross I wonder who that old pop is : seems quite at home here . Hallo ! There 's Flora with another man : dandy chap is n't with her : blowed if I wont ask her again . Wish I had some supper aboard , though : the bombastic toe 's such a blowed deal lighter when a fellow 's top-heavy . I 'll go it , blow me . Exit . Enter Osborne and Mrs. Lacy , from opposite directions . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Hush , speak low , is everything ready ? Osb . Jack Osborne Yes , everything is ready but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper : romantic idea , is n't it ? Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Well , as she 'll have no supper after the wedding , she may as well have a little before hand . Did you see the clergyman ? Osb . Jack Osborne Yes , he said he 'd wait till two o'clock : it 's a quarter past twelve now . Gapes . I was afraid he perhaps would n't marry us on the sly . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Oh yes , this one will . He 's been known to marry people and not recognise them a month after . I 've had my eye upon him for some time . Such men are very useful in a city like this . Osb . Jack Osborne Well , I 've come to the conclusion that there is n't a thing you ca n't get in New York , if you 'll only pay for it . Give me ten minutes and I 'll find anything in Broadway from a cathedral to a toothpick . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy How long do you think you shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall cut the honeymoon down to a honeyweek . Six days , with one to rest in , is about my figure . Gapes . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Promise me one thing , Jack : promise to make Flora happy . Osb . Jack Osborne Good gracious , how do you suppose she 's going to help being happy , with carte blanche at Tiffany 's and ditto at Stuart 's ? Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Of course , I know that 's a great deal , but then you must be kind and gentle with her  --  Osb . Jack Osborne My stars , mother-in-law , you do n't think I 'm going to beat her , do you ? Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy No , but , Jack , I 'm almost afraid to think of what I 've done . Osb . Jack Osborne Do n't back out now , for gracious sake . Think of that precious clergyman that 's sitting up for us . Gapes and looks at his watch . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy No , I 'm not going to retract , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Flora .

By the by , Osborne , who is that strange man talking to Flora ? Osb . Jack Osborne That ? Aside . Dross , as I live . Aloud . Oh , he 's an acquaintance of mine . He 's connected with the assay office . Aside . Private assay office of his own : little back shop with sixpenny crucible . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy I do n't think his manners are very refined . Osb . Jack Osborne Oh , beg your pardon : meet him constantly at a place of fashionable public resort . Aside . Lager beer saloon in Neilson Place . Aloud . He once rendered me assistance at an important juncture , and I esteem him accordingly . Aside . Took me home one night , and put me to bed . Mrs. L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose . Osb . Jack Osborne Yes , I asked him to drop in . Aside . I do n't remember it , but I dare say I did . But I 'll set him adrift to-night . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Aside . He looks for all the world like that money-lender in the Bowery . I would n't have Mr. Lacy know . Aloud . Why , John , he 's going to dance with Flora . Osb . Jack Osborne Oh , I ca n't stand that ; I told him he might , to get rid of him , but I 'd no idea he would . Confound him , his arm is round her waist : oh , I 'd rather dance with her myself . Half-past twelve ; mercy on me , how sleepy I am ! Exit . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy I 'm almost sure it 's the man : to think of such a creature being invited to my house . Horrors ! perhaps he 'll recognise me ! Enter Nancy . Nancy . Nancy Marm , marm , James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the carriage just now , when we saw a policeman on the other side of the street , standing stock-still like a ghost , and staring at us with all his eyes . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Good heavens , Nancy ! Nancy . Nancy Well , ma'am , it is rather suspicious , this taking trunks out of the basement at one in the morning . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Run , Nancy , invite him in , give him some supper , cut the salmon if you ca n't keep it , and find out what he wants . Run , quick . Nancy . Nancy Yes , ma'am . Aside . Spotted by a policeman , sapristi ! Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Mercy on us , can Mr. Lacy suspect ? What with elopements , balls , suppers , money-lenders , and policemen , I beheve I shall go out of my wits . Heavens , it is he ! That horrible Israel Dross ! Let me slip out ! Exit . Enter Dross .

If some folks are proud , perhaps they 've got a right . Fine old family , perhaps : slap-up connexions : blow me , I can understand these things as well as another . But Jack Osborne , pah ! Mama Lacy , pooh ! Tenth rate people anyhow . I sha n't come again , blow ' em ! Enter Osborne . Osb . Jack Osborne Dross , I want to speak a word in your ear . Dross . Israel Dross Well , fire away , Jack . Osb . Jack Osborne Do n't call me Jack , to begin with . Dross , where did I make your acquaintance ? Dross . Israel Dross Do n't you remember the light bombastic toe ? Broadway dancing-school ? Chassez  --  Right hand across  --  one  --  two  --  Cuts a pigeon-wing . Osb . Jack Osborne Stop . I took a fancy to you : I ca n't conceive why ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said I talked the most elegant slang you ever heard in your life . Osb . Jack Osborne And then you presented me to the flash characters of your acquaintance ? I believe I have todded with gamblers , and I remember calling a short-boy by his Christian name . And then I lent you money to lend again ? And I had you invited to Mrs. Wallabout 's ? And I was fool enough to invite you here , and you were scamp enough to come ? Now listen . I am going to be married , Dross , and I do n't want to know you any more . Dross . Israel Dross Oh , come now , Jack . Osb . Jack Osborne Do n't call me Jack . I 've had enough of low life , and I 'm going to shake it off . Dross . Israel Dross Oh , I guess it comes too natural to be shook off so easy . Osb . Jack Osborne Well , I 'll shake you off , at any rate . When I saw you just now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt my flesh creep on my bones : I shuddered from head to foot . And then I knew that I was n't as bad as I seemed , nor as low as I looked . It was sudden and short , but it did me good . Dross , I 'm sick of you , you 're an odious toad . Leave the house . Dross . Israel Dross If you see me leaving it , let me know , will you ? Osb . Jack Osborne Get out , or I 'll call the servants . Dross . Israel Dross And if you do , I 'll tell ' em about that twenty-eight per cent . Low ? I ai n't as low as you , my boy . If I am low . I ca n't help it ; I was born so , and it ai n't my fault . But you , you are low because you like it , and you ran after me so as to catch it , and you did catch it , and you 've got it so strong you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't swindle my mother-in-law , any way . Osb . Jack Osborne What 's your mother-in-law to do with me ? Dross . Israel Dross Not mine , yours . Mrs. L blank Y wanted to make a raise : pawned pearl necklace : Osborne lent the money to Dross : Dross passed it over to Mrs. L blank Y : necklace was n't redeemed , sold to pay expenses , profit twenty-eight per cent . Osborne and Dross shared . I 'm a toad , am I ? Osb . Jack Osborne Aside . Oh , I must wash my hands clean of him , to-night , if I have n't enough left to pay the parson with . Aloud . How much have I made in this infernal traffic ? Dross . Israel Dross Well , you 've made a pretty good thing of it . Osb . Jack Osborne Five hundred ? Six hundred ? Do n't be modest . Dross . Israel Dross Well , Jack , about $621.45 , I should say . I may be a few cents  --  Osb . Jack Osborne Drawing pocket-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Count that . Aside . I 've had the low fever , I 've been cured , I 've paid the doctor 's bill , and I feel better . Dross . Israel Dross Six hundred and twenty-five . Osb . Jack Osborne Very well . Now remember , I do n't know you . I never saw you , I never spoke to you , and not a cent ever passed from your hand to mine . And now I 'll give you a piece of advice . If you should ever be so unlucky as to be compelled to entrust your fate to twelve of your countrymen , take devilish good care that I am not one of the twelve ! Exit . Dross . Israel Dross Alarmed . Twelve men ? What twelve men ? He ca n't mean that affair of the  --  Ugh ! I feel cold all over . I 'm glad to be rid of him , any how , he 's too blowed low for me . I must have something hot , or I shall freeze . Enter Lacy . Lacy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe at any rate . Now to get rid of this abominable interloper . I 'll quiet him with a decanter in a corner , and send word to the station-house . To Dross . I 've good news for you , sir . Confidentially . I 've found out where the sherry is . Dross . Israel Dross No ? How is it ? Slap up ? Lacy . Mr. Lacy How do you mean , slap up ? Dross . Israel Dross Is it the thing , the go , O. K. , A No. 1 , tip top , bang up , straight out ? Lacy . Mr. Lacy Aside . Mercy on me , this man will kill me with slang . To Dross . Well , I do n't know ; we 'll try it and see . Aside . I 'll send him to the pound , on the pretext that he 's a dog of a Jew ! Whether he 's a dog or not I do n't know , but I 'm shot if he 's muzzled ! Dross . Israel Dross In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking through the crack , and what do you think ? There is a dumb waiter ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy Aside . But there 's no Green Seal , my boy . Have him there ! Aloud . Let 's go and try the sherry ! Exeunt arm in arm . Re-enter Osborne . Osb . Jack Osborne Gone , is he ? That 's well . A quarter to one , and no signs of supper : and Flora vows she wo n't stir till she 's had her oysters . Picturesque idea on a man 's wedding night . Gapes . Enter Mrs. Lacy . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Aside . Horrors ! he knows me ! Oh , what a degradation ! Aloud . Oh , Jack , Jack , how could you bring such a creature here ? Osb . Jack Osborne Which creature ? Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Why , your friend Dross . I met him this instant and what do you think he said ? " How d'ye do , old girl ? " Mr. Lacy evidently thinks him quite a card , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him of sherry . Osb . Jack Osborne He wo n't come again , that 's one comfort . Sits down and gapes . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Every ball I give I always vow I 'll never give another . But this will be the last , that 's very certain . Enter Nancy . Nancy . Nancy It 's all right , ma'am : I 've been talking to the officer . He says it 's nothing to do with us . He 's only after a man that he says is a receiver , that 's all ! Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy A what ? Nan . Nancy A receiver . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy That ca n't be anything very bad , for Mr. Lacy was appointed a receiver last week by Judge Roosevelt . Nan . Nancy I asked the officer what a receiver was , and he said they sometimes called it a fence . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Goodness gracious ! A fence ! I have n't an idea what it means , but it sounds like something awful . It must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that when people gave town-meetings in their houses at midnight , in a city like this , they ought to have a detective at the door . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Well , they ought , I do believe . My stars alive , a policeman in the house and a fence at the ball ! Where is he , Nancy ? I must see him . Perhaps he 'll arrest me too ! Nancy , bring some hock and pickled oysters on a tray ! Exit . Nan . Nancy Mong Dioo ! That ossifer ' ll bust , if he keeps on ! Exit . Osb . Jack Osborne Well , this is a cheerful wedding night . I wonder where it will end . I 'm too sleepy to find out what it all means . However , I 'll read about it in the morning papers . Enter Lacy . Lacy . Mr. Lacy I 've tabled him with the sherry , and there I 'll leave him . Oh , Mr. Osborne , a word with you . I learn from Flora that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who turns out to be a Hebrew money-lender . Explain yourself , sir . Osb . Jack Osborne Aside . Here 's another . I wish that Jew was in Joppa ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy Pleasant idea to think that I can not walk out without running the risk of being bowed to by a pawn-broker . Osb . Jack Osborne Well , you need n't bow back , you know . Aside . By George , it 's too bad to pay six hundred dollars to get rid of a man , and then be abused for your pains ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy Pleasant too for Flora to be saluted by a mock-auctioneer . Osb . Jack Osborne Oh , come , he is n't a mock-auctioneer ! And besides I 've known mock-auctioneers that were very decent men . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Oh , stop talking , do , you make me sick . Osb . Jack Osborne I knew a mock-auctioneer whose family went into the very nobbiest society . Everybody thought he was the President of a Bank . He sold pinchbeck watches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his wife . No , Lacy , it does n't do to have prejudices , you know . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Pshaw , with such easy logic as that you might prove a cannibal a Christian . Osb . Jack Osborne Well , I could , if I wanted to . Lacy . Mr. Lacy A cannibal a Christian ! Ha ! I should like to hear that ! Osb . Jack Osborne Well , sir , I 'll leave it to you if a cannibal does n't love his neighbors better than himself ! Aside . I do n't think I 'm as sleepy as I was . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Well , sir , a man that will vindicate Peter Funk and apologize for anthropophagy , is not fit company for my wife and daughter : and I have to request you , Mr. Osborne , never to enter my house again after you have once quitted it to-night . Osb . Jack Osborne I never will , sir , unless you make the first advance . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Which I am not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osborne I would go at once did not imperative reasons compel me to remain to supper . Aside . No , I am not at all as sleepy as I was . Lacy . Mr. Lacy I will bid you good evening , then , now . Osb . Jack Osborne Good evening , sir , and good bye . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Be good enough to say to Mrs. Lacy that I wish her joy of her annual ball , and that I have gone up stairs to bed . Exit . Osb . Jack Osborne Poor old Lacy ! Belongs to a by-gone age . One o'clock ! It would be deuced awkward if the clergyman should have retired for the night ! Exit . Enter Mrs. Lacy . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy So far so good . The officer has agreed not to make the arrest till the party is over . Bless me , I 'm all in a perspiration . Supper two hours late , too , and the guests beginning to murmur . Let me compose myself a little , and attend to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll begin with her . At the door . Why , my dear Mrs. Slingsby , how do you do ? How is your mother ? Exit . Enter Flora and Amy . Flora . Flora Oh , I 'm so glad we are alone , Amy , for I want to tell you something , dear : something very private . What a love of a dress that is : I 've been admiring it all evening . No , that is n't it ; of course not . But you must promise not to tell . Amy . Amy Nelson Oh , I promise solemnly . Some new conquest , I presume . Flora . Flora No , I 'm still at my fourteenth . Aside . I must break my vow , I suppose . Aloud . What I want is this . I 've been thinking , Amy , that something might happen to me : you know one never can tell  --  Amy . Amy Nelson Why , you little goose ! what is likely to happen to you ? Flora . Flora Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broadway , or I might swallow a peach-stone . Amy . Amy Nelson Or you might go off in a balloon , or a giant might carry you away in a diving bell . Go on , I 'm not listening . Flora . Flora Now , Amy , I declare you are unkind . I never was more serious in my life . You know how I love pa , though I 'm often very disobedient , and pa loves me , too ; I 'm his only daughter , and I believe it would break his heart if I should die , and you know there are some things as bad as dying . Well , if anything should happen , mind , I do n't say anything will , I want you to adopt pa , and come here and live in my place . Amy . Amy Nelson If this were after supper , Flora , I should think the champagne had got into your foolish little head . Was there ever such an idea heard of ? Flora . Flora Now you must , Amy dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an orphan , and if anything should happen to me , pa would be an orphan too , or it 's the same thing . Now come , there 's a dear : you ca n't think what a kind man pa is , and you 'll be so happy . Hush ! do n't say a word , you know . Enter Dalton and Tyrrell . Flora . Flora Frederick , I think it 's too bad of you to interrupt a private conversation . Dalt . Frederick Dalton We are the bearers of glad tidings , Miss Lacy : supper is ready ! Flora . Flora Oh , I 'm so glad ! Let me see , what will I have ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , Flora , you ca n't think how impatient I am for the German to begin . Flora . Flora Do let 's think of one thing at a time . Supper first , if you please . I 'm frightfully hungry . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Putting his handkerchief over his arm like a waiter . What will these ladies please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and everything that 's out : pine-apples from the tropics , sandwiches from over the way , salmon from the Kennebec , tea-cakes from round the corner , ice-cream from the pole , hot coffee from the equator , preserves from the ends of the earth , pickles from the confines of creation : we 've a little bit of everything , none too much of anything , it is n't often you have such a chance , now 's your time or never , but do n't both speak at once ! Flora . Flora Stop , you take away my breath . Dalt . Frederick Dalton To Flora . Send me for what you want . Flora . Flora Well , you may bring me some lobster salad , some stewed oysters , and a few sandwiches . And Frederick , bring me a little salmon and a roll on a separate plate . Exit Dalton . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell You are abstemious , Miss Nelson . A little gruel , to complete the banquet ? Amy . Amy Nelson Nothing else , sir , thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he will have , to be sure Exit . Amy . Amy Nelson Now Flora , tell me , quick , before they come back , what this scheme is that you 've got in your head , for I know there is one . Flora , are you going to run away from home ? Flora . Flora Why , Amy , how can you think of such a thing ? Amy . Amy Nelson Flora , were you to take such a step as that , you would regret it all the days of your life : and your regrets would begin to-morrow . Are you not happy at home ? Flora . Flora Now it 's you that are the little goose . To Tyrrell , entering . Why , where 's Frederick ? Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Giving an ice-cream to Amy . He 's in the thickest of the fray : when I saw him last , he was interceding with a negro , and menacing a white man . As for myself , I escaped with a slight stab in the back . Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat spattered Amy . Amy Nelson I am afraid I can never repay you for the perils you have undergone . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Oh , wait till Dalton gets back before you talk of peril . Flora . Flora You do n't think he 'll be long , do you ? Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell There 's no telling : he 'll get the roll easily enough , but I have my doubts about the salmon . I 've brought some mottoes to pass away the time . Here 's one for you , Flora . Flora . Flora Oh , I adore mottoes . Reading . " If you love me as I love you , No knife shall cut our love in two . " I declare to gracious , I believe that motto 's been given to me by three hundred different men ! Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell I have no doubt that the reason why there are so few genuine poets in the world , is that the taste is vitiated in early youth by these meretricious jingles . Flora . Flora You know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoaxie told me the other night . They take the Dictionary of Love and put it in a hand organ , and then you turn and it comes out in mottoes . Oh , here he is , hurrah ! Enter Dalton , with two plates ; one of his sleeves dragged up , his cravat untied , his collar bent , and a white smooch up one of his legs . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Here I am at last ! And in a pretty state , too . Flora , treat that salmon tenderly ; I had to sin to get it . That horrible wretch that asked you to dance , cut it for himself with his pocket bowie-knife . While he was sheathing his blade , I made a long arm and took it . As I was disappearing , I distinctly heard him say , " Prigged again , blow me ! " Whence I infer he had been served in the same way before . Flora . Flora They must have taken him for a waiter ! Well , I declare , you do deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take that other fork . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , Flora , may I ? Sits down . Amy . Amy Nelson Mr. Tyrrell , as your gallantry clearly prevents you from attending to your own wants , will you be good enough to conduct me to my aunt , in the next room ? You will then be free to take care of yourself . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Miss Nelson , that 's a pretext . You wish to leave these young people alone . However , you are right . Look at Dalton , now . That was a descriptive word coined to express the peculiar fascination to which he is a victim . Do you remember it ? Amy . Amy Nelson Smitten , was it ? Infatuated ? Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell No , smashed . He is smashed with her . Conveys the idea , does n't it ? Amy . Amy Nelson Do you think he can ever be in love again , were he to recover from the effects of this spell ? Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell You evidently have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we go along . Amy . Amy Nelson Good-bye , Flora : remember what I told you . Flora . Flora And you remember what I told you about pa : now mind . Amy . Amy Nelson Now , Mr. Tyrrell , I 'm listening . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Well , Miss Amy , thus it was : I was young and thoughtless at the time  --  Exeunt , talking . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Now , Flora , I want you to be serious , for once . Put down your plate and listen . Flora . Flora Let me have one more oyster . Oh , what a fat one , look ! There . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Haring put down her plate . Flora , I have often told you that I love you , but no words can tell how much . My heart is full to overflowing , and I can not endure this suspense . I must speak now ; forgive me if I am hasty , but I can wait no longer . Flora , they have told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your heart unstable . But acts speak louder than words : you have my portrait on your heart , while I wear your image burned into my very soul . I might have hesitated , but thus encouraged , I can hesitate no more . She takes out the portrait and kisses it . Oh , Flora , were I to misinterpret that , I should be unworthy a woman 's love . If wealth be your object , you shall have it to your heart 's content . There is no toil , no sacrifice , of which , for your sake , I am not capable . I love you , Flora : be my wife ! be my wife ! Flora . Flora Aside . Oh goody , that makes fifteen ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Answer me , dearest Flora . Flora . Flora Now do n't press my hand so  --  let go , I say  --  you take me all by surprise  --  I ca n't tell you , that is , to-night . Oh look , Frederick , there 's Jemima Bradshaw without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her some supper ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Let Jemima Bradshaw starve ! Come , Flora , do n't be offended at what I 've said . You know you told me you were not indifferent to me , and I thought  --  Flora . Flora Well , I 'm not indifferent to you . I like you very much . But , merciful sakes , I ca n't marry every one I like , can I ? Gracious goodness , that would be pretty ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Why , you do n't like any one else , do you ? Flora . Flora Do n't I ? I 'm engaged to two men , at any rate ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton You are jesting , I presume , Miss Lacy ? Flora . Flora You 'll see whether it 's a jest ! More kindly . You come in here to get me when the German begins and then I 'll tell you . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Ah , I knew you were not in earnest . Flora . Flora There , you go and attend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signal  --  Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , how I have wronged you ! Kisses both her hands . Flora . Flora There , go ; that 's a good boy . Exit Dalton . Well , I 'm glad to have had the offer , so as not to break my vow . I 'm sorry for Frederick , though : but then he 'll get over it , like all the rest . Osb . Jack Osborne Appearing at the door . Hush ! Are you ready , Flora ? Seeing her plate . Have n't you done yet ? What an ostrich ! Looking at his watch . Half-past one ! whew ! Mrs : L. Mrs. Lacy Appearing at another door . Hush ! Are you ready , Flora ? Now 's the time while everybody 's at supper . Flora . Flora Yes , ma . Are all my things in the carriage ? Osb . Jack Osborne All except the big Saratoga trunk . That 's in an express wagon .

Jack Osborne Now she 's going to suivel , I suppose ! I 'll run and get her some champagne ; that 'll set her up again . Hey , some champagne there for a lady ! Exit . Flora . Flora I do n't want to go away from home a bit : I do n't know what put it into your head , ma ? Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Why , my child , you ca n't marry Jack Osborne without . Flora . Flora Well , there are other people I like better than Jack Osborne . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy I dare say : that is n't the question . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things from Stuart 's you 'll have , my dear . You have n't ever dressed as expensively as you deserved , my love , for your father would not allow me money enough . Flora . Flora Now ma , do n't you say anything against pa ! Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy I 'm not saying anything against him , but the fact is plain that I have had to run in debt , and have raised funds to clothe you decently , my love , in some rather odd ways . But when you are once married , that will all be over , and you need never say again that you have nothing to wear . Flora . Flora Well , I think it 's an awful cold night to go away from home in . Enter a black servant . Serv . Black Servant De Grape Leaf champagne am all out , ma'am , and dose gents am obstreperiferous for more . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Well , is n't there any more ? Serv .

Flora Oh , that feels good ! Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy That 's enough , my dear . Flora . Flora Oh , now I feel jolly ! I could do anything now ! Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy That 's its mother 's own daughter !

Israel Dross Green Seal , blow me ! END OF THIRD ACT . ACT IV . Same Scene as in the First Act . Mr. Lacy , seated . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Well , proverbs are not always true . Time cures all ! Does it ? Six months have passed since my daughter left my house , since the son of my friend left my roof , broken-hearted  --  and yet , at the end of six months , my wound bleeds as freshly as ever . Humph ! when a man gets to be fifty years old , with a bad wife and a runaway daughter , with an empty home and a busy memory , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Threescore years and ten , indeed ! To think of what they 've driven me to for consolation  --  tippling on the sly  --  gambling in a garret  --  only once , though  --  pretty occupations for a gentleman of the nineteenth century ! As for that other piece of folly  --  that I 'm ashamed to think of  --  I must stop it at once . However , I could n't help it . I was introduced by accident  --  she was marriageable and wanted a home . Some one told her that I was a bachelor , and so I took to flirting with a girl of nineteen ! If Mrs. Lacy were to discover it ! The bare thought gives me a cold sweat . I 'll break off to-day . What I should have done without that charming Amy , who says that Flora told her to be my daughter in her place , I ca n't tell .

Let us talk of something else . I want to go to the theatre to-night . Lacy . Mr. Lacy I 'm in no humor for going to the theatre . Mrs. L.

Your favorite weekly , the Small Talk , is not yet out . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Reading . Wallack 's , Camille ! I thought so . French Company , La Dame aux Camelias , the Great Original of Camille ! Of course . Academy of Music , La Traviata ! Camille in Italian ! I declare it 's disgusting . Mr. Lacy , the young men of our time are going to ruin under the influence of the immoral drama . What do you suppose I heard a youth of nineteen say the other night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That he had but one other ambition in life , to be cursed by his father and have a lovely female die of consumption for him ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy Well , nineteen is a happy age ! Let ' em have a good time , I say . I wish I was nineteen ! Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy And then night before last , at the theatre  --  a play translated from the French , I presume , as the bill said it was by a gentleman of this city  --  you know you left me between the acts to go out with Bellamy Squib 's uncle  --  brandy and water , I suppose  --  Lacy . Mr. Lacy No , zwei , merely . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Well , no matter  --  I ca n't keep the run of these fancy drinks  --  my head was leaning against the partition of the box , No. 7 , when suddenly I became conscious of the presence of neighbors in No. 9 .

So can I  --  last week . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy A watch chain , perhaps , or a set of studs , or a ring . By the way , one of my rings is missing  --  Nancy and the Frenchman , of course . How glad I am that Flora is married to an American ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy Your logic is of the most potent kind , Mrs. L. To Amy , entering . Ah , Amy , my dear , good morning .

Mr. Lacy Hallo , how 's that , Miss ? Amy . Amy Nelson You know I only came to take Flora 's place , and she 's coming back . Now do n't pretend to be angry with her , for you 've forgiven her long ago , you know . I do n't know whether it has been any pleasure to you to have an adopted daughter , but it has been a great comfort to me to have an adopted father . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Any pleasure , my darling ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not do as Dalton did  --  go to the Rocky Mountains , hunt the bison , scour the prairies , and join the Seventh Regiment on returning , seeking to forget disaster in a whirl of excitement .

Amy Nelson Do n't you think , Mr. Lacy , should n't you judge  --  or rather do n't you think it reasonable to suppose  --  that  --  that  --  he 's got over it ? Lacy . Mr. Lacy Aside . Just as I thought . Aloud . Well , my dear , I am inclined to imagine  --  that is , I am induced to suppose  --  or rather , circumstances lead me to conjecture  --  that he has ! Mrs. L.

Mrs. Lacy He is said to have abandoned himself to every species of dissipation , and he declares openly that as he has been flirted with , he means to flirt with every pretty girl in town . Lacy . Mr. Lacy I do n't believe it , but even if it is true , Flora is the cause of it , is n't she ? Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Well , I declare ! Flora the cause of Dalton 's riotous courses ! Upon my word ! So that all a man has to do , now-a-days , to palliate his licentiousness , is to say he was in love and throw the blame off on the lady ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy And if a man should  --  mind , I say , should  --  take to evil ways , alleging that his wife and daughter made his home intolerable  --  the excuse would be deemed sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right !

Now stop  --  there . Mr. Lacy , you will treat Flora kindly when she comes ? Lacy . Mr. Lacy I wo n't . Amy . Amy Nelson Oh , I know you better than you do yourself . You are the kindest man in the world . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy You judge hastily , my child : wait till you have known him as long as I have . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Causticity  --  Amy .

Frederick , you do n't treat Miss Nelson politely , and I think she notices it . Why do n't you shake hands with her ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton Well , I do n't know . Really think she notices it ? I 've no objection in the world . Aside . I have n't encouraged her much lately : I 'll press her hand , to console her , poor thing . Aloud . Ladies , excuse the lukewarmness of my salutation . Mrs. Lacy , you are well , I trust . Shakes hands . Miss Nelson , the past forty-eight hours have seemed to me forty-eight ages . Shakes hands . Amy . Amy Nelson Aie ! Dalt .

Mrs. Lacy Aunt , indeed , when everybody knows he has n't got any aunt ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy Yes , my dear , I 'll talk to him . Leave us alone together . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Ohio !

Would you be good enough to lend me for an hour or two , as a pattern , merely , your ruby bracelet ? Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy I have no ruby bracelet , Mr. Dalton . Dalt . Frederick Dalton The one , I mean , that Mr. Lacy gave you last week . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Mr. Lacy has given me no jewelry for the last fifteen years , sir . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , I beg your pardon : I had an idea  --  Aside . Heavens , what a suspicion ! Aloud . Excuse me , I pray . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy You are very excusable . Aside .

Mr. Lacy I say , is she pretty ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton Who do you mean ? Lacy . Mr. Lacy Oh , I know , do n't play the innocent . Box No. 9 , ring from lady , aunt all moonshine , Catawba all stuff ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton How the deuce did you find that out ? Lacy . Mr. Lacy In box No. 7 , listened through the crack , heard the whole thing ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , that wo n't do , you know . These partitions will have to be fixed ! Well , she is quite pretty , and such a pretty name , too  --  Juliana ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy One of the numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by either party to culminate in marriage . Are you not heartily ashamed of yourself ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton Well , I like that , especially from you . Oh , Lacy ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy Aside . Mercy on me ! Can he suspect ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton Ruby bracelet ! Saw it at Tiffany 's : admired it so much that two days afterwards went back to buy it . The clerk said it had just been sold to Mr. Lacy . Now Mrs. Lacy has not received it . Query , who has ? Lacy . Mr. Lacy Dalton , I declare I was going to give it to Amy ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Well , then , let me see it , I want it for a pattern . Lacy . Mr. Lacy You see , Frederick , at this moment , I have n't got it , but  --  Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , fudge . Come , own up . Ah , it 's you that ought to be ashamed of yourself Lacy . Mr. Lacy Hush , Dalton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I swear I was only flirting . Dalt . Frederick Dalton This wo n't do , Lacy , this wo n't do . There 's every sort of excuse for me ; you know the mill I 've been through . But for you , a man with a family ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy That 's just it , Dalton , I have n't got any family . Flora has left me , and in my just resentment I have refused to see her . You 've no idea how desolate the house is , especially in the evening . As for Mrs. Lacy , the education she has given Flora and the part she played in her elopement are fruitful causes of dispute between us , and we fight like cats and dogs . So you see , Frederick  --  and then Ethelinda converses so charmingly ! And she 's so considerate , too . She only lets me go on Mondays and Thursdays , for fear it might compromise me ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Mine only lets me go on Tuesdays and Fridays , for fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Frederick , never let one word of this matter pass your lips . I 'm sick of my own folly , and I promise you I will never see her again . Squeezes Dalton 's hands . Gracious goodness , where did you get that ring ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton Why it 's the one Juliana gave me in the box ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy That 's a ring I gave Ethelinda ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton No ! Both scream with laughter . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Yes , it was before the bracelet . I thought I ought to give her a present , and being in a hurry I took it off my wife 's dressing table . Mrs. L. thinks it 's Nancy ! Ha ! ha ! Well , I 'm cured . I 'm glad it happened so ; I was innocent enough , but I felt guilty . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Aside . That 's the second time I 've been flirted with ! Aloud . You go on Mondays and Thursdays , you say ? Lacy . Mr. Lacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dalton I wonder if there 's anybody else for Wednesdays and Saturdays ! For that 's the way , it seems , that a coquette contrives to be engaged to several men at once ; she has a day for each . Lacy . Mr. Lacy To-day is Wednesday . I 'll run round and see . I may get that bracelet back . Having begun with a ring , I went on with a bracelet . Such is the progress of crime ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton By the way , I left my cane in the closet yesterday . Bring it along , will you ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy I 'll tell her she need not expect me to-morrow . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Nor me the day after . Lacy . Mr. Lacy I 'll tell her that I 'm going to Coney Island , and may push on to Constantinople ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Tell her the Seventh Regiment has been ordered to Pike 's Peak ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy I say , Dalton , I think Constantinople would suit Ethelinda to a charm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Ah , Miss Flora has more to answer for than I thought . Breaking the hearts of a score of lovers is one thing , but setting her old father gadding about the town is quite another . Reflectively . My position is a singular one . Convinced as I am that marriage with an amiable and accomplished woman is the surest road to happiness , I am totally at a loss as to the method of obtaining said accomplished woman 's consent , for Flora looked yes and meant no , and Juliana meant no , though she said yes . The argument is perfectly clear , as thus : I am in love with a woman , very well . Passion says , tell her of it ; but Prudence , in the meantime , suggests , endeavor to discover the nature of her feelings towards you , first . I do so , and Reason tells me that her feelings are in harmony with my own . Human Nature then says : Go in and win . In I go  --  and immediately afterwards , out I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cautious and not allowed yourself to be jilted by a flirt . Mortification then asks , How the devil am I to tell ? And Mortification is right . How am I to tell ? Upon my honor , I do n't know , and I think the best thing I can do is to wait for leap-year or the inversion of the sexes , and then perhaps some woman will ask me . It 's very clear I ca n't make any more proposals or I shall be called the Solicitor General . And no news of my mother 's portrait , either . I am afraid I 'm neglecting my duty in this foolish life I 'm leading . Enter Tyrrell . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Ah , good morning , Dalton . Is Lacy in ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton No , he 's gone round to see  --  he 's at the club , I believe . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell I 'll call upon him , there , then : it 's about the parade , to-morrow . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Stay a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melancholy story of your blighted love ; narrate the dismal anecdote now . I 'm just in the humor to listen to it . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell No , I 'd rather not , thank you . You see , Dalton , I 've somewhat changed my views since then . Dalt . Frederick Dalton You ? Well , if you wo n't tell the other story , tell this . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell To speak the plain truth , then , Frederick , I 'm in love , in serious earnest . Dalt . Frederick Dalton No ! And Araminta ? Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Araminta has given place to Arabella , the peerless , the sincere . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Sincere ? Pooh , how do you know she is sincere ? Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell By her manner , of course . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Just as if that were any guide . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell It is , though . I 've found out how to tell whether a woman is in earnest . Dalt . Frederick Dalton No ! You said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Well , the grand rule , reduced to its simplest proportions , is this . If a woman gives you undue , unauthorized encouragement , she is flirting with you : if she gives you no encouragement at all , or none to speak of , she 's in earnest . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Let me see . If she encourages you , she 'll say no : if she does not encourage you , she 'll say yes . Well , that is new . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Now , let us examine our two little affairs by the light of my late experience . Did Flora make the first advance , or not ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton Well , I think she did . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell And so did Araminta . Did Flora lead you on by positive , unmistakable acts of encouragement ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton I think I may safely say she did . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell And so did Araminta . In short , it was Flora who did three quarters of the courtship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my memory is not treacherous , I am of the opinion that it was . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Precisely so with Araminta . Araminta was a flirt . Dalt . Frederick Dalton And so , I think , was Flora . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Now mark the difference between Araminta and Arabella . Arabella does not seek my society , but at the same time does not avoid it : she never has told me that my company is agreeable , but her manner shows me that my presence is not unwelcome . In short , I have learned that the language of love , so far from being a printed tongue , couched in staring , conventional characters , that all the world may read , has , like the British Constitution , never been reduced to writing : it is unwritten and evanescent ; it requires the most ingenious interpretation , and every one must be his own Champollion : it demands a patient and elaborate reconciliation of apparent inconsistencies : in a word , though sure to bewilder those who give it a literal translation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spirit of free-masonry  --  Becoming befogged  --  and  --  well , in a spirit of pre-Raphaelitism , as it were  --  have I made myself perfectly clear ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton Well , no , I ca n't say that you have . However , I think I understand . But , my dear fellow , there 's nothing new in your system . That 's the way they make love in France . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Well , my dear fellow , that 's the way they make love here , if you only meet the right sort of girl . There , I ca n't stay any longer . I must see Lacy and then run to Arabella 's . Oh , Dalton , we have n't done women justice ! Good-bye . Exit . Dalt . Frederick Dalton The less she encourages you the more she loves you , he said . I 'll try the new system with Amy . By the way , Amy is a delightful girl . It 's almost time she should come down . I 'll do it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in earnest . Of course I do n't consider my engagement with Juliana as binding . Ah , here she is . Enter Amy . Amy . Amy Nelson Still here , Mr. Dalton ? Has not Flora come yet ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton You do n't mean to say that she intends to come ? Amy . Amy Nelson Yes , at the request of her father ; and she asked me to wait for her . So I 'll just take a book and read till she comes . I would not detain you from your business , you know . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Aside . That 's not encouraging , to begin with . Good . Aloud . Well , Miss Nelson , as you say Mrs. Osborne is expected , and as I have not seen her since the elopement , I think  --  if you will excuse me  --  Amy . Amy Nelson Ah , I shall think you are not yet cured , if you are unwilling to see her . You 'd much better wait and have it over . Dalt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bad . However , I 'll try my little experiment . I wonder if she 'll let me call her by her Christian name . If she does , she 's a flirt . Aloud Ahem . I have often thought , Amy , it has frequently occurred to me , Amy  --  Amy . Amy Nelson Mr. Dalton , I am not aware that I have ever authorized you to address me in this manner . Aside . Singular conduct ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Aside . She wo n't let me , oh delicious ! Aloud . It was an oversight , Miss Nelson , pray excuse me . Aside . I wonder if she 'll let me take her hand . Aloud . I was going to remark , Miss Amy , that I must have been laboring under a hallucination during the month after my arrival in this country . To think that I should have been captivated by the giddy , the fantastic Miss Lacy , while the engaging , the high-minded  --  Takes her hand : she withdraws it.  --  Aside . She wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my portrait . Aloud . Miss Nelson , I have always thought it desirable that friends , acquaintances even , without distinction of party or of sex , should possess , in the epigrammatic form of a miniature , the lineaments of those with whom they have been on terms of intimacy . May I make bold to request your acceptance  --  Amy . Amy Nelson In a tone of mild reproof . Mr. Dalton ! Aside . He is sadly changed . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Aside . She wo n't take it ! She loves me ! She loves me ! I 'll try and snatch a kiss . Aloud . Miss Nelson , what a pity that it is not always moonlight ; what a pity that the witching hour of midnight can not , by some astronomic jugglery , be prolonged through the twenty-four hours . Oh , Miss Amy , were it but midnight now , were it but moonlight  --  Oh , Amy , Amy  --  Amy . Amy Nelson Rising indignantly . Mr. Dalton , do you wish me to leave the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 's mine , she 's mine ! I 'll offer myself . Amy . Amy Nelson Mr. Dalton , excuse me , I can listen no longer . I have always regarded you as a gentleman , and as one of the few agreeable men I was in the habit of meeting . I see that I have committed an error , and will even add that I regret to have been undeceived . Suffer me to retire . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Miss Nelson , hear me . Amy . Amy Nelson Not another word , sir , farewell . Goes up . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Curse my senseless , idiotic vanity ! I 've actually made her cry . Enter Osborne and Flora , meeting Amy . Flora . Flora Why , Amy dear , what 's the matter ? Amy . Amy Nelson Nothing , Flora . Oh , I 'm so unhappy . I 'll wait for you in your mother 's room . Exit . Dalt .

Dear me , what a surprise ! With forced gaiety . How have you been this long time ? Flora . Flora I have been exceedingly well . That 's not the question . Mr. Osborne , leave the room ! Osb . Jack Osborne Oh , Flora , may n't I stay ? Flora . Flora No , I wish to have some private conversation with Frederick . Osb . Jack Osborne May n't I stay off there , out of the way ? Aside . Where I can see , if I ca n't hear . Flora . Flora Well , sit down in this chair , and mind you do n't stir . Now , Frederick , listen . They sit . Dalt .

Flora Certainly I do  --  most decidedly I do . Now , Frederick  --  Laying her hand on his arm . Osb . Jack Osborne Mrs. Osborne ! Flora . Flora Hush , Jack . Amy is my dearest friend , and I can not see her feelings trifled with . Now I simply ask you as a man , as a human being , as a Christian , do you think it right to encourage hopes , and all that sort of thing , which you do n't mean to realize . Now do you ? Dalt .

Now come , you know I 'm an old woman now , you can talk to me as you would to your grandmother . Do you love Amy ? I do so hope you do ! Say , do you ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , Flora , I can not tell you such a thing  --  you whom I have loved so distractedly ! Osb . Jack Osborne Mr. Dalton ! Flora . Flora Hush up , I say , Jack ! Oh , nonsense , you never loved me . But if you love Amy , why , I think , mind I only think , that she loves you , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I should think it must be the sweetest thing to marry a person you love ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Do n't you know it 's the sweetest thing ? Flora . Flora No , how should I ? I married Jack for money , you know . Dalt . Frederick Dalton True , true . Flora . Flora Oh , I never did love but one man . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Dear Flora ! Flora . Flora Oh , it was n't you , you conceited thing . But I never told him of it Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , you never told him of it ! Flora . Flora No , he never gave me a chance . He 's in Paris now : perhaps you 've met him . Algernon Bradshaw , Jemima 's brother . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Algernon Bradshaw , certainly , I know him intimately . Flora . Flora But now that I 'm married , of course , you know , . I 've forgotten him entirely . Still I do n't want to see him again . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take me to Paris , but I say positively I wo n't go . I want to tell , you something privately . Osb . Jack Osborne Mr. Dalton ! Mrs. Osborne ! Flora . Flora Now , Jack , will you be still ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton How you do treat the poor man ! Flora . Flora Oh , I have to , he 's so jealous . But , do you know , he 's only jealous of those who used to be attentive to me before we were married . That 's why he wants to get me out of the country ! But then I tell him what 's perfectly true , that I do n't care that for any of them , and that it 's all nonsense for him to be jealous . Why , I gave him this morning all the love letters that were ever written to me , and told him he might read them . Why need I care , it was before we were married ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton You did not give him any of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , I did n't look . I gave them all in a lump ! Dalt .

I must try to get that letter away . Flora . Flora There now , good bye . I must go up and see ma , and wait till pa comes . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Flora , tell Amy I am sorry I made her cry , will you ? Flora . Flora Yes , and if you see pa before I do , tell him I 'm awful sorry I ran away . There , Jack , you can get up now . Good bye , Frederick . Exit . Dalt . Frederick Dalton I wonder if he 's read my letter yet . Osb . Jack Osborne Coming down in great agitation , and burying his head in Dalton 's bosom . Oh , Dalton , Dalton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are choking me . Why , Osborne , why , Jack , what 's the matter ? Osb . Jack Osborne Dalton , I did n't treat you well , I know , especially in that affair of the stock , but I feel you are a man of Christian principles , and , besides , Lacy refunded the cash . Give me your sympathy , Frederick , and let me unburden my mind ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton His distress quite agonizes me ! What 's this emotion all about , Jack ? Osb . Jack Osborne It 's plain enough , I should think . Mrs. Osborne is such an incorrigible flirt ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton But you knew that before you married her . Osb . Jack Osborne But I did n't know it was to be everlastingly coming up , so that I should have no peace from morning to night , with her nineteen hundred and forty-eleven beaux , did I ? I ca n't walk without meeting ' em : I ca n't sleep without dreaming of ' em ! I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the house , and I 've given up going to church , for there 's one that sits in the pew !

Jack Osborne Thirty-eight ! And five states to hear from ! However , the thing has its conveniences . I was at Chicago last month , and happened to say how sorry I was that I had forgotten to bring my wife 's miniature , as it would have been a comfort to me while absent . What do you think ? Ned Mallory offered to lend me his ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Yes , it is convenient that 's a fact . Osb . Jack Osborne But he made me promise to return it , as it reminded him of so many happy hours ! Steep , was n't it ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton Rather precipitous , I must say . Osb . Jack Osborne But I could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we were married ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , you are too thin-skinned , Jack . Osb .

Pleasant reading for a rainy day , is n't it ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton Aside . Now if I could only manage to get mine from him . Osb . Jack Osborne What a pile of gilt-edged flummery and sweetscented balderdash ! Taking one out and smelling of it . This is from Bellamy Squib , I know by the Jenny Lind . Dalt . Frederick Dalton By George , you do n't mean to say you can tell by the smell ! Why , it 's getting to be a dangerous thing to have a favorite perfume ! Osb . Jack Osborne Try one . Take this .

Osb . Jack Osborne Yes , he 'd have thought himself a four-leaved clover , if he 'd got Flora ! This one I hardly know , it smells some like lip salve , but more like peanuts . See who the jackass is . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Why this is from you , Jack . Osb . Jack Osborne Is it ? Let me smell again . Frangipanni , as I live . Smell . There 's something to suit all tastes . Here 's one that 's strong of hartshorn ; almost takes away your breath : and one that smells of snuff . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Smelling and sneezing . Atchum ! Osb . Jack Osborne Millefleurs ! Dalton , I 'm shot if this is n't from you ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , let 's burn ' em up and get rid of ' em ! Osb . Jack Osborne No , no , not till I 've read them . I mean to enjoy a grim satisfaction in devouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of making yourself unhappy , when there 's no necessity ? Osb . Jack Osborne I wish to be unhappy : it gives me a grim pleasure , Sitting down on one side . Oh , if I could only find one written since we were married ! Dalt Frederick Dalton Aside . Well , you 'll find one , if you keep on . Aloud . Ah , here come the ladies . Enter Mrs. Lacy , Amy , and Flora . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Aside . Mr. Lacy still absent and that reprobate Dalton still here ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Miss Nelson , if Mrs. Osborne has not yet offered you my excuses , permit me to tender them in my own name . Amy . Amy Nelson She has done so , Mr. Dalton , but I am nevertheless glad to receive them from you personally . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Aside . Amiable girl ! Sits down beside her . Osb . Jack Osborne Now , if they were all as good as this one they 'd be entertaining enough . " Meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the fourth room , we shall be quite alone , as that 's where the good pictures are , and there 's no one ever there ! " Sarcastic youth ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , Miss Nelson , then I may really call you Amy ? Osb . Jack Osborne Ha ! The 27th of December , and we were married the 26th ! Oh , ecstasy ! Amy . Amy Nelson Not so fast , Mr. Dalton , I said that you might , if you would explain satisfactorily the presence of that ring which occasioned such an excitement just now . Dalt . Frederick Dalton This ring , oh , it 's a mere nothing . Aside . I wish I could get the confounded thing off ! Osb . Jack Osborne Dalton 's handwriting , and the day after the wedding ! Oh , delirium ! Amy . Amy Nelson Yes , but who gave you the ring ? And why was Mrs. Lacy so shocked ? Enter Lacy . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Dalton , come here : excuse me , Amy dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureau . Shows the bracelet . As I came out , she was locking some one up in the closet , so I could not get your cane . I fled with my booty , and made tracks for home as fast as I could . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Ah , poor Juliana ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy Ha , ha , poor Ethelinda ! Enter Tyrrell . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Mr. Dalton , how comes it that I find your cane in Arabella 's closet ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Arabella ! My cane ! I say , Lacy , Wednesdays and Saturdays ! Explosion of merriment . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell This merriment is ill-timed , gentlemen . Mr. Lacy , Arabella 's bracelet on your wrist , sir ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy Mercy on me , what shall I do ? Here , Dalton , take it . Wo n't anybody have it ! Aside . I 'll give it to Mrs. L. Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Mr. Lacy , it 's my opinion you are no better than you should be ! Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring . Horrors , it is ! Help , air , water ! Faints ; the ladies surround her . Osb . Jack Osborne Mr. Dalton , did you write this letter ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton I did . Osb . Jack Osborne That 's all . You may hear from me , shortly . Amy . Amy Nelson Mr. Osborne , run for some hartshorn , quick . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Miss Nelson , can I be of any service ? Amy . Amy Nelson Never speak to me again , Mr. Dalton . Osb . Jack Osborne There 's no hartshorn : here 's something will do as well . Gives the letter that smells of it . It is applied to Mrs. Lacy 's nose : she sneezes . I must have given her the wrong one . Smells it . Atchum ! Flora throws herself into her father 's arms . END OF FOURTH ACT . ACT V. A Breakfast Room in Lacy 's House . 8 a. m . Flora and Amy . Flora . Flora Now , Amy dear , it 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frederick to-day . Pa 's satisfied ma that it was all a mistake , and besides young men will be young men , you know : they must sow their wild oats , as people say . Amy . Amy Nelson Yes , and often the wild oats that young men sow , their wives have to gather . Flora . Flora Now , hush , dear , and let us consider a moment . Frederick is capable of love , you must allow ; look how dreadfully he was in love with me ! Then you know he 's pretty well off , and he 's in a good business , and you must acknowledge he 's a handsome man . And he 's so popular , too . Why , he has only been in the regiment six months and has just been elected corporal , while Jack has served five years and ca n't get a blessed vote . And besides , Amy , Jack is jealous of Frederick , and I know I sha n't have any peace till he 's married . Amy . Amy Nelson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me marry a man because he 's rich , or handsome , or popular , or to quiet your husband 's ridiculous fears , would you ? Flora . Flora No , marry him because you love him and he loves you ! I guess that 's a reason . Oh , I may be foolish , but I always go in for human nature ! Amy . Amy Nelson He is not coming this morning , is he ? Flora . Flora Of course he is : that 's why I want you to make up your mind . Pa invited him to breakfast , on purpose , too You know the regimental line , as they call it , is formed on Fourteenth St. ; and Mr. Tyrrell told me that the right would rest on our house . Of course I do n't know what he meant . Amy . Amy Nelson I am sorry he is coming  --  I think I 'd better go  --  I should n't like to meet him to-day . Flora . Flora You ca n't go now  --  I hear him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiery , you know . Present arms to the National Guard ! Enter Dalton , in uniform of the Seventh Regiment . Flora presents arms with the poker . Flora . Flora Amy , Amy , does n't he look sweet in his uniform ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Good morning , Flora : good morning , Miss Nelson . Flora . Flora Frederick , I want to tell you something . Make it up with Amy to-day , wo n't you , there 's a good fellow . In the first place , you 'll be perfectly happy , and in the second , you 'll relieve my unfortunate Jack . He is terribly jealous of you ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , he is , is he ? Flora . Flora Not of anything he sees or hears now , but of your being in love with me before I was married . He keeps muttering about the 27th of December , and says that human gore must flow . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , he means at the sham fight . Flora . Flora Gore flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess gore wo n't ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Claret is sometimes used figuratively for gore , Flora . But be that as it may , Jack and I will have no trouble . We are under arms to-day , and he will not challenge me , I am sure ; and if he does , I shall not listen to him . Before night I hope to have matters arranged amicably and satisfactorily . I mean , too , to speak seriously and earnestly to your friend Miss Nelson . Flora . Flora Oh , I 'm so glad ! Ah , here comes Jack ! Enter Osborne , in uniform of the Seventh Regiment . Osb . Jack Osborne Ladies , the United States army salutes you . Flora , where 's the Brigadier ? Flora . Flora The who ? Osb . Jack Osborne The Brigadier . Your governor , of course . Flora . Flora Oh , pa ? He 's dressing . He was sharpening his sword just now . Osb . Jack Osborne Good morning , corporal . If I salute you , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because any social good-will prompts it . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Dear me , Jack , what 's the matter ? Osb . Jack Osborne Mr. Dalton , after a night 's reflection , I have decided that your conduct deserves reprobation , and that your person needs chastisement . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Loftily . Private Osborne , I can not listen to language of this nature , while we are under orders , and as your superior officer , I command you to  --  shut up . Osb . Jack Osborne You are doing the corporal rather extensively , ai n't you ? You wrote a love-letter to my wife , and I want satisfaction ; and I am going to send two friends from Company E , to demand it Dalt . Frederick Dalton Private Osborne , this conduct is mutinous . If you should send the gentlemen from Company E , I will have you and them court-martialed . Osb . Jack Osborne Oh , my eye ! You do n't mean to say you are a coward , do you ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now do n't be hasty , Dalton . I did n't say you were a coward , I only asked you if you were one . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Aside . Pshaw , I am a fool to let him move me . Aloud . Jack , I wrote that letter when I hardly knew what I did , and when I certainly had no evidence , beyond report , that Flora was married at all . I have regretted it more than I can tell , and I ask your pardon . Osb . Jack Osborne Do you , though ? By George , you shall have it . You are a fine fellow , Frederick , and I like you ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Jack , one word about this matter of duels . A soldier , whether in the federal army or the state troops , should be the last man in the world to send , convey , or accept a challenge . His blood belongs to his country , and as he has devoted it to a sacred cause he has no right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duels to the civilians : and if forthy senators , bombastic editors , and aspiring youths must fight , let them be alone to enjoy the reflection that the country looks with derision on their valor , and with contempt on their scars . Osb . Jack Osborne By George , that 's true . I can see myself that if I were to notice a fine military man , with a wound on his brow , and I should say to him , " Sir , you got that at Lundy 's Lane , I presume , " and he should reply , " No , I got it at Hoboken , " I should feel exceedingly cheap ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton And he would feel cheaper than you . Now give me back the letter which has made all the trouble , and I 'll refund you more than its value . Osb . Jack Osborne Drawing out letter . Here it is . " Beloved , darling Flora : " signed , " Your delirious , heart-broken Frederick . " Dalt . Frederick Dalton Yes , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , observe . Reminiscences of youth . A left hand-glove . Osb . Jack Osborne One of twelve dozen that I smuggled in through a friend . Dalt . Frederick Dalton A dismantled fan . Osb . Jack Osborne I paid the bill for it only yesterday . Dalt . Frederick Dalton A bunch of faded flowers . Osb . Jack Osborne I remember sending it by that tall bouquet man ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton A lock of hair . Osb . Jack Osborne That she seems to have furnished herself . Dalt . Frederick Dalton And last though not least , Miss Flora 's portrait . Osb . Jack Osborne Thirty-nine , as I 'm a sinner ! Flora , come here , my dear . Aru't you ashamed of yourself ? Flora . Flora What for ? Osb . Jack Osborne Do you see all this trash ? Flora . Flora Yes , some old things I gave Frederick . Osb . Jack Osborne I think I gave them to you before you gave them to him . Flora . Flora Yes , the fan and the flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osb . Jack Osborne Distractedly . Flora , you never loved me ! Flora . Flora I never said I did ! Osb . Jack Osborne Oh , you arrant flirt ! Flora . Flora You knew I was a flirt when you married me ! Osb . Jack Osborne Flirt ! Conquette ! Jilt ! Flora . Flora I did n't jilt you , did I ? Osb . Jack Osborne No , I wish to gracious you had ! Flora . Flora Now , Jack , what 's the use of making such a fuss ? I never loved Frederick . I 've told you so a hundred times . I never loved any one but Algernon Bradshaw , and he 's in Paris . Osb . Jack Osborne It 's devilish lucky for me he is , I expect . Flora . Flora Oh , do stop . Look at Frederick and Amy . They seem to be having a delightful time , do n't they ? They are apart and silent . That 's the way people look when they are in love Come to breakfast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osborne My appetite 's all gone . Flora . Flora Pretend you are famished . Mr. Dalton , you must excuse us as Jack is very hungry and is dying for his breakfast . Osb . Jack Osborne I ca n't eat a thing . Flora . Flora Amy , my dear , we leave you with Frederick , as Jack is going to fortify himself against the fatigues of the day . Come , Jack , a porter-house steak , a lamb chop , a few sausages , three or four eggs , five or six rolls , with a fish ball or two , will quite set you up . Osb . Jack Osborne That 's right , Flora . Starve a man 's heart and stuff his gizzard ! Frederick , do n't marry a flirt ! Exit . Flora . Flora Aside to Dalton . Now 's your time ! Steboy ! Exit . Dalt . Frederick Dalton After a pause . Charming weather for the parade . Amy . Amy Nelson Yes , if it does not rain . Dalt . Frederick Dalton After another pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Amy . Amy Nelson I have not observed it . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Congress is going to meet soon . Amy . Amy Nelson I dare say . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , this will never do . Miss Nelson , will you allow me to speak a few words to you , with all the respect I owe you , but at the same time with all the earuestness my feelings prompt ? Amy . Amy Nelson After what has occured , Mr. Dalton  --  Dalt . Frederick Dalton I beg you to listen , Miss Nelson . When I first came to this country  --  Amy . Amy Nelson I have no claim on your confidence , sir . Dalt . Frederick Dalton If you will but give me leave , I will tell you how much I have always  --  esteemed you , and how  --  I have gradually learned  --  to love you . Oh , I honestly and truly believe , that in spite of all I have done and suffered , or have thought I suffered , since my arrival in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart yet unbestowed , the promise of a first and only love  --  Amy . Amy Nelson Aside . My heart assents , my reason bids me doubt . Dalt . Frederick Dalton In falling a victim to the wiles of Flora and the treachery of Juliana  --  Amy . Amy Nelson Oh , Mr. Dalton , I can not listen to this . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Nay , hear me , Amy  --  I but paid my tribute to what seems to be a national endemic  --  one which , if you will permit me to characterize it , strikes me as a crying social sin  --  Amy . Amy Nelson Oh , if you thus depreciate the country and denounce its customs , I shall think that your foreign birth has after all given a bias to your opinions . Dalt . Frederick Dalton What , can I not be a good American and yet denounce an American practice ? Because I am an American , must I , for that reason alone , approve and defend that purely American invention of experimental courtship , that abuse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And permit me to add that the moment is at least ill chosen to reproach a man with being an alien and a bad citizen , when he has the state 's uniform on his back , and never a cent of the state 's pay in his pocket . Amy . Amy Nelson Oh , Mr. Dalton , I did not mean to offend you  --  Dalt . Frederick Dalton Let us change the subject again . We can revert to the weather and the bell-pull . Aside . After all , perhaps she has been in love , though I have not . That 's a suspicious looking locket about her neck . Taking Amy 's chatelaine . You are quite nautical in your tastes , Miss Nelson . Amy . Amy Nelson Yes , my father was an officer in the navy , you know . Dalt . Frederick Dalton I remember . A fragment of the cable mounted as a watch-key  --  a jewelled anchor  --  Lacy . Mr. Lacy The emblem of Hope . Dalt . Frederick Dalton For me or the cable ? Amy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah . A tiny gold model of a man-of-war . Amy . Amy Nelson The frigate Constitution . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Is it possible ? Amy . Amy Nelson My father 's ship . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Your father was commander of the Constitution ? Amy . Amy Nelson Yes , for many years . Dalt . Frederick Dalton When , in heaven 's name , Miss Nelson ? Amy . Amy Nelson From twenty to thirty years ago . You seem agitated , Mr. Dalton . Dalt . Frederick Dalton And well I may . Aside . If it should be her father that  --  Aloud . Miss Amy , forgive my curiosity , it is not an idle one . Do you happen to know whether , some twenty-nine years ago , your father was in European waters , and whether he had occassion to cast anchor in the port of Brest , in France ? Amy . Amy Nelson I have the best reason for knowing that he did cast anchor in that port . Dalt . Frederick Dalton What reason ? Oh , speak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it was told me , was this . It seems that an American lady was taken sick at Brest , and being about to die , was conveyed , at her own desire , on board the frigate , that she might not die in a foreign land . My father , of course , was as kind to her as a sailor knew how to be , and he smoothed the hard journey to the dying woman as best he could . To requite his services and to prove the esteem in which she held him , she gave him , with the consent of her husband , her portrait , saying , " If my son lives , give it to him ! " Dalt . Frederick Dalton Where is that portrait , Miss Nelson ? Amy . Amy Nelson Here , in this locket . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Give it to me ! Amy . Amy Nelson To you , Mr. Dalton ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton I was born on board the Constitution , and there my mother died . Amy , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Amy Nelson Oh , Mr. Dalton , had I known  --  Takes it off . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , mother , mother ! Amy . Amy Nelson Keep it , Mr. Dalton , it is yours ! How happy I am to have been the means of restoring it ! Dalt . Frederick Dalton Keep it ? Indeed I will . Never more will I part with my long lost treasure . Offering to put it round Amy 's neck again . Will you keep it for me ? Amy . Amy Nelson I , Mr. Dalton ? Dalt . Frederick Dalton Amy , there 's not one jot of superstition in my creed , but I will not believe you can have worn my mother 's picture for twenty years upon your heart , and not feel some little kindness for her son . Puts it round her neck . Oh , Amy , say that little word ! Amy . Amy Nelson That little word ? No , then . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Flirted with again , by heaven ! Amy . Amy Nelson Archiy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frederick Dalton Rapturously . Oh ! Amy ! The long one then On his knees . That monstrous monosyliable , so big with fate ! Enter Flora . Flora . Flora Do n't mind me . Turns her back . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Come , dearest Amy ! Amy . Amy Nelson I will keep the picture . Dalt . Frederick Dalton Oh , Amy ! Now I am happy ! Flora , look round . Flora . Flora Oh , I 'm so glad ! Kisses Amy . Frederick , she 'll make you a great deal better wife than I should have done . Dalt . Frederick Dalton I honestly believe you . Aside . Stop a moment . When I asked her to say yes , she dodged and said something else . Can that be another phase of flirtation ? Hum Amy , come here , dear . Say yes . Amy . Amy Nelson Yes . Dalt . Frederick Dalton That 's all . It 's always best to be sure . Enter Tyrrell , in uniform of the Seventy-first Regiment . Behind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gentlemen , good morning ! Flora . Flora Jack , Mr. Tyrrell , present arms to Mr. and Mrs. Dalton . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Is it possible ? Fredrick , Miss Nelson , I heartily congratulate you both . Osb . Jack Osborne Thank you , Frederick . Miss Nelson , command me always . Aside . Now my mind 's at ease for ever . Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell By the way , Jack , I 've pleasant news for you . Algernon Bradshaw 's arrived ! Osb . Jack Osborne Oh , Lord ! Sinks into a chair . Flora . Flora Oh , goody ! I 'll invite Jemima to dinner ! Tyr . Godfrey Tyrrell Gentlemen , the Brigadier ! Enter Lacy , in uniform of a General of Brigade , and Mrs. Lacy . Military Salute . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Good morning , my boys ; we turn out strong , I hope . Fine weather and clean streets . Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy You in this uniform , Mr. Dalton ! You might have been more patriotic , and joined your countrymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lacy , I 'm ashamed of you ! Amy , my love , kiss me . Amy . Amy Nelson Shall I , Frederick ? Lacy . Mr. Lacy How do you mean , " Shall I , Frederick ? " Dalt . Frederick Dalton No , dear , I 'd rather you would n't to-day . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Ha ! ha ! ha ! Bravo , Frederick ! Shakes hands vehemently ; then rushes to Amy and kisses her forehead vigorously . They 'll make a splendid couple . I say , boys , three cheers for the army and navy ! They give them . Flora . Flora Tiger ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy To Amy . A sailor 's daughter and a soldier 's wife ! Kiss me again ! Mrs. L. Mrs. Lacy Erastus ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy Geraldine ! And now Amy , and now Flora , as wo have five minutes before the drum beats , let me give you a few words of heartfelt and affectionate counsel . Mrs. Lacy , you need not listen , as I am speaking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very well , I 'll read the morning paper . Sits and reads . Lacy . Mr. Lacy Taking Flora and Amy under each arm . There was once a republic , my daughters , whose fathers built its base upon foundations they hoped would be eternal  --  the virtue , probity , and intelligence of its citizens . No king , no throne , no peer , no subject  --  naught save the people and the commonwealth . And how they felt their duties and responsibilities , in those days of trial ! The women were strong and the men heroic : the mothers were Cornelias that the sons might be Gracchi . Time passed and the women grew weak : and then the men became corrupt . The virtue of the people waned . Now , in all times and in all lands , my children , the women are the measure and the standard of a nation 's worth . The men have often fallen below them , never risen above them . Well , Flora , as our generation gives way to yours , so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. Mrs. Lacy Mr. Lacy , I see they are making preparations to take the next census ! Lacy . Mr. Lacy Ay , the census ! Let it be a rousing volume , bursting with boys and girls ! In 1886 , those boys in their turn will be voters and those girls mothers : it depends on you , my daughters , that they give a good account of their inheritance on our first centennial . Heaven bless you both ! The drum rolls without . Military salute by the characters . Tyrrell . Mrs. Lacy . Osborne . Dalton . Flora . Amy . Lacy . The End .
