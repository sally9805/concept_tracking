txt ART . VIII . - The Life of John Collins Warren , 111 . D. Compiled chiefly from his Autobiography and Journals . By EDWARD WARREN , M. D. Boston : Ticknor and Fields . 1860. 2 vols. 8vo. pp. 420 , 382 . As we have been recently reminded by Dr. Warren 's successor , " the Professor at the Breakfast-Table , " Who can write about both as an expert , talent is of immeasurably higher value and larger availableness than genius . Pegasus , prancing in mid-air , is a spectacle to be gazed at and admired ; but for the actual uses of this earthly life feet are worth more than wings , and the power of apprehending the things that are gives a working position and force , which may be supplemented , but can not be compensated for , by the richest endowments of a creative fancy or a discursive imagination . In the subject of the memoir before us we discern talent of a rare and high order , without genius , or the show or pretence of it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficiencies contributed equally with his eminent gifts to constitute his merit and his fame . Among his many titles to reputation we suppose the foremost to have been that of a pre-eminently skilful and successful surgeon . The foundation for this transcending ability was , of course , the most thorough and accurate scientific knowledge of the anatomy of the human frame , not in theory alone , but in all the details of normal , abnormal , and morbid fact . In this department of knowledge there was equal need of the power of close inductive reasoning and of an inaptitude for rapid and hypothetical generalization . It was essential that theory should never exceed the // contents of observed facts , and that every inference should be the legitimate consequence of well-established premises . There was need , too , of the commensurate and equal development of the physical and physico-intellectual powers with those of pure intellect , - of the keen eye , the discrimInating ear , the discerning touch , the steady hand , with judgment , invention , and prescience . All these requisites were combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-restraint , and industry through the entire life of the distinguished man , whose fragmentary records of his own experience are brought into unity in the volumes before us by the careful editorship and the graceful , impartial , and appreciating narrative of his brother . John Collins Warren was the nephew of General Joseph Warren , the patriot physician , and the son of Dr. John Warren , who is believed to have had but one equal , and no superior , among the American surgeons of his day . He received the rudiments of his classical education at the Boston Latin School , in which for seven years he was , except for a very short interval , at the head of his class . In college he maintained a high character for scholarship and for moral excellence , and was graduated in 1797 , with the Latin Valedictory , - a post of honor then assigned by vote of the class , but none the less an index of proficiency in classical learning . His father , unwilling to expose him to the cares , anxieties , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ; but it was hardly possible that the son should not have had his ambition kindled by the father 's fame . Nor ought we to omit here , though it is left in modest silence in the memoir , the eloquence and enthusiasm of the elder Warren as a Lecturer in the University . We heard in our youth , from old men who had listened to him in college , of the wonderful fascination which he imparted to themes not in themselves attractive , and especially of the thrilling tones , and often tear-choked utterance , in which he loved to exhibit the miracles of the Divine handwork in the human frame . It is not , therefore , a matter for surprise , that the younger Warren , after a year devoted to the French language under the tuition of the late Mr. Sales , embraced the medical profession , and commenced its study as his father 's pupil . // The opportunities for medical study in Boston were at that time restricted . The town was healthy , the population comparatively small , and the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was neither public hospital nor medical school . It was therefore determined that young Warren , after the first year , should prosecute his studies in Europe . Accordingly , in the summer of 1799 , he embarked for London , where he entered at Guy 's Hospital , as a " dresser " under William Cooper , the surgeon , who was shortly afterward succeeded by his nephew , the eminent Sir Astley Cooper . Here he was " immediately put in charge of about forty patients , comprising as interesting a collection of surgical accidents and diseases as could be desired . " We can not refrain from quoting his announcement , in a letter , of his introduction to active professional duty ; for it indicates the strong development of the ruling passion of his life , and at the same time is the only instance in these volumes in which his language departs from the calm and even flow of a mind not easily elated or thrown from its perfect poise . " I am the luckiest dog in life ! I was called away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while visiting Netley Abbey with some ladies , and preparing to explore a subterranean passage ) to a dislocated shoulder , which I have reduced in very handsome style . Within the three first days of my week I have had one fracture , and one injury of the cranium ; one fractured leg , and another that we thought was fractured at first ; one fracture of the ribs , and this dislocation ; besides two or three trifling accidents . I have been exceedingly fortunate every way ; and I verily begin to think I shall be famous . " - Vol . I. p. 35 . After a year in London , diligently spent in hospital service and attendance on lectures , our student went to Edinburgh , where he lived in the most retired and frugal style , and passed the morning in hearing lectures , the afternoon and evening in writing out his notes and remembrances of them . In the summer of 1801 he left Edinburgh for Paris , where he became domesticated with Dubois , then sole surgeon of the Hospice *de l'Ecole de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lectures of Cuvier on comparative anatomy and paleontology , while he devoted his chief attention to chemistry and to the anatomy of the human // 463 body . He thus in the space of nearly three years and a half availed himself of the highest privileges and the best opportunities of the three great centres of professional science and skill , and he seems to have resorted to each of the three with a distinct conception of the part of a thorough education which it was adapted to furnish , and with a prearranged plan of life closely consonant with his purposes . No American physician had then enjoyed such ample means of professional culture ; and none can ever have been more faithful or judicious in their use . At the same time , if his character was ever immature , - which there is some reason to doubt , - it became thoroughly matured by these years of self-reliance and incessant labor , and he returned to his native town prepared to receive and merit public confidence in his professional ability and discretion , to a degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time the elder Dr. Warren had sustained an attack of paralysis , from which he never entirely recovered ; and the son s first care was to afford his father all the aid and relief possible in his very extended practice . As soon as was consistent with his filial duty , he commenced practice on his own account , and in 1806 , in addition to the care of a large and increasing list of patients , he assumed the office of Adjunct Professor of Anatomy and Surgery in the University , and continued to share the labors of that chair till he succeeded his father in it in 1815 . Thenceforward it is difficult to write a consecutive story of his life ; for it had few outward vicissitudes , and may best be described , not as a routine-life , but as regular and measured movement in an orbit which grew wider with every year , and on which he became ever a more conspicuous object of regard , trust , and reverence . We , therefore , in what remains of our sketch , shall follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public and his claims upon their gratitude rather than the succession of events and incidents . The period of his establishment in Boston was a time of previously unprecedented intellectual activity . A private society had recently been formed for the study of natural philosophy , and of this he early became an active member and lecturer . Here he was associated with Drs . Jackson and Howard of his // own profession , with Messrs . Kirkland , Popkin , and Channing among the clergy , and John ( afterward Judge ) Davis , Josiah Q uincy , and John Lowell among the members of the bar . Before this society Dr. Warren took for one of his subjects the analysis of the well-water of Boston , and was instrumental in first drawing the attention of intelligent men to its impurities , and to the need of introducing a competent and healthful supply of water from some adequate source . This great public interest he kept constantly in view ; wrote often on the subject ; appeared before a committee of the Legislature ; and had the satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of witnessing the consummation of his plans and hopes in the completion of the Cochituate aqueduct . In 1803 , he became a member of the Anthology Club , under whose auspices was issued the first literary periodical of high merit and commanding reputation which appeared north of Philadelphia . The Monthly Anthology was conducted with marked ability for six years , and the literary activity which it embodied and aroused led , shortly after its suspension , to the establishment of our own journal , with very much the same circle of contributors , with kindred aims , and , we trust , with similar benefit to the awakened intellect of New England . The reading-room and library of this club grew by slow stages into the Boston Athena*um , which in process of time absorbed also the Boston Medical Library , founded mainly by the exertions of Drs . Warren and Jackson . In 1803 , Dr. Warren also became a member of the Massachusetts Medical Society , and , in connection with Dr. Jackson , he succeeded in infusing a new life into its organization , " stimulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication . " In 1805 , these gentlemen were appointed a committee to prepare a pharmacopoAa for the use of the Society . The result of their labors was the introduction of a systematic nomenclature , the simplifying of medical prescriptions , and the diffusion of knowledge as to various remedies which had been restricted to individual practitioners or localities . We again find these same gentlemen on a committee of the Society to inquire into the effibacy of the // then recent practice of vaccination , and to report measures " for establishing the practice on a safe foundation . " The report contains " all that is HOW known on the subject , and the proper rules of action , from which subsequent experience has shown no reason to deviate . " Prior to 1810 , the Cambridge Medical School had hardly an existence as a distinct department of the University . The lectures were delivered at Cambridge , and were open to the undergraduates . After the removal of the School to Boston , it was obliged for several years to submit to straitened accommodations , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jackson that a substantial building was erected and opened for its use in 1815 . Dr. Warren , senior , who had also exerted himself largely for the same end , died on the eve of its accomplishment . Another object which engaged the attention and enlisted the earnest efforts of the inseparable associates and friends we have so often named , was the establishment of a public hospital . An appeal to a few of the liberal citizens of Boston procured a subscription of a hundred thousand dollars , to which a grant of the State added fifty thousand . During the lapse of a few years this endowment was largely increased by legacies , several of which were obtained through tile personal influence of Dr. Warren . lie induced Mr. Abraham Truro , a Jewish gentleman of wealth and generosity , to bequeath ten thousand dollars for this use . He was also instrumental in procuring the legacy of one hundred and twenty thousand dollars by Mr. John McLean , whose name is perpetuated in the Asylum for the Insane at Somerville , - an institution which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Hospital . lie himself subscribed liberally toward the general fund of the hospital , and at a subsequent period gave a thousand dollars , the interest of which was to be appropriated for the purchase of moral and religious tracts for tile use of the patients . Dr. Warren first proposed tile issue of a periodical for tile advancement of medical science . Tile result was tile establishment of the New England Medical Journal . This was commenced in 1812 , and was continued till 1828 , when it // was merged in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal . The editoui*hip was in other hands , but the successive volumes contained frequent and valuable contributions from Dr. Warren . Among the great social interests to which Dr. Warren devoted much of his energy was the cause of Temperance . He joined the Massachusetts Temperance Society in 1827 , and from that period his efforts in this behalf were unintermitted , and were not confined even to his own country . In 1837 , he acted as chairman of a temperance meeting in London , and in the same year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temperance reform with several members of the administration of Louis Philippe . He at-. tempted to supersede the use of alcohol in many medicinal preparations , successfully substituting for it " a wine produced by the fermentation of a vegetable infusion with sugar . " He published an article in which he earnestly recommended this change of practice to his brother physicians ; but the conservatism of the profession was too strong to admit so radical an innovation . One of his latest labors was the preparation of an historical sketch of the temperance movements for the last half-century , and in a legacy of two thousand dollars , the income of which was to be devoted to the distribution of temperance publications , he left a valuable and enduring memorial of his zeal in the cause . It is impossible to over-estimate the influence of such a man in this department of effort . Social reforms , in order to be thorough and permanent , must have the sanction and co-operation of those who hold a confessedly high place in society . The paucity of such names among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . The reason why so many men of high principle and undoubted philanthropy withhold the full force of their example and influence from this cause is perfectly obvious . They themselves and their associates are in comparatively little danger from the use of pure and costly wines as but one among the many luxuries at their command , and with them wine-drinking is often little more than a conventional formalism associated from time immemorial with the rites of hospitality . They are seldom brought // into conversance with the coarser forms of convivial entertainment , and are hardly aware of the intense peril resulting from the use of fiery manufactured wines , and maddening alcoholic liquors , where they are the only quasi luxury within the means of the entertainer . But so long as the more innocuous and expensive beverage is indispensable to the tables of the rich , the tyranny of fashion will enforce the use of corresponding beverages in every degree of cheapness and vileness through the entire social scale , - a scale down which reforms will run , while they can not even creep up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church in Brattle Square . The son , on his return from Europe , attended the First Church , of which 11ev . William Emerson was pastor , and afterward the Brattle Square Church , under the ministries of Messrs . Buckminster and Everett . In 1820 he connected himself with St. Paul 's Church , at which he was a constant worshipper and communicant for the residue of his life . His religious convictions were the result of prolonged study and deliberate reflection , and , from the time that they became clear and strong , exerted their vivifying influence over his whole life and character . His biographer has preserved much of his religious correspondence , which exhibits profound humility , tender conscientiousness , undoubting faith in the fundamental doctrines of the Gospel , and a hope of immortality which grew constantly brighter and happier as with the lapse of years it approached its consummation . We quote the following paragraph from one of his letters , as conveying in brief what a lengthened homily might fail to say as well , on faith . " You ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by faith . how can I answer this question to a mind more acute and better instructed on this subject than my own ? I have no doubt you comprehend the object he had in view better than myself ; but perhaps we may view his opinions in a different light . Like all who have dwelt much on one subject , he sees it in many relations which would not present themselves to others ; and it is by the attempt to convey all their relations we are confused , and get no impression from that which is principal and preeminent . What does he wish us to believe but this , - that faith is not a new nor an abstract principle ; that , of itself it is nothing but a // barren speculation ; that , to make it fruitful , we must cultivate , not only the understanding , but the heart , and bring into its service , not the reasoning power alone , but the affections ? We must feel as well as believe . We must feel the mighty power and goodness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us miserable beings in sending us a revelation of his character and his will by his blessed Son , and his accepting that Son as an offering for our frailties and transgressions , and listening to him as a Mediator for our prostrated and penitent souls . When the love of our infinitely beneficent Parent is brought into our view , we are not to satisfy our consciences with bowing our heads in respect and adoration , but we must bring our whole souls to realize his transcendent benevolence . With such a temper of mind cultivated into a permanent habit , all our thoughts would partake of love for that Creator who has done so much for us ; and this love would banish all meaner thoughts , all the trifles of time and space , to their proper region . This blessed spirit of love would influence all our social actions , and , beginning in the narrow sphere which encircles ourselves , would extend to all men , and all the animated works of our common Father , and at length return and rise again to Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vol . I. pp. 177 , 178 . Dr. Warren adds his emphatic testimony to that of very many of the busiest and wisest men , as regards the utility of the weekly Sabbath in preserving the powers of mind and the capacity of labor , - a ground on which the law of the Sabbath appears a law of nature no less than of revelation , inscribed on the human constitution no less than on the stone tablets of Mount Sinai . He writes - " So far as my observation has extended , those persons who are in the habit of avoiding worldly cares upon the Sabbath are those most remarkable for the perfect performance of their duties during the week . The influence of a change of thought on the Sabbath , upon the minds of such persons , resembles that of a change of food upon the body . It seems to give a fresh spring to the mental operations , as the latter does to the physical . I have a firm belief , that such persons are able to do more work , and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked the whole seven . " The breathing the pure and sublime atmosphere of a religious Sabbath refreshes and invigorates the mind , and forms the best preparation for the labors of the following week . " - Vol . I. pp. 204 , 205. // 469 sional duty almost without intermission . The first period of relaxation he allowed himself was iu 1837 , when he revisited England , and travelled very extensively on the continent of Europe . Even this seems to have been hardly a vacation ; for his diary is full of medical and surgical notes . Interesting cases of fracture , tumor , or epilepsy , the methods of distinguished surgeons , and the arrangements of hospitals , were the chief objects of his regard , to which scenery and art are secondary and incidental . By this we would by no means convey the idea that he was inaccessible to the attractions presented by nature and by human genius . Some of his letters display an intense susceptibility to the influence of the outward universe , and he had almost a poet 's tenderness for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Wachusett and its surroundings . At the same time , he was a lover and a liberal patron of the imitative arts , and manifested an eminently pure and refined taste in all that related to domestic architecture and horticulture . But this European tour , made in the midst of an arduous and successful practice , and fraught with opportunities for observation such as his wellearned celebrity alone could have procured for him , seemed like a special mission for professional purposes , and it is no wonder that his sympathies as a surgeon gave the chief direction to his curiosity , and held the foremost place in his record of travel . When in 1851 , at a period of less engrossment in the great pursuit of his life , he again visited Europe , we find traces of a less exclusive devotion to his favorite science , and more extended comments on the objects that usually attract the attention of tourists . As years advanced , and with them , with more than even pace , the infirmities of old age , he resigned one by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within eight days of his death , he continued to visit his patients as often as his declining health permitted . His fatal illness was brief ; he contended almost to the closing hour with disease and debility , manifesting , while resigned to die , a strong hold on life ; insisted on the last day on being placed upon his feet ; and met the final change in a sitting posture . His decease was on the 4th of May , 1856. 40 * // Dr. Warren 's self-consecration to science was displayed in no way more emphatically than in the directions left by him iji writing for the disposal of his own body after death . The following is an extract from a letter of instructions to his son - " To be opened after my Death , and before the Funeral . " The final and principal object of writing this letter is this , which regards the disposition of my mortal remains after the spirit has quitted them . The arrangement I wish is the following , suhject to any peculiar circumstances of season , &amp;c. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with arsenic after death , soon . " 2 . The funeral solemnities to take place in St. PauPs Church , in the full and proper form of the church service . " 3 .

Any morbid parts to be carefully preserved ; and particular attention is to be paid to the heart , spleen , and prostate gland . " 4 . The hones to be carefully preserved , whitened , articulated , and placed in the lecture-room of the Medical College , near my bust ; affording , as I hope , a lesson useful , at the same time , to morality and science . " I earnestly request that you and my family will lay aside any natural feeling of opposition to this my last request , considering that it is for the interest of humanity , and for mine and their honor . " Finally , I take leave of you in the hope of our meeting again , and enjoying the society of our blessed friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. WARREN . " Boston , July 14 , 1842. " - Vol . II . p. 359 . There is absolute heroism in these directions , when viewed in connection , on the one hand , with Dr. Warren 's well-known character , and on the other , with his professional experience . When a cold-blooded sceptic , whose heart has never thrilled with a tender sentiment , and who has looked upon himself as a mere earth-clod stimulated into brief activity and to be resolved into thin air and lifeless dust , leaves orders to cheat the grave of its due , we feel disgust , yet no surprise . But Christian faith and the undying hope to which it gives birth attach a sacredness to the body which has been the tenement of an immortal soul , and none are so heedful of the rites of sepul // 471 ture and the invi6lableness of the tomb , as those whose belief in Christian verities is the most intimate and vital . This feeling is enhanced by the doctrine of the resurrection of the body , which , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article of the creed of the Church to which IDr . Warren gave his allegiance . It can have been only by stern selfconflict , and under an imperative conviction of duty , that he was brought to provide a cenotaph for his memorial in the cemetery . But he had been made painfully aware of the need , for the benefit of the living , of a surgeon 's unrestricted access to the members and the healthy and morbid organism of the human frame . He had been foremost among his brethren in efforts for overcoming the popular scruples to the dissecting-room , and procuring through legal methods a supply of subjects for the knife . He had claimed for science the bodies of the friendless , who died in public institutions , as well as of those who met their fate under sentence of the law . The question with him was one of sincerity and self-consistency . Should he , who had demanded that the natural sentiment for the dead should yield to the still more cogent exigencies of the suffering and imperilled , succumb to the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not but regard this bequest to his favorite science as a noble act of self-sacrifice ; and while our intuitive sympathies are all arrayed on the other side , we feel constrained , by their instinctive recoil and shudder , to hold his memory only in the profounder respect and honor . We have said but little of Dr. Warren in his own peculiar department , because his transcending merits as an anatomist and surgeon demand the hand of an expert to do them justice . We close our notice with some few details that may interest the general reader , referring those who may seek a fuller knowledge of his services to the volumes before us . He was among the foremost of his time in cultivating the science of comparative anatomy , and was especially among the pioneers in our own country in the study of paleontology . His great work on the Mastodon Giganteus is an enduring monument of his patient industry and his extended knowledge in this recondite department of research . He obtained at his own expense a tolerably complete skeleton of a mastodon discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hudson River , and various other similar relics , on which he lectured repeatedly in Cambridge and Boston . He took also a deep interest in the craniological researches of Gall and Spurzheim , and made a large collection of brains , both of human subjects and of various classes of animals . It does not appear to what extent he accorded with the phrenological theory of Spurzheim ; and it was probably with him rather an hypothesis for the collation of facts and the induction of general laws , than a representation of ultimate truth . By his agency , the valuable collection of the Boston Phrenological Society , containing more than five hundred and fifty articles , became the property of the University , and was deposited in the Massachusetts Medical College . Very early in his medical practice , Dr. Warren had partly anticipated a great discovery of our own day , in the employment of sulphuric ether to alleviate the pain of dying , particularly in pulmonic disease . In 1846 he performed the first surgical operation in which ether was used as an anesthetic agent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in surgery . In the course of the first year 's practice after this initial experiment he employed ether in more than two hundred cases , the results of which he communicated in a work entitled " Etherization , with Surgical Remarks . " He strenuously opposed the use of chloroform , as at once dangerous even in skilful hands , and proffering strong temptation as a medium of inebriation . Chloric ether he preferred on trial to sulphuric ether , as more agreeable and less irritating to the lungs . Among his important services to the public was the introduction to general use of " cracked wheat " as a preventive and remedy for constipation . He had previously used and recommended bread prepared from grain in which the bran was retained ; and to his precept and example , and his admirable treatise on " The Preservation of Health , " we are largely indebted for the dietetic reform in this respect which has taken place in domestic habits . The catalogue of Dr. Warren 's writings contains nineteen titles of separate works , with a very long list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various periodicals and associations . The list of larger surgical operations , // performed by him at the Massachusetts General Hospital , exceeds five hundred in number , to which must be added those performed in the preceding twenty years , and afterward in his private practice . These volumes contain medical and surgical papers and notes on a very wide diversity of subjects , and indicate an amount of industry with mind and pen rarely equalled , perhaps never exceeded , by one whose calls to active duty were so incessant and urgent . The entire record impresses us with admiration for his ability , skill , discretion , and various learning , and vindicates his title to a high order of intellectual merit , and a place among the most illustrious names in a profession second to no other in the eminent endowments of those who have been its ornament and honor . At the same time , we discern through his whole life uncorrupt integrity and good faith , transparent sincerity , and scrupulous conscientiousness . We suppose his to have been a somewhat hard and rigid nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentle faith and the loving spirit of Christianity ; but this renovating power was manifestly infused into his whole being , - was not a force ab extra , but a new and modifying element of spiritual life , making him true to its divine ideal , and consecrating his powers and endowments to the service of God and man . The memoir is compiled with eminent skill and felicity . The author has incorporated with it large portions of the diary and correspondence of its subject , which it was deemed desirable to preserve in a permanent form ; and it was thus necessary often to duplicate the narrative , in order to conne&amp;t fragments of manuscript which would otherwise have left the life-story imperfect . Dr. Edward Warren 's style is chaste , perspicuous , and strong . The work could not have fallen into better hands , or have been executed more faithfully or more lovingly . It appears in the best style of the publishers , and with several wellexecuted engravings . It presents , of course , the strongest claims upon the interest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both as giving him a lifelike portraiture of a worthily eminent man , and as conveying , with the fewest technicalities possible , a large amount of valuable knowledge on a wide range of subjects seldom presented in a form so simple , intelligible , and attractive .
