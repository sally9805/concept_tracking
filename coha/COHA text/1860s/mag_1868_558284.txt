ART . II . - THE CHURCH AND RELIGION . THE student of history finds in every period two diverging and frequently opposing Currents of thought in respect to religion , and those institutions intended for its support which are classed under the generic name of The Church . Without intending to criticise either of them by an appellation , one may be called the current of authority , the other of liberty . One is the expression of the tendency of the mind toward form , and the influence upon it of tradition , exhibited in creed , dogma , and superstition ; the other of its search for reality , simplicity , and independence of external control . In the past , the former has been the wider , and has seemed to be the stronger cnrrent ; at the present day the latter has a growing force . " If we begin , " says a writer in a recent number of the " Pall Mall Gazette , " " by considering the Church as it was when it emerged from the Dark Ages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not fail to see that it was then the great representative of whatever light and knowledge there was in the world . The clergy were , and were felt to be , the natural and rightful moral and intellectual leaders of the human race ; nor need it be denied , that , though the spirit of their rule was as narrow as was to be expected from the state of knowledge in those times , it was on the whole highly beneficial . How the clergy failed to keep pace with the growth of knowledge ,  --  how they quarrelled amongst themselves as to the true character of the revelation of which they claimed to be the keepers ,  --  how the laity took part in the quarrel , and examined into their credentials , and with what results ,  --  how that part of human life which was to be regarded as the spiritual province of affairs was gradually narrowed , and the part which was to be regarded as the temporal province was gradually enlarged , are the principal subjects of modern history , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who really maintains , that , taken as a whole , the clerical view of life has been gaining , and the temporal view of life losing ground . " It is true , indeed , that the sacerdotal view , as it may be // called , of religion , and of the office of the Church , was never more ardently professed , and never more vigorously asserted , than it is in some quarters to-day . The Papal Encyclical of the 8th of December , 1864 , and the accompanying Syllabus of opinions and doctrines which " are altogether reprobated , proscribed , and condemned , " afford probably the most extreme instance of the extent of the claims now put forward by the adherents to the principle of authority in matters of religion . The 15th Article of th' Syllabus condemns as a pernicious heresy the proposition , that " Every man is free to embrace and profess the religion which he , guided by the light of reason , shall believe to be true . " The 24th Article denounces the error , that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a subsequent Article - the 47th - denies that " Science ought to be exempt from ecclesiastical authority " while the last Article of all reprobates the notion , that the Church " ought to reconcile itself and compromise with progress , liberalism , and modern civilization . " The whole Syllabus is , indeed , a denunciation of the principles most efficient in the progress of the world , and on which existing society is founded . The doctrines thus affirmed are not mere empty words ; they are accepted by every genuine member of the Roman Church as truths necessary for salvation . Nor is the Papacy short-sighted in issuing what might seem a defiance d l'outrance to the enlightenment of society . Under this war-cry it gathers to its banners a host of zealots and enthusiasts , whose spirits are raised to the highest pitch by the sense of the impracticability of a peaceful composition with their opponents . Thus , in a volume of Essays written by members of the Roman Church in England , and edited by Archbishop Manning , which was published a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authoritative exposition of the opinions and temper of a large body of the most enlightened and devoted Catholics , we find much that indicates their absolute subjection to the doctrines of the Encyclical . " The Church , " says one of these writers , " we must never forget , is our infallible guide , not in faith only , but in morals also ; and every single proposition of which right or wrong is the predicate is under her direct jurisdiction . " ( p. 90. ) // And again : " The foul poison of worldliness has , ever since the Fall , overspread the whole moral world ; and our one security from its infection is to sit ever at the Church 's feet , and listen to her voice , and make her utterances our one test and measure of human morality . " ( p. 94 . ) " To speculation , " says another of these essayists , " the Church leaves within the limits of the Christian domain a wide and open space to move about in at will . To step over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads not to knowledge , but to confusion ,  --  to darkness , and not to light . Hers is the hand to appoint the paths and the boundaries , hers the controlling will , and hers the infallible judgment to allow the more or the less , to separate the sound from the unsound , to define the true or the false . Her infallibility is man s security ; it is not so much a yoke to the will as a light to the reason . " ( p. 473 . ) It would not be difficult to find among recent writers belonging to various branches of Protestantism expressions which , though different in terms from those we have just cited , are not less absolute in the assertion of the existence of an infallible authority to which the intellect should be subjected in matters of religion , and of the necessity to salvation of the acceptance of certain doctrines or dogmas . The revival of the sacerdotal spirit , which is to be remarked in America as well as in Europe , is in fact a protest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or irreligion , but of religion independent of ecclesiastical formularies . It is an indication , on the part of the churches of all denominations , of a sense of common danger to their supremacy in the regulation of religion . The spirit of individual independence in religious no less and no otherwise than in secular affairs is gaining ground , and growing in distinctness and consistency ; and as the natural effect , the sacerdotal spirit for the time gains in intensity and eagerness . It is vigorous , because put on its defence , and driven to its strongholds . A complete statement of the historic causes of the decline in the power of creeds and churches would be a history of the intellectual development and social progress of modern times . But it is evident that two principles have been mainly instru // mental , during the last century , in bringing about the existing condition of religious opinion , and it is difficult to say which has been most operative . It may perhaps be fair to assume that the decay of belief in creeds is due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the application of the scientific method - the method of all true knowledge , that of induction from the facts of particular observation - to the investigation of religious truth ; while the decline in the authority of the churches is due more especially to the progress of political liberty . Certain it is that the combined influence of these two principles upon the minds of enlightened men has wrought a change of which all are conscious in religious faith , opinion , and spirit , and one likely to produce results on human character and on social institutions which as yet can be but very imperfectly estimated . That point of progress has now been reached , when , for the first time in the history of civilization , it is not only free to a man to believe what he likes , but safe for him to profess what he believes . The time has come when not only the right of free thought in matters of religion , no less than in other matters of speculation , is generally allowed in society , but the propriety of free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and marks a definite era in the advance of civilization . To put all opinions upon equal ground , so far as the right to hold and to express them is concerned , is the opening of a new order of things . " In modern times , " said ilume , writing a hundred years ado , " parties in religion are more furious and enraged than the most cruel factions that ever rose from interest and ambition . " But ilume 's modern times are not ours . However active and bitter the spirit of intolerance may be in some quarters , or however " irritated prejudice may oppose the gentle advent of new truth , " the general temper of society does not allow force or violence to be exerted to control opinion . The recognition of the inviolability of private judgment , and of the sanctity of individual belief , is gradually depriving parties in religion of their fury , and rendering their manners as accommodating as those of parties in politics . Even those sects that hold to a creed which , if logically followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are com // pelled by the very constitution of society to relinquish the hope of enforcing conformity , and gradually learn to partake of that charity which is the direct growth of freedom of thought . For the influence of this freedom is to liberate men from conceit of opinion , from prejudice , from subjection to narrow and exclusive modes of belief ; and whatever may be the disposition of those who shrink from claiming freedom for themselves , and who would , if possible , deny it to others , the free-thinker or liberal in religion is required , if he would be consistent with his own principle , cheerfully to admit , not only the right of others to hold what opinions they may , but their equal claim to respectful treatment and moral equality . The establishment of the principle of freedom of opinion has thus not only a direct influence to increase charity , but also to bring about the only conformity which is desirable or practicable among men , - a conformity of moral intention and aim . As men learn that agreement of opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be desired , their efforts become more and more directed to the accomplishment of the common ends the promotion of which is the main object of every form of religious faith , and to the development of that harmony which is the ideal of society . " To be still searching , " as Milton says , " what we know not by wha1* we know , still closing up truth to truth as we find it , this is the golden rule in theolo*y as well as in arithmetic , and makes up the best harmony ; not the forced and outward union of cold and neutral and inwardly divided minds . " But it is not to be supposed that the charity which freedom promotes is allied to indifference , or to carelessness concerning the truth , or to a low regard to the consequences of opinion upon the character and moral disposition . On the contrary , the widest charity for the opinions of others implies no want of just confidence in our own , or of zeal in maintaining them . It teaches us , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it modifies the methods adopted for the propagation of opinion , and substitutes in controversy the armory of reason for the irrational weapons of force . Devotion to truth in freedom has a calming influence upon the temper , even in dealing with those who cling to what we esteem error // with a constancy such as truth alone has a right to claim , and who defend their convictions with a zeal which blinds them to the dictates of equity , and leads them to mistake pride of opinion for fidelity to principle . In saying these things one inns the risk of seeming to rehearse truisms . But in such new conditions as those in which advanced religions thought now finds itself , there is need to enforce the application of truths which have been familiar in old relations , but which may be overlooked in their bearing upon present circumstances . And there is the more need to enforce the grace of charity as the best expression and proof of liberty , from the fact that the actual triumph of freedom is the result of a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not yet fairly escaped . Liberty has been born of strife ; and we , if not sore with wounds , are still covered with the dust of the battle , and still hot with the fight . And though liberty of thought is essential to the progress of religion , - nay , in a sense , oven to the existence of true religion , - the possession of liberty is not to be esteemed as the absolute acquisition of truth , but only as the means by which the continual search after truth is secured , and as an indispensable condition of such partial acquisition of it as is alone competent to man . Liberty substitutes the authority of the individual will ; directed by sound reason , and enlightened by the moral culture which is implied in the very existence of free society , - liberty substitutes the authority of this enlightened and restrained will in place of every external authority of whatever claim or nature . But religion has been commonly , indeed is still commonly , regarded as embodied in the churches . Even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally accepted that it is difficult for the mass of men to separate their notions of the spiritual teachings of Christ from the great system of ecclesiastical dogma and tradition with which they have become invested . In the decline of the power of the churches , and in the rejection of their authority , many consequently see a rejection of the authority of religion itself . But this is far from being the case . On the contrary , the increased sense of personal responsibility , which is the direct effect of individual // freedom , leads rather to an increase of the religious sentiment . The formal religion of tradition and habit gives place to the vital religion , which is a new growth in each man 's soul , and the expression of his sincere devotion to the object which he acknowledges to have absolute claim over the whole of his life . The work which the Church ( embracing under this generic name all its varieties ) effected in past times for the progress of society , and for the maintenance of the religious spirit , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful to generations which were still in a childish period of development , as its authority is still helpful to that portion of society which partakes least in the general advance of intelligence , and consequently of capacity for intellectual freedom . And although the power of the Church is declining , it is still very strong even among the enlightened classes , through the influence not only of the sentiments which its history and pretensions are fitted to inspire , but of those tender and sacred feelings naturally connected with the office it fulfils , with the religious associations of childhood , with the habit of worship within its walls , and with its solemn and consecrated symbols and forms . But so far as the most intelligent portion of society at the present day is concerned , the Church in its actual constitution is an anachronism . Much of the deepest and most religious life is led outside its walls ; and there is a constant and steady increase in the numbers of those who not only find the claims of the Church inconsistent with spiritual liberty , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regard it as failing to fulfil the most important functions which the constitution of modern society demands of it . For the Church , ideally considered , has still a place second in importance to no other social institution ; but it is hindered from occupying this place , not only by its claim to authority over the soul , and by the substitution of special systems of theology in place of the universal truths of religion , but by the vice inherent in its ancient constitution , and superstitiously transmitted to modern times , of sacerdotalism . This vice , which attaches to the most liberal scarcely less than to the most orthodox de // nominations , steadily acts to diminish the value of the services of the Church , and its appropriateness to the existing conditions of intelligent moral , and intellectual life . The reason which once existed in the religious dogmas of Christendom for the elevation of the priesthood into a superior caste exists no longer , outside of the Roman faith ; but the Church still centres around the priest , the clergyman , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community bound together , not by the constraining tie of a creed , but by interest in the pursuit of common ends under the guidance of religion , - a community in which each individual should bear a responsible part , - it becomes more and more a simple assemblage of persons gathered to go through with certain formal ceremonies , the chief of which consists in listening to a man who is seldom competent to teach . The Church is now mainly an institution for occupying the leisure hours of Sunday with what is called religious services . Undoubtedly many churches engage in work outside the walls of the church edifice ; but this work is rarely assumed to be necessary to the conception and existence of a church , and the functions of the pulpit are , at least in popular regard , its essential characteristic . But even accepting this low conception of the object for which a church exists , the churches , with few exceptions , fail to secure its fulfilment in a satisfactory manner . The modes of nominal worship , and the forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most part ill adapted , from their conventionality , formalism , and actual , though unintentional , impiety , to produce a good effect , or to supply the spiritual needs of an intelligent community . To men whose religion is sincere , undogmatic , the result of serious personal experience and deliberate conviction , and to whom the fit expression of religious thought and sentiment seems one of the highest and most difficult of intellectual efforts , the perfunctory manner and loose thinking common in the pulpit are scarcely tolerable . A writer in the London Spectator not long since gave the reasons why he did not go to church . They are such as in finence many persons whose natures and lives are not less // religious than those of the most punctual attendants on church services . He says - " Church , ' as we use the word every week , implies an hour and a half of worship among other worshippers , and half an hour 's steady listening to a sermon , bad , good , or indifferent . I dislike both , though not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me as an exercise , but I believe in the Divine response to it with a strength which would compel Professor Tyndall to set me down as a fool ; but public prayer is merely a disagreeable formality . I do not pray , and can not pray , with the prayers . I want in prayer to think my own thoughts , and use my own words , and do both at my own time , and be , above all , truthful before the Almighty ; not to plead to Him , for example , against sudden death , when I think it decidedly preferable to slow dying . The thoughts of those who framed the Missal , which we translated , are very noble thoughts , and I recognize their nobleness ; but they are not my thoughts , - are not like my thoughts at the time when they are uttered . No thoughts could be if I had to say them twice over under two different sets of mental circumstances ; and to say them every week , under indefinitely changing pressures and experiences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objection to the services . Loftier ideas were never couched in words fitter to convey them ; but when once learned by heart , their advantage for me is ended . They benefit as a psalm benefits , and I can not pray a psalm . It is right to pray for all conditions of men , if I am feeling for all conditions of men at the moment ; but if I am not , it is an act of hypocrisy for which I am morally greatly the worse , and I can never make my thought and the Prayer-Book thought run together . I am wanting to pray for more light when the congregation is singing the Te Deum . That emotion of worship which mere a *sociation with multitudes also worshipping produces in some men I can not feel . I ought , it may be , but I do not , not being by nature gregarious . I could pray in an empty church , or one of the Continental cathedrals , which give the mind a sense of solitude ; but not in a crowd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all in a crowd not praying its own thoughts . Chapel is worse than church . The thought is not mine any more than before , and is // expressed in far inferior words . Of course , if I believed association in worship a duty , I should try to do it , however disagreeable ; but I do not . The object of worship is to establish a closer relation with the Almighty ; and as this object is not attained by me in attending any external service whatever , whether of prayer or praise or commemoration , I stay away . Other people go , and benefit , as other people go to public meetings arid benefit ; but why should I be required to feel gregarious worship healthful , any more than gregarious dis-cussion ? " Then there is the sermon . As to worship , my feeling is , I imagine , individual , or so far individual that there is little sympathy to be hoped for or feared , the majority of human kind feeling the electric influence of association . But about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of men feel secretly . I dislike good sermons just as much as bad . It is not the length , or the feebleness , or the mannerism of the speech which annoys me , as it seems to annoy most men who write about sermons , but the speech itself . I do not want to be lectured even by a great lecturer . I object to the usual basis of the very best sermon ever delivered in a Christian church , - that I am a great sinner , come there to help to be saved . I am not . I am rather a good fellow , with a distinct purpose to lead a good life according to my lights , and a strong wish that it could be made , and I could be made , nobler and more efficient for the service of God and His creatures . If the preacher can help me towards that , I will go and hear him ; but he never does , and never will do it . He tells me I have deserved hell , and shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have not deserved anything of the kind ; no decent bishop , who knew the whole truth , would inflict anything of the kind ; my dearest friend would shrink with horror at the idea of imposing anything of the kind ; and God is better than any bishop , more loving than any friend . I want to get nearer Him , not to escape a doom I do not believe in ; and I can not get nearer by assenting in external act to ideas I at heart reject . That eternal preaching of selfishness as the highest impulse offends and annoys me till every sermon does positive harm . Better starve to feed Bethnal Green , than // starve to be released one 's self from all future sense of hunger . Then , be the preacher ever so good , he must , in each sermon , have one of three objects , - to state Christian doctrine , or illustrate Christian ethics , or warm his hearers ' hearts towards Christ and God , - must be either theologic or moral or emotional . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of ten , I know three times or thirty times as much theology as he does . No doubt , in the tenth case he can teach me ; but he would not do it in a sermon intended for babes and sucklings . If he would give me information about the things which worry me , the doubts whether law is not irreversible , whether God be the author or the exponent of the law , whether virtue and vice are not mental phenomena , whether all that we say or seem be not a dream within a dream , ' he might do me good ; but he will not do it , - is perhaps right in not doing it Emotional preaching ought to do me good , no doubt ; but the simple truth is , it does n't . I am not warmed to religious feeling by a splendid sermon , ' any more than I am warmed to political feeling by a splendid speech . It may be very wicked , but that is the simple truth . You might as well ask a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I belong to the Englishmen of the day . I have been trained all my life to dissect eloquence , and distrust sentiment , and dislike unction ; and the training tells on eloquence in the pulpit just as much as eloquence in the forum . I can no more be made into a Christian by Mr. Spurgeon than into a Radical by Mr. Bright . There is conceit in all that , bad conceit ; but then , if every man said his thought , would not every man seem conceited ? " It is evident that this writer 's objections apply mainly to the Church as represented by the clergyman , and regarded as an institution for maintaining certain definite doctrines , and for supporting stated devotional exercises . This is no doubt in great measure the true character of the existing Church , and it is no slight misfortune alike to religion and to society that it should be so . The churches of the present day fulfil but a very small part of the legitimate functions of a church in society . They have no proper relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its morality , no less than its religion , is in great measure independent of them . Habitual // attendance on church services , or even church membership , as it is called , affords no assurance of improvement in character or of advance in the religious life . Worship , the highest act of religion , is one of the professed objects for which the churches exist . But the worth of worship depends on its sincerity , - on its being the genuine expression of the spirit of the individual . Whatever conventionalizes or formalizes the act is an injury to the integrity of the spiritual nature . To go through with the forms of worship , to profess to call upon God , if one is repeating words without a corresponding emotion , is an act of impiety ; the windmill prayers of Thibet are to be preferred . It is not to be disputed that in all churches , of whatsoever name , and whatever be the forms they adopt , there is a tendency hardly to be resisted to this act of impiety . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreality of its prevailing modes , if we could free ourselves from traditionary sentiments and the delusions of superstitious observance , and if , by exercise of imagination , we could vividly represent to ourselves the real nature of the act , the purity of affection and self-concentration demanded by it , there is no one who would not be shocked at the character of the services usual in our churches , no one who would not feel how deep an injury they may inflict on the characters of those who unthinkingly , but seriously , engage in them . It is , however , but a small number of those who attend church who really attempt to engage in worship . The larger part leave worship to the clergyman , and look to him not only to " conduct , " but to perform the whole service . They throw the responsibility upon him , and do not ask as to the integrity of his emotions . The only thing required of him is the proper devoutness of manner . In substance , many of the prayers recited in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are expressions of unworthy conceptions , not duly of the Divine attributes , but of human nature , and are devoid of that spirit which it is the object of true worship to cultivate and to utter . If the prayer be unmeaning or unworthy , the existing churches lose one of their chief professed raisons d ' *tre . But // the defect in the portion of the services devoted to the forms of worship might be compensated in some degree by excellence in that portion of the ceremonies devoted to instruction or exhortation . It is not , however , to speak with disrespect of respectable men , to say that not one educated man in a thousand , and consequently not one clergyman in a thousand , has intelligence , culture , experience , imagination , sympathy , and humanity enough to qualify him to prepare one or two discourses a week for a single year , much more for a series of years , capable of benefiting an audience by the thought contained in them . In the absence of thought , a sermon may indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficially minds susceptible of vague moral impressions , or it may deal with subjects fitted by association to awaken virtuous reflection . But the common run of sermons derive whatever power they exert mainly from the superstition of authority which still attaches in the minds of the mass of church-goers to the office and dignity of the clergyman , - a tradition from times when the priesthood was not only the most enlightened portion of society , but when the priest claimed to be invested , by virtue of his office , with a mystic mediatorial character , and arrogated to himself not only the respect due to a teacher , but the reverence due to the minister of the judgment and mercy of the Lord . In the Church , as nowhere else at the present day , are to be found the still-flourishing relics of the childish elder world . But except in the Roman Church , - a church whose power lies in the special adaptation of its dogma and its forms to the needs of the ignorant and the childish , and to the temperament of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a church which still performs by its very nature a most important function in society , and will continue to perform it as long as great masses of men in civilized countries lie outside the pale of genuine civilization , in the ignorance and childishness of the Dark Ages , - except in this church , the real authority of the priest or the clergyman , so far as it claims to be a special divine grace inherent in the priesthood or the ministry , has almost passed away . Its shadow , however , remains , and the clergyman is very generally regarded with a vague reverence , such as is not accorded to a // lawyer or a schoolmaster , and his utterances often carry weight which their intrinsic value does not justify . But it is not merely on the supernatural side that the authority of the clergyman has declined . It has fallen off quite as much on the natural side . He is no longer a member of a class more enlightened than the rest of the community , and consequently authorized to instruct it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not only superseded the pulpit as instructors , they have raised the level of general culture , and have quickened the intellectual perceptions of the laity . More is demanded of the pulpit than of old . It is exposed to sharp competition . But the clergy are naturally slow to admit that their office gives them no title to teach , save as education , faculties , and experience may fit them , in like manner as education , faculties , and experience fit other men , for the task . The education in theology which the clergy usually receive is , for the most part , not so much a discipline of the mind to qualify it for the investigation and statement of truth , as a training in the grounds of certain received opinions under a strong prepossession in their favor . Its methods are th' opposite of scientific . It has a tendency to unfit men to judge correctly of the nature of evidence , and the character of arguments founded upon it . As a body , at this time the clergy are not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and this is true , whether we regard general culture , or that learning which might seem to belong specially to their profession . Even Biblical criticism owes more to laymen , in this generation , than to clergymen ; and in the debates which at present occupy all serious thinking men with regard to the ultimate positions of metaphysical science , the origin and test of moral ideas , and the very foundations of religious opinion , the clergy take no important part . It may be urged , indeed , that the work of instruction required of them is rather that of applying religious and moral truths to the practical affairs of life , than of discussing the speculative questions of moral or metaphysical science . But upon the justness of speculative opinions depends the propriety of the practical applications of truth ; and ample illustration could be brought , were it not already within the cognizance of every // reader , of pulpit teachings opposed no less to good morals than to good sense . If we take the volumes published by the clergy of this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes mainly of sermons , - we shall hardly find one of them which is a valuable contribution to thought , or which deserves even slight regard for its literary merit . There is hardly one of them which is an addition to literature , - not one of them with which the future will have any reason to concern itself , except nominally . The general shallowness of American culture doubtless affords a partial excuse for the poverty of the productions of the pulpit . The clergy are neither supported by a high standard within their profession , nor stimulated by judicious criticism from without . So little is excellence expected either in the substance ' or in the form of their work , that there is no longer any sarcasm in the use of the term " pulpit argument " as synonymous with unsound reasoning , and " pulpit rhetoric " as the designation of a feeble and stilted style . No doubt much of this is the result of the fact , that a work is required of the clergyman , by the custom of the churches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it is not mere intellectual incompetence or exhaustion which vitiates pulpit literature . The worth of a sermon may be in depth and purity of sentiment , rather than in mental power . But the capacity to be genuinely in earnest is almost taken from the clergyman by his false position . He is not , while he remains in the pulpit , and assumes by so doing a professional authority , in harmony with his times . He is an anachronism , and more or less feels himself to be so . Habit and traditional association are the great pillars of the modern pulpit . They are strong and enduring supports ; but they are giving way ; and when they fall , when at last the clergyman finds himself on the level of his congregation , standing on solid mother earth , he will find the inspiration which he now seeks in vain , and will gain a power more serviceable than that which is now slipping from him . The complaint is general in all the sects , that few young men of ability seek the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed to the superior attraction of other professions as means of winning distinction and wealth , and of thus satisfying the most common ambitions . But there is a deeper reason in the recognition by young men generally that the relation between the Church and the world is at present unsatisfactory , and that in choosing the ministry or the priesthood as a profession they run the risk of finding themselves soon in a position in which there is little room for the free development of individuality , and which requires efforts and sacrifices of a sort which few men are capable of making without loss of mental vigor and moral sincerity . We should be greatly misunderstood , if we were supposed to underrate the value of the services which the clergy , even under their present disadvantages , render to society outside the walls of the churches . It is in the world that their functions are of chief worth . Their profession brings them in contact with men in intimate and domestic relations in a manner which enables them to be ministers of peace and charity and comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate duties ; and a large measure of self-denial and devotion and purity is required of them . It is this field of what we would gladly call pastoral duty , had not the phrase almost lost its sweet original significance under the formal associations that have invested it , which is the one that now needs to be chiefly cultivated , and in which the true work of the clergy is mainly to be done . Ecclesiastical services usurp the place of social duties , and the performances of Sunday exhaust the strength which the clergy require for the discharge of weekday labors . And we should be still more seriously misunderstood , if we were supposed in these remarks to speak otherwise than in the real interests of the clergy themselves . It is because we desire to see the profession brought into harmony with the conditions of modern society , and freed from the trammels which limit its usefulness and lower its character , that we set forth thus distinctly some of the more obvious evils which attend its actual position . And here the question naturally arises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this leads to the broader one , How is the Church to be regenerated , that it may take its true place , and // realize its legitimate object and ideal as an institution not less essential to the best order of society than the institutions of political government are to the legal order of the State ? It is not by destruction that this end is to be effected , but by slow and natural processes of modification and improvement . It is plain that the gulf must steadily widen between the churches and the real opinions and interests of the advanced section of the community , - that the Church must become steadily more and more a mere decaying instrument for influencing the lower orders of society , and for affording to the refined class a respectable mode for the perfunctory fulfilment of certain recognized obligations to the name of religion , unless its spirit , methods , and organization be gradually and profoundly modified . No great social institution changes its form to bring itself into accordance with changed ideas by an easy or rapid process . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those which seek embodiment in forms appropriate to themselves , the longer and the more laborious is the period of transition . The Church of the past has rested on the principle of authority in matters of religion ; the Church of the future must rest on that of liberty . The opposition is complete , so far as principle is concerned ; but there is ground for peaceful transition in the common end of each , - the improvement of mankind by bringing them to a stronger sense of duty , of the responsibility attaching to life , and to a clearer recognition of the claims of the spiritual nature of man . The exact process of change is not to be determined beforehand ; the forms in which the new ideas will take shape are neither to be prearranged nor predicted . It can only be asserted in broad terms that they will be a natural growth , the expression of needs widely felt , and determined by the general constitution of society . The Church of the future is not to be moulded with set purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts and wills of each new generation . The Church which claims to be immutable , the same semper , omnibus , ubique , is a useless petrifaction , from which life and virtue have hopelessly departed . But a Church based on the principle of liberty may at least be conceived of , which shall exist , not in virtue of its exclusiveness , // but as a natural human brotherhood , - a Church which shall embrace not only those attracted to it by considerations foreign to religion , by superstition or by fashion , by tradition , custom , and association , - not only those who seek to lay down the privilege and responsibility of independent thought , or those who attend its services for the sake of amusement or excitement , or who know not how to express their respect for what the Church professes to represent otherwise than by regular attendance on its services , or who fancy that the example of church-going is one that has a good influence on the public at large ; - a Church may be conceived of not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope wide enough to embrace , and methods various enough to employ , the most enlightened and the least enlightened members of the community , the most religious and the least religious , the philosopher and the skeptic , no less than the ignorant and the superstitious . Such an image as this at least may be formed of a Church in a society which recognizes the reality , the universality , and the unity of the religious sentiment , while acknowledging the diversity of religious opinion and of dogmatic affirmations . A faith seemingly little justified , indeed , by the appearances of the world may be required for confidence in such an advance in the moral and intellectual culture of man as shall render possible such an institution . But there are deeper lying grounds for this faith than superficial appearances afford . In such a community as that which is now growing up in the United States , - a community which began , as one of the old New England divines said , as " a plantation religious , " whose people " bought the truth with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon moral principles , and whose nationality is founded in the doctrine of the equal moral rights of man , - in such a community , it is hardly extravagant to anticipate that the Church will become actually , in a measure , what it is ideally , the natural instrument for securing those ends to the pursuit of which individuals in society are directed by the religious sentiment , and which the political institutions of the State do not undertake to accomplish . The Church might thus become the complete expression , and afford the most effective organization of the moral order which un // denies the political system . A vast field of social and individual interests lies altogether outside of the reach of political government , and objects not less important to the general welfare than any over which the government has direct control are left to be secured by other instrumentalities , and by the use of other than legal means . The spontaneous action of individuals , either separately or united in a community , is insufficient to secure steady improvement . For this end there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulated , and directed by organization ; and the organization best fitted for the purpose is that of a free Church , - a Church existing as a natural human fellowship , its members bound together simply by the spiritual tie of devotion to the highest good that each is capable of recognizing ; claiming no authority , whether original or derived ; with no test of membership but that of interest in the common good ; with no limits short of those of the community itself ; organized so as to combine most effectively the separate good-will and the scattered efforts of its members ; - such a Church would appear to be an instrumentality by which society may accomplish those ends which lie without the province of its constituted government , and which the spontaneous efforts of individuals are incompetent to reach . Existing not as a close corporation , for the purpose , express or implied , of upholding any selfish ecclesiastical supremacies , of maintaining the fictions and traditions of dark and superstitious times , of enforcing any doctrinal system , of restraining the free exercise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of formalizing the expressions of religious sentiment , but as a fellowship embracing all men as equal members within its ample and elastic fold , for the end of developing the religious character of the community , of inspiring and regulating active efforts for the improvement of man , it would apply the spirit of religion to the solution of the difficulties of society by methods and offices as various as the needs of men , and by services as various as their different temperaments , culture , experience , and desires ; it would form the channel through which the currents of beneficent impulse and action , now so greatly diffused and wasted , would flow into all parts of the body of the State . // While each individual in such a Church would have a recognized share of responsibility , and an acknowledged duty to his fellows , the clergy would be leaders and agents in every work of practical humanity , and would find their field of pastoral occupation enlarged in proportion to the narrowing of that of pulpit duty . Whatever of good or beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in greater measure in a Church which would neglect no means suited to the development of religious character and life , would be constrained by no formalities , and would not suffer itself to be deprived of the use of any rational mode of influence upon the sentiments and the imagination , or of appeal to the spirit of man . All art , every beneficent or beautiful form of life , would belong to it by right . Proceeding from a natural principle of growth by gradual evolution , and not springing from a violent revolution destructive of historic continuity , it would cherish all ancient and endeared associations , and would incorporate every venerable form consecrated by the experience of the race , leaving undisturbed every conviction , habit , nay , every prejudice as well , that did not interfere with the advance of society in the free inquiry after truth and the independent practice of religion . The social element in the life of this Church is so essentially predominant , that it must adapt itself to the weakness as well as to the strength of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which bind together the generations of men , and of rudely cutting off the solemn perpetuity of the religious commonwealth . " " The burning visions of a future brotherhood were inadequate without the support of a religious consciousness of what we owe to past effort . " Nothing can be more fruitless in speculations relating to society than a mere abstract ideal formed without reference to positive conditions , to practical needs , and to actual desires . So far only as the image of the Church which is here sketched conforms to these conditions can it possess any value as a view of a probable development . But whatever may be the worth of the conceptions here presented , there can be no legitimate question of the certainty of coming change in the relation of the Church to society , and of a development of religion as the fundamental // element of progressive social life . The decline in ecclesiasticism and sacerdotalism is the advance of religion , and implies the growth of the tine Church of universal humanity , - the symbol and manifestation of the brotherhood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially existing , wherever men , discarding the old notion of religion as something external , to be got by special experience , as a system of dogmas to be accepted , and of forms to be regarded , arrive at the true idea of religion as devotion - utter , absolute devotion - to whatever they know and feel to be best . It exists wherever the individual has learned that he has no private ends , - that for all he is , and all he desires , and all he does , he is responsi .. ble to the community of which he forms a part , and which endows him with its united powers , - that possession conveys no absolute right to property , but that every man holds whatever he possesses , be it genius , faculties , opportunities , or lands and goods , not as owner , but as trustee ,  --  and that the true worship of God consists in the service of His children , and devotion to the common interests of men .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
