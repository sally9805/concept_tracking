OUR CIVIL SERVICE . THERE are many weighty problems before the country in connection with the reconstruction and the regeneration of the Southern States , and with financial and fiscal affairs ; but these , and other questions , are all subordinate in importance to that relating to the organization of the civil service of the United States . At present there is no organization save that of corruption ; no system save that of chaos ; no test of integrity save that of partisanship ; no test of qualffication save that of intrigue . The consequence is , that the revenue laws are r*ot executed , for the want of faithful officers ; and these and other laws are imperfectly applied , for the want of competent functionaries . In local , general , and Presidential elections , the whole country is thrown into convulsions ; and who would imagine that these demonstrations of public liberty are converted into engines of public demoralization ? But in the present chaos of the civil service it is so . Every man elected to State or national , executive or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who vote for him , and the great majority of the hundreds of thousands of officeholders of the United States are virtually nothing else than political mercenaries , who are paid by the state , instead of being paid by the individual whom their votes lift into power . If one hundred thousand mercenaries were actually paid in cash by the state at the average rate of two thousand dollars , the country would know that it is bled annually to the extent of two hundred million dollars ; and resign itself by adding this amount to The general cost of representative government ; and Congressmen and Customhouse Directors , and members of the Cabinet , and other legislative and executive authorities might rise at least in public estimation in proportion to the additional prize-money exacted from the country for their retainers . But these satellites of the executive and legislative planets are not only paid by the state , instead of being paid by the luminaries around whom they revolve , but they rob the state ; they mismanage public business , and bring free institutions into disrepute by proclaiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by subsidizing organized bands of mercenary office-holders , and by securing the boon of political liberty at the cost of morality and of the culture and attainments requisite for the public service . If republican institutions can not be maintained except by holding out bribes to voters , it would at all events be more economical and respectable for the United States Government to make a bargain with each person elected to legislative and executive offices , paying him a certain amount for his expenses at the poll or in the State legislatures , and reserving to itself the power of appointing public officers who have undergone examinations and passed the tests prescribed by Mr. Jeuckes 's Civil Service bill . But to pay the gentlemen who help the honorable Representatives from the different States to their respective seats , or eminent politicians to seeretaryships , collectorships , and foreign missions , by conferring upon them public offices , allotted geographically or indiscriminately , and then to incur the risk of their robberies , blunders , and mismanagements of every kind , is not only intolerable upon the score of total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of two things is sure // to happen : either the Republic must break up this systematized demoralization , or it will break up the Republie . As long as this demoralization lasts , the Republic will be so only in name . In fact , it will be a species of crapulous , democratic imperialism , which ransacks the gutters of the land for the purpose of enlisting mercenaries , who , in reward for their services , prop up the Presidential throne and the legislative pillars , and then , with the true instinct of freebooters recruited under the piratical banner that to the " victors belong the spoils , " rob and disgrace a nation which is foolish enough to believe that liberty can thrive when its standard-bearers are reeking with ignorance and venality . Foreign nations need not be startled by this frank statement of ugly facts . If they had not introduced African slavery to the North American continent , and if they had not fastened upon this country the noble but irksome task of educating into manhood and freedom European paupers and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found leisure and opportunity to devise measures for purging their public service from ignorance and corruption , and for making the tests of moral and mental qualification more stringent in proportion to the increase of population and territory , and the corresponding increase of public officers . But as it was , we had no breathingtime . Slavery stared us in the face at the very dawn of our national existence . The slavery question so distracted the country , that even those who were appalled by the growing demoralization of the public service shrank from laying hands upon the monster , because it was overshadowed by the still greater monster , slavery . It may be asserted that , during the war of independence , the curses against slavery were hushed by the necessity of unanimity in throwing off the British yoke , and that , since the achievement of our independence , the painful feeling inspired by the traffic in public offices was quelled by the greater indignation aroused by the supremacy of the slave oligarchy . That the traffic in public offices became the most formidable auxiliary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the European importations of population were controlled by it , almost desp6tically , require no demonstration at our hands . The facts are matter of history . The politicians of the Tory and slavery school would never have had such a long lease of power , if they had not been able to hold out the bait of office to their most unscrupulous camp-followers . To talk to them of a reform in the civil service , would have been regarded as stark insanity : they would have scouted the idea of dispelling a chaos that fostered their designs , and of introducing a system of culture and integrity which would have blasted their hopes . Conscious as every thoughtful citizen was of the abuses of political life , he was equally conscious of the futility of attempting to reform any of its branches as long as the fountain head of political liberty and morals was poisoned by the abettors of the slavery power . While the country was struggling against the progress of slavery , it was at the same time engaged in the civilization of its new territories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population . To have converted the American wildernesses into prosperou* cities , and marshalled gigantic armies for the overthrow of the old Tory and slave power , and at the same time kept our civil service and political machinery free from those abuses , which had such an immense scope , we would have been superhuman . We have been only human and could not carry out a series of vast transformations and reforms at one and the same time . It is because we have accomplished such great deeds within a few generations , that we can afford to lay bare the // evils which still gnaw the heart-life of the Republic . Weak nations may feel constrained to gloss over the defects of their systems of administration , but strong nations need not stoop to concealment of national blemishes . In our case , frankness is a token of power . It is , moreover , a great relief to follow the practice of the English race , in calling things by their names , and in taking the bull by the horn . We have , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoiltraffic theories . But having said thus much , we have to put in what French lawyers wor*Id call pleas of extenuation . They consist in this : that in our country but few , if any , persons can afford or are inclined to work for nothing . Hence , if Jones works for the election of Brown , Jones expects to be compensated in some way or other . Not only that Jones must live , and that Mrs. and the Misses Jones must be able to make a decent fl*ure in society , but Jones is also imbued with a certain rough sense of dignity . Self-sacrifice being superseded , in the current of modern ethics , by self-elevation , Jones claims his reward not only as due to Jones in the concrete , but also to Jones in the abstract ; to the man as well as to the citizen ; to his individual wants as well as to his civic claims . In medieval times Jones would have got his pay , and there would have been an end of Jones . But at the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets are involved in the transaction . He sympathizes with the political church of Brown , and , long after having receiyed his compensation in the shape of a postmastership , or a clerkship in the Treasury or the Customhouse , or an assessorship , he uses his influence , whatever that may be , in the interest of the common political church . Brown has to sustain him accordingly , and to vote for an increase of his salary , and even to oppose the reform in the office in which Jones is employed , in the event of such reform threatening to submerge Jones . Jones may steal ; he may blunder ; when appointed to a postmastership , he may desert his post and saddle upon the country the additional expense of sustaining Jones 's shadow or deputy ; when in the Treasury , he may connect himself with rings , and betray the secrets of his office ; he may commit all sort and manner of irregularities and delinquencies , but as long as he clings to the political church , there is a chance at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape from justice , and of shelter against exposure and removal . Or , without being positively criminal and unfaithful , he may be altogether incompetent for the discharge of his duties , or revel in sinecures , as thousands of Joneses do all over the country , and in foreign offices ; but he adheres to the tenets of the political church , and Brown , his , high priest , bestows upon him absolution for all his sins . Now , what the Browns fear in voting for the adoption of the Jenckes Civil Service Bill , which provides for tests of examination and qualification , so as to purge the service from all incompetent and dishonest persons , is that they will be lost by losing the support of the Joneses . And here we are at issue with the Browns . We contend that there are all kind and manner of Joneses . There are incompetent , dishonest Joneses , and there are well-qualified and perfectly honest Joneses . All Brown has to do , is to shift his base . He must turn his back upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private life , if he can not select his sponsors for his public life from the honorable and able members of the community in the midst of which he lives . Brown may promise to give to Jones the benefit of his patronage , provided that Jones possesses the requisite moral and intellectual qualifications for the office to which he aspires . The Jenckes bill does not do away with political patronage . It only makes it subject to certain conditions of fitness , which are of greater importance to the state than the rise of Brown or the fall of Jones , and // which moreover relieve Brown from the fearful responsibility of fastening upon the public service a worthless person , and Jones from temptations to which he may not be subjected in remaining a loafer and good-for-nothing in private life . If the Jeuckes bill fails to pass , how is the state to be protected l Is Brown to be held responsible for the delinquencies of his *rote'ge* , and for the money which Jones draws from the people , without giving in return for it adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be held responsible . In the present chaos and demoralization nobody is responsible ; nay , Jones pleads that he has to feather his nest , because he may be turned out when Black turns out Brown ; and thus the hard-working people are the only sufferers in t4ais palladium of Liberty , as they are in the strongholds of despotism . The statistics of all these eases are selfevident . In an isolated evil , the public might withhold their verdict until the facts are proven and authenticated . But here we have to deal with a wide-spread evil , which defrauds the country in the collection of taxes on a scale so gigantic that the commissioners of revenue , collectors , assessors , and Treasury officers - at least those of them who are honest - bow their heads in shame , and despair . We have to deal with an evil that is manifest here and there and everywhere . To present particular instances of it , would be to claim the space of several annual volumes of this magazine , without exhausting the documentary evidence . All that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this myriad-armed evil , is to reveal not only the fact of its existence , which every American knows , but  --  and what is more painful  --  to disclose , also , the fact that no remedy has been so far proposed for its diminution , if not eradication , excepting that contained in the Jenekes Civil Service bill . It will be seen at a glance that the bill does not go far enough . The Constitution vesting in the President the appointing power , by and with the consent of the Senate , the bill could only primarily deal with those subordinate officers who are appointed by the heads of departments . But it contains a provision which enables the Senate to be guided in its confirmation or rejection of persons nominated to that body by the Executive by an examination test to which these persons may , in the judgment of the Senate , be subjected , together with the candidates for subordinate offices . The bill goes probably as far as it can go under the present Constitutional limitations , and as a first instalment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is to introduce a similar bill for the reform of the foreign service . The adoption of these two bills would effect , however , only a partial reform . To consolidate it , a reorganization of some of the pifblic departments is indispensable . The Treasury Department , for instance , controls the customs , the revenue offices , the statistical bureau , apart from the multitudinous branches of the Treasury proper , ineluding the currency and printing bureau . In giving to one man the control of such an immense caravansary of offices , and of the corresponding patronage , a bureaucratic despotism is built up in the midst of free institutions , which , whenever a President is hostile to the popular will , may easily be used as a formidable weapon against the People . It must be borne in mind that , when the Treasury Department was established , it could not have been anticipated that , after a few generations , the population would increase from a few millions to forty millions , and that the dominion of the Republie would spread from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Treasury are selected by the President , to be sure , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate ; but while their politics are well known and primarily determine their selection , they are generally taken // on trust , so far as their qualifications are concerned , and the control over the financial resources of the country , and , in a great measure , over its commercial and industrial interests , is given , as it were , at random , and rather recklessly . A Secretary of the Treasury is 8Uppos to be what is called a practical man of business , and a man conversant with financial law and science , and with political economy . But it is all guesswork . Nobody knows what his real opportunities were for grappling with this vast field of knowledge , theoretically as well as practically , and probably he does not know himself until opportunities arise which either make him conscious of his defective knowledge , or bring out his capacities . While his animus is that of a presidential aspirant , his occupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of a sultan . Even supposing that he possesses the greatest intellectual and moral qual*fications for his office-comprehensiveness of mind , quickness of perception , wealth of experience , stores of financial and politico - economical knowledge , and , above all , clearness of head and unswerving integrity-even suppose him to be a paragon of perfection , the question yet arises , whether it would be safe to confide to one mortal man such a boundless trust and to vest in him such a mammoth patronage . The better way probably would be to have a Minister of Finance who has nothing to do with the bureaucratic routine of the Department , and to whom the Secretary of the Treasury would be held responsible , together with the other officers of the Treasury proper , including the Revenue bureau ; while the Customs , together with Agriculture , Statistics , Census , and Land and Patent Offices , might be placed under the control of a Minister of Commerce and Agriculture and Industry . The Interior Department at present controls the Agriculture , the Land , the Patent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beside the Interior Department proper . It is very properly proposed to unite the Indian Bureau with the War Department ; and pensions being generally paid only in the military and naval service , the Pension office might be in all propriety annexed partly to the Navy , partly to the War Department . With a minister ) f finance and a minister of commerce and agriculture and industry , occupied only with the statesmanlike and comprehensive survey of their respective spheres , and unincumbered with the daily business of bureaucratic routine , these supreme functionaries might cooperate in the Civil Service Department proposed in the Jenckes bill , and promote the efficiency of the service at the same time that they control the respective official administrations of the Departments . Working secretaries answered very well when the country was small ; but in its present dimensions , the great Departments should be presided over by the best qualified men of th' country , whose time is not absorbed by reading thousands of letters daily , and listening to the clamors of swarms of office-seekers , but whose whole attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the branches of all the Departments , both administrative and executive . The daily routine of bureaucratic life is hardly reconcilable with the higher attributes of financial and commercial statesmanship . The mind of the secretary is at present crushed by a load of hard work . He has no time to think and to take the measure of the whole sphere and scope of his own acts and occupation . Like an admiral , a minister of finance , or of commerce , should be able to see over the horizon above him , and over all the spheres around him . The present secretaries do too much drudgery , and perform too little mental work . They seem to be overworked ; but the greatest stagnation of mind is often induced by the most incessant hard work , and the reports issued by the respective departments show how it is possible to be prolix without being suggestive . No country issues as exhaustive official reports as this country ; // but it is almost impossible to peruse any of them without missing the compact and pregnant utterance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barren of practical illustration and of suggestive , fertile ideas . One*and the same bureaucratic mechanism pervades them all , and very naturally so , because there is not one presiding mind in any of the departments which is not tainted with the miasma of drudgery , or which has thought or leisure to rise to a statesmanlike and philosophical exposition of the interests to which the reports refer . The multiplicity and bulk of the present reports are so colossal , that they are but little read by the masses of the people . In this country , where time is money more than anywhere else , and where leisure is exceptional , official reports should be concise , telling , pitliwy , compact , comprehensive . Instead of having , as at present , a hundred different reports from the various bureaus and offices of the great departments , the presiding ministers should digest and unite and condense them all , and present them to the country in a readable , suggestive shape . The Agricultural report is at present worked up in the Interior Department ; the Commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Land Office report , &amp;c. , &amp;c. ,  --  Land , Agriculture Commerce and Navigation , Census , Statistics , Customs , and Industry presided over by one mind , might be merged into one and the same report , and thus exhibit to the country a complete picture of its great resources ; while the minister of Finance would do the same as regards revenue , currency , and finance . Hundreds of thousands of dollars would thus be saved to the country . The gain would not only be pecuniary , but also intellectual and encouraging to the development of our resources and civilization . The growth of the country has been so spasmodic that the organization of its public service has also taken a spasmodic turn . Bureaus have been piled upon bureaus in chaotic masses , until the Treasury and Interior have grown up to be unwieldy laboratories , in which ill-directed forces are pell-mell thrown together , all working for the elaboration and administration of the financial , fiscal , commercial , territorial , and industrial resources of the country , but in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce from industry , while Indians , and pensions for soldiers and sailors , are under the same administration with inventions , penitentiaries and insane asylums . Add to all this the absence of all tests of qualification in the chief and subordinate officers , the irresponsibility pervading all these bureaus from the subterranean caverns to the loopholes near the roof , and no cmotion should prevail but that of unalloyed though negative admiration that , in the midst of such a saturnalia of chaos and irresponsibility , there arc not more frauds* perpetrated , and not more blunders committed . That , however , among the mass of the men thus employed , there should have been so few to expose the anomalies of the public service , is a less encouraging symptom . It seems almost as if Americans , born to shift for themselves , in the full exercise of their independence , become unhinged from the moment they don the livery and settle down in the drudgery of office , not only like automatons , akin to those which haunt the Bank of England and Doctors ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An exploration through the caverns and labyrinths of the Interior and Treasury Departments resembles , in some respects , that through asylums for the aged and the infirm . Not that excessive brightness and buoyancy could be expected in public offices , but the aspect of excessive desolation is only accountable by the fact that intellect is too much excluded and all is reduced to the kvel of a mechanical workshop , without even imparting to the inmates the healthy glow of men en aged in arduous manual labor . 7 // Another cause is the crowding together of many bureaus in one and the same building ; the want of ventilation ; the miasma engendered in the Treasury building by the printing workstead and the smoke of the burnt notes . Hence the livid appearance of many of the poor clerks . Hence , also , the appearance of debility and somnolescence . At the same time the absence of all prospect of promotion crushes ambition and begets discouragement , while the dependence of clerks , in some instances , upon questionable and ill-qualified chiefs of bureau , culminates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are somewhat painful , but they show that the total absence of presiding minds causes as much neglect in the exercise of the most common duties of humanity , as in that of a statesmanlike organization . The department needs depletion of the buildings , consolidation of bureaus , and reduction offorces , with presiding ministers relieved from drudgery , and with chiefs and subordinates of bureaus appointed upon the principle of probation , examination and promotion , and remoVal only for cause , as indicated in the Jenckes bill . By reducing the number of bureaus , and the forces , a great saving will be effected ; and a still greater one , by increasing the pay of competent officers , and removing all those who are useless and worthless . Deputy-ships in the Postal service should be altogether abolished ; and the postmaster who absents himself from his post without leave of absence in urgent emergencies , should forfeit it . The principle which prevails in the Prussian service , of requiring bonds , varying according to the respective salaries , from all officers , high or low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cases of delinquency , the people would be , at all events , protected against loss . The first duty of the new civil service department proposed in the Jenekes bill should be to elaborate measures for the reorganization of the whole service , with a view to secure greater economy and efficiency in all its branches . Congress could never undertake such a colossal task . It could only be carried out by a distinct department devoted to the organization of the public service , and to that alone . The task of unravelling the accumulated blunders and mismanagements of several generations is not an easy one . It requires the cooperation of the best minds of the country , but could only be well done by a few well-chosen men devoting themselves exclusively to this work . A great number of men , such as are congregated in Congress , could only make the confusion worse *onfounded , by each one urging pet schemes mixed up with political considerations -- fatal to a work which is purely one of administrative science and organization . Millions on millions are at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publish . Apart from the demoralization diffused by the present system of appointing political mercenaries , without regard to capacity and integrity , it entails upon the people fearful losses in the shape of frauds and uncollected revenues , and an extravagant expenditure in subsidizing the prot*g*s of legislative and executive officers . This consideration can not fail to have weight even with those who regard the infusion of culture in the public service as incompatible with the rude impulses of a rough-and-tumble democracy . But those who hold this last-mentioned opinion are doing great inj ustice to great numbers of our young men , who are deterred from entering the public service , because , under the present circumstances , a political price seems to be set upon ignorance , while rascality is far from being regarded as a disqualification . The contemplated reform would , moreover , react upon the very fountain-heads of education , and from the moment that the civil service becomes a career , the presidents of our universities , colleges , and schools would awaken to the necessity of giving greater prominence to those studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at present , are not practically pursued from a professional point of view . We have chiefly referred to those great departments of Washington which need most the axe of the reformer . It is hardly necessary to speak of the New York Custom-house . It is a most awful concern , with a dark history , and a perfect hotbed of sinecures . A good and honest man appointed to it , after the withdrawal of Hiram Barney , was soon found in the East iRiver , with stones round his neck  --  a fit emblem of the burden that had fastened upon his distracted soul . It is a place full of tragedy and full of farce . It is probably the only custom-house in the world which also serves the purpose of a political penitentiary and partisan lazaretto . No one man should be entrusted with the control of such an unfathomable abyss of corruptioa . Half a dozen custom-hquses , the directors respectively under the control of a minister of finance or commerce in Washington , would probably do infinitely less harm than the present one-man-power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tormented spirit between the White House , the Trcasury , Foreign Missions , and incidentally the Custom-house  --  a profitable customer , at any rate , for railroads and hotels . Custom-houses , surveyorships , and naval port offices all over the country , are all more or less " rotten boroughs . " On certain occasions whole gangs of men are ejected , and new recruits enlisted . Such are the contrivances by which demagoguery saps morality and drags polities into the mire of venality . What is needed on certain occasions , are a great number of votes , so as to turn the scale upon the partisan adversary ; and lo ! all of a sudden , hundreds of men , many of whom are hard-working , and have large families to support , are thrown destitute upon the streets like so many leprous dogs , to make place for new and more serviceable recruits , who , on some future occasion , are to be ejected in the same brutal manner . As usual , the ernelty of the demagogue strikes most remorselessly the poorest and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so they tell as voters , though they are treated as if they were unworthy to be men . No doubt , there will still be imperfections and blemishes in our public service in ages hence , after our present system has been purged of some of its most hideous and revolting features . We dare also say , that all which is bad in our system looks still worse than it is , because every thing in this country comes to the surface in all its unsophisticated nakedness , and is not glossed over , as in older and more subtle and hypocritical civilizations , by all sort and manner of artifices . But nothing can explain away that which is intrinsically and irretrievably bad , and all good citizens should cry , " Shame ! " upon each and every politician who , for selfish purposes of his own , opposes and baffles the reformatory measures now pending before Congress . Heaven knows that they are wide of the mark . They only touch a few springs of a vast and complex machinery of evil , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . To withhold assent from these bills because they do not remedy all the evils , would be as wise as to decline medical assistance for one disease , because there are other diseases in the body for which it does not also afford remedy . We have not yet spoken of the State Department . It presents a sense of unity which is due to its peculiar functions , and transacts its vast business with a smallness of forces which is creditable to it , and shows how much more is to be achieved by a small force harmoniously employed , than by large forces scattered over unwieldy and chaotic organizations . In respect to the consular ser.vice , how ever , the Department indulges in the erroneous belief that it is self-supporting . The fact is , that the fee raised upon the certificates of exporters is a tax upon commerce which the consumer has to pay . If the fee were one hundred dol // lars for each certificate of an invoice of goods , the consular service might , upon the same theory , be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer nonsense . The fees exacted by consuls from exporters are , like all other fees , part of the revenue of the country ; and the salaries and contingent expenses of consulates are parts of the public expenditure . To represent it under any other light , is to claim a supernatural merit for the consular service . Since consuls are paid by the state , like all other public officers , there is nothing self-supporting in that service . If taxes are imposed upon commerce in the shape of fees upon consular certificates , for no other purpose than to make credulous Congressmen swallow the selfsupporting dodge , it is simply unfair to commerce , and somewhat savoring of duplicity . The question then simply is as to a proper adjustment of salaries , without regard to fees , and to have the accounts so adjusted as to have the fees go to the credit of the revenue , and the salaries and contingent expenses to the credit of the consular officers . A great number of consulates might advantageously be abolished ; and the system of appointing deputies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared by Mr. Patterson , of New Hampshire , provides for the manner of appointing consuls and ministers , and for the system of examination and promotion to be adopted . At present , consuls are virtually appointed by Congressional delegations . They urge them upon the Executive and the State Department , and attend to their confirmation in the Senate . In most instances these delegations know nothing of the man they recommend , except that he is recommended by somebody they know , and that the political church requires his nomination . After the nomination and confirmation have duly taken place , the new-fangled consul is informed by the Secretary of State of his good luck . The fellow jumps in the cars , and all of a sudden an altercation takes place between the doorkeeper of the State Department and VOL. rr. - l6 some rough-looking customer , who insists upon seeing the Boss , and claiming to have come all the way from Kankakee or Ashtabula to get " them " papers . The officials of the State iDepartmentsome of whom gravitate toward the Virginia and Maryland old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stolid placidity of the countrymen of Rip Van Winklegive to the new consul a rather chilling reception . Of course , lie is not admitted to the presence of the * who reserves himself for a few foreign ministers , and for cabinet meetings . He has about half a second 's interview with Fred . Seward , who , with a smile of imperturbable sweetness , hands him over to one of the gentlemen of the office , who hands to the consul a handsomelybound volume , which contains the consular regulations . Very soon after this episode , a flaming article appears in the Li6erty Belt or Bungtown Bugler , announcing the fact that " the lion . Jeremiah Napoleon Ezekiel Jupiter Jones , so eminently popular in this district , and remarkable for his diplomatic talents , has arrived at Washington ; had a lengthened interview with the Secretary of State , who gave him official instructions of the highest importance , and then departed in hot haste for his post of destination , it being rumored that on his way to Saurkrautenthal he is to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the meanwhile , Jones passes a miserable evening at the Seaton House , in a most unsatisfactory tte-d-t*te with his " instructions . " The book which the gentleman of the State Department handed him with such a bland smile , simply contains the general consular regulations applying to all countries of the world , and without any particular reference to the particular duties which he may have to fulfil in the particular place to which he is particularly appointed . He soon gives the book up in despair , but has the happy inspiration to buy a " Bradshaw . " After having discovered the latitude and longitude to which he is assigned , he is next seen stalking about with a most // consequential air on the deck of one of the cheap Inman steamers . He is never again seen at the State Department . All they know is , that he rcgularly draws for his salary , and occasionally he copies , from one of the local papers of the place in which he resides , extracts of commercial statistics , with great flourish of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If any language exceptin* the Aslitabula or Kankakee dialect is spoken at the post of his destination , he holds himself rather " aloof " from society . He is generally taken for an Aboriginate American , and sticks to his post through thick and thin , until , one day , Brown steps in , and says : " Jones , you are smashed ! " Jones does a little swearing , invites Brown to take a drink , picks up his traps , and the next we hear of him is through our old friend the Liberty Bell or Bungtown Bugler , in the following strain : " We are happy to announc* the safe return to this district of the Hon. Jeremiah Napoleon Ezekiel Jupiter Jones , from his mission to Saurkrautenthal . After having spent several years abroad , he speaks , of course , the different languages of Europe , and has had access to the most exclusive circles of the nobility and gentry , and is versed in all the arts of the statesman and the diplomat . Our best citizens paid their respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his quarters at the Tomahawk House , where , with his wonted urbanity , he treated his friends to a handsome supper . We may add , that the honorable gentleman is proposed as the member in the seventyfifth Congressional district , the intention being , in the event of his election , to make him chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations , for which post he is so pre-eminently fitted by his familiarity with the history and laws and systems of foreign nations . " - The so-called Consular Commercial Reports are printed , in extracts , in volumes annually presented to Congress . In 1868 , the merchants , manufacturers , and industries of the United States are faithfully informed in these reports what their chances were in the sphere of enterprise in 1865 or 1866 . If , at the time of the receipt of these reports , the commercial world had been informed of the cultivation of certain roots , or the progress of certain crops , or the invention of certain new models and patterns , in one or the other country , some advantage might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have achieved some practical result . But by the time they reach the parties whose interests are affected thereby , the reports have become fiat , stale , and unprofitable . The commercial and industrial facts to which the reports refer have then become things of the past , and lost all practical value and interest . It is overlooked that the consular , like all other public departments , are only agencies for the promotion of the public interest , to be sure , invested with specific functions , but yet utterly failing in their mission if they neglect to take every possible opportunity to further the commerce and industry of the country . While this should be the principal aim , and the routine-work with sailors ' certificates , passports , and the estates of deceased Americans , only an accessory , nothing is generally done with any degree of ability or system , excepting the indispensable routine labor *f the office , which must be done . Probably this will continue to be the case as long as the consular service is controlled by the State Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministry of commerce , as is the case in many European countries . Under the present circumstances , consuls do little or nothing for the promotion of commerce . At a stated annual period they are called upon to make a report to the State Department , and in most cases their mental activity finds its climax in this annual report , and which , moreover , is gener* lly copied from other reports , and but rarely the result of painstaking , original , and exhaustive investigation . By raising the character and qualifications of consuls , as proposed in the Patterson bill , it is probable that a better class of men will devote themselves // to this branch of the public service , and make it , as it ought to be , an auxiliary to the commerce and industry of the country . As regards diplomatic posts , the country has been rather fortunate , since the accession of Mr. Lincoln , in 1861 , when Mr. Motley was sent to Vienna , Mr. Marsh to Italy , Mr. Adams to London , Mr. Dayton to Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places the s4ections were less felicitous , and Mr. Motley has been ousted from Vienna . Mr. Dayton is dead , and Mr. Dix is at present at his place ; and , to make up for the temporary withdrawal of Motley , at Vienna , we have Mr. Bancroft at Berlin , Dresden , and Munich . Within the last year Admiral Farragut has , in reality , been the principal American representative at the European courts . It is surprising that naval commanders are not permanently invested , in . times of peace , with foreign missions . They generally make an admirable impression abroad , and , as has been shown by Commodore Perry , in Japan , succeed in the most delicate missions when civilians generally fail . There is something upright and straightforward in a sailor 's bearing and address , which inspires confidence , and the very magnetism of his simplicity acts as a tacit rebuke toward those American diplomatists who make themselves ridiculous by attempting to mimic the worn-out style of diplomatic craft and mummery . Some of our foreign ministers are excessively sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for them sumptuous dinners , and try to make themselves all things to all men and to all women . But , lo ! no sooner have they caused to be inserted in the official gazette of the capital to which they are accredited , that his excellency , Mr. 8- , or Mr. II- , has returned , from his leave of absence , to his post of duty , at his palace in the Avenue des Snobs , than a complete change takes place in their attitude and deportment . They cut everybody excepting the Duchess of Superfine , whose salons are considered inaccessible to everybody cisc . Their American excellencies are accordingly shunned by all really wJl-bred people . Enamored while at home , with all the excesses of the wildest social levelling , they are enamored as soon as they are abroad , with all the excesses of the most silly social pretensions . They actually belittle , by their sneakish manners , the great country whose strength is the only bulwark of their position . Instead of making European people feel how much grandeur there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rank , as if they were thankful even for being snubbed by a duke . Those who have a genuine regard for the genuine gentlemen and ' gentlewomen of America , can not but feel sickened at the sight of these sycophants ; and to think that some of these miserable creatures are ministers , is positively revolting . Fortunately , their number is very limited ; but if there is only one of them in the whole list of the United States ministers , he should be removed , as if he were a felon . He really brings more discredit upon the American name than a downright rascal . With the exception of London , Paris , Berlin , Madrid , Florence , St. Petersburg , and Constantinople , Brazil , China , Japan , Mexico , Chili , Peru , foreign issions are altogether superfluous , and most of them are more or less sinecures . The Minister to Holland might be also accredited to Belgium ; the Minister to Spain to Portugal ; Sweden and Norway to Denmark ; and in South America , five missions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present twenty missions . Mr. Patterson 's report will no doubt make appropriate suggestions for the greater retrenchment and efficiency of the diplomatic service . While we sent some of our best men abroad , as Everett , Motley , Bancroft , etc. , foreign governments are still treating this country de haut en bas , by accrediting to Washington second and third-rate diploniiatists . While we send a first-class mission to England , England sends only a second-class mission to the United States , such as she would // not send to France or Russia , or even Austria . Napoleon sent the consul of New York as minister to Washington , and then he sends a gentleman who had never been in any foreign mission , excepting , for a short time , in China , and whom he would not send to London or to Berlin . No greater compliment can be paid by one nation to another , thQn by selecting a representative from the most illustrious citizens ; and in this respect America is still treated gingerly by foreign powers , as if she still were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful nation of Christendom . We have no doubt there will be more discrimination in future in regard to the confirmation of foreign ministers . By reserving foreign missions for the bestcultured men of the country , and by making ministers give more comprehensive reports of and take a more lively part in the resources of foreign countries , and of their own country , the sinecures , and dining out , and gala element which now pervade , more or less , all foreign missions , might at last find an invigorating , counteracting influence . The reforms to which we have pointed , all-important as they were at all stages of our history , are particularly so at the present time , when the Southern members return to Congress , and clamor for their share in offices , and when the new cyclus of States clustering round the slope of the Pacific assert more and more their supremacy in the control of patronage upon what they call the decayed old Atlantic States ; just as some of our Atlantic publicists speak of the effete old European countries .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
