txt GEN . FREMONT 'S PROCLAMATION CONCERNING SLAVEs. ? Some question has been raised as to the law of Congress under which Gen. FREMONT 'S proclamation concerning the slaves of rebels , was issued . So far as we understand the matter , Gen. FREMONT 'S declaration goes somewhat beyond the letter of any law Which has been enacted on this subject . The law ) f Congress , passed Aug. 6 , provides that any property which may be employed in aiding the rebellion shall be " lawful subject of prize and capture wherever found , "  --  and shall be " seized , confiscated and condemned . " It further provides that , whenever " any person held to service or labor under the law of any State shall be required or permitted to be employed upon any fort , ship , intrenchment , or other military work against the Government . of the United States , " in every such . case , " the person to whom such service or labor is claimed to be due shall fo  --  feit his claim to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary notwithstanding . " This is the provision of Congress on this subject . It is very guarded in its terms , and relates exclusively to slaves that may be employed in the rebellion . Gen. FREMONT 'S language is much more comprehensive . He says. ! " The property , real and personal , of all persons in the State of Missouri who shall take up arms against the United States , or who shall be directly proven to have taken active part with their enemies in the field , is declared to be confiscated to the public use , and their slaves , if any they have , are hereby declared free men . ' ' This is a forfeiture of all the property of men engaged in the rebellion ,  --  and proclaims the freedom of all their slaves , whether they have been employed in the work themselves or not .
