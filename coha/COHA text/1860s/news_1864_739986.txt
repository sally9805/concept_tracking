txt As they say in the programme of the plays , " an interval is supposed to have elapsed ; " that an interval has elapsed since my last is a fact , and such accidents are liable to occur . I do n't mean that my excuse is similar tethat of the chap who apologized for not being oh hand the day he promised to marry a young lady ; be had been " unavoidably detained , " and proved it by the Sheriff who had detained him . I expect there are any number of young ladies waiting who will wonder if it is:the Sheriff 's that ' s the matter , and hope it may be no worse . In my last I promised to give you Some , items upon the mining interests , and especially the Mariposa Fremont mine ; but I have a splitting headache to-day , and the subject is one that requires figures , and statistics and a headache do n't go well together . I will say this , however , that all the charges of fraud and swindling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did just what every man does who has an article to sell , put it in as favorable a light as they . could , and made it as attractive an investment as possible , ? and if the New York capitalists consider themselves done slightly brown , let them bear in mind the fact that they did not purchase the mine on the representations of the sellers ; but alter examination of books and statistics , and upon the report and judgment of their own engineers and experts . Ati for the Garrison claim or title , they had an opportunity of learning all about that , it being both a matter of record and history . The claim was originally a foreclosure and sale under judgment , and the . Sheriff 's deed passed into the hands of MARK BRUMMAGEM , a banker here , and agent for the parties . This deed Mr. BRUMMAGEN offered to surrender at any moment on being paid the cost of same , with ordinary interest , and the . matter so remained . It was urged repeatedly that this deed constituting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but , although fully warned , . no heed was paid to it , and after every effort was made by Mr. BRUMMAGKN to get his money , they refused to reimburse him , and in due time , he sold it to C. K. GARRISON , who now , I believe , holds it in terrorem over the stockholders , unless it is settled , of whi ch we have no news here . There was no attempt on the part of Mr. BRUMMAGEN , or any one else to blackmail the . estate , and on the contrary , Mr. B. exercised a forbearance beyond what could be expected from any business man in the community . Mr. GARRISON , I think , purchased it as he would anything else that promised a profit , and if he do n't make a good sound operation out of it , his early education must have been neglected , but . I do n't think it was ; and there are plenty who do n't perceive any great deficiency in his Daboll . The mine is now being worked under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rumors are that it do n't pay  --  very possibly . I know a great many really good mines that do n't . Every mine has its sunshine and clouds , and for months are worked at a loss , but afterwards , when the poorer rock is removed , the pay streaks appear again , and all goes on smoothly , and the almanac might read , " look for dividends about these days . " Again , it is no easy matter for a new man to step in without any experience in the mines of California , and work successfully , for their character sets all theory at fault , and it is only by experience and close observation that the way and how to do it can be arrived at . It is no disparagement to the competency and ability of Mr. OLMSTED to say that it is a great deal easier for him to lose money for a time than to work this great mine profitably , but that he will eventually do it I do not doubt , as its character is more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. OLmSTIED will get to be an experienced California miner , and discover where the little joker lies . It seems to be both customary and common to lay all swindling in stocks and mines to Californians , and they are sneered at singly and collectively as a separate and distinct race of beings , partaking of the characteristics of the country last from , and are set down as unreliable , uncertain and " blowy . " Would it not be better to ask where they got their educations ? California , being but fifteen years old , as many say , is scarcely entitled to the credit of rearing the body denoted " Californians . " I think it will be found that many of the sharpest got their finishing touches in Wall-street . They were born somewhere outside of California and came here from somewhere . BILLY MULLIGAN , for instance , is not indigenous to the country . New-York must claim WILLIAM ; who , by the way , has been illustrating the code again by fighting a six-shot duel up country with a man named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BILLY , no doubt , would like very much to pop at on account of the affectionate reminiscences of the Vigilance Committee . Tho duel is question was fought according to the mles of the code , was witnessed by some two hundred people , including the county officials way up in Idaho , I believe , and the only regret expressed was that neither were killed . WILLIAM is " onto.it , " and " plucky WILLIAM " should be his soubriquet  --  but to return to my mutton . I was about to inquire how far and , to what extent the good people of Wall-streetliave been shocked by the doings of ** Have . they got it bad ? Do n't Californians , pay their debts generally , and in gold at that ? Have they not a right to " spend their , money free , " as George Christy says . I remember seeing a fling in one of the New-York papers ire Californian because he presumed to own fast horses , and drive on the road where such men as Mr. Vanderbilt aired themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was polished off with the term " California adventurer . " Now I happen to know that the gentleman named made his money , or a large start , at least , . in legitimate business , and while in business no man was more industrious or attentive . When his time came to play . he went in for having a'good time , and no matter how many fast horses he indulged in , as long as he owed nobody ; It is safe to say you will take it if on investigation you find that the facts justify his opinion . There is nothing personal there , you see , and it lets him down easy . Any man thinking of investing had better write to some friend in San Francisco first , and await his report , and be sure that friend do n't own a little stock . himself , which he would part with it urged . It is a very difficult thing to find a man in California that is not the owner of a more or less number of shares in mines . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could not fire into a crowd without killing two or three Pre ' dents and Directors . I fought against ho re for a whole year  --  swore I would n't be an officer of any mining company  --  but it was US2-less . I went ont of town for a few days , and on my return found . myself President of fourteen Companies and Director of thirty-six others . No man escapes  --  lawyers , doctors and divines are all in . The man that saws your wood , your groom , your cook , your nurse  --  all own a remarkable number of feet in still more remarkable mines , and in unheard-of locations . The vocabulary of names is nearly used up . There are mines for every General ever nominated . All the stars have been exhausted ; Heathen mythology has been impoverished  --  all the cities of the Union , all the Spanish names , and they Lave had to come down to individual names . I halt seen notices for the stockholders in the " Wooley Horse , " " green Monster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pay assessments . The last two remarkable narnesl , being the " Sweet Vengeance Gold and Silver Mining Company , " and the " Fool Catcher " Copper Company . There 's leo sense in the latter name  --  but I can fully appreciate the vindictive feelings with which the discoverer named the former " claim . " He had been done brown himself prolubly , and he saw his good time coming , when he was going to take sweet revenge on mankind by selling them the stock . He could scarcely wish them any greater misfortune than to own it . Some day it may be quoted at a thousand a foot ; nobody is safe ; you are liable any day to wake up and hear that they have " struck it rich " in the " Mary Ann " or some other magnificent investment of yours . The duce of it is , the Irish dividends , that nearly ruin a fellow . Once a month regularly an assessment is levied to sink a shaft or run a tunnel , until a fellow is harassed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , reading your papers , sitting in your arm-chair waiting for you . They are smart ; you are the worm and they the early birds . Every man you meet has a pocket full of rocks , and the chances are that you ca n't sit down in a car without plumping on to some fellow 's coat tail containing " specimen rock " from his claim , or , if a broker , samples to sell by  --  and the chances are , that your respect for him will cause you to rise suddenly , for it is my experience that the sharp corners of pieces of Washoe ore are not comfortable as a permanent seat . There are some good mines , and four thousand that are good for nothing , but if one out of a hundred prove worth working , we can continue to make our regular remittances for a great many years to come . I find the major portion of this 1 letter is bound to be about miners and mines , and I must defer further comments until my next , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a great many more that are not . As a general thing , I own lots of stock in all the poor ones , and none in the good ones , therefore I hope I shall get credit for performing a melancholy duty when I cry down my own wares . I dropped in at the operklast evening , and when Ilooked around at the splendid house , the handsome women and Dundreary whiskers , the kids and the splendid toilettes , the beaver-tail hair arrangement , I exclaimed mentally what a shame that we can not have an opera troupe worthy of the audience . For five nights the house has been crammed just to hear one new voice , Sig . GRIM , who arrived here recently from New York or somewhere else . " La Scala of Milan " in the bills always . Good gracious , what a great responsibility rests upon that same institution for the hundreds it sends forth to pass their greenback notes for the . simon pure metal that rings , ( excuse the unpatriotic sentiment on currency ; I sold a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm " techy " on it . ) Well , never mind . Tls new arrival , this one woman , a new broom , with the old dust brushes only to aid her , has sung five nights to $2,000 houses , and continues so to do . She sings pretty well : we have had few better , many worse ; but it only shows the hunger and thirst of this community for opera , and yet no one here or in New-York has the courage to attempt it . I do n't know AIARETZEK , but I had an idea of writing to him about it , until I heard he was an extravagant dog , and that expensive style of opera wo n't do . We want a small troupe , ? well managed and new operas . We do n't want incongruous elements , but harmony , as near as it can be arrived at in an opera , coutoallY , do n't want anybody to aet rattles 0 be suddenly indisposed , but about four sensible people , who do n't want all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't expect to get ten times more than they ever received in places of ten times the number of people to support an opera ; but we will give them dollar for dollar , all they can get anywhere or ever did get , for a season . We want a troupe for four months , to sing two and perhaps three evenings in a week . We want a leader who has the scores of all the new operas  --  our leaders here are competent , but have not the new music . I do n't suppose we could afford the first-class artists ; they put on too many airs and get colds most inconveniently for the interests of the manager ; but about four good voices belonging to people that could not afford the influenza .
