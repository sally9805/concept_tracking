txt ART . VIII . - The Law of Freedom and Bondage in the United States . By JOHN CODMAN HURD , Counsellor at Law . In two volumes . Boston : Little , Brown , &amp; Co. ; New York : D. Van Nostrand. 8vo. pp. 617 , 800 . Tnis is a remarkable work , not only for thorough research , wide range of investigation , exhausting discussion , and general ability , but for the singularly unimpassioned tone in which it treats of the most exciting topic of the age . Slavery takes the strongest hold alike upon the moral senses and the sympathetic emotions of mankind . The unwarped and unperverted conscience pronounces it a gigantic injustice , and the heart of humanity is sorely pained by the sufferings which flow from it , however fully the understanding may recognize the practical difficulties which lie in the way of removing it , or however faithfully the reflecting patriot may respect the constitutional defences which have been thrown around it . No one can wonder that those in whom the sympathetic and emotional elements are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its existence , should acknowledge no limits to the responsibility which it imposes upon freemen to labor for its removal , and should take no heed of the obstacles // lying in their path , whether from the nature of things or from the character of the institutions under which we live . But Mr. Hurd treats the subject of slavery as dispassionately as Mr. Fearne has treated the subject of contingent remainders . He looks at it through a simple achromatic glass , which neither colors nor magnifies . He resolutely thrusts aside all considerations flowing from the passions and the affections . He is as unimpassioned as a chemist analyzing a mourner 's tear , or a physiologist explaining a lover 's blush . He neither denounces nor declaims : he has no benedictions for those who agree with him , and no maledictions for those who differ from him . We have no reason to believe that the tone of the book arises from want of sensibility in the author ; we doubt not that Mr. Hurd has as keen a perception of the evils of slavery as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his intellectual training has been such as enables him to put aside his emotions and sympathies when he has resolved to do so , and to investigate his subject exclusively by the dry light of the understanding . It is not that he feels less , but that he thinks more . The judicial temper of his book is the more remarkable , when we remember that Mr. Hurd is still a young man , - a fact which also increases our respect for its thoroughly conscientious spirit and the various and profound learning which it shows . Mr. Hurd 's love of truth amounts almost to a passion ; and this characteristic , which we find stamped upon every page of his work , gives a certain moral charm to its gravest and driest discussions . Mr. Hurd 's general method of treatment , his wide range of research , his fondness for abstract discussion , and his somewhat extreme love of divisions and distinctions , show the influence which the writers and thinkers of Germany have had in the formation and growth of his mind . His treatise belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public in Germany than in our own busy and practical country , where we want results without the processes by which they have been reached . The scholars of that land could not fail to greet with peculiar satisfaction a writer who shows so marked an intellectual affinity with them , and whose book is SO honorably distinguished for the German qualities of patient 13* // investigation , methodical structure , and noble indifference to popular effect . But though Mr. Hurd shows the influence of Germany in the training of his mind , yet the spirit of his work , its point of view , and the order in which the topics are evolved , are rather Anglican than German . His method is more inductive than deductive . He belongs to the historical school , so called , which recognizes an inevitable connection between the present and the past , and maintains that forms of government and political institutions are the results of laws as imperative as those which bid the rose-bush bear roses . We can imagine that the work grew by successive steps , somewhat after this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confederate commonwealth , made up of thirty-four single commonwealths , with the attributes and functions of sovereignty apportioned between the whole and the parts . Of these single commonwealths , fifteen were slaveholding and nineteen were non-slaveholding . The apportionment of the functions and attributes of sovereignty was made by an organic law called the Constitution , - the expression of the will of the aggregate or collective people . The subject of slavery is included in this Constitution , and a copious range of inquiry and discussion is necessitated in order to the mere construction of those clauses of the Constitution which touch upon it . But this is not all . Slavery is older than the Constitution , and independent of it . At the time of the formation of the Constitution , slavery existed in nearly every State of the confederation . The States are older thait the Constitution . Hence arises another class of questions as to slavery upon this continent anterior to , and independent of , the Constitution , - its origin , the legal ground on which it rested , and consequently a consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as an examination of its judicial recognition in Europe generally . The legislation of the several States upon the subject of slavery , and in regard to the African race , forms another branch of inquiry purely historical . The work is divided into three parts or divisions , the first // being the elementary or abstract portion , contained in the first and second chapters ; the second , the historical portion , contained in the third and following chapters , to the eleventh , inclusive ; and the third , the practical portion , contained in the remaining chapters of the work . Of the first and second chapters a few copies were published in advance of the work , under the title of " Topics of Jurisprudence connected with Conditions of Freedom and Bondage , " a title which points out , with sufficient distinctness , the range of discussion and inquiry embraced in them . Mr. Hurd begins by distinguishing the primary and secondary meanings of the word law . In its primary sense , it is a rule of action , prescribed by a superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a mode of existence or action . When we speak of the law of primogeniture , we use the word in its former sense ; when we speak of the law of gravitation , we use it in the latter . Jurisprudence is the science of a rule enforced by the will of a state or sovereignty . Questions relating to the nature of man - the law of his being , in the secondary sense of the word law - come under the province of ethics . The rules of action prescribed by any single sovereignty or state are called national , or municipal law . They have effect only within the territorial limits of its dominioii . But from the fact that men are under the jurisdiction of different states , and that the effects of municipal laws can not be confined within the territorial limits of each state , there arises a branch of law called international law , or the law of nations . Municipal law and international law are both subdivided into two portions , public and private . Public municipal law is that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bounds , and purposes within its own limits ; private municipal law is that which determines , within the limits of a state , the relations of persons towards one another in all the incidents of the social state . Public international law is that which concerns the mutual relations of sovereign states as such ; private international law determines the relations of individuals towards other national authorities or jurisdictions than that with which they are primarily associated as subjects . Public international law is not law in its // primary sense of a rule imposed by a superior , having a right to command , upon an inferior , who is bound to obey , inasmuch as the mutual independence of nations precludes the idea of superiority or inferiority . It is a rule , or body of rules , of moral obligation , resting upon the general consent of civilized humanity . International law , as applied by the judicial tribunals of any state , is to be distinguished from the municipal law of that state only in the nature of the relations which it affects : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all persons within the jurisdiction of the state . This is a point on which Mr. Hurd especially insists , and a principle which he repeatedly enforces . Whenever one sovereignty gives effect to the law of another sovereignty , it is by virtue of a law on the part of the former . For instance , England regulates by law the contract and condition of marriage within its own territory ; but suppose a man and woman residing in England go to Scotland , there contract marriage , by forms which are valid in Scotland but not in England , and then return to England , the recognition or non-recognition of such marriage is entirely within the autonomic sovereignty of England . The law of Scotland on this head can have no proper force out of its own territory . If England adopts and recognizes such marriage , it is by virtue of her own law , - a law flowing from the same source , and enforced by the same sanction , as that hy which she regulates marriage between her own subjects on her own soil . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generated - are the same in municipal and international law . First and most authoritative is direct legislation , the distinct enunciation of the will of the state through its lawful and constitutional organs . But a considerable portion of the rules which regulate the relations of men in civil society are not the result of direct legislation , - are not statute law . They are the gradual growth of time . They form what is designated customary law . This is created , in the lapse of years , by the judicial tribunals which expound the law in a given case . Such was the origin of the common law , so called , in England and America . The tribunals do not make or create the // custom : they merely recognize it as existing . First comes the custom , and then the judicial enunciation , or exposition , of it . Custom is the effect of law , and not the cause of it . If jurisprudence is taken to be the science of law , in the strict and proper sense of the word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But since the jurisprudence of each state recognizes natural reason as a rule of intrinsic force , and in its muncipal and international law applies that reason to the unalterable conditions of human existence , thus recognizing the law of nature , in the primary and secondary senses of the word law , it follows that some principles will be found to be the same in the law of many different states . These principles may be judicially considered as founded on the necessary conditions of human existence , and as being natural principles in the jurisprudence of any one country ; not only because recognized by the national law , but because founded on the general reasoning of men living in the social state . They form a general or universal jurisprudence , so called because they are found among all civilized and enlightened nations . The Roman jurists employed the term jus g'entium , law of nations , to designate legal principles having this general extent . This is to be carefully distinguished from ( public ) international law , jus inter gentes , which is *f comparatively modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late English writers to designate these principles , corresponding to the jus gentium of the Roman jurists . These principles are inevitable deductions from the law of humanity itself . Municipal law recognizes various forms of servitude and bondage . No subject of a state is entirely and absolutely free ; but there are various degrees of restraint . Feudal slavery confines the person to a particular locality and a subordinate range of action . Caste is a limitation of liberty operating upon a certain and defined class of persons . But slavery in its popular sense , or chattel-slavery , is that condition of a natural person in which , by the operation of law , the application of his physical and mental powers depends , as far as possible , upon the will of another who is himself // subject to the supreme power of the state , and in which he is incapable , in the view of the law , of acquiring or holding property , and of sustaining those relations out of which relative rights proceed , except as the agent or instrument of another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state , in ignoring the personality of the slave , ignores his capacity for moral action , and commits the control of his conduct as a moral agent to his master . There are three maxims in international law which are of universal reception , and are thus axiomatic principles of universal jurisprudence . The first of these is : The power of every state or nation is absolute , self-dependent , and supreme , within that space or territory which it possesses or occupies as its own domain , and over all persons and things therein . The second is : The sovereign power of one state or nation is not to be recognized as sovereign , or has no existence as such , beyond its own domain or territory , or within the space or territory which constitutes the domain of another possessor of national sovereignty . These two maxims are laws in the secondary sense only ; they are not properly rules of action , but statements of a mode of existence or of action . They are maxims of universal law , and lie at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The laws of one nation or state may , by the consent or allowance , and therefore under the authority , of the supreme national power in another nation or state , have the effect of law within the jurisdiction of the latter . This maxim is the statement of a relation or condition only , and therefore , like the first and second , a law in the secondary sense of the word law . Status , or personal condition , consists in the possession of individual rights , and is always , at any one time , under the legislative power of some one state . The status of a natural person can become a question of private international law only when such person is living under a certain jurisdiction , with a status or condition created under and by force of another jurisdiction within which he formerly lived . Shall the state in which such person is domiciled recognize and enforce the relations created by a state in which he was formerly domiciled ? This is a question coming within the scope of the // autonomous sovereignty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a state may or may not recognize those relations , as it pleases . The tribunal which is called upon to determine any particular question of this kind must ascertain the will of the state . If there be positive legislation , that of course is authoritative and decisive ; but , in the absence of that , the tribunal must ascertain the will of the state by reference to those standards of natural reason which have , by anterior judicial recognition , and the implied sanction of the sovereign power whose will they execute , acquired the authority of law . The laws of other states are recognized as having a jural character ; and , as a consequence of this recognition , the state will also recognize and support foreign laws , and their effects upon persons and things coming within its dominion , when those laws are not contrary to the rule of right contained in the municipal or internal law . This is the true source and reason of the rule called comity . Judicial comity is , in fact , customary law . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribunals . The tribunal must compare the foreign law with the measure of right contained in the local law . Laws of different origin may produce similar effects , and these would everywhere be recognized and enforced . Laws of different oribin may produce dissimilar effects ; but these may be recognized and enforced partially , and with limitations and exceptions . Mr. Hurd thus states the simplest general principle of private international law applicable to the subject : That relations of persons and their constituent rights and obligations , existing under the law and jurisdiction of one state , are to be judicially admitted to international recognition ( that is , to be allowed to have legal effect ) within the jurisdiction of other states , when they are not inconsistent with those principles which , in the jurisdiction of the latter , are juridically known as principles of universal personal application and extent , or which the local law applies to all natural persons within its power and its territorial jurisdiction . Certain principles , from being constantly recognized by many different nations , will acquire , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal principles , or principles of universal jurisprudence . Having once acquired the // character of jural rules , in the jurisprudence of each state , by an inductive method , - from the fact of their general recognition ,  --  they become vital and germinating principles , from which consequences are to be deductively drawn . But the effects of universal jurisprudence within any particular state may be limited by laws having a universal personal extent within the territorial limits of such state . Especially may this be done by positive legislation . The law of legal capacity and personality lies at the foundation of private international law , as well as of private municipal law , and the relations of persons which constitute freedom or liberty , and slavery or bondage , may be a topic of international private law , as well as of municipal private law . Certain relations , such as those between husband and wife , parent and child , guardian and ward , are universally recognized , and form a part of universal jurisprudence . But conditioiis or relations not supported by universal jurisprudence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be recognized in countries where the local or municipal law recognizes all human beings as legal persons , with capacity for legal rights and duties , and attributes the right of personal liberty to every individual domiciled within the sphere of its sovereignty ; but it will be recognized in countries where such condition is known to the local law . But though slavery may not be recognized as lawful in any particular country , yet the relation may be recognized as having been lawful in the foreign country where it was formed , and the rights and obligations existing under the law of the domicile as between the master and third parties , in respect to the slave , may be recognized and maintained in the law of the forum . The above is an imperfect , though tolerably full , abstract of Mr. Hurd 's first two chapters , which , though introductory to the whole work , have something of the character of a separate and independent treatise . They are remarkable for thoroughness of discussion , careful accuracy of statement , nice distinction of principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research which the learned foot-notes show ; they reveal an uncommon power for the examination and exposition of juridical questions ; but so far as the reception of the // book is concerned , we can not but think it a little untoward , that , in this age of preoccupied minds and rapid movement , the reader should encounter upon the threshold more than a hundred pages of such abstract discussion . There is something of mathematical closeness in the vigor of Mr. ilurd 's reasoning ; every paragraph requires fixed and concentrated attention , and if a single stitch be dropped , the continuity of the web is broken . There are but few minds , comparatively , that have the athletic training and the patient tenacity of grasp which such studies require . Mr. liurd has a very accurate mind , and his statements are elaborately and painfully careful ; but he is deficient in the power of illustration , and this is an important want in a writer who deals with juridical topics . Illustrations in works of this class may be compared to fountains by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey , but they refresh the traveller , and prevent him from fainting by the way . The second part of the book , commencing with the third chapter and closing with the eleventh , contains an historical examination of the law of status , or personal condition . From the earliest instances of the political annexation of foreign territories to the dominion of the British crown , there has been much dispute in English jurisprudence respecting the personal extent of the laws of England in reference to such territories ; but the American doctrine always was , that the common law of England accompanied the English colonists as a personal law , and fixed their social and civil rights , as much as those of British subjects in England . During the colonial period , the extent of the common law of England , in determining the rights of the British-born colonists and their descendants in America , became generally recognized in matters of private law . Its operation , in determining the public rights of the colonists , was always a matter of controversy , settled at last by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England was which accompanied the British colonists in America as a personal law , it must be inquired whether , at the time of the settlement of the colonies , there were any principles of universal jurisprudence - any historical law of nations - affecting the // status or condition of natural persons , which , in England , could be judicially applied as part of the common law ; and , as preliminary to such inquiry , it must be ascertained what principles affecting natural persons in the relations of freedom or bondage under private law were judicially known as part of the historical law of nations at the time of the planting of the colonies , and the date of their charters . The Roman law is received by all publicists and jurists as the authoritative exposition of the principles of universal jurisprudence . In this sense , it has been the common law of the greater part of modern Europe . The authority of the Roman law does not rest , as is often loosely stated , upon its intrinsic merit as an exposition of natural reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman law regarded slavery as a condition recognized and maintained by the law of nations . In point of fact , it was a condition or status prevalent in every nation of antiquity , and universally consequent upon captivity in war . In other . words , it was a legal condition , universally recognized by the natural reason of mankind , so that , before describing the rights of persons , the Institutes begin with the simple declaration that human beings are either freemen or slaves . But the principles universally recognized , which comprise the law of nations , are susceptible of change . They are modified by the progress in material and moral civilization of which society itself is capable . But this change is not simultaneous among all nations . During the later period of the Roman empire , Christianity began to modify slavery , so that slavery was no longer attributable to universal jurisprudence ; and a similar effect was produced among the nations of Northern Europe . But Christianity introduced a new distinction into this subject . It made difference of religious creed a fouiidation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infidels and heathens was supported by universal jurisprudence . In the fifteenth century the holding of heathen negroes as slaves was so supported . The traffic in negro slaves was recognized by all the maritime nations of Europe . During the period within which the thirteen American colonies were founded , the // chattel slavery of Moors , Africans , and Indians was recognized as a part of universal jurisprudence . In this connection Mr. ilurd gives a brief abstract of the various reported cases in England upon the subject of slavery , down to Somerset 's case in 1772 . But the decision in that case did not affect the question of slavery in the colonies . This condition became established under the common law of the several colonies , which was a local law , distinct in origin , authority , and extent from that national common law which was in each part of the empire the common measure of the personal rights of English-born subjects . The colonial governments appear to have exercised without question an unlimited control over the condition of such persons of the Indiaii and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus there were two systems of personal laws in the colonies : one affecting English colonists and their descendants , and one affecting domiciled Africans and Indians ; but both rested upon like authority , and both were equally jural in their character . In the sixth chapter Mr. ilurd gives an extended statement of the legislation of the colonies , setting forth each statute and its date , with ample references to original authorities . This digest is prepared with great care , and will be found extremely convenient for reference and consultation . An examination is then made of the principles of international law ou the continent of Europe relating to freedom and bondage , and the conclusion is reached , that , at and before the date of the American Revolution , slavery had ceased to be recognized by the principles of universal jurisprudence , or the law of nations , and was not protected by the judicial tribunals of countries where it did not exist by local law . In this connection Mr. Hurd discusses the question how far the conversion of a heathen slave to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right of transit for owners of slaves , and as to the rules of comity affecting the rights of the owner and the obligations of the slave . The ninth chapter is principally devoted to an examination of Lord Mansfield 's decision in Somerset 's case . In Mr. Hurd 's view , the decision was right , upon the principles of // private international law as then existing ; but the reasons for it , as stated by Lord Mansfield , were not sound . It was an inconsistency to declare that the relation between the master and slave was unlawful in England , because contrary to natural justice , and at the same to admit that it was a legal relation in the colony . He also ignored the historical origin of negro slavery , when he declared it to rest upon statutes having a definite territorial extent in and for the plantations and the coast of Africa . Mr. Hurd thus states the true grounds on which the decision is sustained . " According to the principles herein before assumed , the true statement of the international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of nations - universnl jurisprudence - as then recognize dby European states , did not support his bond condition , whether it was chattel slavery or the bondage of a legal person . This condition had been created by the local law - jus proprium - of the colony in which he had been a domiciled inhabitant ; whether he had there been held as a chattel , or as a person bonnd to service or labor , was immaterial . The law of the foreign jurisdiction - the colony - was to be taken to be jural- a law of right - in and for the colony : its conscquences there were legal . But the law of England ( except as comprehendin* the law of nations - universal jurisprudence - if it then supported the slavery of heathen negroes ) attributed the right of personal liberty to all natural persons within its territorial jurisdiction , and enforced no dominion of one private person over another , except in the relations of the family ,  --  relations arising out of primitive and remedial law , and in some local districts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation of this kind existed between Somerset and his master . The law which attributed the so-called personal rights ' to the inhabitants of English birth ( except as modified by these relations ) had a universal personal extent in England , which prevented the operation of the principle of comity , since there was no statute or international custom by which these general principles could be himited. " - Vol . I. pp. 377 , 378 . By the American Revolution a new sovereignty became established . Previously to this change , the sovereignty had been held by the local governments , so far as it had not been exercised by the central imperial government . The aggregate people of the thirteen Colonies had no recognized political functions . But the Revolution was the act of the people col // lectively , and by it and through it the people of the United States assumed a national existence . Yet their corporate existence as the people of distinct States continued of necessity . The same integral nationality was manifested in the iRevolation , in the Confederation , and in the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States are equally original and sovereign in the hands of a political unity , called the people of the United States , as the sovereign powers not so granted and not prohibited to the several States are original in the possession of the people of the several States ; that is , the Constitution , as a political fact , is evidence of the investiture of certain sovereign national powers in the united people of the States , antecedently to the Constitution , as well as of the residue of sovereignty in the same people in their several condition of the people of distinct States . The power of the political people of the United States is independent of law and of the consent of individuals , and is unlimited or absolute in its natare . The Constitution of the United States is of a twofold nature , being both evidence of fact and a rule of action ; or , in other words , it is , first , a declaration of the location of sovereign power in the people of the United States as one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polities ; and , secondly , it is direct legislation , by the exercise of the sovereign powers held by the people of the United States as a political unity , taking the shape of either public or private law . Sovereignty is thus apportioned between the people of the United States and the people of the several States . In the determination of the law contained in the Constitution , the national judiciary is supreme , and for all private persons its decisions are the supreme criterion of law . But State sovereignty must be independent of judicial power , because it would be contradictory to say , that a State of the Unioii possesses sovereign powers as an independent State , if an external tribunal has the right to decide finally what those powers are . In their local sovereignty , the States are to one another like independent nations . In the United States there are two classes of aliens : foreign aliens , who are aliens to the whole country , like Englisinnen or Frenchmen , and domestic aliens , 14 * // who are aliens merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found . Each State may deal with domestic aliens as it pleases , so far as its powers are not limited or controlled by the Constitution of the United States . The private international law of the United States may be divided into international law applied to domestic aliens ,  --  those who , within the jurisdiction of a State , are alien to it , but not to the jurisdiction of the general government , - and international law applied to foreign aliens . The Constitution of the United States partakes of the nature of a bill of rights , and comprises limitations on the powers of the national government , as well as on the powers reserved to the States . The people spoken of in that instrument was recognized by it as previously existing , with certain defined rights . The private law of the Colonies was not abrogated by the Revolution . The Declaration of Independence was not intended to operate as private law ; and if it were , the Congress issuing it had no power to affect the status of persons , or to alter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of private persons , as such . Political liberty , as a personal right , is not determined by the Constitution of the United States , but by the local law of the several States . The Constitution of the United States is not a bill of rights , as against the States . The common law , so called , is local , and not national , though it is incidental to the exposition of the written national law ; and consequently it is alterable by the States . The determination of the civil condition , or status , of natural persons , belongs to the States exclusively , and is not included under the national branch of powers . Thus it is for the States to determine what individuals shall constitute " the people , " as spoken of in the Constitution . Herein there has been a change . The States have more power over status than the Colonies had ; for the common-law rights of Englishmen were established , by that law , for the white inhabitants , at least , of each Colony , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection , Mr. Third suggests , but declines to answer , a significant question . " Whether civil or social liberty has , in consequence of this political change , a better or a worse foundation in the present Unitcd States than in the former colonies of Great // Britain , is an inquiry which is not embraced in that legal view of the subject which is herein taken . " Under our system , there is an exercise , through appropriate tribunals , of judicial power by the national government and the States . But the limits of jurisdiction are not very accurately drawn , and in many things the national and State judiciaries have concurrent powers . State courts are often called upon to interpret and apply the Constitution of the United States and the laws made under it , and the national courts must sometiirnes do the like with State laws . But the national rule , when applied by State power , is local in territorial extent . The State judicial function is here subordinate to the national . The national judicial power can not be vested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here lays down certain rules or tests by which judicial functions may be discriminated from ministerial . In the sixteenth chapter , Mr. Hurd treats of the local municipal laws of the United States affecting conditions of freedom and its contraries , considered in connection with the principles of public and private law which have been stated in previous chapters . The corporate existence of the political people of a State is anterior to and independent of any law , and their possession of sovereignty is a fact above the national Constitution , and not under it . Political liberty in the States , regarded as a private right , depends altogether upon State law . State constitutions , like that of the United States , are both evidence of sovereignty and a rule of action . The States enjoy all the residuary powers not held by the national eoveminent . But these powers are limited and restrained , not merely by written constitutions , but by common-law principles and rules , which would have a restricting and controlling force in the absence of a written constitution , and are and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Personal status depends on State power , except as restrained by the international provisions of the Constitution . The power of the national government in the Territories is like that of a State government in the States . The power of Congress to determine whether slavery shall or shall not exist in a Territory of the United States was never // called in question till the decision of the Supreme Court in Dred Scott vs . Sandford , 19 Howard , 394 . In this case it was held by the majority of the Court that Congress has no power to abolish or prohibit slavery in the Territories of the United States . The main ground of the decision was , that the clause in the Constitution of the United States which provides that " no person shall be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law , " applies to slaves as property , or that , in reference to such guaranty , they are to be considered property . This particular point Mr. Hurd examines at some length , and with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power was supported by a majority of the Court , or by more than four of the judges . The Chief Justice , and Justices Wayne and Grier , adopting the opinion written by the Chief Justice , held that slaves are property by the national law , because rights of property in respect to them are specially recognized in the written Constitution , and also because slaves are property by common law , or an unwritten jurisprudence embraced in the national jurisprudence , independently of any specific recognition of slavery in the written Constitution . Mr. Justice Daniel appears to have relied exclusively on the clauses of the written Constitution referring to slaves . Mr. Justice Campbell and Mr. Justice Catron rested their conclusions on other grounds . Mr. Hurd denies that , in the Constitution , slaves are referred to as property by local law , or that slaves are property under national law . The Constitution recognizes that certain natural persons have rights over certain other natural persons , and by the State law these latter may be property , and not legal persons ; but it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a distinction between rights supported by a law of national authority and rights supported by a law having national extent . If the Chief Justice be correct , it would follow that , in the clauses of the Constitution in question , slaves are regarded as property throughout the entire dominion of the United States . The question of the proper interpretation of these clauses Mr. ilurd postpones to a later portion of his work . But , in a portion of the Chief Justice 's opinion , the broader // ground seems to be relied on , that the slaveholder 's right comes within the guaranty , because there is no difference between property in a slave and other property ; or perhaps the doctrine held may be thus expressed , - that there is no distinction in law , or in the jurisprudence which may be applied by the national judiciary , between rights of property in respect to slaves and rights in respect to slaves as property . This argument Mr. ilurd meets by an application of the doctrines laid down in a former part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as used in the *Constitution , is to be ascertained by known and recognized rules of interpretation ; and , in inquiring whether it means or may mean property in slaves , we must inquire whether such property is now , or was at the time of the adoption of the Constitution , sanctioned and enforced by the universal jurisprudence of all juridical nations , or a law of nations ; and both these questions must be answered in the negative . Property in human beings is not now , was not then , known to universal jurisprudence . It rests upon local common law , and not upon national common law . For many years before the Revolution , the condition of an American-born negro held in involuntary servitude , whether chattel slave or bond person , and the correspondent riohts of the master or owner , rested exclusively on the local b law - jus propriam- of some one Colony , and were not internationally recognized , in the several parts of the empire , as effects of universal jurisprudence . Mr. ilurd also examines the doctrines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this connection Mr. Hurd touches upon the confusion arising from want of precision in terms . Thus , the phrase " positive law " is sometimes used , and correctly used , to designate any rule which is made coercive by a state , and thus distinguishable from natural equity or natural justice ; but it is also sometimes used to designate statute law , or positive legislation , as distinguished from customary or unwritten law . So , too , jurists sometimes confound their own ideas of right with the conception of right furnished by the juridical history of the world , and , instead of assuming that certain principles are founded in natural reason because of their universal recog // nition , they reverse the process , and hold that certain principles ought to be generally received because conformable to their individual natural reason , - in other words , that a rule is not right because it is universal , but that , because it is right , it ought to be universal . In the concluding portions of the sixteenth chapter , Mr. Hurd presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in denying to Congress a legislative power over slavery in the Territories . The seventeenth , eighteeiith , and nineteenth chapters , comprising the first two hundred and eighteen pages of the second volume , are occupied with an historical or chronological abstract of the various legislative enactments in and for the several States and Territories of the United States , affecting personal condition or status , being a continuation of the abstract of the colonial laws having like effect , which was given in the sixth chapter . In this is also included a notice of those provisions of the several State constitutions which affect this topic of private law . This abstract , like that of the colonial legislation , is very carefully prepared , and contains the results of much patient and intelligent toil . In his twentieth chapter Mr. ilurd resumes the thread of his exposition , and partly restates and recapitulates the principles previously laid down , treating of the conditions under which private international law may exist in the United States . There are two political sources of the law prevailing in each State , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limits of the United States , while lie remains everywhere under the same national law , is always also under some particular or local subjection to a law proceeding from a State or local authority . Thus , as before said , aliens are of two classes , - foreign and domestic . The condition of all natural persons is primarily determined by the judicial will of the State , and international private law in each State rests on its several power . But an exception may have been created by provisions in the Constitution of the United States to the exercise of State power over aliens . According to Mr. ilurd 's view of the nature of the Constitution , every provision contamed in it which declares the rights and obligations of pri // vate persons , is of itself sufficient to give legal existence to those rights and obligations in the relation which they constitute ; but if the Constitution is to be considered the formulary of a federal compact between States , then these provisions would have the character of public international law only , resembling ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is place for international private law , because these clauses recognize the fact that there are certain powers of sovereignty vested in the States , which , except as by these clauses limited , are exercised independently , and affect the condition and relations of all persons within each State , as by its own local law . So far as the relations of foreign alien persons are not fixed by any provisions in the Constitution , the private international law determines their condition under the national or State jurisdiction respectively , only through its recognition and allowance by the government of the United States , or by the several States individually and wherever the relations of domestic aliens are undetermined by the Constitution , or by the legislation of Congress under it , they are determined by international law , as received and allowed by the source of the municipal ( local ) law there in . The rules regulating such relations may be drawn from a general international private law , founded on custom . The judicial allowance of any rules or maxims to have international effect in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be settled on this , among other considerations , - that a change of sovereignty abrogates in any State only those laws which are inconsistent with the new sovereignty . Hence , what was received as private international law between the Colonies would have the same effect now , unless changed by positive legislation ; and thus the general principles illustrated in the customary jurisprudence of the Colonies , together with the constitutional provisions and the legislation of Congress and of the several States , having either international or quasi international effect , constitute the private international law of the United States . According to the various extent of the powers held by the national government and the States , this international law will be either national or local law . But in its application // to persons , it may also be distinguished as either domestic international law , or foreign international law . The former is earlier in the order of historical development than the latter , and in the natural order its exposition precedes that of the latter . It has two principal divisions : the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the persons to whom it applies , is identified in its source and authority with the national municipal law , and is found either in the Constitution itself , operating as private law , or in the legislation of Congress under the Constitution ; and the second , that which , though international by the character of the persons to whom it applies , is identified in authority with some local municipal ( State ) law . The clauses in the Constitution which have the effect of private international law for the several States , by limiting or extending the operation of their respective local laws , are those contained in the first and second sections of the Fourth Article , as follows : - " SECTION I. 1 . Full faith and credit shall be given in each State to the public acts , records , and judicial proceedings of every other State . And the Congress may , by general laws , prescribe the manner in which such acts , records , and proceedings shall be proved , and the effect thereof . " " SECTION II . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States . " 2 . A person charged in any State with treason , felony , or other crime , who shall flee from justice , and be found in another State , shall , on demand of ' the executive authority of the State from which he fled , be delivered up , to be removed to the State having jurisdiction of the crime . " 3 . No person held to service or labor in one State , under the laws thereof , escaping into another , shall , in consequence of any law or regulation therein , be discharged from such service or labor , but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due . " These provisions will be considered principally in their effect upon relations of private persons , in which those rights and obligations are involved which enter into the condition of freedom and its contraries . These provisions are international // in their effect , but though they rest for their authority upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there may be some doubts as to the persons who are the immediate subjects of the law which they contain , - whether the States , in their political personality , are subjects of the relation created by them , or whether , like other provisions of the Constitution , they operate on natural persons within the limits of the United States independently of the powers vested in the States severally , and are a law within each State by resting on the national authority of the United States , irrespectively of the juridical action of the States as separate polities . Mr. Hurd indicates four different views which may be taken of these provisions , involving different conceptions of their practical operation on the relations of private persons . According to the first of these , the clauses under discussion have only the force of a compact between the States , and the States alone are charged with the duty of giving them practical effect . The other three constructions agree in attributing to these clauses the force of law in the strict and proper sense , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bound by them . But it does not follow , from the juxtaposition of these clauses in the Constitution , or from their all having an international effect , that a similar construction should be given to each one of them . So , too , their character as public law , or their connection with the possessors of the sovereigii power in the United States , may be distinguished from their purpose and object as private law , or their effect upon private persons , inasmuch as , under any view of their construction , the intended effect upon the legal condition of private persons must be supposed to be the same . The question whether the States or private persons are the subjects of the rights which each provision creates may be conveniently postponed to that of the application of such provision as private law , and to the determination of the rights and obligations of private persons under it so far as they may be connected with the conditions of freedom and of bondage . Whatever their legal force and operation may be , such provisions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply to international agreements . To // ascertain their effect on the relations of private persons , reference must be had to the anterior jnridical action of the constituent parties in the determination of relations arising under the same or parallel circumstances ; that is , to the international private law of the colonial period and the periods of the Revolution and the Confederation , cornprisii*g the municipal law of the whole empire , and that rule of imperfect authority which prevailed among various j nrisdictions , and rested within each upon its several local authority for its legal effect upon private persons . In his twenty-second chapter , Mr. Hurd discusses the first section of the fourth article , the legislation of Congress in regard to it , and the judicial opinions in cases wherein the statutes of Congress have been relied on as determining the rights and obligations of private persons . The weight of judicial opinion seems to support the doctrine that legal operation or effect on the substantive rights of the parties is not involved in the received doctrine of the conclusiveness of judgments under the statute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the language of the Constitution , such effect might be given to the judgments of another State in the forum of jurisdiction . In the twenty-third chapter , Mr. Hurd considers the meaning of the word " citizen , " or rather of the phrase " citizens of each State , " as used in the first paragraph of the second section of the fourth article , with special reference to the question whether a negro can be a citizen of the United States . The term citizen is susceptible of various shades of meaning . It is often used as equivalent to sublect , or , in our country , to a native or naturalized subject having a domicile . It is in this sense that the word seems to be understood by Story and Kent , in their comments upon the clause in question . If this be the definition of the term , the meaning of the constitutional provision is obvious enough . But if citizenship indicates a condition of superior privilege , - if citizen means something more than subject , - then it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each State " are determined by the juridical will of the State of their domicile , or whether there is some national or common // standard for their recognition . To determine these questions , Mr. Hurd applies those historical rules and principles which are the guiding lights of his whole inquiry . To ascertain the meaning of any doubtful term in the Constitution , we must inquire how the term was previously used by the parties who made the Constitution ; and the answer can be found only in the enunciation of law which had bad international effect among the States and Colonies . Such law , whatever may have been its source or the authority on which it rested , must in a great degree have been identified with the international usage of all civilized nations . The use of terms by the constituent parties , in this branch of jurisprudence , is therefore in a great degree identified with the use of such terms in the general international law of civilized nations . Mr. Hurd then shows historically , that ) from the origin of the Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisprudence a distinction between natural persons , on the ground of their having or not having certain civic privileges ; in other words , a distinction between citizen and subject . The most marked illustration is found in the personal distinction between the negro and Thdian races and the European or white race , as affecting the possession of civil rights under the juridical power of civilized nations ; but it is not the only one . The disabilities of persons of Hebrew race who adhered to their ancient creed , and of persons of the race called in English the Gypsy , have been maintained in the law of every European nation . Their status of civil disability may be said , from its general enfQrcement , to have been a doctrine of the jus gentium for those countries since the Christian era . Now , in any international compact the word citizen would have been held to mean only those persons who , at the time of entering into it , were citizens by universal jurisprudence , and such a rule would control the meaning of the word in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had removed the civic disabilities previously existing . For instance , suppose that a state called Northland had made a treaty with another state called Southland , in which it was provided that the citizens of each should have certain privileges in the territory of the other , and at the date of the // treaty Jews were in both states laboring under such civic disabilities that they were not citizens ; and suppose that , at a subsequent period , Northland by positive legislation had removed the civic disabilities under which Jews had formerly labored , and made them citizens ; it would still be the duty of the courts of Northland to give to the word citizen , as used in the treaty , the meaning which it had borne by mutual recognition at the date of the treaty , and not that which had been given to it by the jus propriurn of Northland . Applying these principles to the case in hand , the conclusion is reached , that , in order to find the meaning of the term " citizens of each State , " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and before the date of its adoption , held practically that all subjects were citizens , or whether they limited the rights of citizenship to a particular class ; and this question is answered by the historical fact or statement , that negroes and Indians were not recognized as citizens by any rule of national authority and extent , that only free persons of the European or white race were so recognized , and that consequently the term must be so interpreted . In some sense a citizen of a State is still a citizen of the United States . He is so in all those points wherein citizens and subjects are identical . He owes allegiance to the United States , and can claim its protection . So far as foreign nations are concerned , every citizen of a State is a citizen of the United States . In this view , a refusal by the State Department to grant passports to negroes would be the denial of an unquestioned right , if the applicant were a citizen of the State in which he lived . In the twenty-fourth chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended by the phrase " all privileges and immunities of citizens , " as used in the second section of the fourth article of the Constitution . The question presents itself , whether the intended standard of these privileges and immunities depends on the law of the domicile of " the citizens of each State , " or on the law of the State forum in which they appear as aliens , or whether some common criterion is here implied , and if so , how it is to be ascertained . Some of the judicial decisions upon this subject are examined , // and from them it may be gathered that they reject the law of the State of the citizen 's domicile as the standard of the privileges and immunities to be accorded to him in every other State . It seems , too , that they would find the standard rather in the rights enjoyed by citizens domiciled in the forum of jurisdiction , than in a national standard of privilege . But , in Mr. ilurd 's opinion , the question can be determined only by construing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which formerly prevailed as between the Colonies and States . The privileges and immunities of any of the inhabitants of the Colonies or other parts of the empire , or of the States before the Constitution , when appearing as domestic aliens in other parts of the empire or in other States , were not measured either by the law of their local domicile or by that of the Colony or State wherein they might be , but by the common law of the personal rights of inhabitants of England , which had a personal extent in all parts of the empire before the Revolution ; consequently , the effect of this clause is to continue the pre-existing common law of the Colonies , so far as it contained a standard of the rights of citizens of one locality appearing as domestic aliens within another jurisdiction ; although , by the Revolution , and the establishment of new forms of government , the privileges and immunities of citizenship in the case of domiciled inhabitants became altogether determinable by local law . If this be correct , it would follow that other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might properly be denied in a State to the citizen of another State , even though they should be actually enjoyed by the residents within the forum of jurisdiction , and should be similar to those held by such citizen of another State in his place of domicile . This conclusion seems reconcilable with most of the judicial decisions , as well as with the language of Kent and Story . The possible application of the provisions of this clause in all cases would open a wide range of inquiry ; but Mr. ilurd confines himself to a consideration of the question whether it guarantees the rights of a slave-owner over his slave , in any case , in a non-slaveholding State . The courts of the non-slaveholding States have uniformly rejected any such claim , on 15* // the ground that the law of the State in which the slave-owner may be found is the standard of the rights incident to citizenship . So far as the common law of England , operating as a personal law with national extent in the Colonies or the States2 was the standard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slave-owner . Nor was t maintained by the private international law prevailing in the Colonies or States before the adoption of the Constitution . Nor is it sustained by the doctrine of judicial comity , because comity is subject to legislative alteration , and the courts must , in applying the so-called rule of comity , declare the will of the State , and not their own . Long before the formation of the Constitution , the slavery of negroes had ceased to rest on universal jurisprudence , and was ascribable solely to the particular law - jus proprium - of some one Colony or State ; and , even in the slaveholding Colonies or States , it is questionable whether the condition had not so essentially changed that the slave was no longer mere property , but a person owing service in a relation to another person . Certainly the slave is not now property by international law . In the twenty-fifth chapter , Mr. Hurd discusses the meaning of the phrase " treason , felony , or other crime , " as used in one of the sections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from justice . There have been many instances in which this question has been considered by the chief executive officers of the State governments and their legal advisers , the Attorneys-General of the States , and it has been sometimes subjects of discussion in the State legislatures . Generally the cases have been those in which the Governors of slaveholding States have made requisitions on the Governors of non-slaveholding States for the delivery of fugitives charged with offences against the slave-code , and the claim has been denied , on the ground that such acts were not recognized as offences by the code of the State where the fugitive was found . But Mr. Ilurd , admitting that this clause should be construed strictly , holds that it should be interpreted by rules applicable to international treaties or compacts , as well as by such as apply to legislative acts . Regarded as an international compact , the standard of the // interpretation of the words employed must be one common to the States as the constituent parties , and this standard must be found in the pre-existing law having internati*nal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the date of the Constitution property in slaves had ceased to be supported by universal jurisprudence , yet it continued in nearly all the States as an effect of local law , and it must be presumed that the parties to an international compact continue to recognize the jural character of one another 's laws . Before an international compact should be interpreted on the ground that the jural character of slavery in the slaveholding States had been denied by the non-slaveholding States , some positive declarations to that effect , anterior to , or contemporary with , the formation of the compact , should be shown ; but , so far from there being any such declarations , the written and tinwritten jurisprudence of the noii-slaveliolding States contains many recognitions of the validity of the slave laws of the slaveholding States ; and even the Constitution itself contains some provisions which , as national private law , support , in certain circumstances , rights and obligations incident to slavery , and others which involve its recognition , as an effect of the local ( internal ) law , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it or allowed it to continue . Upon these grounds , the refusal of the Executives of many of the non-slaveholding States to surrender fugitives charged with offences against laws peculiar to the status of slavery is opposed to the spirit of the Coiistitution ; though , as Mr. Hurd says , " unless the solution of such controversies can be placed in the hands of the judiciary , it seems impossible to arrive at any definite rule in such cases . " In the twenty-fifth chapter , Mr. ilurd also considers the question who may be claimed under the term " held to service or labor , " and says that there has never been any judicial doubt that it includes slaves as well as apprentices . The word " escaping " has almost uniformly been construed to exclude slaves who have been voluntarily brought by their masters into a non-slaveholding State . In that portion of the second volume - being nearly one half - which is comprised between the twenty-sixth and // thirtieth chapters inclusive , Mr. ilurd discusses the constitutional provisions respecting fugitives from justice and fugitives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former incidentally. * . He examines the legislation of Congress upon these points , and the various judicial opinions which have been called forth , directly and indirectly , by the so-called Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and 1850 , as well as by the memorable Dred Scott case . Without undertaking to give an abstract of Mr. Hurd 's discussion and analysis , we shall content ourselves with stating the conclusions at which he arrives . He holds that these clauses of the Constitution have the character of private international law , and as such are binding upon all persons within the limits of the United States , irrespectively of any juridical action on the part of any State . They create a legal relation , in which the Governor of a State demandant , or a private claimant , is the subject of a right , and a private person , the fugitive from justice or from labor , is the subject of the obligation . As a consequence of this construction , it will follow that the demand or claim of such rights and the denial of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third article of the Constitution as within the judicial power of the United States , and such as are within the concurrent judicial power of the States , because the subject-matter is within the original jurisdiction of the States . It further follows , that these provisions of the Constitution may be enforced , independently of any legislation , by the ordinary courts of the United States and of the several States , having concurrent powers , the Supreme Court of the United States having the same power over the courts of the several States as in other cases where constitutional questions are involved . But though the provisions of the Constitution are in themselves in the nature of a law , with a self-executing power , yet there is no reason why Congress should not legislate in aid of these provisions , so as to afford means and instruments for their more easy and speedy execution . Concurrent legislation might also be exercised by the several States . But such legislation , whether national or State , must always be such as to carry into effect the judicial power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate States . Mr. Hurd applies these principles to the actual legislation of Congress , and especially to the Fugitive Slave Law , so called , of 1850 , which he subjects to a long and searching analysis and examination . His conclusion is , that the law is unconstitutional on two grounds first , because the action of the Commissioners in granting a certificate involves an exercise of the judicial power of the United States , and the Commissioners are not such judicial officers as are known to the Constitution ; and secondly , because it violates the seventh article of the Amendments , in not allowing a determination by a jury of the issues arising on a claim for a fugitive from service . We omit an abstract of Mr. Hurd 's reasoning on these points , not merely because so doing would expand our article to an unreasonable length , but also because it would give to it a flavor too strongly professional for the general readers to whom our pages are addressed ; but we earnestly commend this portion of his work to the careful attention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold fast to that which is true , and especially of lawyers and of men who are , or who aspire to be , engaged in public life . Whether Mr. Hurd 's conclusions be assented to or not , it must be agreed by all , that nothing can exceed the thoroughness of his discussion , the fairness with which he states the propositions that lie examines , and the conscientious loyalty to truth which is the guiding light of his mind . The course of his investigation leads him to examine several reported cases , among them Prigg vs . Pennsylvania , 16 Peters , 557 ; Sims 's Case , 7 Cushing , 285 ; and Ableman vs . Booth , 3 Wisconsin , 1 , and 21 Howard , 506 . Mr. Hurd states the provisions of such a law as , in his judgment , would have satisfied the other requirements of the Constitution , while it would also have carried out the purposes of the provision for delivery of fugitives from labor . He would have a preliminary hearing before commissioners or magistrates , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commissioners are empowered to act . They might have been authorized to commit , arrest , detain , or keep the person claimed as a fugitive , who , being then in the custody of the United States , and not in that of the claimant individually , // should afterwards have been brought before some judicial ohcer capable of deciding the case in virtue of the judicial power of the United States , or of the concurrent power of some State , where the State might have consented to its exercise . The necessity of summary proceedings on these claims is generally based on the assumption that , in the non-slaveholding States , juries , whatever the evidence might be , would never or rarely find that the person claimed had escaped from service , being therein actuated by hostility towards the slaveholding States , or by opinions respecting the ethical character of the laws of those States , leading them to regard the provision of the Constitution as void in the forum of conscience . But supposing this to be true , the objection may be met by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other locality than the State in which the supposed fugitive is arrested , and by a law which should provide for a transfer , by public authority , of the supposed fugitive to the jurisdiction from which he is said to have escaped , and a hearing there before a jury , on a demand of either party . From the analysis we have thus given of Mr. Hurd 's book , imperfect as it has necessarily been , our readers will see how conspicuous its merits are , how wide a range of inquiry it covers , what patient research it shows , and what loyalty to truth has inspired it . Although we have indicated , as we went along , some of its marked characteristics , yet we feel that we shall not have done full justice to a most laborious student and conscientious inquirer , without indicating a little more distinctly some of the points wherein this treatise is entitled to claim a superiority over such others upon the same subject as have fallen under our notice . First of all , we think it remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin and foundation of slavery , as a relation once recognized by universal jurisprudence , in opposition to the popular notion that it is the creature of positive law , understood in the sense of a legislative enactment . In this connection , Mr. ilurd 's manly and vigorous criticism upon Lord Mansfield 's judgment in Somerset 's case is worthy of careful consideration . And as slavery was a relation , or status , of customary law , not created by legislation , but recognized by it as anterior // in poini* of time , so it was subject to a law of decay analogous to the law from which it derived its existence , and it gradually ceased to be a relation enforced by universal jurisprudence , but rested . upon the jus proprium , the municipal law , of each state . Lord Mansfield did not establish , but he announced , the principle on which Somerset was entitled to his freedom . And whenever slavery ceased to be recognized by universal jurisprudence , or the law of nations , the question whether it should be maintained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was consistent or inconsistent with the personal rights attributed to all subjects within the limits of that jurisdiction . The Roman law was at one period exactly identical with universal jurisprudence , and it still forms a large part of the customary law of all civilized nations . Savigny has written a treatise which he calls " The Roman Law of To-day , " - Systern des Ileutigen R*mischen Rechts . But the Roman law , or the Gorpus furis Givilis of Justinian , is of authority with us , or with any people , not because it is just , reasonable , or conformable to natural equity , but because the nations of the civilized world have accepted it as a juridical standard of right , in the absence of rules originating in their own legislative or judicial action . The Roman law is not generally received because it is right , but because it has been generally received it is to be presumed to be right . This doctrine is derived as a consequence from the broader proposition , that , in finding a rule of law , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicial action of the sovereign of the forum is ascertainable , a court is bound to recur to the action of other actual possessors of the juridical power of society , that is , to the jurisprudence of other states and nations , in preference to its own ideas of justice . When a judge 's own standard of morality becomes the measure of juridical right , we have a rule as variable and uncertain as would be the Chancellor 's foot for the measure so called , to borrow Selden 's witty but unfair saying about eqnity. * * The case of Deerfield s 's . Arms , 17 Pick . 41 , may be cited as an illustration of the vitality and enduring authority of the Roman law . An island had been formed by alluvial deposits in the bed of the Deerfield River , and the question was , how it // Mr. ilurd also puts the doctrine of comity upon ekar and intelligible ground . The word comity , like equity , has both a popular and a technical sense . Most laymen , and not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rules of natural justice are applied to modify the rigor of the common law . But this is not a correct statement of the distinction . Equity differs from the common law in its forms and instruments , but not in its principles . The chancellor is as much bound by precedent as the common-law judge . So comity is popularly understood to have some sort of vague analogy to the rules of good-breeding and the usages of polite society , and it is supposed that we recognize the laws of another nation as we abstain from laughing at any little peculiarities of manner in a stranger whom we are entertaining at our table . But comity rests upon no such airy foundation , but upon a principle or law , which is , that every sovereignty is bound to recognize as jural a relation created by the will of another sovereignty , unless it be inconsistent with some right attributed to all natural persons within its territory . Comity depends upon the will of the state , and not of the tribunal which announces it ; and where that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts must conform to it , whether it agrees or not with their own ethical judgment . In the method of the work Mr. Hurd begins with the statement of fundamental principles , or the derivation of legal rules by the method a posteriori , the historical method , as opposed to the adoption of principles a priori , with a view of arriving at certain results or foregone conclusions which are assumed to be ethically right . In his introductory chapters , he carefully discriminates between jurisprudence and political ethics . The former is the s6ience of what the rule given or should be divided and apportioned among the riparian proprietors . The books of the common law supplied no rule for the case , as , owing to the physical geography of England , such questions had not arisen in regard to its rivers . But a rule was found in the civil law , and applied by the late Chief Justice Shaw , in a luminous and satisfactory judgment . The argument for the demandants was made , and the authorities from the civil law were snpplied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early quenched , whose private worth and professional promise are still freshly and affectionately remembered by those of his contemporaries who had the opportunity of observing and knowing them . // allowed by the state is ; the latter is the science of what ought to be the rule . The rules of universal jurisprudence , in point of fact , conform to the ethical judgment of man ; but their authority is derived , not from such conformity , but from the fact of their universality . To start with the natural conscience , and to say that a law is a principle of universal jurisprudence because it conforms to that conscience , - . in other words , to seek the foundation of universal jurisprudence in one 's own moral instincts ,  --  is to reverse the natural order , and to substitute the deductive for the inductive method . So the arrangement of our author 's materials is synthetic . He starts from fundamental principles , and follows the course of legal effects to a certain class of practical questions , instead of taking up certain concrete propositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are or are not founded on fundamental , admitted principles . Mr. ilurd treats slavery very much as De Tocqueville treats democracy . In the suits of Democracy vs . Monarchy , and Democracy vs . Aristocracy , De Tocqueville does not hold a brief for either plaintiff or defendant ; but , to follow out the illustration , he is like a master in chancery , who reports upon a question submitted to him by the court . He finds a great country governed by democratic institutions , and carefully examines these institutions , their origin , their tendency , their advantages , and their dano'ers ; but his own judgment as to the expediency or desirableness of democracy he keeps in abeyance . So Mr. ilurd finds the institution of slavery existing in a considerable portion of our country , and thoroughly examines it in its jural , and incidentally in its political , aspects and relations ; but the ethical judgment to be passed upon it forms no part of his plan , and is resolutely kept out of view . To all that fervid anti-slavery zeal might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the words of the great Cujacius : " Nihil hoc ad edictum Pr*toris . " In his views of the nature of the Constitution , and of the distribution of the sum of sovereign powers between the iiational government and the States , Mr. Hurd belongs to the Federal school of interpretation and exposition , though the originality and independence of his mind forbid him to sub // 18*2 IIURD 'S LAW OF FREEDOM AND BONDAGE. scribe unreservedly to the creed of any particular school or party . According to him , the Constitution derives its authority from the act of an integral people of the United States ; and he denies the construction which makes it a compact between several pre-existing sovereignties . The aggregate people of the thirteen States , and not the thirteen States , made the Constitution , though , in making it , the people used the State organizations as convenient instruments , or machinery , in constructing their new political edifice . Hence the Constitution , so far as it is a rule of action , acts on natural persons only , and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no international relations towards one another . The international law contained in the Constitution is private law , and quasi-international ; and all other international law operating as between the States is private law , resting on State authority . It is not contemplated in the Constitution that the States should take any cognizance of one another . The possession of sovereign power is always a question of fact , and to be determined historically . The Constitution is the evidence , and not the cause , of the distribution of the powers of an independent nationality between the people of the United States and the people of the several States . The present distribution of sovereign powers between an integral people of the United States and the people of the several States , is the continuation of the distribution which existed from the first settlement of the country . There was always a local sovereignty coexistent with , and , in the theory of the colonies , co-ordinate with , the imperial or national sovereignty . At the evolution , the powers held by the imperial government passed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by revolutionary devolution , not to the States severally , but to the integral people of the United States . The people of the United States and the people of the several States are co-ordinates in the possession of the powers held by them respectively . There is no grant on either side . The national government has nothing to do with the States as such , and , except by the guaranty of a republican government , has nothing to do with the people of a State in their corporate capacity . If the people of the United States , the integral // people , were to assume the reserved powers of the States , or of any one State , the act would be revolutionary , like any other change in the location of sovereign power . The admission of a new State into the Union is an occurrence of the same nature : it is an autonomic development of sovereignty , and not an act taking place under law in the ordinary sense . Upon the transfer of its powers from the imperial government to the integral people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have occurred in respect to certain rights of private persons which had been , to some undefined extent , under the imperial authority , since it appears that the States acquired exclusive power over the personal rights of all within their limits , except as restricted by those provisions of the Constitution in the first and second sections of the fourth article which affect persons within the States only as they may be domiciled inhabitants , or citizens , of another State , while the personal rights of the domiciled inhabitants are entirely dependent on the State power . In this connection , Mr. ilurd suggests a pertinent inquiry , - to which recent events in the history of the country , not anticipated when the inquiry was made , have given a peculiar and unexpected interest , - whether this difference between the present and the ante-Revolutionary distribution of power has not been , politically speaking , an injury to civil liberty , and whether it might not be better to have a certain portion of the powers held by each State over personal rights pass into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crown , or the imperial sovereignty , protected or might protect the subject against gross invasions of liberty or personal right by the colonial legislature or the colonial magistrate . It was a distant tribunal ; its power was not to be set in motion upon light pretexts or for trivial causes ; but it existed , and was held in reserve to be put in force when the occasion was grave and the stake weighty . The colonial subject , oppressed or threatened by local or provincial tyranny , might resort to the throne for protectioii or redress . But now the personal rights of the domiciled inhabitants of each State // are under the exclusive control of that State . The President does not replace the King , nor Congress Parliament . If events should ever verify Mr. Hurd 's sagacity , and prove his suggestion to have a practical , and not merely a speculative importance , we must take refuge in the commonplace reflection , that political institutions , like all the works of man 's hand , are imperfect , and that no political problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power with perfect security against the abuse of that power . Do what you will , - arrange your checks and balances as you may , - the subject will sometimes be oppressed by the sovereign , whether the sovereignty reside in one or in many ; but experience and observation show that power which is distributed among many is less likely to be abused than that which is held by one , and that majorities , though often capricious and unjust , are rarely vindictive and cruel . In this connection , we may remark that there seems to be a general impression that the rights of private persons are secure in proportion to the smallness of the political integer on which they depend . The attachment shown to State lights , so called , seems to be connected with this political instinct ; as if liberty and property were of necessity safer when entirely dependent upon the will of the State , than they would be if they depended upon the will of the nation . Men love their town or city first , then their State , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it may be doubted whether they are sound , and whether the smaller the body , and the greater the facility with which the law may be changed , the more danger there is of individual oppression . Passions are made intense by compression ; and no tyranny is more galling than that which is limited in its sphere , local in its origin , and trivial in its cause . We have had occasion to point out some of the practical applications of Mr. ilurd 's speculations , in stating his views upon the constitutionality of the Fugitive Slave Law , and his comments upon the decision of the Supreme Court in the IDred Scott case ; but there is yet another , and the most important of all . We refer to the question of slavery in the rrerritories , or , rather , the power of Congress over slavery in // the Territories , - the only question which the wisdom and patriotism of the country have not been able to solve , and which is the pretext , if not the cause , - the causct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - of the deplorable civil war which is now desolating the land . Mr. ilurd 's views on this question may be thus briefly stated . As slavery is not now supported by universal jurisprudence , but in every slaveholding country rests on the particular law - jus proprium - of such country , a slave is not property by any common law having national extent in the United States , and thus slave property is not protected by the Constitution , operating as a bill of rights against the legislative power of Congress or the Territorial government . Congress , conseqnently , has full power over the subject in the Territories . It may legislate to exclude slavery from all or any portion of the common domain of the nation . So may the Territorial legislature exclude it from its own Territory . Whether the power shall be exercised or not , is a question of expediency merely : there is no constitutional restriction. * But suppose there is no legislation on the subject whatever , either by Congress or by the Territorial legislature , and a slaveholder should come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would be the relation between them ? Would the status of slavery continue or not ? This question would , in the absence of legislation national or local , be determinable by the judicial tribunals of the Territory , and would be determined by the application of that rule of comity which imposes a judicial obligation to recognize as jural , or rightful , a relation which exists by law , even by the law of another forum , when not incompatible with some universal attribution of rights and obligations by the law of the forum of jurisdiction . But slavery , or involuntary servitude , exists as a legal condition in fifteen of the States of the Union ; it is recognized as such in the Constitution by the provision for the return of fugitive slaves ; and this is sufficient to exclude the idea of any such universal attribution by the national law of the right of personal liberty in the Territories . Consequently , * Vol . I. pp. 558-*69. // the relation between master and slave , in the absence of legislation , should be judicially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the individual judge pronouncing upon the question might have the strongest olz*jections to slavery on ethical grounds . The question is one of law , and not of ethics. * These views of Mr. Hurd are opposed , on the one hand , to those niaintained in the opinion of Chief Justice Taney in the Dred Scott case , and , on the other hand , to the doctrine which gives to the proposition in the Declaration of Independence , that " all men are created equal , " the force of positive law . Our notice has insensibly stretched to an unreasonable length , and we must hasten to bring it to a close . Our readers will have observed that our purpose has been to tell them what manner of book Mr. Hurd has written , and not to entertain them with essays of our own upon any of the many topics suggested by it . We have read it with unqualified admiration and respect , and with general but not unqualified assent ; but we have not delayed , as we went along , to discuss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our judgmeat , there is very little profit in arguing the issues which grow out of the question of American slavery , or rather African slavery in America , especially since the politics of the country have come to turn on these issues . Slavery is a subject on which the conclusions of the mind are determined by the passions , the emotions , or the conscience . Herein we are all more or less partisans ; we can not treat it dispassionately if we would , we would not if we could . Starting from the point that slavery is a wrong , a barbarism , an injustice , we have already , perhaps unconsciously , predetermined the legal and political aspects of the condition , although they are really independent alike of the ethical and the emotional judgment . Some of our opinions are forged upon the anvil of the understanding , others are cast in the furnace of the passions ; opinions touching slavery are of the latter kind . Discussions upon it only serve to confirm the parties in the opinions they began with . An old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF FREEDOM AND BONDAGE. of Commons observed , that he had never known a debate upon a party question to change a vote . Upon a collateral and incidental subject a powerful speech may , and often does , produce a great effect . Macaulay 's speech on Sergeant Talfourd 's Copyright Bill is said to have changed the vote of the House ; but not a vote was lost or won by all the learned research , the compact logic , the impassioned eloquence , that were lavished upon the Iteforin Bill or Catholic Emancipation . Of the many books and pamphlets which the fruitful subject of slavery has called forth , nearly all are the growth of a passionate conviction which seeks to justify itself , and thus have little other than rhetorical value . This work of Mr. hard 's , and the well-known series of books of travel in the Slave States by Mr. Olmsted , are almost the only exceptions we can now recall . The former embodies the opinions of a dispassionate thinker ; the latter , the observations of a dispassionate witness ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court in which slavery issues are tried , judges and witnesses are few , but advocates many . We have been the more anxious to give a full analysis and abstract of this remarkable work , from a conviction , not only that it will not be popular , in the common sense of the word , - the subject may alone account for this , - but that it will not be popular among that class to which it is especially addressed ; in other words , that mere lawyers and mere politicians will shrink from the patient and continuous application of mind which Mr. Hard 's labors require for their full coniprehension , and that his readers will be found only among statesmen and jurists , comprehending among these all , whatever their station or position may be , who desire to study legal and political questions from the point of view of the statesman and the jurist . And the limited audience which Mr. Hurd must expect to have is due not merely to his grave and unimpassioned treatment of his subject , but also to certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not substantial , will repel all but resolute inquirers after truth , with minds accustomed to athletic exercise . having praised the work so heartily for its essential merits , we can with the better conscience turn to those points // wherein it falls short of the high standard to which in others it attains . Mr. Hurd 's training , it is easy to see , has been exclusively speculative . Not only has he not had the experience of a statesman and law-maker , but we presume he has had but a moderate share of practice in his profession . The custom of solitary study has enforced a habit of mind naturally subtile , and of an almost morbid power in discriminating differences . He reminds us of those inquirers who are accustomed , as Bacon says , " upon every particular position or assertion to frame objections , and to these objections , solutions ; which solutions were , for the most part , not confutations , but distinctions ; whereas indeed the strength of all sciences is , as the strength of the old man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which happily points out an obvious peculiarity of Mr. ilurd 's work . It abounds with what Bacon calls " vermiculate questions , " which task the patience by their number and minuteness . He weighs grocer 's wares in apothecary 's scales . He has a mental vision analogous to the natural organ of the mosaic workers of Rome , who are said to distinguish fifteen thousand colors and shades of color . He is minute in his distinctions and microscopic in his glance , where the general mind wants short cuts and practical results . Read , for instance , his long , careful , and exhaustive discussion of the clause in the Constitution for the rendition of fugitive slaves , of the legislation of Congress in aid of its provisions , and the various decisions of the Supreme Court in exposition of it ; it is impossible not to admire the thorough analysis , the nice discrimination , the patient comparison , the perfect loyalty to truth , which distinguish it ; and yet , when we lay down the book , we say to ourselves , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and principles like these . The machinery is too fine for use . These are instruments too airy and delicate for the world 's rough work . Life is too short , men are too busy , to pause for and insist upon a standard of ideal perfection . He shows how the clause in the Constitution might have been made effective without any legislation at all , as well as how Congress might have legislated in aid of it without infringing - as he maintains they have // - on the Constitution ; but who is there that can , like him , walk over burning ploughshares , and not feel their heat ? Who can examine the Fugitive Slave Law , and the clause hi the Constitution out of which it grew , with his serene and unimpassioned glance ? These questions are determined before they are discussed , and by considerations drawn from other regions of the world within us than those in which reason holds her impartial and imperial sway . The trying element in the Fugitive Slave Law is in its essence , and not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in the manner of doing it . The slaveholder is entitled upon demand to have his fugitive slave returned to him ; and provided this be done , what matters it whether it be done by the agency of a commissioner , a judge , or a jury ? The law is unconstitutional because it is hateful , not hateful because it is unconstitutional . All the primary instincts of the human soul are on the side of the fugitive , and from the judicial reason alone we draw the arguments and considerations which bid us disobey the voice of these instincts . There is a truth involved in the now familiar phrase , " the higher law , " though , as commonly put , it includes a logical inconsistency and a dangerous principle . There is a conflict , as old as humanity itself , between impulse and duty , between what we would do and what we ought to do ; and never in civil society was this conflict organized on so great a scale , and with such forces on each side , as by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large proportion of the free States in regard to it has become such , that the theoretical right of the master can be preserved only by carefully abstaining from the practical enforcement of it . Tried by this feeling , Mr. Hurd 's ingenious , acute , and original expositions will seem a waste of intellectual power , lavished as it is upon questions on which fervid philanthropy and partisan zeal will brook no discussion and hear no argument . They remind us of that ingenioxis and elaborate convolution of cordage by which Ulysses attempted to secure a chest of treasure , which a touch of flame or steel would in a moment make useless . This characteristic of Mr. ilurd 's work , the result and expression of an innate quality of mind , is rather a peculiarity // than a defect . It imparts a certain flavor by which readers of a kindred taste may be rather attracted than repelled . But there are other elements which will lessen the number of its readers , and thus contract the sphere of its influence . We may express these in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of skilful literary workmanship . It may be likened to a building in which the contractor has done better than the architect ; so that the completed structure , in its disposition and arrangements , does no justice to the copiousness and value of the materials . Mr. Hurd is evidently not accustomed to writing for the public ; we can easily see that he is thinking only of doing full justice to his theme , according to his own standard of justice , without asking himself how his labors will be received by others . This adds to the value of his work as an authority , but it makes it less attractive to the common mind . There is an awkwardness of manner about it like that of a shy scholar in a gay circle . There are occasional repetitions which might be pruned off , and a general process of compression might be judiciously applied . Sir James Mackintosh , speaking of the ponderous work of Puffendorif , says : " In the time of Mr. Locke , it was considered the manual of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe it will be found that men of business are too occupied , men of letters are too fastidious , and men of the world too indolent , for the study , or even the perusal , of such works . " This was said sixty-four years ago , and in England ; and , to say the least , it is quite as true in our own day and country as it was then and there . When you take away men of business , men of letters , and men of the world , there is not a large remnant left . It is not to be supposed that the light swarm which flutters round the flowers of a circulating library will be allured to a work like this ; but we must say that it might have been made more attractive without losing any of its substantial worth . We have found it a very hard book ; using hard in the sense in which schoolboys use it , and as Greek students apply it to Thucydides and Lycophron . It requires in every part the fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces of the intellectual voluptuary and the faculties that are exhausted // by professional toil are alike incapable of grappling with it . It abounds with passages which at first blush seem a tangled and impenetrable thicket of words , and it is only by patient continuance that we work our way through . We have before spoken of Mr. Hurd 's deficiency in the power of illustration , and we advert to it again to express our wish that this faculty had been bestowed upon him . It might be too much to ask that his page should sparkle with the epigrammatic point of Montesquieu , or that he should have a combination , like that of Grotius , of profound juridical genius and the most excjuisite scholarship ; but if lie could have borrowed the easy , gentlemanly pen of Blackstone , or written with the matchless grace and eloquence of Lord Stowell , his work would have taken its place among that rare class in which the results of deep thought and patient investigation are presented in a form which meets the requisitions of the most fastidious literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an epithet or two . Buffon 's celebrated aphorism , that the style is the man , is so far true , that style is an expression of the character as well as of the mind . Style has moral as well as intellectual qualities . So far as the former are concerned , Mr. Hurd 's style is excellent , and leaves upon the reader aim impression of respect for the man as well as for the writer . It has no offensive airs of superiority ; it has no dogmatism or flippancy ; it preserves throughout the tone of grave earnestness which befits the subject . Mr. Hurd in his discussions uses neither sarcasm nor denunciation ; he neither says nor insinuates that the conclusion against which he is arguing is the offspring of a bad heart or a corrupt conscience ; he deals with judges and writers with whom he is compelled to differ as impersonally as if they were algebraic formulas . He contends for the truth as he holds it , and not for victory . His zeal is without bitterness ; his ink is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of thought , Mr. Hurd 's can not be called a bad style . It is correct , grammatical , and free from offensive mannerisms . But , on the other hand , it can not be called a distinctively good style . It lacks ease , grace , and compactness . In the art of constructing sentences // 192 iiUR1i* ' S LAW OF FREEDOM AND BONDAGE. we miss the skill of the finished literary artist . His periods are apt to be too long and involved , - too heavily freighted with qualifications and limitations . His meaning sometimes eludes the grasp , from the very care he takes to state it with exact precision . The picture would have been better painted , if the painter had taken less pains . The language is so painfully elaborate , so conscientiously exact , that the mind becomes lost in a labyrinth of words , and the clew drops from its hold . There seems sometimes a sort of blur upon the page the eye slides from one end of a paragraph to another , but the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We wish that a work in so many respects admirable could have added to its other merits the charm of an attractive style ; and we wish this , because we heartily desire that Mr. Hurd 's labors should receive the meed of commendation which they so richly deserve . Style is more than the garb of thought , it is its body ; and no book , however wise , weighty , and learned , can afford to be without a good style . Jeremy Bentham says of Blackstone 's Commentaries , that it owes its reputation , in great measure , to what he not very happily calls " the enchanting harmony of its numbers , " and adds , " So much is man governed by the ear . " We are , indeed , all captives to the ear ; the grave and the reflective , as well as the gay and the frivolous . Nonsense itself , if it be only resonant and smooth , obtains a certain currency , and passes for something fine . Dust over-gilded circulates more readily than gold over-dusted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a work into which he has put so much thought and labor should create but little sensation , and leave hardly a ripple upon the surface of the great stream into which it is thrown . He has written a book which is not for to-day or to-morrow , but - we say it as no mere rhetorical flourish - for all time ; that is , it fairly exhausts the subject of which it treats , as that subject stands to-day , and leaves nothing more to be said about it . It thus can never become obsolete . As we can not conceive of a man 's writing a treatise upon political economy without studying Smith 's " Wealth of Nations , " or upon peace and war without mas // tering Grotius , so any man who shall hereafter write upon American slavery without having comprehended this book of Mr. Hurd 's will prove by this omission alone that he has not qualified himself for his task . Time , who is perpetually sweeping into his wallet the ephemeral pamphlets that buzz , sting , or glitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this work . He has not lived in vain who has done thus much . We can not bring this long article to a close without a renewed expression of our respect alike for what Mr. Hurd has accomplished and for the spirit in which he has labored . If mankind were arranged according to the motives which animate them , the result would be a kind of pyramidal structure , narrowing as we ascend . Most men are wooers of fortune : with them the acquisition of property is the be-all and end-all of life . These form the lowest course of the pyramid , the widest in extent , and the least removed from earth . higher up is a smaller class , who are enamoured of fame and glory , whose inspiration is the breath of popular applause , to whom oblivion is annihilation , who are ready to pour out their life-blood if it will only keep green the laurel that blooms over their grave . These are swayed by a nobler passion than the love of gain , but yet not the noblest . Highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are the few who are moved by the love of truth . They dwell not merely above the smoke and dust of earth , but above that middle region of the air where tempests rage , and meteors glance and play , and clouds break and re-unite their airy files , marshalled by the restless wind . Theirs is an ampler ether , a diviner air , a purer sunshine . Poverty and neglect may be their portion ; recognition , if it come at all , may come too late to be of any value ; the crown that was woven for the brow may be laid upon the coffin ; but they shall not fail of their reward . Fame and Fortune are beautiful , but capricious mistresses ; their smiles are dazzling , but their frowns are terrible , and these smiles and frowns are not distributed according to desert ; but the countenance of Truth is never averted from those who woo her in sincerity of heart , and they who have once looked upon her serene and spiritual beauty will not sigh for lighter // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her service miss the glittering hopes , the dizzy tumults , the wild raptures , which stir the blood of those who aspire to the prizes of wealth and fame ; but they miss , too , the cruel disappointments , the crushing reverses , the sad satieties , which are the sable lining of the silver cloud . Truth never betrays the hearts that trust her ; she does not promise them place , renown , wealth , or title , but she promises them herself , and she never fails to keep her word . Theirs is the sunshine of contentment and the air of peace . They escape the feverish struggles , the gnawing anxieties , the wasting cares , that furrow the brow , hollow the cheek , and corrode the heart . If their youth be attended by no splendid visions , if their manhood be passed in no stormy struggles , their age is like the long , silvery twilight of a northern summer , which preserves to the last some portion of the morning light . And among those few who , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heart , have turned aside from the " broad way and the green , " and sought the " bright countenance of Truth in the quiet and still air of delightful studies , " the author of the work we have noticed is entitled to be classed .
